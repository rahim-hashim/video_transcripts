# Biden PANICS Over Israel's Genocide
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIxkI6HREHA)
*  Joe Biden's administration is panicking over the consequences of Israel's genocidal onslaught
*  against Gaza. Now, I don't mean the human consequences. The Biden administration has
*  long made it clear that it has nothing but contempt for the value of Palestinian life.
*  I mean the political consequences for Joe Biden, who faces a presidential election in
*  just a few months, in which he will have to beg Democrats, disillusioned with that minor
*  triviality of him facilitating a genocide, devote for him. And they're also panicking about the
*  consequences for US power, given this catastrophe has further damaged a flailing superpower,
*  which has already spent the 21st century in terminal decline, thanks in large part to
*  disastrous foreign military adventures. Now, that's why the US has paused a shipment of
*  bombs to Israel. A bit of context here. Israel is the largest cumulative recipient of US foreign aid,
*  and that's in the time period since its foundation back in 1948. So the largest cumulative
*  recipient of any country on earth, receiving, when adjusted with inflation in mind, with around
*  $300 billion in total economic and military assistance. Those figures, thanks to the
*  estimates, not the estimates, the figures provided by the Council on Foreign Relations.
*  Now, Israel would never have got away with subjecting the Palestinians to ethnic cleansing,
*  illegal occupation, siege, apartheid, colonisation, repeated mass slaughters,
*  even before the current horror without US support. Now, since 7th October, the US has
*  reportedly made more than 100 military aid transfers to Israel, largely bypassing Congress
*  in the process. Earlier this year, though, the administration sent Israel $14 billion worth of
*  aid with no conditions attached whatsoever when it came to, you know, minor things like human rights,
*  not slaughtering people, little children. Indeed, let's read what Rishida Tlaib,
*  the Democratic representative in the House of Congress, the only Palestinian American
*  in the US Congress, tweeted this week. She said, it's no coincidence that immediately after our
*  government sent the Israeli apartheid regime over $14 billion with absolutely no conditions in
*  upholding human rights, Netanyahu began a ground invasion to continue the genocide of Palestinians
*  with ammunition and bombs paid for by our tax dollars. Now, notably, she was one of only 37
*  House Democrats who voted against the foreign aid package that included military assistance for
*  Israel, assistance which, of course, has proved crucial in this genocide. It's quite an astonishing
*  thing to have to tweet out condemning your colleagues and your president for facilitating
*  a genocide by sending the weapons in order to make it so. Now, let's just read from this latest news
*  report. It says, the Biden administration paused the shipment of bombs to Israel last week over
*  concerns that the country was approaching a decision on launching a full scale assault on
*  the southern Gaza city of Ra'afah against the wishes of the United States, Defense Secretary
*  Lloyd Austin said Wednesday the shipment was supposed to consist of 1,800 and 2,000 pound
*  bombs and 1,700 500 pound bombs, according to the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity
*  discussed the sensitive matter. The focus of US concerns the larger explosives and how they could
*  be used in a dense urban setting like Ra'afah where more than a million civilians are sheltering
*  after evacuating other parts of Gaza amid Israel's war on Hamas, which came after the militant group's
*  deadly attack on Israel on October 7th. I have to say it's absolutely infuriating reading this.
*  So now they're hand-wringing about the possibility of these explosives being used in dense urban
*  settings like Ra'afah. Where have they been? Where have they been when an area the size of East London
*  one of the most densely populated places on earth has been subjected to the firepower equivalent of
*  several nuclear bombs largely of US weapons provided. I mean this is a dense urban setting
*  to use the description there, a dense urban setting which has been carpet bombed by US weapons
*  and now they're worried. Indeed given we're talking about southern Gaza we know Israel has
*  repeatedly dropped £2,000 bombs on so-called safe zones in the south slaughtering huge numbers of
*  civilians as they did so. None of that caused the US to reconsider its military aid or to stop it
*  sending over those £2,000 bombs. Now the press report goes on to say Austin confirmed the weapons
*  delay telling the senate appropriation subcommittee on defense that the US paused one shipment of high
*  payload munitions. So this is really tokenistic stuff let's be clear we should know that there
*  was supposed to be a US State Department report issued this week on whether Israel has violated
*  US and international humanitarian law during the war in Gaza. It was supposed to be released today
*  Wednesday but has suddenly been delayed and definitely the State Department was working
*  on it apparently and if it concluded Israel has violated international humanitarian law
*  the US would be expected to stop sending Israel military assistance. I mean how the hell is this
*  supposed to conclude otherwise given some of the worst war crimes, some of the worst atrocities of
*  the 21st century have been committed over and over again in full public view is beyond me.
*  It has now been indefinitely delayed as I say which has to make you conclude that of course
*  it's established that war crimes have been committed egregious war crimes because if not the
*  report would be a total joke what on earth would it say. Now the State Department spokesman Matt
*  Miller today says that the poor shipment of weapons could just be the beginning he says we are reviewing
*  others well too little too late really to say the least but even this limited move has provoked a
*  reaction from Israel's politicians let's listen to this particular lovely ray of sunshine belonging
*  to the ruling Likud party.
*  Now to be clear she's saying that the US is threatening not to give us precise weapons oh
*  yeah well I got news for the US we have imprecise weapons I'll use it I'll just collapse 10 10
*  buildings that's what I'll do so just to really saying we'll commit even more brazen war crimes
*  unless you keep arming us I mean it's just over just sometimes you have to process just how overt
*  how honest these people are when it comes to just yelling about their war crimes not even trying to
*  cover it up not trying to pretend the truth is Israel cannot commit cannot keep committing war
*  crimes without US support it's just empty bluster they depend on arms from the United States
*  what this does show is the US does have leverage it just chooses not to use it largely speaking
*  it's been forced to use this leverage however limited it may be under pressure it shows leverage
*  can be used now a bit more context a new poll commissioned by Zetio the new media company
*  founded by my brilliant friend Medhi Hassan very proud of myself to be working for them
*  has some striking polling results so in this new poll they found 39 percent of likely voters think
*  Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians of Gaza 38 percent say no but among
*  Democrats is 56 percent compared to 22 percent saying no 55 56 percent Democrats think genocide
*  has been committed in terms of voters 22 percent say no 55 percent of Americans under 45 thinks
*  it's genocide while pluralities of black and latina voters that means more than not think it's genocide
*  worth just absorbing that for a minute what will happen now is Biden supporters are going to brow
*  beat America's the vote for him they'll go you are moral disgrace how dare you don't you watch it
*  state you've got to vote for us it's Trump what up against how dare you a disgrace we have contempt
*  you vote for us that's their general approach doesn't see how well that works but let's just
*  consider just how broken US democracy is firstly I mean given how many democratic voters think
*  genocide has been committed and yet the vast majority of their representatives democratic
*  representatives in the house of congress don't think genocide's been committed and actively
*  support giving them arms but I mean it's one thing to say to US voters vote for the lesser evil what's
*  happening in the November presidential election is unprecedented most of Biden's own voters are
*  expected to have to vote for someone they believe has facilitated a genocide for the rest of their
*  lives they will have to process the fact that in the name of stopping a greater evil they voted for
*  someone they believe is complicit in genocide that's a moral stain which you expected to just
*  take and you'll never be able to scrub it off that's how it works now a political system which
*  forces voters to make that kind of decision is completely broken you just cannot expect a
*  democracy to withstand that kind of pressure indefinitely even though US democracy is one
*  which is heavily caveated but the truth is the Biden administration is panicking because it knows
*  the gravity of Israel's crimes are just too obvious to avert it's driving Americans against
*  Biden and it's having a catastrophic impact on US power they're panicking so it's up to the movement
*  against this one of the great crimes of our age to build yet more pressure because we're winning this
*  but it's a race against time because with every passing day more Palestinians are slaughtered
*  more devastation is inflicted more starvation imposed but the fact is these people have lost
*  they've lost Israel's lost its allies are going to suffer terrible consequences for generations
*  because of what's happened but we've got to be confident because the fact that they're acting
*  in however limited a way is because we're winning so let's keep pushing please like and subscribe
