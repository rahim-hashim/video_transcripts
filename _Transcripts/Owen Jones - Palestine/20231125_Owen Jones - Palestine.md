# Gary Lineker SMEARED Over My Gaza Interview
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [November 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANY4TEB844w)
*  So I got the nation's best-loved Chris Munching sports aficionado Gary Lineker in trouble
*  Not intentionally I should add with our lovely mild-mannered friends in the British media
*  I think this whole episode really is revealing of a lot of things now this week
*  I published an article with Raz Segal who is an Israeli American associate professor of Holocaust and genocide studies
*  That's quite an important detail. I think in this whole story
*  Nobody could reasonably conclude that Raz Segal doesn't know what he is talking about
*  Now I did a 40 minute interview with him very thorough and he argues in that interview that the Israeli onslaught
*  Against Gaza is a textbook case of genocide. His argument is scholarly
*  It's grounded in huge amounts of research legal knowledge
*  Historical knowledge and of course knowledge of what's currently happening at the moment now whether or not you agree or disagree with him
*  I'll come on to that everybody should surely I think agree
*  We are kind of consensus that his argument deserves
*  Respectful engagement and the least you can do if you've got a dissenting view is to engage with the substance now
*  I posted a 13 minute clip of this interview on Twitter, which has gone hugely viral
*  Millions of people have seen it on that medium alone now Gary Lineker
*  Helped in that process because he quite rightly quote treated it with worth 13 minutes of anyone's time
*  And then all hell broke loose
*  let's hear a clip from the
*  Supposedly offensive interview which is actually as I said a very
*  Scholarly grounded interview with Raz Segal and if you haven't watched the whole interview, please do watch it for yourself
*  Now the case of Israel's attack on Gaza is actually very
*  Unique
*  It's actually exceptional I think in a number of ways but it's but it's unique in the sense of discussing it
*  As what I think it is that is genocide because the intent is so clearly
*  Articulated right and it's articulated. It's articulated throughout
*  Israeli media and society and politics now and anyone who follows Hebrew language sources is
*  Exposed to shocking shocking language by members of Parliament by journalists. What happened next then?
*  Well, basically every media outlet piled in on Gary Lineker
*  At the time said BBC staffs anger after Gary Lineker shares Israel Gaza genocide video
*  The mail BBC staff fury at Gary Lineker after match of the day shared video which accused Israel of committing textbook
*  genocide in Gaza in fresh impartiality rather for broadcaster
*  Richard little John who is
*  one of the most unpleasant people probably the British media and
*  For my perspective, which I think you're saying quite something and he goes on here to say and that
*  Gary Lineker told his almost 9 million followers that an interview by the Guardians resident toy town trot
*  Owen Jones that can be my epitaph
*  With Holocaust historian Rousey Gale was worth 30 minutes of anyone's time
*  The mere fact it was being hosted by pro-palestinian anti-israel fanatic Jones tells you in advance where this was heading
*  We can't all be as moderate. Can we as Richard little John and
*  Anyway, it goes he goes on along that kind of vein the I joined in BBC boss faces test of leadership after Lineker shares
*  Israel genocide clip now, this is I think
*  Uncomfortable but we need to say it a BBC newsroom source says it is inflammatory video for someone of Gary's prominence to share at
*  Time when Jewish people are feeling threatened the Times had a similar vein the post called dismay amongst BBC staff one race concerns
*  It would be bloody awful for any Jewish colleagues that have to work with Lineker
*  It's pretty shit for any Jew having to work with quite a few folk here right now
*  Look anti-semitism is a grave evil a grave grave evil
*  2000 years of anti-semitism which have
*  Meant history is littered with terrible atrocities which culminated in of course the Holocaust in which two-thirds of European Jews were exterminated
*  now there is an increase in genuine anti-semitism at the moment and
*  There are people who conflate what should be a justified opposition to the horror being unleashed against Gaza
*  With hatred against Jewish people that's a genuine issue
*  It has to be confronted that there's no there's no two ways about that and I would never seek in any way to below that
*  Point that is not the same as Gary Lineker
*  saying that an Israeli Jewish historian who specializes in the Holocaust and genocide studies
*  Discussing the horror in Gaza has anything to do with hatred against Jewish people. It is
*  Ludicrous and offensive to make the argument it defames
*  Rasigal to make that argument now
*  You know, this is conflation, isn't it? And that's that's the point
*  We need to have a clear boundary and that includes people who oppose of course what Israel is doing
*  Now the spikes went on in their normal mild
*  thoughtful way
*  Accusing Israel of genocide is despicable double-think Gary Lineker's Israel bashing has exposed the moral rot of the rogue West
*  They sound like Vladimir Putin these people that's essentially what he always goes on about the moral rot of the morally decadent West
*  Weirdos Stephen Pollard the editor at large is Jewish Chronicle accused Lineker of universe-bending ignorance
*  well, I mean, you know who to defer to here Stephen Pollard or a
*  Associate professor of Holocaust and genocide studies great same Greg Smith conservative MP for booking him
*  It's inconceivable any right-minded person would give that video the time of day
*  I bet you they've not even watched it how they have not watched the interview has Greg Smith watch this interview
*  And if he has why not just engage with what the substance is
*  I'd love to hear what he thinks now
*  What I do want to say is this some might go you could just cherry pick a specialist who backs up any old opinion
*  That doesn't make them representative or indeed, right?
*  There are scientists who descend from the consensus on the climate for example, and you always get them cherry picks ago
*  Look at you know, here's a spec
*  He's a scientist and he doesn't think that the climate emergency is real so it isn't real
*  Well, I would know that as early as 15th of October nearly 800 scholars and practitioners of international law conflict studies and genocide studies
*  Signed a letter warning of potential genocide in Gaza. So it can hardly be said that Raoul Segal is some mild
*  you know some some aberration here and
*  Indeed the UN special reporter in human rights in the occupied territories of Palestine Francesca Albanese herself a distinguished international lawyer
*  Who I have also interviewed also warned of the risk of genocide as did a statement signed by a range of other special rapporteurs
*  the point I keep
*  Making is what I find so in hinge about this current nightmare
*  Which is being actively cheered on by political elites and most of the mainstream media is there is no subtlety if there was a hypothetical
*  War crime of tribunal against Israel for what they have done in Gaza, which you know as come in the current world order
*  There isn't going to be but if there was you wouldn't need to go through some classified
*  Secret documents in order to work out what Israel's intent were
*  You would just have to listen to what Israeli leaders and officials say when Benjamin Netanyahu
*  for example quoted from the Bible about Amalek the nation of Amalek when God orders the Israelites in revenge for
*  Amalek's attack on the Israelites to kill all men women children and livestock
*  Genocidal isaac Herzog who is the president of Israel who early on?
*  Essentially well just did talk about the collective guilt of the Palestinian people in Gaza
*  For not rising up against Hamas and therefore being complicit in what they did when a senior IDF spokesperson said that they were
*  Using missiles for damage not accuracy
*  Well, we've certainly seen that and the consequences of that and when the Israel Defense Minister said we're fighting human animals
*  As he justified cutting off all basic needs of human life like energy and food and water
*  and you know when another
*  Spokesperson said of the military that they were going to reduce
*  Gaza to a city of tents with no buildings left standing a former top military lawyer the former top military lawyer of Israel
*  Said that you have to destroy every single building in Gaza because every single building has Hamas in them
*  Israel's finance minister saying a few days ago
*  He agreed with every word of a column written by a former top general which declared a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza including severe epidemics of illness and
*  Starvation will hasten victory a leaks document by the Ministry of Intelligence
*  Led by supposed liquid moderate whatever the hell that means but relatively
*  in which the preferred option is given where the whole of Gaza is ethnically cleansed of
*  Every single Palestinian the deputy speaker of Parliament arguing Israel is too humane burn Gaza no less
*  Loads of other examples and we're not even talking about the genocidal language of many journalists and media outlets that matters, too
*  As we saw in Rwanda and that is criminal its incitement and it's not just intent as incitement as well now
*  There's also what's happening in Gaza obviously in discriminant bombing and the destruction of the conditions which allow life to be possible
*  The civilian death rate as I keep pointing out the percentage of civilians dying violent deaths is much higher than other conflicts like Syria like
*  Yemen like Bosnia like Iraq and Ukraine and indeed people do describe what Russia is doing to Ukraine as genocide
*  That's actually just a mainstream view to have if you said that nobody would regard that as controversial and so why doesn't apply here?
*  You know because has horrific is what Putin is doing to Ukraine the overall
*  destruction and death
*  In terms of Ukraine as a whole compared to Gaza as a whole for Gaza obviously much worse in a much shorter space of time
*  You know the argument then made as well Ukraine didn't do to Russia what Hamas did to Israel now even if you part the outrageous
*  Dishonesty of starting the clock of all this horrible 7th of October you don't adjudicate whether or not something is genocide based on how it began
*  That's not even slightly relevant to whether something is a genocide or not in actual fact whether or not something is
*  Genocide is judged by stated intent and the actual policy being pursued however that what however is justified
*  However it all began that's the point made by Seagal now finally just a point about this whole
*  Gary Lineker thing because my friends at Navarre suggest
*  This is an example of Owen Jones derangement syndrome, which is and just my existence provokes
*  I and fury partly because there's been such an assault on the left and attempt to drive the left out of existence the fact
*  That's have not dissipate died in the ditch and is provocative to a lot of people so the fact Gary Lineker shared me
*  As though I was a legitimate political or media actor and has set them off
*  So but the other issue I think is that an example we're trying to make an example here and
*  Because they know that they're losing the battle for public opinion they know a lot of people are horrified and disgusted by what's going on
*  Apologists for this massacre also know that many people are scared to speak out for fear being smeared for doing so
*  Gary Lineker is a household name. He's a mainstream liberal
*  He doesn't have my politics and that's not to disrespect him
*  We all have different views, but I think his prominent liberals go his heart is very much in the right place now
*  I know lots of high profile people are privately telling me I know that that they're horrified and disgusted
*  To speak out someone like Gary gives permission and space for others to speak out
*  They're scared about that the apologists for this horror and hence the pylon against Gary now the claims is in violation of impartiality rules and
*  Nonsense, you know, we had the previous attack on Gary when he
*  compared the rhetoric of the government to
*  1930s Germany to quote the LBC zone article following the review the BBC decided to allow his top
*  stars to share their own views on social media
*  But must stop short of political campaigning presenters also prohibited from commenting on political debates
*  During the election period or taking up official roles with campaigning groups
*  Well, none of that applies at all in this particular case, so they can't get them on that now finally
*  I think this is backfired badly. It's spread awareness people read an article. They're like, oh no what this is outrageous
*  What's Gary Lineker done? And then it's like
*  Israeli-american
*  Academic specialist in a Holocaust and genocide studies. I think a lot of people read through that I know
*  He might know what he's talking about actually and then go and look for the interview themselves
*  So thanks for attracting more of an audience to get people to hear what Rassi Galt said
*  I'm very thankful to Gary for using his platform as he did. He got a lot of shit for it for nothing
*  He is on the right side of history here. People have to remember that all those who aren't speaking out
*  You've got to be on the right side of history here. This is one of the great atrocities of our time
*  It is a despicable atrocity
*  It is a disgusting atrocity and the complicity of the media and political elites alike is something which will go down
*  Rightly in infamy throughout history and
*  History will not be kind to those who cheer this atrocity on I've no doubt about that
*  So here's to all this speaking out and that's what they're really scared about. Please like and subscribe
