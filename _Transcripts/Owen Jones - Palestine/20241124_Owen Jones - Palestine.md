# Why Israel Is RIGHT To Panic Over ICC Arrest Warrants - w. Dr. Alonso Gurmendi
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [November 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RApBgp4JjSc)
*  Now, finally, after months and months and months of waiting, the International Criminal Court has
*  issued arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu, of course, the Israeli prime minister, and his
*  former defence minister, Yov Galan, for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Israel's
*  murderous onslaught against Gaza, which has now obviously been taking place for getting on for
*  14 months, with apocalyptic conditions for the people of Gaza. That's separate, of course,
*  to South Africa's case of genocide against Israel, which is at the International Court of Justice,
*  which is the UN's highest court and highest court on earth. Now, we've got a lot to talk about. This
*  is my first video I've done about it, so I've been absent during a very crucial moment, but we're
*  going to more than make up with it, because we've got the incredible Dr Alonzo Gamendi, who for me
*  is always a go-to expert on this and so much more, LSE fellow in the Human Rights Department,
*  sociology, brilliant, just go to the always Twitter feed, just the line, what's going on,
*  what's the correct position, always correct. Hey, how you doing? Hey Owen, how are you? Thanks for
*  having me again. This is my third time, actually. I know, I know, but every time people just want
*  more, people just baying for more. And in fact, the first time I did speak to you was about the
*  case on video of, that was at the International Court of Justice back in January now, when
*  provisional orders, no, that was when the case, that was when South Africa's case was presented,
*  it was before the division orders. So this is a big moment. We've been waiting for this for ages,
*  and I know because we talk about this, there's always that, is it going to be today? Is it going
*  to be today? And finally, because it was back in May that the chief prosecutor issued requests for
*  arrest warrants, Karim Khan, and then it's taken many months. That was a much bigger gap than
*  between the request for arrest warrants against Vladimir Putin and one of his ministers,
*  and the issuing of arrest warrants. So, I mean, what just, let's just get your broad
*  brush. What is the significance of this? How big a moment is this? Well, yeah, I think it is
*  incredibly significant. I think what we are witnessing is something that,
*  I mean, it's quite unique that is actually happening. Like I remember when I was in college,
*  and I was in law school, and there were efforts to bring forward cases against war criminals in the
*  West for their crimes in Iraq or Afghanistan or anywhere in Guantanamo. They were always squashed
*  behind the scenes. When I was in law school, there was this whole push for universal jurisdiction
*  all over Europe. European countries started indicting American and European leaders, and one
*  by one, slowly but surely, all of them disappeared over time. And then I think no one's gone to jail
*  over the Iraq war or any of the crimes committed in Guantanamo or anything like that. And so this is,
*  I think victories come few and sparse. So when one comes along, it's good to acknowledge it and say,
*  wow, this is incredible that it just happened. And I think it is also important to not just
*  see this outside of its broader context, because yes, this is an incredible victory for Palestine.
*  It is an incredible victory for the Office of the Prosecutor at the ICC, but it is also something
*  that is, let's say, it rests upon a broader context, a broader change that we're seeing
*  in how international politics works. And it has to do with the fact that global south states are now
*  able to engage international law to secure decolonization or decolonizing aims or liberation.
*  And that is good. And that is good because usually throughout human history, when state power
*  increases, that is used to try and bend the rules, similar to what, let's say, China or Russia might
*  be doing right now. But when you look at South Africa, when you look at Palestine, when you look
*  at Brazil, when you look at these states that are gaining more and more power in the international
*  sphere, even if it's like legitimate power, not necessarily like army power or weaponry,
*  they are using it to enforce rules that were promised to them, that they basically, the global
*  order said, these are the rules. And it just so happens that that was never the case. And so now
*  they're being used for, I guess, the purpose that they were supposed to be used in the beginning.
*  This is battle between international law on one side and this so-called rules-based order that
*  really isn't rules-based. It's just essentially protecting global north interests over global
*  south rights. This is one of the, obviously, what you're talking about, one of the big things I
*  want to talk to you about. Let's start with the specifics of what we know. And it's very important
*  to just make clear that all we actually have is a press release. We don't have the detailed
*  rationale. And just so everyone's aware of the process, you get the chief prosecutor who issues
*  requests for a restaurant, presumably, well, not presumably, because of the sensitive nature of
*  this and the pressure exerted on the International Criminal Court, which the chief prosecutor spoke
*  about, it was also put to an independent panel of expert lawyers who also released a document at the
*  time back in May, setting out their reasons for accepting the overwhelming legal case, as Karen
*  can't put it, for the request for a restaurant. And then you got three pretrial judges, one of
*  whom not that long ago actually stood down for reasons of ill health, officially. But nonetheless,
*  it's three pretrial judges that go through these different processes. But just interested, just
*  based on what we know, because we don't have their detailed reasons, but it's also important to note
*  that this is actually focused specifically on the question, Karen, Karen onwards of siege of
*  starvation. And a lot of the reason for that is there isn't any access to Gaza. You can't get
*  independent researchers or ICC appointed researchers, journalists, foreign journalists are banned. We
*  rely on Palestinian journalists who suffered the biggest slaughter of journalists in recorded
*  history in a conflict in this period. So I mean, so it's focused because there might be other charges.
*  So I just want to focus on that. So what basically is this focusing on? And I think there's a really
*  important point that this could go beyond in terms of who's actually has a rest warrants against them,
*  but also the charges. Yeah, absolutely. And I think it's also important to say that these are
*  not just arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Galland. They were also arrest warrants against
*  Dave. Of course, yeah, Hamas, Hamas, of course. Because we're seeing in the reaction already,
*  this idea that the arrest warrants in themselves are anti-Semitic because of, we can talk about
*  that in a minute, but like the accusation sort of breaks down when you see, well, but they are also
*  going after Hamas. So how can they be anti-Israel? But I guess the point here is that the court is
*  charged with dealing with international, the core international crimes, right? So basically
*  aggression, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and genocide, of course. And the prosecutor is not
*  obliged to go out on a limb and prosecute everyone for all the crimes all at the same time. This is
*  more of a strategic decision, like a litigation strategy on what can I get fastest, what can I
*  get easiest right now, which is why, for example, there were no charges for genocide. And I know a
*  lot of people were angry about that, but there is a reason why. It's because you don't need to
*  prove as many things when you're going after, say, the crime against humanity of extermination.
*  And so the pre-trial chamber this time around found that Netanyahu and Galland have reasonable
*  grounds, that there's reasonable grounds, that's the legal standard. It's not that they are guilty
*  of, it's not beyond a reasonable doubt, it's not on the balance of probabilities. It's one of the
*  more basic standards. There's reasonable grounds to believe that they are engaged, they were engaged
*  in the war crime of starvation as a method of war, and the crimes against humanity of persecution,
*  murder, and I'm forgetting one right now. Oh, and there was the accusation of the war crime of
*  extermination that was not met. The chamber said this is not really extermination, all the elements
*  of the crime are not here yet. I think at this point this is murder, so they changed extermination
*  for murder. They also said that there were reasonable grounds to believe that Netanyahu
*  and Galland had engaged in command responsibility for launching direct attacks against civilians,
*  meaning that soldiers, presumably under their command, attacked civilians directly, which is a
*  big claim that they always have denied, and they didn't sanction them, they didn't take measures
*  to prevent those attacks. And so this is just like the first round, there's definitely more
*  to come. I'm sure that the office of the prosecutor is going to insist on their extermination charges.
*  I don't think they're going to just let that slide, they're just going to offer more evidence,
*  and then probably expand both the people that are being served with arrest warrants,
*  or requests, and also the amount of crimes at play here. Because it's important to know
*  in the original document released by the chief prosecutor, Kieran Khan, it made clear that they
*  wanted to investigate, for example, the bombing campaign. A lot of people actually probably,
*  in their minds, when they think about the possibility of genocide in Gaza, which obviously
*  I would accept the case of genocide full stop, but just when people are looking at that case,
*  they would often think the bombing campaign, the mass destruction of any of civilian infrastructure,
*  Gaza looks like a different color and texture when looked up from space. But he said that that needed
*  to be investigated further, and that you can't investigate that properly without being on the
*  ground. So that shows, doesn't it? I mean, the other point is as well, arrest warrants don't
*  need to be public. So you could have further arrest warrants or further charges, but they may
*  not be publicly disclosed. Yeah, that was a very big, I guess, I'm sure it was a very big debate
*  for the prosecutor. What do I do? Do I announce publicly, I am requesting these arrest warrants,
*  and then any kind of political or legal pressure that his team would face would need to also be
*  public? Or do I do it under secret, hoping that Israel never finds out? So clearly he decided to
*  go for the public option. He doesn't need to do that again. He can now, I don't know the expression,
*  the rabbit's out of the hat, I guess. So he can keep on doing it. Now as to what you mentioned of
*  what constitutes the genocide of Palestinians in Gaza, that is an interesting one, because yes,
*  it is true that what most people associate with is there's a genocide because of the mass killing of
*  Palestinians. That is certainly one of the ways through which genocide can be committed under
*  international law, but it's not necessarily the easiest to prove because of what we discussed in
*  that first video that we made on how do you prove genocide, and you need to prove that the genocidal
*  intent behind those deaths has the only reasonable inference of that is an intent to destroy
*  Palestinians. And that is difficult in these kind of like quote unquote military operations where
*  a lot of people are dying, because Israel can say that the logical inference of that is not I want
*  to genocide Palestinians, the logical inference is I want to defeat Hamas. So it's more difficult
*  to prove. Where it becomes, I don't know if easier, but different is when the act of Israel's
*  of genocide that you're trying to prove is the subjecting of the people to conditions of life
*  that are calculated to bring about their destruction as a group. And that is something that as of the
*  starvation campaign and the whole siege of northern Gaza before that the siege of Ra'afah,
*  and the huge amounts of like problems in getting humanitarian aid into Gaza. That's what's been
*  getting into the minds of experts more as in yeah I acknowledge that it might have been difficult
*  for the court to prove genocide through the mass killing of Palestinians with 2,000 pound bombs,
*  but when we start to get into the mass starvation of Palestinians and the complete siege of northern
*  Gaza, how can you not say that that is subjecting the population to conditions of life that are
*  calculated to bring about their destruction. And the interesting thing of that is that that specific
*  crime at the ICC that wasn't, the court didn't issue arrest warrants for extermination. The chamber
*  said this crime hasn't met all of its elements, therefore I'm going to call it murder not
*  extermination. But it did say the element that I know is there in the crime of extermination
*  that has like different elements on what you need to satisfy for it to be able to be the crime of
*  extermination. They said I'm not saying this is not extermination because there's not a risk of
*  extermination. They said one of the elements of extermination is subjecting the population
*  to conditions of life calculated to bring in about their destruction. The court specifically
*  says that I do think is there. Some other element, we don't know which one, you still need to prove
*  prosecuted. Because most people listen to that and think that was surely the crucial element of
*  extermination. Right, yeah. So I guess what I'm saying is it's basically verbatim the same
*  text of the genocide convention. It's just that when you do that, when you do that part of the
*  elements of the crime of extermination with the specific intent to destroy, then you get genocide.
*  So you need to take this with a grain of salt because it's not the same proving individual
*  conduct as it is proving state conduct. There's different standards of proof here. This is not
*  beyond a reasonable doubt. This is just like reasonable grounds. All of that, yes, absolutely.
*  But if you're a South African lawyer trying to prove that Israel specifically subjected
*  Palestinians to conditions of life calculated to bring about their extermination and then the
*  chamber of the ICC, the pretrial chamber of the ICC says, well, I think there's reasonable grounds
*  that these conditions of life have been imposed, then you're happy. So there's a connection between
*  the ICC and the ICJ. It's not one to one. It's not perfect. It doesn't mean that South Africa already
*  won, but it is an interesting further step into that direction. In terms of, I mean, obviously
*  throughout this, it feels like being ghastly to death by Israel and its cheerleaders during this
*  onslaught against Gaza, is the fact, I mean, Ransi Gal, the Israeli-American associate professor
*  of genocide and Holocaust studies, when I interviewed him very early on, made clear that
*  actually it's very rare that intent is so explicitly spoken about by a state. A perpetrator
*  normally goes to great lengths to cover up their intents, their intentions, and even dressers up
*  what they're doing in humanitarian clothing. What the statement of the ICC prosecute said in May,
*  he says that the acts he listed were committed as part of a common plan to starvation as a method
*  of war and other acts of violence against the Gaza population as a means to, the third reason he said,
*  was collectively punish the civilian population of Gaza, whom they perceive as a threat to Israel.
*  So essentially treating the civilian population as a military threat and therefore a legitimate
*  military target. And this is just this point about content, because the reason it feels like being
*  ghastly is they just confessed to the crime over and over again as they began committing it, with
*  no subtlety of any description. Classic example, 10th of May, Kogat, the civilian wing of the
*  Israeli military forces basically in charge of civilian affairs in the occupied territories.
*  They tweeted out the quote from the relevant major general Ghassan Alyan, who's in charge of Kogat,
*  You wanted hell, you will get hell. The coordinator of the government in the territories
*  major general Ghassan Alyan speaking to Hamas and the residents of Gaza. And in it he says,
*  Hamas became ISIS and the citizens of Gaza are celebrating instead of being horrified. Human beasts
*  are dealt with accordingly. Israel has imposed the total blockade in Gaza. No electricity, no water,
*  just damage. You wanted hell, you will get hell. Clearly talking to the civilian population,
*  clearly saying that they will suffer collective punishment, clearly saying they have collected
*  guilt, clearly making clear they are legitimate military targets. That's one example of so many
*  other examples. Isn't this just, I mean, this is incredible. It's a case of Israel going,
*  how dare you accuse us of, what are you saying? But they just confessed to war crimes from the
*  start. I mean, how is that not, there's no way that's not a confession to war crimes, is it?
*  So, I mean, I'm playing devil's advocate here because I agree with you.
*  But I guess you still need to go through that hurdle of what is the reasonable inference.
*  And there's a whole structure at play within international law to try to make genocide very
*  difficult to prove. This is why the Office of the Prosecutor didn't go with genocide to begin with.
*  I guess this sense by Israelis, especially Israeli leaders and political commentators,
*  of saying how dare you accuse me of this when you don't have any evidence, quote unquote,
*  even though we have the evidence on tape, is more related to how the world is supposed to work as
*  opposed to how it is working right now. World order, as someone who comes from Peru, and we've
*  also had to put presidents in jail, and we've also had to go through atrocity crimes. And
*  I've seen these arguments before in my own country, is how dare you attack the soldiers
*  that are defending me by torturing others. When that happens, traditionally, the world is organized
*  around a principle, which is impunity for me and accountability for you, where the global south
*  needs to hold its own torturers, its own dictators accountable. And that is good, and you get funding,
*  and you get money, and you get statements from the US and Norway and Sweden saying,
*  this is amazing, Peru. It's great that you are putting your presidents in jail for war crimes
*  and crimes against humanity. This is amazing. The Truth Commission is great. The Peruvian Truth
*  Commission is studied in the global north universities as a successful example, even though
*  I don't think it's been that successful. And everyone claps at South Africa for its Truth
*  Commission and Peru for its Truth Commission and for Fujimori being in jail in Peru and for Pinochet
*  almost being in jail. And all of this accountability discourse that is only reserved for the global
*  south. And the global north, when it comes to the war in Iraq, when it comes to coups in Latin
*  America, when it comes to drones, all of that needs to remain in impunity. And that is how the
*  world is supposed to work. And so when the world starts to change and global south actors start to
*  get a little bit more power so that the US cannot pick up the phone and call the South Africans or
*  the Office of the Prosecutor at the ICC and say, squash this, Israel is feeling that it's being
*  treated to a different standard because it sees itself as part of that West that is old impunity.
*  So when they say this is a situation of special treatment, like you're holding Israel to a
*  separate standard, they are saying you're holding Israel to a separate standard when compared to the
*  great powers of the world. They're not comparing themselves to Peru, they're not comparing themselves
*  to South Africa, they're not comparing themselves to Chile, they're not comparing themselves to
*  Argentina, they're only comparing themselves to the United States and how George W. Bush is
*  Rome free. And they say then why aren't us also free? Which is part of the
*  basic inequity of the global system that the global south, the rise of the global south,
*  is trying to change. So I don't see any kind of like double standards with Israel because I come
*  from a country that has had to do that. We've had to go through those difficult discussions,
*  we have had to accept as a society that yeah, the way we fought our own wars against our own
*  terrorist groups was wrong. It's not okay to kill a bunch of people for your own safety because
*  your safety is worth more than other people, other person's lives. And yeah, these are complicated
*  conversations. Societies aren't built to deal with that well. You get a lot of crazies that say no,
*  you need to kill them all, kill all the people. And yeah, you just need to go through it. So if
*  Peru went through it, so does Israel. And there's a question that I've got, which you've been
*  alluding to, which is Peru use its own legal system. And that's the question of complementarity,
*  which is in terms of why the Israeli state is, you know, it's displaying this outrage.
*  But the reason the International Criminal Court intervenes is because there is no confidence
*  in Israel's judicial system to hold to account any of its politicians or indeed soldiers,
*  because there is no history of the Israeli state holding any of its politicians or indeed soldiers
*  properly legally to account for the war crimes they committed. And I think that's why it's
*  interesting, for example, torture so far hasn't been included, even though there's overwhelming
*  evidence, overwhelming evidence of systematic torture against Palestinian detainees, including
*  rape, gang rape. And there was one example when the Israeli state tried to arrest some soldiers
*  for gang raping a Palestinian detainee, and there were riots on the streets of Tel Aviv,
*  including Israeli ministers against that, and then many of the soldiers were released.
*  But I mean, the point there, wasn't it, was that was complementarity is the question Israel going,
*  we can deal with ourselves, therefore you don't have to intervene. But that's why the the ICC is
*  intervening is because it doesn't it's a case of we only intervene if there's no question of any
*  faith in the judicial system of the state in question doing that themselves.
*  Yeah, there's one thing that comes before that, which I've seen a lot in the reaction to the
*  arrest warrants as in, oh, Assad got no arrest warrants, or like Xi Jinping got no arrest warrants,
*  or like, you know, different growing list of like, authoritarians and war criminals, and so why
*  were they? Yeah. And so I think it is important to to to clarify. The ICC simply doesn't have
*  jurisdiction over them. And then the logical response is over. But Israel isn't a member of
*  the ICC. Yes, but the rule is not that you need to be a member to be under the jurisdiction of the
*  ICC. The rule is that you do not commit war crimes and crimes against humanity and genocide
*  in territories that are subject to the ICC jurisdiction. Like Russia and Ukraine, Russia,
*  not a signatory Ukraine, signatory. Right. And like, I would say like
*  Palestine, this is part of this effort that I was saying in the beginning of states
*  choosing to use the law as a means for liberation. So all of these actors and commentators that
*  complain about Hamas as why, why are they receiving legitimacy in the world, while
*  staying silent about, you know, the Palestinian Authority and the state of Palestine,
*  using the mechanisms that they're supposed to use. This is what supposedly they want to happen. Like,
*  if you believe that Palestinians have a right to self-determination, and you believe that armed
*  struggle should not at all be used ever, then you should be happy that they are going to the ICC.
*  They are not happy for other reasons, for reasons of discrimination, for reasons of
*  prejudice, of orientalism. But this is what should happen. What we supposedly in this
*  rules-based order expect states to do, use the rules. It's just that the rules are, you know,
*  supposed to use in the favor of some and against others. And this is where the issue of
*  complementarity comes. Because Israel wants to say, I have potentially a fair judicial system
*  that could potentially deal with this. Only it doesn't. And when that happens, when you commit
*  an international crime in the territory, in a territory that is subject to ICC jurisdiction,
*  and you yourself don't take care of it, then the ICC takes over. That is, again, those are the rules
*  of the rules-based order. And yet the reaction from the West has been one of, from the most absurd
*  and unhinged, like Lindsey Graham saying that you should end the economy of any ally that
*  collaborates with the ICC, which is a legal obligation that states have.
*  Or... He listed Canada, Britain, so on. Yeah. Yeah. And this idea that some other senators said,
*  like, oh, we have an invade the Hague act for a reason. Completely unhinged reaction.
*  And then... John Cotton, I think, yeah. I think so, yeah. To the more uncomfortable one, which is
*  this almost like, yes, this is an arrest warrant. Yes, I'm a member of the ICC. Yes, that means that
*  I need to comply with the ICC. And yes, that means that I support the ICC. And then the journalist
*  asks, so you will arrest Netanyahu? Oh, no, we don't engage in hypotheticals. We don't know.
*  Maybe, perhaps. I don't know. That discomfort shouldn't be there. Like, ask them if they
*  would arrest Putin. If Putin all of a sudden lands in any of their countries, and you ask,
*  would you arrest them? Yes, of course they would. So this double standard is what's at the heart of
*  global South's discontent with the rules-based order and why they are just using international
*  law and saying, now we can. We don't need to swallow our pride and just take your hypocrisy.
*  We can use the rules of the supposed rules-based order and you will hate it. But now we finally
*  can. I mean, just in terms of the reaction, I mean, we saw obviously Israel's deranged reactions,
*  which were entirely predictable, abusing the term antisemitism and antisemitism is a genuine evil,
*  which is rising and trashing its meaning, which is sorry, responsible, because it will stop people
*  being able to identify actual antisemitism or stop people believing in antisemitism existing.
*  It's extremely dangerous. And lots of progressive Jewish activists have spoken out about how this
*  threatens Jewish safety. But in terms of, I mean, is there a worry? I mean, it was put to me that
*  it's not a surprise this came before Trump's inauguration, actually, because he will put on
*  the screws his administration. We can see really extreme pro-Israel people who he's appointing
*  across the board. I mean, is there a threat here? Under Trump, there'll be a just vengeance to try
*  and reassert, because this is seen. I mean, Lindsey Graham, we mentioned the Republican
*  politician who called for these measures. And he said, actually, he has a point in a way here,
*  in that he says the danger is if we allow this, then they'll come for us next. And that's the fear
*  he's alluding to that you're talking about, which is the global South asserting itself and asserting
*  that the legal framework is actually should be taken literally and not a pick and choose menu
*  for the West, depending on what suits its needs and interests at this given point in time.
*  But that, I mean, the Trump administration sees this, and that's why they see this as a threat,
*  because they know this is a kind of the first time there's been an attempt to go after a Western
*  state, basically, in this way. So what do you say? I mean, isn't there a danger the Trump
*  administration will just destabilize? They'll trash the international order if needs be to defend
*  Israel from being held accountable for crimes against humanity and war crimes.
*  Yeah, it is exceedingly ironic, isn't it? Because what you have them saying is,
*  in order to protect the world order as has been applied, we will destroy the world order as it
*  should apply. And that what they're saying is, we will break the transatlantic alliance.
*  In order to fight for impunity for our allies. If I were Russia or China, and I was a competitor
*  for global hegemony in the world, and I hear this, imagine that the transatlantic alliance,
*  one of the most powerful political alliances in the history of humanity, is going to collapse,
*  not because of Russian bombs, not because of Chinese economic pressures, not because of TikTok,
*  but because the US itself will break the alliance to support Israeli war crimes so that the US
*  can keep on committing war crimes. It is, I mean, you cannot even write this stuff off. If you make
*  a movie out of this, people will say this is a ridiculous movie. Right? So that's where I am
*  confused, because I 100% think that Trump will sanction the ICC. They've done it already
*  before, and it will be very hard on the ICC staff going forward. I mean, solidarity to them,
*  because there's very difficult years ahead for them. They're very brave for doing what they're
*  doing. Because they've got Russia, and Israel in the West. I mean, it's just a mess for them,
*  because the security services of Russia are not fun either. So it's not ideal.
*  No, not at all. But at the same time, at what point, and you have this guy who calls himself
*  the best negotiator in history, Donald Trump, who has said before, I'm going to end the war on
*  Ukraine. I'm going to solve the Middle East peace. And he has a bunch of people that are saying,
*  and we're willing to break transatlantic unity over this. At a time when Russia is using hypersonic
*  missiles to attack Ukraine. So in terms of timing, breaking up the transatlantic alliance is not
*  very logical. And so I'm not sure how much of this is just bravado and saber rattling. And at what
*  point is Trump going to say, you know what, I just need to solve this. And he's going to attempt to
*  just solve Middle East peace. Who else? He's the greatest negotiator on earth. So he will try.
*  And he will have in front of him Netanyahu, who does not want a deal at all. I think that's been
*  very clearly established. And that will be a clash between two very overpowering personalities.
*  One not wanting a deal, one wanting a deal. Or at least some level of face saving policy that
*  Netanyahu can say, look, mission accomplished. Let's put a banner in an aircraft carrier and
*  like say that we won and then call it a day. Netanyahu is not going to want that. And it might be,
*  I don't know, but it might be that Trump does. Both because of his, I can solve any problem with my
*  deals, out of the deal kind of logic. And also because of, at some point his generals will tell
*  him Russia is shooting like nuclear capable missiles right now. We cannot just invade the
*  Hague. And so at what point will these two clash and what will that produce? I don't know. At this
*  point I can only speculate, but I don't think that we can take all of these like crazy reactions from
*  the US at, you know, very seriously. Before I just, I was going to ask, obviously, just in terms of
*  the change of the global order, which we've talked about throughout, to be fair, but I can't not ask
*  about the German state. My favorite, I'm talking about the German state to be clear, not indulging
*  in wanton xenophobia against Germany as a whole, but the German state and their response, never a
*  genocide. They're not keen on becoming complicit in it seems, as Namibia, the state pointed out on
*  Twitter earlier this year, slightly surreal how these things turn out. Because of course, the
*  German state committed genocide in there against the Herero in the Nama people at the beginning,
*  as I pointed out, their first genocide in the 20th century. And when you're being told about your
*  first genocide of the 20th century, I think it's time to sit down and just shut up, isn't it really?
*  And of course, there's also Tanzania, which is, I mean, they don't talk about it, but they also did it.
*  I mean, and that point is, of course, there's a show in which they exterminated six million Jews,
*  two terms of Jewish population, but of course, the multiple other genocides they were committing
*  against the Roma. Anyway, their response basically was to suggest, well, I mean,
*  their spokesman said, well, it looks like we're not sure we'd be able to implement this.
*  What do you think of just the German state, their response?
*  So I think, let me start one step below and talk about, this is not all on Germany,
*  in the sense that the way the system is framed, the way the international system of nation states
*  is framed, all states, at one point or another of their history, most likely have committed a genocide,
*  and they have a fancy name for it, and they call it the conquest of the West, the Wild West.
*  I mean, Peru has exterminated indigenous peoples all throughout the Amazon, all throughout the Andes,
*  and if you go alphabetically, you can do this with every single state.
*  The thing is, when you get to Germany, as any other western state, they committed countless genocides,
*  just genocides that weren't filmed, either like the Holocaust or this current Gaza one.
*  In Africa, now it's the anniversary of the Berlin Conference of 1884,
*  which was the start of a bunch of genocides all over Africa. The difference is that when Germany
*  gets to the Holocaust, it sort of made it its national policy, given what happened in the
*  aftermath, given the politics of post-World War II reconstruction and the Marshall Plan and
*  denazification, which was not exactly very denazifying for Germany, ended up putting the
*  Holocaust in a pedestal and more importantly putting Germany's reaction to the Holocaust.
*  Putting the Holocaust in a pedestal and more importantly putting Germany's reaction to the
*  Holocaust in that same pedestal, saying we are the role model for how to deal with a genocide.
*  We've already gone through, we are the experts in how to overcome genocidal mania.
*  And so you need to listen to us because we understand it better. And the way that they
*  did that was by looking at Israel and saying, now we're going to protect you as a means to
*  exemplifying how much we've moved forward. There's a reason of state. The reason for the existence
*  of Germany is now the sustaining of another nation state, which is in itself part of the problem.
*  Because if we go to what we're saying in the beginning, the reason why genocide exists is
*  because of the nation state. So claiming that you're going to atone for genocide by creating
*  the type of entity that almost naturally produces genocide, because you create this idea of the
*  nation. Whoever is not inside that nation is therefore the other that needs to be apartheid
*  or segregated or jinkrowed or exterminated or genocided. It's sort of the wrong lesson.
*  And I think there's a little bit of hubris and we are the experts in atrocity managing in Germany,
*  where I think maybe that is true in terms of another western state that has had to deal with
*  its own genocidal mania in one specific instance. But it's not a western state that has atoned for
*  its entire genocidal mania. To the point, like you said, genocide of the Herrera and the Nama,
*  Germany doesn't recognize it as a genocide per se. They recognize it only as a moral genocide,
*  because they say, oh, genocide didn't exist. The genocide convention didn't exist in 1904.
*  And so therefore it's not technically genocide, but we will treat it as if it were a genocide
*  because of moral reasons. And I think this goes on to the entire west. When you think of the kind
*  of otherization that western states do, not just with regards to Palestinians in Palestine and
*  Israel, but let's think of the UK here where I'm right now. The same principle that leads people
*  to be okay with Middle Eastern, North African asylum seekers drowning and dying en masse by
*  the hundreds in the English Channel is the same kind of reasoning that is enabling Germany to say,
*  no, no, we need to support Israel because of our genocidal past. It is the same kind of problem of
*  producing a nation and saying there's an other, and it doesn't matter what we do to the other.
*  So in the case of Israel, that other is the Palestinians. In the case of the UK,
*  it's asylum seekers. In the case of Germany, it's Turkish immigrants. All societies in the west,
*  and everywhere in the world, like Peru has the same problem with Andean and Amazonian indigenous
*  people, have developed the idea of a nation and then an other to be excluded, discriminated,
*  segregated, genocided. And until we don't acknowledge that, we're always going to have
*  these internal contradictions of Germany saying the ideal way to fighting genocide is by enabling
*  another genocide. And I guess it is important to call Germany out on this internal contradiction.
*  It's what should be done right now. But at the end of the day, the internal contradiction exists
*  in every single nation state because that's what nation states do. Nation states exclude genocide,
*  segregate, Jim Crow, apartheid. That's what they do. That's what they were meant to do.
*  They're meant to put England is meant to protect the English. And whoever doesn't look English
*  needs to be other excluded. And you can drown in the middle of the English channel and we don't
*  care. So that's the root cause. So I agree 100% that we need to call out Germany, but not
*  forgetting where does this come from? What's the root cause? And the root cause is a problem with
*  the way we've organized the world and the way we understand our societies themselves.
*  Just thought I mean, this, well, I was going to ask you a question which before the final
*  pop actually, I think there's just segues into what what I was defining going to just talk to
*  you about, which has been the theme throughout. Because someone look at these arrest forms and
*  go, waste of time, they're never gonna get arrested, they're never gonna go on trial,
*  it's just not gonna happen. They're not going to visit countries where they honestly think
*  they're going to get arrested. I mean, Hungary, which by the way, for those who aren't aware,
*  has the most anti semitic regime in Europe, and has is very pro Israel. And it's that classic,
*  there is no correlation. As history tells us lots of anti Semites for Israel, and sorry,
*  no correlation between, you know, you support Israel, therefore you oppose anti semitism,
*  does oil like that. Richard Nixon was a really famous example of an anti Semite pro as well. But
*  there's so many. Balfour. Balfour, very good example. Yeah, Trump. I mean, Elon Musk constantly
*  doing anti semitic and boosting anti Semites in neo Nazis. But, you know, again, flying the flag.
*  But anyway, so they've invited, Hungary's invited Netanyahu on a visit to, you know,
*  but you know, but they're a signature to the ICC. So like, ha ha, we will show the ICC is a waste
*  of time. But people look at I think this is a waste of time because of that, because they'll
*  be arrested. So I'm just interested in terms of what this means in terms of Israel,
*  Israel's impunity, and linked to that, I suppose, the global order in which we live,
*  which as you talk about, and has rules which are written down, that those rules are clearly not
*  applied in any consistent fashion. So what does you know, when people go waste the time, never
*  going to get arrested, what do you say, what's the real significance here? Well, if they were useless
*  and powerless, they wouldn't bother with them. This is something like I study, you know,
*  post colonial approaches to international relations, I critical race theory, I study like,
*  I'm human rights, gender, all of these ideas have been in the discourse for decades. Like, we have
*  not just invented the AI, we have not just invented critical race theory, these are ideas that come
*  from the 60s and 70s. This is the result of the civil rights movement. But during the 60s,
*  during the 70s, during the 80s, during the 90s, during the early 2000s, they existed in books,
*  they existed among people that talked about them over coffee. And if anything happened in the world
*  that were moved us slightly in that direction, the hegemonic powers went like, who cares,
*  they don't have any real power. When meltdowns happen, it's because those ideas are all of a
*  sudden gaining power. There's a meltdown over critical race theory because it's gaining power.
*  There's a meltdown over trans rights because they're gaining power. There's a meltdown over
*  the AI because it's gaining power. And there's a meltdown over Palestinian statehood and
*  Palestinian self-determination because it is gaining power. And so, no, I cannot promise you
*  that everything's going to change. And tomorrow, when Netanyahu is on his way to Hungary and he's
*  flying over, I don't know, Greece, Greece is going to deploy an F-35 and force his plane to
*  land in Greece so that he can be arrested and sent to the Hague. Probably not. Even if he has
*  like an emergency landing in Greece, maybe they will be arrested. But there are always mechanisms
*  right now that are clearly out of the control of the hegemonic powers. If Lindsey Graham could make
*  these arrest warrants go away with a phone call, he would just make the phone call. He wouldn't go
*  on Twitter or on the TV to say how you need to destroy the transatlantic alliance to make sure
*  that Netanyahu is not arrested because otherwise we're next. Because he truly believes, like you
*  said, that, yeah, the U.S. might be next. So these moves, these ideas have power and they matter.
*  It's just that, I guess, the frustrating part is that they take too long. As in, Palestine began
*  this process of getting to these arrest warrants in 2010 when it petitioned the United Nations to
*  make them a full member of the General Assembly. And they lost that vote. They were only recognized
*  observer state status a few years later. But once they got to the observer state status,
*  they were able to say that they're a state. And so they were able to ratify the Rome Statute.
*  And once they were able to ratify the Rome Statute, they were able in 2015 to say, hey,
*  prosecutor, look into our situation. And then that's when Bensouda started looking into, and then
*  Israel pressured her into not doing it, according to press release at least, to press information.
*  So all of these things move the needle of world justice in a specific direction. I know this
*  sounds cliche, like the long arc of history, but it bends to justice. But it is true. It's just that
*  international law is something that has been around for centuries. Like, depending on who you
*  believe, either in the 1800s or the 1600s, depending on whose historian you're reading,
*  it's been here for centuries. So its history is measured in centuries, not in decades.
*  And that is a problem. But the hopeful side is that it has changed so much ever since the 60s.
*  Like, those ideas that were in pieces of paper and cafe discourses and cafe speeches in the 60s
*  are now in the front lines of the quote unquote culture wars. And so right now, after decolonization,
*  it is a very critical moment for people who, like you and me, like we want to make international
*  law and make the world order a more just system that is not based on impunity for me and
*  accountability for you, but actually on self-determination and human rights. So I guess
*  the consolation of all of this is that we are living at a point in time where that is perhaps
*  as closest as it's ever been. If we were living in the 1700s, then I will tell you, yeah, I mean,
*  it's going to take a long time for us to get to an ICC, you know, arrest warrant. We first need to
*  create the ICC, right? Now I can tell you, we are part of the generation that is changing things.
*  So be happy about that, at least. And that really, as you say, links to this, the assertion of the
*  global south, where they're trying to refashion a world where these rules are taken literally
*  applied consistently rather than trying to bend the rules in their self-interest. I think it is
*  inevitable at this point to say that a post-Western world is coming. How it looks like
*  and what role the West plays in all of that very much depends on what the West does right here,
*  right now, with regards to these crises. So will this be a situation where the Western
*  values and ideas about world order are completely delegitimized and play no more roles in whatever
*  comes next? Which is a very scary thought, because I don't expect the Chinese-centered
*  world order or the Russian-centered world order would be any less supercritical.
*  But what parts of the current world order, what ideas will make it to the post-Western world,
*  is international criminal justice going to be part of it? Is the prohibition on the use of force
*  going to be a part of it? And what role would the West play in that post-Western world? Will it be
*  those former powers that are now irrelevant? Or will they be a relevant player still? All of that
*  depends on right now, on how much the people who are emerging respect the people who are basically
*  are losing power. Because that's what Trump is, right? That's a crumbling empire, basically.
*  It's a narrow playing the mandolin while Rome burns.
*  My book, The Fall of the West, will be out soon. I better get finished. Literally, I'm writing that,
*  everyone. I wasn't joking. Alonzo, what sort of force as ever? We covered so much ground there,
*  both in terms of the specifics of what this means, but also the larger global implications.
*  So everyone do share this video. Press like and subscribe, leave comments, because then that's
*  good for the algorithm, more people listening. Share it, get it all out. But Alonzo, honestly,
*  it's been a real honor. Thank you so much. Thank you for having me.
