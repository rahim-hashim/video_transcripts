# Palestinian Christian Leader: "History Will Hold You Accountable" Over Gaza Genocide
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk)
*  Hello, thanks for joining us. I'm honored today to speak to the Reverend [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=0.0s)]
*  Muntah Isaac. He's senior pastor at the Evangelical Lutheran Christmas Church [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=3.04s)]
*  of Bethlehem. Now, he delivered an incredibly powerful Christmas sermon in which he damned [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=7.04s)]
*  Western complicity in Israel's ongoing mass slaughter in Gaza. Before we speak to him, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=12.72s)]
*  let's hear an excerpt from that sermon. If you are not appalled by what is happening in Gaza, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=17.76s)]
*  if you are not shaken to your core, there is something wrong with your humanity. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=24.959999999999997s)]
*  And if we as Christians are not outraged by the genocide, by the weaponization of the Bible to [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  justify it, there is something wrong with our Christian witness and we are compromising [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=37.2s)]
*  the credibility of our gospel message. If you fail to call this a genocide, it is on you. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=42.8s)]
*  It is a sin and a darkness you willingly embrace. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  Some have not even called for a ceasefire. I'm talking about churches. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=57.36s)]
*  I feel sorry for you. We will be okay. Despite the immense blow we have endured, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=63.12s)]
*  we the Palestinians will recover. We will rise. We will stand up again from the midst of destruction [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=70.88s)]
*  as we have always done as Palestinians. Although this is by far maybe the biggest blow we have [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=78.72s)]
*  received in a long time, but we will be okay. But for those who are complicit, I feel sorry for you. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=85.36s)]
*  Will you ever recover from this? Your charity and your words of shock after the genocide won't make [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=93.52s)]
*  a difference. Very powerful stuff. Now, I began by asking him about that theme of Western complicity. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  Not just those who actively support Israel's onslaught, but those who refuse to speak out. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=108.08s)]
*  Yeah, thank you for having me. This is something we've been talking about as Palestinians, but [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=113.92s)]
*  certainly as Palestinian Christians for a while now. But I think the war on Gaza brought everything [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=120.48s)]
*  in an intensive way together. We engage a lot with not just church leaders, but diplomats [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=125.92s)]
*  and politicians. And we hear the rhetoric from Western leaders who have been for years [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=133.68s)]
*  not just supporting Israel, but supporting the Zionist narrative. We see how in this war, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  everyone frames this conflict as if it started in October 7th, ignoring the context. And then [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  continuing to not just be silent about what's happening [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=157.67999999999998s)]
*  in Gaza, but silent about the constant dehumanization of the Palestinians. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=165.67999999999998s)]
*  The way we were described by Israeli politicians and military leaders. And the way they continue [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=171.04s)]
*  to use phrases like human shields. So if it takes, as I said, destroying a school and killing [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=179.68s)]
*  everyone in it just to get one Hamas militant, it's okay. Because they don't see us as equal [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  humans. So this language that Israel is doing self-defense, it's war on Hamas, and then [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=194.0s)]
*  Palestinians are casualties. And especially when you compare it with the reaction when, for example, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=198.88s)]
*  Russia wants Ukraine. And you're very concerned about the killing of civilians in Ukraine, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=206.32s)]
*  but what about us? And there, it seems the narrative is there. And this is not just what [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=212.72s)]
*  happened in the first week after October 7th. Everyone was horrified. We were all horrified. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=221.2s)]
*  No one should approve the killing of children or families. But then you see how the world leaders [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=227.2s)]
*  lined up one after the other to make sure Israel not only has the weapons and that they will pay [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=232.64s)]
*  the bill, but that they will have the cover, that they will have the political cover. And in some [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=239.2s)]
*  instances now churches have given the theological cover, something we've been talking about as [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=244.64s)]
*  Christians. And then now that the death toll has increased, we're beginning to see the stance a [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=249.6s)]
*  little bit get softer. And they're saying, we're concerned. Israel should respect the parameters of [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=256.32s)]
*  wars. And I say, now you say after you've told Israel basically it's okay to go on and do what [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=266.48s)]
*  you're doing. Israel has been clear about their intentions. They told us what they were going to [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=271.76s)]
*  do. They told us they were going to empty Gaza. And now you're concerned? Now you say, oh, this is [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=276.8s)]
*  appalling. And mark my word, when this genocide is finally over and the international community [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=285.28s)]
*  has access to Gaza and we begin uncovering not just the dead bodies from under the rubble or in [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=290.71999999999997s)]
*  the streets. And right now we're seeing horrifying images of dead bodies everywhere in the streets. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=297.84s)]
*  But then the amount of massive destruction that takes place to the extent that Gaza is no longer [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=303.91999999999996s)]
*  inhabitable. Mark my word, people will say this is shocking, this is horrifying, and so on. And [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=308.64s)]
*  this is what I don't get. And I don't think we should allow them to get away with this, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=316.47999999999996s)]
*  especially when they will come with their money of relief and so on. Or even worse, if they're [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=321.68s)]
*  going to be okay with funding the displacement of the Palestinians of Gaza. And we're beginning [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=328.47999999999996s)]
*  to hear this. So the plan is unfolding in front of our eyes. Everybody is seeing it. We've seen it [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=336.88s)]
*  coming. And now next people will feel the moral obligation to support these refugees and help [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=342.32s)]
*  resettle them. And Israel gets away with ethnic cleansing. And the Western world gets away with [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=352.0s)]
*  looking at the nice people who helped resettle the Palestinians. I can't, you know, why doesn't the [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=358.32s)]
*  world see it? I'm just interested in that point you made about intent being so overt and spoken. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=363.2s)]
*  It's not as subtle. And this is still framed as Israel versus Hamas. But then, I mean, I say this [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=369.92s)]
*  to you as a theologian, when Benjamin Netanyahu quoted approvingly the Amalek and the Bible, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=377.2s)]
*  when the Amalek nation attacked the Israelites, and he says, remember what Amalek did to us? And [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=384.71999999999997s)]
*  in that God commands the Israelites to kill all men, women, children and livestock. Ethnic cleansing, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=388.4s)]
*  two ministers now have come out and called for the ethnic cleansing of Gaza of the Palestinian [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=395.44s)]
*  people and resettlement. But that's not how it's framed, is it? I mean, I just wonder from your [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=400.64s)]
*  perspective, you're obviously in the West Bank, but as a Palestinian, you're seeing this framed [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=405.68s)]
*  state of a war between Israel and cramping down on Hamas. That's not how the West is framing it. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=411.84s)]
*  Even though the intent is spoken very clearly. Yeah, I think this shows the importance of [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=418.24s)]
*  narrative and how everything is framed. The colonization of our land was framed as Jews [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=424.0s)]
*  returning to their homeland. Just think of that logic that is very common in churches today. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=430.8s)]
*  A logic that gives a Jewish person born in Russia or Ukraine more entitlement to the land [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=437.12s)]
*  than the Palestinian, the indigenous Palestinians who've been living here for generations. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=448.24s)]
*  And this rhetoric is translated into action because we're denied our rights on a daily basis. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=452.8s)]
*  We're being forcibly displaced from our land. Even in the West Bank, people are leaving and are [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=457.68s)]
*  forced to leave for several reasons, and sometimes they can't even come back to their land. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=462.16s)]
*  But any Jewish person can resettle, and the world seems okay with this. And again, it's part of the [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=471.04s)]
*  framing of the conversation. Jews coming back to their homeland, and it goes back. A land without [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=476.71999999999997s)]
*  people. How common that phrase was. And the land had people, of course. They knew that the land had [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=484.56s)]
*  people, but it's okay. These people go to Egypt, go to Jordan. And that continues to be a phrase [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=490.96s)]
*  today, denying us of our identity, of our rootedness in the land, while framing it as if a Jewish [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=497.84s)]
*  person anywhere in the world has more rights and is entitled to the land. Sad that theology has [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=505.44s)]
*  played a part of it. We've been challenging what we've called the theology of the empire for [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=511.44s)]
*  four years now as Palestinian Christians. And even today, many progressive Christians would say, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=516.56s)]
*  this is a just war. Israel has the right to defend itself. And just that language, and it's a very [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=524.16s)]
*  common language in this war. I noticed the power of that language, because it turns the colonizer [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=532.56s)]
*  into the victim, and the colonizers into the aggressors. And I've been saying it. Have we [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=540.0s)]
*  forgotten that the state of Israel was built on the ruins of the towns and villages of the very [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=545.76s)]
*  same cousins that are now being pushed out again? So that language ignores the entire context, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=552.16s)]
*  ignores the reality on the ground that Israel has been suffocating those Gaza in an inhuman [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=559.44s)]
*  siege for 16 years, where even the amount of calories were calculated. What amount of calories [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=565.12s)]
*  should enter Gaza during these 16 years? But by insisting and repeating that Israel has the right [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=570.6400000000001s)]
*  to defend itself, the whole narrative is completely reversed. And now we are the aggressors, not the [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=577.6800000000001s)]
*  way around. I was just wondering as well, your thoughts on South Africa's submission to the [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=584.16s)]
*  International Court of Justice, and this is accusing Israel of genocide. I mean, I've read [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=590.16s)]
*  for you the document. I don't know if you've looked at it. It's extremely detailed, lengthy document. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=594.64s)]
*  I just wondered your thoughts on that, because obviously, you know, Western, you get occasionally [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=600.3199999999999s)]
*  hand-wringing from Western leaders who arm and back Israel as they continue to do so. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=605.8399999999999s)]
*  You know, Joe Biden will say it's indiscriminate, which actually is confessing to a war crime, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=610.8000000000001s)]
*  because indiscriminate bombing is a war crime. And then that's walked back by a spokesperson. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=614.5600000000001s)]
*  So I'm just wondering, I mean, what do you have hopes about that submission in terms of [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=618.48s)]
*  how it could actually put Israel under pressure on the question of genocide? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=623.76s)]
*  Yeah, so, but first, I think it's important to acknowledge the [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=627.76s)]
*  the [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=632.48s)]
*  connectedness with the South African context, because even the [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=633.6800000000001s)]
*  those working against anti-apartheid were called terrorists and who supported the apartheid regime. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=639.36s)]
*  And there were churches that even provided the theology for the apartheid regime. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=645.28s)]
*  South African church leaders who've been coming to visit us in Bethlehem for years have been calling [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=649.84s)]
*  this an apartheid regime. In fact, they would tell us this is worse than apartheid. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=654.64s)]
*  And they've been pleading with the world. And just as they were ignored when they were suffering [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=661.1999999999999s)]
*  from apartheid, the very same church leaders are now ignored by Western church leaders. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=666.88s)]
*  And I think the same will happen with the South African government. That's why I think we can't [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=671.92s)]
*  get around this without mentioning racism here. It's part of the whole equation. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=678.8s)]
*  But these moves are important because unless Israel is held accountable, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=686.4s)]
*  they will go on doing with what they're doing. I mean, when I used to explain the situation on [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=692.88s)]
*  the ground for visiting church leaders, and most of them would say, we didn't know. And then how [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=700.4s)]
*  does this happen? And I say Israel gets away with it because they can. No one holds them accountable. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=706.4s)]
*  They do it because they can. And not just they are never held accountable, they don't have to [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=711.12s)]
*  pay for it. Occupation is profitable. And now with this war, they're not paying for it. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=718.3199999999999s)]
*  So unless they are held accountable, unless the world shows that they are serious about the [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=724.0s)]
*  international law, then I don't know what good is it to have such bodies that set laws and hold [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=729.28s)]
*  people accountable. We've seen how Israel continues to get away using the American veto power, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=739.36s)]
*  but we can't get them away now with obvious war crimes that the whole world is witnessing. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=746.9599999999999s)]
*  I mean, the people of Gaza are broadcasting their own execution, their own genocide, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=752.8s)]
*  and the world is watching, and we're still debating terminologies and so on. I hope there [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=758.08s)]
*  is a serious effort from not just South Africa, we're grateful, but for others, because unless [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=763.84s)]
*  they are held accountable, they will continue to do it because they can. Just finally, you're [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=770.4000000000001s)]
*  Christian. Most of the countries which back and arm Israel are dominated by Christianity and by [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=776.96s)]
*  leaders who call themselves Christian. And even if the people of those countries aren't Christian, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=783.6800000000001s)]
*  they're culturally very informed by Christianity in lots of ways. What would your plea be to those [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=787.6s)]
*  in the West who either still buy into the idea that this is Israel defending itself or don't feel [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=792.32s)]
*  able to speak out, feel scared to speak out, maybe accused of smeared attack, that kind of thing. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=798.64s)]
*  What would your plea to them be based on how history will judge all of this, I suppose? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=803.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'll be very clear because I think that the magnitude of the killing, the genocide that is [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=809.6s)]
*  taking place right now demands what I'm going to say. History will hold them accountable. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=821.2s)]
*  This is the time to act. This is the time to speak. History will hold you accountable, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=827.44s)]
*  and history will ask, where were you when this was happening in Gaza? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=831.76s)]
*  When children were killed on such an unprecedented level that we've seen in recent history, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=838.64s)]
*  where were you? And if the answer is we were praying for peace, this is the kind of [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=844.56s)]
*  soft spirituality that have been challenging and many of us have been challenging [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=853.52s)]
*  because it gives the cover that we're peaceful with good people. We pray for both sides equally. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=857.68s)]
*  And I think true peacemaking demands that we take sides, demands that we speak truth to power and [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=863.04s)]
*  call things by their name. This is the time to act and to speak and to put pressure. And this is the [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=871.1999999999999s)]
*  time to act by our moral and ethical standards as Christians who are demanded to speak justice, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=877.28s)]
*  to defend the oppressed and to be thirsty even. Jesus said blessed are those who are thirsty, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=884.48s)]
*  hungry for righteousness. Right now the situation in Gaza is beyond, it's literally hell on earth. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=891.36s)]
*  And I think as many people will continue to ask where was God, me as a pastor I would continue [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=899.84s)]
*  to ask where was the church. It's a very powerful I think expression of moral leadership from [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=905.84s)]
*  you Munther and I really, really appreciate it. It's a very difficult time, it's very difficult [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=911.92s)]
*  for you. I know the pressure you must be under at the moment is incredible but I think your voice is [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=914.9599999999999s)]
*  so, so important right now. So I was really delighted for you to join us. For those watching, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=919.8399999999999s)]
*  do share this video and like and subscribe. But Munther, honestly that was a real honour. Thank you so much. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=923.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7tAxR5mzUk&t=928.3199999999999s)]
