# Gaza Deal Exposes Biden As MONSTER
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo)
*  As a ceasefire is declared in Gaza due to begin on Sunday, and we will see about that, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=0.0s)]
*  not least as the Israeli state continues its genocidal onslaught on Gaza, it's time to [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=3.84s)]
*  take stock. Joe Biden, the President of the United States, who will rightly go down in [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=8.82s)]
*  history as a monster, said this. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=13.64s)]
*  This is the ceasefire agreement I introduced last spring. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=16.72s)]
*  One caveat here, how sentient this man is, open to debate, but what were he and his advisors [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=20.64s)]
*  thinking when they decided he should say that? Did they think it would reflect well on him? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  That this would mean he would get some credit? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=30.0s)]
*  Does he not realise how incriminating this is? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=32.52s)]
*  Indeed, what has been underlined by latest developments is that the United States, which [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=35.04s)]
*  provides Israel with the overwhelming majority of its weapons, as well as aid and diplomatic [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=39.32s)]
*  support, we could go on. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=44.2s)]
*  The US has almost total leverage over what Israel does in these circumstances. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=46.0s)]
*  That Netanyahu signed up to a deal that was on the table last spring is because, let's [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=51.24s)]
*  say it, Donald Trump used some sort of leverage, which Biden refused. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=55.84s)]
*  There's going to be some heavy caveats here. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=59.599999999999994s)]
*  Don't worry, I got onto them. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=60.919999999999995s)]
*  Now, according to The Washington Post, a diplomat briefed on the ceasefire negotiations between [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  Israel and Hamas, credited progress in the talks in part to the influence of President [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=67.2s)]
*  elect Donald Trump, saying it was the first time there had been real pressure on the Israeli [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  side to accept a deal. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=76.12s)]
*  According to The Times of Israel, a tense weekend meeting between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=78.84s)]
*  and incoming Mideast envoy Steve Wittkopf led to a break through in the hostage negotiations [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=83.72s)]
*  with the top US president elect Donald Trump, doing more to sway the premier in a single [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=89.16s)]
*  sit down than outgoing President Joe Biden did all year, two Arab officials told The [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=93.72s)]
*  Times of Israel on Tuesday. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=99.2s)]
*  Trump triumphantly posted on Trees Social, we have a deal for the hostages in the Middle [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=103.24s)]
*  East. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=106.84s)]
*  They will be released shortly. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=107.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=109.28s)]
*  All in capitals, characteristically. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=110.28s)]
*  Now the scenes, understandably, of Palestinians and Gaza celebrating. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=112.03999999999999s)]
*  Any respite whatsoever, given what they've gone through, is something which has overwhelmed [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=115.92s)]
*  so many of them. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=121.12s)]
*  That includes, of course, children who've suffered so much. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=122.12s)]
*  Let me give you some context about Joe Biden. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=140.96s)]
*  Let's do this. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=143.56s)]
*  Two consistent themes of his policy on Israel and Palestine since the 7th of October 2023 [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=144.56s)]
*  are the same as they've been throughout his entire political career. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=149.12s)]
*  And that is firstly, Israel is an invaluable strategic asset to the United States. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=152.68s)]
*  And the second is that Palestinian life does not matter very much at all. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=158.24s)]
*  And those are overriding considerations. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=164.64000000000001s)]
*  Now this isn't hyperbolic. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=167.28s)]
*  Let me read from a long read. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=168.88s)]
*  It's published, it was published last March in the London Review of Books. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=170.2s)]
*  It was penned by the Indian essayist and novelist Pankaj Mishra. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=173.64s)]
*  It refers back to 1982 when Israel had invaded Lebanon, inflicting terrible atrocities as [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=177.79999999999998s)]
*  it did so. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  Led by Menachem Begin, the leader of Likud, of course the party later led by Benjamin [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=183.79999999999998s)]
*  Netanyahu. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=188.35999999999999s)]
*  In the run up to the establishment of Israel, Begin was a terrorist leader. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=189.95999999999998s)]
*  Now one of the atrocities committed in Lebanon was the massacre at Sabra and Shatir in which [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=195.72s)]
*  Israel's allies slaughtered up to three and a half thousand civilians, mostly Palestinians [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=202.6s)]
*  and Lebanese, with unspeakable crimes. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=208.56s)]
*  I mean it's a horror film. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=210.88s)]
*  And it should be noted the Minister of Defence Ariel Sharon was forced to resign and found [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  culpable for that massacre. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=217.95999999999998s)]
*  Now Israel's behaviour was too much for the then Republican President Ronald Reagan, who [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=219.48s)]
*  as Beirut was assaulted, rang Begin and ordered him to cease what he described as a Holocaust. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  Begin was angry, but he complied. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=230.8s)]
*  Now with that context, let me read this passage. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=232.92000000000002s)]
*  In 1982, shortly before Reagan bluntly ordered Begin to cease his Holocaust in Lebanon, a [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=235.28s)]
*  young US Senator who revered Eddie Weisel as his great teacher met the Israeli Prime [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=240.16000000000003s)]
*  Minister. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=244.64000000000001s)]
*  In Begin's own stunned account of the meeting, the Senator commended the Israeli war effort [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=245.64000000000001s)]
*  and boasted that he would have gone further even if it meant killing women and children. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=249.32000000000002s)]
*  Begin himself was taken aback by the words of the future US President Joe Biden. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=254.4s)]
*  No sir, he insisted. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=258.08s)]
*  According to our values, it is forbidden to hurt women and children, even in war. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=260.68s)]
*  This is a yardstick of human civilisation, not to hurt civilians. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=265.12s)]
*  Well he didn't abide by it then. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=269.03999999999996s)]
*  That's a yardstick of civilisation. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=271.59999999999997s)]
*  Where does that leave Israel today? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=273.52s)]
*  Absolutely incredible stuff. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=277.03999999999996s)]
*  Let's be very clear. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=278.03999999999996s)]
*  Let's be very clear. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=279.03999999999996s)]
*  Joe Biden is an anti-Palestinian racist. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=280.03999999999996s)]
*  He clearly does not believe that Palestinian life has any significant worth. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=282.76s)]
*  The occasional hand-wringing you have seen from him has all been for show. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=286.2s)]
*  To try and defuse growing domestic anger as well as backlash abroad, he has gladly, proudly [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=290.52s)]
*  kept arming Israel to the teeth as he has butchered Palestinians in this genocidal [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=295.12s)]
*  mayhem offering a record amount spent on US military aid to Israel. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=299.71999999999997s)]
*  Now let's go through caveats, and these are big caveats. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=304.96s)]
*  Israel is bombarding Gaza at the moment and history tells us they will use the period [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=308.36s)]
*  to slaughter as many Palestinians as they can. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=313.62s)]
*  Dozens are now reported killed since the ceasefire announcement. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=318.42s)]
*  At one hospital, Ali Arab Hospital, 53 victims who were killed were admitted, their bodies, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=320.9s)]
*  because of Israeli bombing since the announcement of the ceasefire. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=326.86s)]
*  18 women, 18 children, 4 men, 3 elderly. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=329.86s)]
*  If that happened in Britain, just that one massacre, well I mean these were different [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=333.74s)]
*  massacres presumably. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=338.98s)]
*  That would be a national tragedy, remember that, generations. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=340.98s)]
*  Britain has a much bigger population, approaching 70 million compared to Gaza's pre-war 2.2, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=346.82s)]
*  2.3 million. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=352.18s)]
*  It would just shatter society here. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=354.70000000000005s)]
*  It would just be, everyone would just be, you know, it would just be shattering in terms [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=357.86s)]
*  of just how devastated so many people would be. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=363.06s)]
*  It would be like national mourning, remembered for decades. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=364.98s)]
*  One of the great tragedies of post-war Britain. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=369.38s)]
*  That's just one massacre. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=373.46s)]
*  That's just one group of, you know, it's like it's nothing. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=375.46s)]
*  But it is, it's everything. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=379.14s)]
*  Every single one of those people, an entire universe, extinguished. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=382.06s)]
*  But you know what I mean. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=385.62s)]
*  But what of Donald Trump? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=388.14s)]
*  Trump is no friend of the Palestinian people and he has nominated pro-Israel anti-Palestinian [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=390.02s)]
*  zealots to his incoming administration. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=393.7s)]
*  Back in November, just after Trump's victory, I posted, here's what I think may happen. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=396.16s)]
*  Donald Trump grants Israel annexation of the West Bank in exchange for Israel widening [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=400.56s)]
*  down its full scale onslaught against Gaza in favour of quieter, gradual strangulation [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=403.76000000000005s)]
*  so he can present the latter as a win. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=408.38000000000005s)]
*  Now as Mohammed Shahada, a brilliant Palestinian analyst, put it, Trump offered a gift bag [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=410.68s)]
*  in return for a Gaza deal, lifting all sanctions on Israeli extremists, settlers and spyware [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=415.56s)]
*  companies. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=420.6s)]
*  And from your perspective, if this deal goes through and we enter what's characterised [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=421.6s)]
*  as the first phase, does that effectively mean the war is over? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=448.16s)]
*  Is, does a ceasefire mean that Israel's, its work is done in Gaza for the foreseeable future? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=453.56s)]
*  Well I certainly think Hamas would like to believe that. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=461.12s)]
*  But we've been clear that Gaza has to be fully demilitarised. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=466.04s)]
*  Hamas has to be destroyed to the point that it cannot reconstitute and that Israel has [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=471.92s)]
*  every right to fully protect itself. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=479.76s)]
*  So you know, all of those pieces. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=482.24s)]
*  Now it's worth emphasising that the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, this week declared [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=485.44s)]
*  that according to US assessments, Hamas had recruited almost as many new militants as [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=489.24s)]
*  they had lost. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=492.76s)]
*  Now what is Waltz talking about here? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=494.32s)]
*  Given the apocalyptic barbarism unleashed against Gaza now since October 2023, what [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=497.24s)]
*  on earth is he possibly endorsing that he thinks will achieve a different outcome? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=504.44s)]
*  What level of violence? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=507.12s)]
*  Can you even imagine it? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=510.28000000000003s)]
*  Trump is no peacemaker, don't be fooled. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=513.24s)]
*  It's worth noting that last time he became President in 2016, he dramatically escalated [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=515.04s)]
*  airstrikes in Afghanistan, which meant a surge in civilian deaths, even as he paved the way [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=519.72s)]
*  for the inevitable US acceptance of strategic military defeat in Afghanistan. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=524.92s)]
*  Now for those who believe the genocide is over, I'm afraid a bitter appointment with [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=528.24s)]
*  a grim reality beckons. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=530.9599999999999s)]
*  Indeed, what's left of Gaza? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=532.4799999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's not habitable as it stands or as it lies in ruins. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=534.8s)]
*  Most of its infrastructure is in ruins. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=542.4399999999999s)]
*  Its hospital system is destroyed. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=544.92s)]
*  Its domestic food production and agriculture is ruined. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=547.28s)]
*  Just one statistic, 83% of plant life has been destroyed. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=551.4s)]
*  That was months ago, by the way, the estimate. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=554.08s)]
*  Whatever happens, there has to be accountability. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=556.68s)]
*  The Democratic administration, Joe Biden, Antip Lincoln and, yes, Kamala Harris, they [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=558.36s)]
*  need to go to jail. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=563.0s)]
*  I don't care how far-fetched or utopian that seems now. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=564.0s)]
*  If we normalise this level of evil, then we are paving the way for a future of unspeakable [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=567.88s)]
*  barbarism and thus paving the way for the destruction of our own species, which I have [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=572.92s)]
*  to say I think increasingly hangs in the balance. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=577.84s)]
*  We need accountability for other leaders as well. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=580.08s)]
*  That includes Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour Prime Minister in the United Kingdom, who [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=582.0s)]
*  at the beginning of this genocide declared Israel had the right to cut off the basic [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=585.76s)]
*  essentials of life to the civilian population of Gaza. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=589.76s)]
*  He's issued a statement now about the ceasefire and it's absolutely disgusting. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=593.6s)]
*  In that statement, he talks of Hamas being brutal terrorists, Israelis suffering the [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=597.96s)]
*  deadliest massacre in terms of the Jewish people since the Holocaust, brutally ripped, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=603.12s)]
*  he says, from their homes, held captive in unimaginable conditions, being murdered. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=608.36s)]
*  I think we'd agree, extremely emotive language. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=612.96s)]
*  But when he talks about Palestinians, he just says they have simply lost their lives. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=616.2800000000001s)]
*  That's all he says about it. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=620.24s)]
*  I mean, no perpetrator identified, nothing that in any way shows kind of an emotional [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=622.84s)]
*  response to what they've gone through. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=632.08s)]
*  You know, it's just like some act of God or natural disaster. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=635.16s)]
*  There is no evidence, zero evidence, in fact, that this man truly believes that Palestinians [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=639.16s)]
*  have equal worth as human beings. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=643.2s)]
*  It's very clear to me that he believes Palestinian life is worth a fraction of Israeli life and [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=644.92s)]
*  a pretty small fraction of that. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=648.6s)]
*  Finally, let's think of the Palestinian journalists of Gaza. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=650.76s)]
*  They are the lions of the world's press pack. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=659.36s)]
*  They've suffered so much. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=662.48s)]
*  They did everything they could to show the world the horror, the barbarism, being inflicted [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=664.76s)]
*  on their own people, all while they have suffered the biggest slaughter of journalists in history. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=669.16s)]
*  They were the eyes and are the eyes and ears of the world in a time of unspeakable evil. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=675.64s)]
*  One by one, or sometimes more than one at a time, they were butchered, sometimes alongside [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=682.84s)]
*  their families and their little children, burned alive, blown to pieces, buried, under [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=686.96s)]
*  rubble and suffocated. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=693.52s)]
*  They had one objective above all else, to convince the world that Palestinian life matters, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=695.3199999999999s)]
*  that the worth of a Palestinian is no less than the worth of anybody else, that their [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=701.1999999999999s)]
*  suffering matters, that their pain matters, that they deserve the right to live, to flourish [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=706.36s)]
*  and to be happy, not to be trapped in a killing field and reduced to ash. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=712.56s)]
*  They were and they are lights in the darkness, the most courageous journalists to ever walk [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=717.48s)]
*  the face of the earth. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=721.88s)]
*  And we must never, ever, ever, ever forget what they've done. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpReoy3xRo&t=723.44s)]
