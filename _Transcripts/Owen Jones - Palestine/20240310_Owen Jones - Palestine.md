# Why Israel's Fake 'Moderates' Are Politically Dangerous
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [March 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmVQ8E6srA8)
*  Can you be a moderate supporter of a genocidal onslaught? Now that might sound preposterous
*  to you and there's a good reason for that. It is preposterous. But what I'm about to show you is
*  highly instructive. It's some clips from an interview on CNN with an Israeli historian
*  who's presented to us as a voice of moderation and humanity. It's utterly infuriating in my view,
*  to say the least, but it is a highly instructive case study about where Israel's currently at.
*  It offers an insight into what happens to those who genuinely believe themselves to be humane,
*  rational and compassionate when they live in a society which has become deeply and profoundly
*  morally corrupted. Now I've repeatedly made the argument that Israel is in the grip of a form of
*  genocidal mania. What does that mean? It means the dehumanisation of the Palestinian people is
*  absolute in large swathes of Israeli society, to the point where it's taken for granted by many.
*  It becomes like a background hump. That level of dehumanisation is so absolute that it leads people
*  to, at the very least, accept hideous levels of barbarism against those who they do not regard as
*  fellow human beings with lives of equal worth or even approaching equal worth. The worth of those
*  lives isn't even a tiny fraction of the worth of the lives of the people they see as being like
*  themselves. Now a really important point here, there are extremely courageous Israelis speaking
*  out against the mass slaughter of the Palestinian people in Gaza. They're extremely courageous
*  because they are so few and so marginalised. This isn't a phenomenon specific to Israel. The
*  righteous have been bitterly isolated in many societies before, our own included, and yet they
*  ended up, in many cases, triumphing in the end. And so I believe it will be the case here, not least
*  because you have to have hope or you give up, which I don't consider an option, and because while
*  Israel has been at war with great Jewish political traditions of justice and equality, without which
*  the mon left would not exist, those traditions live on, not least in the Jewish communities of,
*  for example, the United States. Now the person in this interview, which I'll show clips on,
*  is not one of those people. And indeed, the word that kept coming into my head when I listened was
*  insidious. There are, as we know, Israeli ministers, journalists, public figures who
*  speak in overtly genocidal ways about the Palestinian people, which is very relevant in
*  the discussion we're going to have. She's not one of them. And that might make some applaud what
*  she says, well at least she's not speaking in vicious, blood-curdling terms about the Palestinians
*  as they're slaughtered. Can't we give her some credit for that? In many ways, what you're going
*  to hear is more dangerous. The historian in question is Fania Oz-Solsberger, the professor
*  emeritus of history at the University of Haifa. She regards herself as being on the Israeli left.
*  She's the daughter of Amos Oz, who was a celebrated Israeli public intellectual who died
*  aged 79. Some of his and therefore her relatives were murdered by the Nazis in the Holocaust.
*  He advocated a two-state solution in 1967 when it was unpopular to do so. It made it obviously
*  extremely unpopular now, but he was on the early figures to say anything along those lines. He
*  rightly said even unavoidable occupations are a corruption occupation. I don't agree with the
*  unavoidable bit. He helped found peace now in 1978, opposed the illegal settlements. He was an
*  ardent Zionist. He supported the Second Lebanon War in which Israel committed terrible war crimes.
*  Admittedly, he got squeamish about it and supported later onslaughts against Gaza,
*  despite again being squeamish given Israeli atrocities. Let's just hear a first clip from
*  this interview. The enormous cost in global acceptance, public opinion that Israel is
*  suffering right now because of what is happening in Gaza with the death of 30,000 people,
*  you know, starvation, famine, or all of those things that you know.
*  Yes, so yes, we have started, we have not started actually, we've been at it for quite a while now.
*  It was absolutely clear that a war in Gaza will have a terrible toll, a terrible cost in human
*  suffering in Gaza. And I think many of us knew this from the very beginning. And still we felt,
*  and I still feel as we talk now, that defeating Hamas is wholly necessary. It is morally right.
*  However, this is certainly not the kind of war that I and many other Israelis would have liked
*  to fight against Hamas. Okay, let's just go through that to begin with. She says it was clear that a
*  war in Gaza would have a terrible toll, a terrible cost in human suffering. She says,
*  I think many knew this from the start. Refreshing honesty, I'll give her that. On the 24th of
*  October, I wrote a column for The Guardian entitled, Israel is clear about its intentions
*  in Gaza. World leaders cannot plead ignorance of what is coming. Now, I wrote that for a big
*  important reason, because I knew that when the scale of the crime was so grotesque and
*  hideous and relentless and public opinion increasingly just became revolted by, I don't know,
*  countless children being burned alive and suffocating under the rubble of their own
*  homes or having their schools ripped apart by bullets. Some would go, oh, if only I knew
*  what I knew then. Knew then what I knew now. I didn't know this would happen. It's gone too far.
*  This is awful. Oh no. So the good professor makes it clear she knew this would happen.
*  She knew. What she means is what those terrible consequences are, that terrible cost in human
*  suffering. What does that mean in practice? Well, she must know unless she's in denial,
*  it means over 14,000 Palestinian children suffering hideous violent deaths at the hands
*  of Israeli weapons, as well as in total approaching 40,000 Palestinians killed,
*  when you include those buried under the rubble, that is 40,000. Now, with a new detailed academic
*  report, we know just how bad things are likely to get. When a likely escalation is taken into
*  account, for example, the invasion of Ra'far, by August over 5% of the Palestinian people
*  are likely to have been killed according to their projections. One in every 19 Palestinians
*  been killed in Gaza in just 10 months. Where do you even begin to describe the horror of that?
*  It means two mothers dying every hour. It means Caesareans performed on mothers without
*  anaesthetics. It means babies having their limbs amputated without anaesthetics. It means
*  Palestinians surviving on animal food and children starving to death. As one UN official puts it,
*  it's likely the worst rate of killing since the Rwandan genocide. That easily ranks it as one of
*  the worst atrocities of our time. That's what we're talking about. Is this the stuff she's
*  discussing here? Is that what she means? Now, we knew this would happen because Israeli ministers
*  and officials and army officers made clear it would happen. At the start, Yov Galan, Israel's
*  defense minister, justified a total siege of all the essentials of life to a civilian population
*  he described as human animals. He also declared he'd removed all the strengths and restrictions on
*  Israeli soldiers. Well, we certainly saw the consequences of that, didn't we? The Israeli
*  president, Isaac Herzog, declared that an entire nation out there is responsible for 7th of October,
*  declaring it's not true, this rhetoric about civilians, not aware, not evolved. It's absolutely
*  not true, adding, we will fight until we break their backbone. Other ministers declared variously
*  that the entire civilian population of Gaza is ordered to move immediately. One suggested just
*  nuking Gaza. Another call for a new NAQPA, that is a repetition of the mass expulsion of Palestinians
*  in 1948, in which 15,000 were slaughtered. We could go on. So what's the function of what she says here?
*  Of her saying, I knew how much suffering there would be. I knew there'd be terrible suffering.
*  Given, I would argue the extremely explicit statements by those who run her country,
*  about the fact that Israel had already killed more Palestinians in Gaza five days into this
*  entire hideous episode, probably sooner than Israelis killed on the 7th of October. And now
*  we've had 155 days of that. Is it to make us think, well, at least she's compassionate?
*  At least she cares. At least she's not someone who's entirely dehumanized people, whose lives
*  she would not consider as having any less value than another human being. Well, I have to be
*  honest here. That had the exact opposite impact on me. Sounds like a confession to me. I knew
*  it would be an unspeakable horror. I backed it anyway. I knew it would mean terrible suffering.
*  She then says defeating Hamas is wholly necessary, is morally right. Living inside,
*  that's not going to happen. You can't militarily defeat an idea. Don't listen to me also, by the
*  way. Listen to Shin Bet, Israel's military intelligence service, who declare in the end,
*  Hamas will live on as a guerrilla group. US intelligence officials told members of congress
*  last month that Israel was not even close to defeating Hamas. So she thinks it's morally right,
*  does she? Given the mass slaughter we've already seen to carry this onslaught on,
*  how many more times Palestinians will then be killed as have already been slaughtered?
*  How many is she willing to accept if, because defeating Hamas is morally right in its own,
*  as an end in itself, given that's already involved about 40,000 being killed. If they're not even
*  close to defeating Hamas, how many more times are those that figure 40,000 to die? Does she
*  have a limit? I'd like to know that. Does she have a limit? It's clearly not the tens of thousands,
*  is it? How many hundreds of thousands, how many hundreds of thousands of Gazans are you willing
*  to accept to die valid deaths in the morally right objective of defeating Hamas? What percentage of
*  Gazans, 2.2 million people, around half of human children, are you prepared to sacrifice in the
*  altar the impossible military objective of defeating Hamas? And do you realise or do you not realise
*  that of whatever number survives there is an endless supply of recruits who will never forgive
*  Israel for what it has done, whether they end up calling themselves Hamas or something else,
*  and that is guaranteeing generations of violence and bloodshed. Do you know what it's going to do
*  to the people picking up the remnants of their little toddlers? Do you think they're going to go,
*  we accept Israel now? Do you think that's going to happen? Well, I'm going to tell you now. It
*  isn't. Now she says, however, this is certainly not the sort of war that I and many Israelis would
*  have liked to fight for against Hamas. Well, we'll come on to what she says next, because that's
*  theoretically ambiguous, isn't it? Does she mean Israel should not have adopted a strategy of
*  virtually wiping Gazans off the face of the earth? So it now actually has a different colour and text
*  to it when looked at from satellites, and what would have been that strategy instead? Or is she
*  just adopting the standard formula here of Hamas forced this on us and thus every single
*  civilian who the Israeli military kills is a tragedy, but it's on them. They forced it on
*  us. We didn't want this, but this is what we have now, which conveniently allows Israel to commit as
*  many atrocities as it wants, because it can always just say, well, it's Hamas' fault. Carpe Blanche.
*  Let's carry on. Given you've seen with your own eyes these selfies that Israeli soldiers are taking
*  of themselves in Gaza, do you think that this is diminishing the self-proclaimed
*  notion of the most moral army in the world? I will not call any army in the world the most
*  moral army in the world. I think that this is a doomed kind of competition. I do think that
*  Israel, the Israel that I have grown up in, that I have known, that I have loved, that I still love,
*  this kind of Israel has attempted in the best possible way to diminish the suffering of both
*  ourselves and our enemies and certainly our enemy civilians and innocents. Gaza has innocent people.
*  Not all civilians are innocent, unfortunately, but we cannot tell the difference when we fight,
*  and hence all civilians deserve to be protected as best we can. I think that in this war,
*  we have partially failed in doing that, although we have been trying. The IDF has attempted
*  to diminish the danger to civilians, not always successfully, and sometimes preferring the safety
*  of our own soldiers to the safety of local civilians. It is a complicated case. It is a
*  horrible, a set of horrible moral dilemmas, and I certainly wish that another leadership,
*  another prime minister, another kind of war cabinet would have been running this war, not that previous
*  wars were paradisical, but this war is among the worst, perhaps the worst, perhaps the ugliest,
*  perhaps the dirtiest that we ever had to fight. And still, Christiane, I have to say that we have
*  to defeat Hamas, not disregarding the moral dilemmas, but doing our best, which we haven't,
*  unfortunately, but trying to keep doing our best for the innocent, for the uninvolved.
*  This really is insidious, isn't it? Rarely has there been so much documented evidence of an army
*  committing so many loud and proud war crimes. Hiran said to Israel's ludicrous statement about
*  having the most moral army on earth is a useful cop out here. Well, you know, which army could
*  you ever describe as such? Don't want to get into that. So she doesn't rule it out. She just says
*  it's not a useful way of looking at how you would look, kind of order things, and then launches into
*  a deeply insidious defence of the Israel defence forces to make us believe that it does try to
*  protect civilians, even if it doesn't always meet the mark. But if we're really going for the most
*  insidious of all the comments, it's her Gaza has innocent people. Not all civilians are innocent,
*  unfortunately, but we cannot tell the difference when we fight. Not all civilians are innocent,
*  unfortunately. What does she mean there? What's she talking about there? Does she know what
*  civilian is? She's a professor of history. I would imagine she does. What's a civilian?
*  Could the good professor define a civilian for me? A civilian is a non-competent.
*  That's what a civilian is. International law is extremely clear. No civilian under any circumstances
*  is ever a legitimate military target. In a war, combatants are legitimate targets subject to the
*  laws which govern warfare, like the Geneva Convention. Now, if we're just sticking by
*  the letter of international law, that doesn't mean you can't put the lives of civilians at risk.
*  So legally speaking, you can, but only if it's proportionate to the military aim you're seeking.
*  So what does she mean by not all civilians are innocent? If a civilian takes up arms,
*  they're not civilian anymore. She can't be talking about that. Is she defining innocence or
*  guilt by people's beliefs? You can't do that, professor, can you? I mean, that is clearly the
*  mentality driving this onslaught. I get that. That's where the whole collective guilt thing comes in.
*  That that is not how wars which abide by the norms and laws of war work. I could look at
*  opinion polls in Israel, like 60% of Jewish Israelis supporting ending all humanitarian aid to Gaza,
*  which means death by mass starvation, disease, or the fact that even is split and whether the
*  firepower already used against Gaza is about right or hasn't gone far enough. And quite
*  justifiably conclude those are genocidal perspectives, but never ever stop seeing
*  them as civilians. And I would never stop. I would never support any violence against Israeli
*  civilians. It doesn't matter how poisonous their views are. I wouldn't then, when I'm talking about
*  a theoretical military onslaught, start sort of like compartmentalizing an innocent Israeli
*  civilian and a guilty Israeli civilian. Imagine, imagine somebody did that. What would a guilty
*  Israeli civilian mean? What does she mean? The message she's trying to convey here, by the way,
*  when she says not all civilians are innocent, and we can't tell the difference when we fight,
*  is the massive civilian death toll, which she can't deny, can be explained by the fact the
*  Israeli army just doing its best, but doesn't often know which civilian is innocent,
*  in inverted quotes or not. Ken, what does it mean? What does innocence mean in this context?
*  As for pointing to selfies of IDF soldiers, I'm sorry, but the presenter here, who actually is a
*  formidable journalist, I've been on TV with her before myself, and I think she has a hugely
*  formidable reputation for lots of very justifiable legitimate reasons, but she catastrophically
*  failed in her job here. It's not just selfies. It's IDF soldiers putting on social media for comic
*  amusement, things like them making overtly genocidal statements about Palestinians over
*  and over again, blowing up schools, hospitals, and people's homes, posing with the stolen
*  possessions of those they displaced, maimed and killed, like children's bicycles, children's toys,
*  the walking canes of the infirm and elderly, over and over again with women's underwear,
*  with no evidence of any disciplinary action against these people. No disciplinary action that we know
*  whatsoever, which isn't a surprise because as already noted, Jo Gallant, the Minister of Defense,
*  said at the start of this so-called conflict, but in practice genocide, longslaught, that he'd removed
*  all restrictions and restraints on soldiers. She claims the IDF have been trying to avoid
*  civilian casualties. What do you even say at this point? I mean, it's just having to try and communicate
*  now with someone who's just living in a different moral and physical universe. The equivalent of
*  several nuclear bombs worth of explosives have been detonated in an area the size of East London.
*  Around 70% of civilian infrastructure has been severely damaged or destroyed. According to the
*  brilliant investigative work of Plus 972 magazine, an Israeli-Palestinian media outlet, the Israeli
*  army increased the number of acceptable civilian casualties from dozens per alleged military target
*  to hundreds. They also refer in that work to the use of the Daha doctrine, in which the Israeli state
*  uses civilian violence against the civilian population in an attempt to get them to put
*  pressure on Hamas. Violence against civilians for political ends. We have a word for that
*  in the English language. You may have heard of it. It's called terrorism. It's also the case that all
*  research points overwhelmingly the direction of Hamas being an all-encompassing term for the
*  Israeli state, which goes far beyond competence and makes up a huge chunk of civilian populations,
*  making them legitimate targets. The likes of Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch,
*  and previous Israeli onslaughts against Gaza have made clear that is the case. We also have
*  not only multiple reports of field massacres and mass graves all over Gaza, but incidents such as
*  the IDF storming into a family's home, shooting dead the father as he waved a white flag, then
*  throwing a grenade into the kitchen, injuring the mother and a five-year-old's disabled son,
*  a fragment being inserted into his brain, and then her being shot dead in front of him and the other
*  kids. Or of little six-year-old Hind Rajab, six of her relatives in a car, three of them kids,
*  as they were attacked by the Israeli army, slaughtering most of them, her 15-year-old cousin
*  ringing the Palestine Red Crescent, begging for help, being shot dead on the call, Hind Rajab then
*  ringing, desperately scared of the dark, an ambulance being sent to her, coordinated with
*  the Israeli army, before they then blew it up, killing the two paramedics, before a few days
*  later the badly decomposed bodies of Hind and her relatives were later found. We've got doctors
*  reporting sniper shots of the heads of kids aged between five and eight, reports of Israeli
*  soldiers raping Palestinian women. In the latest example we have the video footage of an Israeli
*  soldier who admits he murdered an elderly Palestinian man who had his arms up in the air and
*  begged him to spare his life. All of the other soldiers in his unit are there on tape applauding
*  him for it, shaking his hand, giving him a pat on the shoulder and saying all the respect.
*  The claim the IDF has attempted to diminish the danger to civilians is atrocity denial.
*  All she does is attach some hand-wringing and comments about how complicated things are,
*  in an attempt to make us think the IDF are not engaged in one of the worst killing sprees of
*  our time. And when she talks about protecting those not involved, well given she's already
*  discussed the guilt of civilians in wanton disregard for the norms of warfare, she should
*  really make clear what she means by uninvolved. Let's just have one more final clip. Well first
*  of all let me say, and this is a caveat that I have to make absolutely clear, that unlike the
*  rest of the world who is watching us on the screens and moralizing from the armchair,
*  we are a battered nation right now. We are not only heartbroken, so heartbroken that sometimes
*  it's difficult to be heartbroken for the civilians on the enemy side. We are also
*  mind-boggled, shocked, humiliated. Very few Israelis will admit that but we might as well
*  say that we also feel humiliated. Terribly saddened and terribly scared with a sense of an
*  ongoing crisis, the worst in our history for sure, and an ongoing sense of tragic loss. I'm saying
*  that this not only in order, not in order, to play the victim's card. I don't believe in playing a
*  victim's card but I do believe that many of us have been truly victimized on the 7th of October
*  and of course the hostages are still suffering a horrible, horrible fate. I'm wearing like so many
*  Israelis do now, the bring them home token and our heart as it says is captive in Gaza. We are not
*  being totally rational now. I don't think that we are sitting here, most of us, apart perhaps from
*  a few very strong women and men, most of us are not weighing the moral options and necessities
*  in a totally rational way because we are deeply, deeply involved. Hurt, injured, surprised in a
*  negative way beyond the capacity of many people to take up complications, nuances,
*  to understand or to try to imagine the other side. Oh my word. Well firstly it's very important to
*  say Hamas and other armed groups committed grave war crimes on the 7th of October. I'm not someone
*  in denial about that fact, I've seen the evidence myself. That includes killing civilians both
*  deliberately and through reckless violence and that includes taking civilians hostages. I've always
*  been clear from the start this happened, there's no cause on earth which justifies war crimes
*  and they have to be condemned and a resulting hurt, which is completely understandable, has to
*  be understood. But the way this is phrased, we're moralising from our armchair. Well good professor,
*  you're not exactly carrying in the rubble of Gaza are you? When you say you're in a battered
*  nation right now, well from the video I can see the sky and Tel Aviv behind you, as far as I can
*  tell all its buildings are still standing, so if you're a battered nation right now, where does it
*  leave the ruins of Gaza? As for saying it's difficult to be heartbroken for civilians on
*  the other side or to be totally rational, I get it, she's trying to get us to be in the minds of
*  where Israelis are at the moment. But what? What does she want us to say at this point? Do something
*  about it, that's not an excuse. You can't keep saying this after this level of mass slaughter,
*  after 155 days of this, well it's very hard for us to care about something being inflicted on
*  another people. That's only true if you don't actually have humanity. That's what's been
*  admitted to her under the guise of trauma. We lack empathy and humanity, we don't even have any.
*  That's not good enough, because those sentiments are running through the veins quite clearly of
*  Israeli soldiers as they rampage around Gaza murdering innocent people and those are crimes.
*  Do you not think people who committed terrible crimes in the past felt exactly the same as this?
*  It's not new, it's not unique. Do you not think the Hutu extremists who slaughtered the Tutsis
*  in the Rwandan genocide didn't feel genuine fury about the atrocities that were committed by the
*  Tutsi rebels of the Rwandan patriotic front? Do you think that the Bosnian Serbs who committed
*  unspeakable horrors against Bosniaks didn't feel genuine anger and disgust and fury about the
*  atrocities that were committed against Bosnian Serb civilians in the Bosnian war, given seven
*  and a half thousand Bosnian Serb civilians are believed to be killed? Many more, I would note,
*  in absolute and proportionate numbers than Israeli civilians who were killed on the 7th of October,
*  as bad and horrible as 7th of October was. Was that an excuse? It certainly wasn't in the war
*  crimes tribunal when they were in the dock because believe you me that was their defence.
*  It's not new or unique, you know, that feeling. It's actually at the root of most of the worst
*  atrocities in human history. You stop seeing yourself as a fellow human in terms of the
*  atrocities that are committed. What you get angry about and upset about are horrors committed
*  against those you define as your own tribe. That's what happens and that's how your humanity is
*  rotted away. That's what happens. If you only focus on the pain and suffering of people you've
*  defined as your own, then you end up in a place where you can be very easily manipulated to support
*  horror being inflicted against other people because you're not counting them. You're not
*  counting their suffering, are you? That's the problem. That's what we can now see being
*  acted out against the people of Gaza who's then murdered in the tens of thousands.
*  Now the Israeli hostages must be released, he refers to them. So too must Palestinian hostages.
*  As the incredibly brave Israeli journalist Gideon Levy points out, thousands of Palestinians
*  detained in the West Bank alone, often without any charge, including children who according to
*  the charity Save the Children are sexually abused in custody. Nowhere in anything, I would note,
*  Fania Oz-Selsberg says is even any sense of context of the mass ethnic cleansing of
*  Palestinians beginning in 1948, the longest belligerent occupation in modern times,
*  of what Gaza was subjected to before this, the longest siege in modern history,
*  or what is defined as apartheid by multiple human rights organizations, including Israel itself,
*  let alone atrocities specifically against Palestinians, including thousands killed by
*  the Israeli state before 7th of October. With 248 Palestinians killed in the West Bank before 7th
*  October last year alone, 40 of them kids. That was more children than those killed on 7th of October.
*  And the 36 Israeli kids killed on the 7th of October, we should all agree, was a terrible
*  crime. Where does it leave 14,000 Palestinian kids? After the interview she posted, I've gained some
*  notoriety among Western Hamas fans. One of them just called me a herselite freak and I think it's
*  a wonderful epithet, she's referring there to the founder of modern Zionism. Fanatics you see,
*  don't hate the other side's fanatics, half as much as they hate and fear the moderates.
*  I'd love to know again who she means by Western Hamas fans, given defenders of the Israeli onslaught,
*  I can see just how liberal they are with the use of the word Hamas supporters. Does she mean
*  people who oppose the mass slaughter of Palestinians is what I'd be interested to find out. Does she
*  think I'm a Western Hamas fan as a gay secular socialist who thinks Hamas has committed serious
*  and grave war crimes? Let's do a test here in terms of what she says there, because I know what
*  she's doing, it's very obvious. When she says fanatics don't hate the other side's fanatics,
*  half as much as they hate and fear the moderates. If someone did an interview in which they
*  supported Hamas but presented them as a moderate, humane, compassionate person, as they supported
*  the 7th of October, but then said they'd applaud violence against Israeli civilians and claimed
*  Hamas actually did all it could to protect civilians, they don't always get it right though,
*  and pointed to Hamas revising their charter in 2017 to accept a two-state solution and using that
*  as evidence to present themselves and Hamas as moderates, what would she say? I'm interested.
*  Would she go, well at least they're more moderate than someone who says death to Israel,
*  we should extend the hand of friendship to them, genuine moderates. Or would she say actually
*  that's pretty dangerous and insidious stuff there. They're whitewashing Hamas and trying to
*  convince global people that they are something they're not, and would she therefore regard them
*  as more dangerous than that more militant version? Hardcore apologists of Israel's onslaught think
*  people actually like Fania Oz-Solsberg incredibly important and useful. How do I know that? Because
*  Elon Levy, who spends a huge amount of time, well his career isn't it now, is justifying Israel's
*  murderous onslaught, justifying war crimes. Now he came to her defence after I criticised the
*  interview, much to her delight. It gets worse. She then quote-treated her interview with,
*  I've stood up and said my truth, now where is the Palestinian, at least the pro-Palestinian,
*  willing to meet me halfway in mutual respect and future orientation? To be honest Fania,
*  they're pretty busy right now, being bombed and shot and starved to death by your state in a
*  military onslaught whose human impact you think is terribly unfortunate but which you support
*  What do you think they have to say to you honestly? What do you think the parents of the
*  thousands of Palestinian kids who have been slaughtered, that's the parents who've survived,
*  what do you think they have to say to you if they have the time given most of their time is
*  focused on survival right now? Do you think they should be grateful that you dress up support for
*  mass slaughter in humanitarian and compassionate garbs? Seriously? Let me just quote someone else.
*  I realise that our job is to give all sides an equal hearing but in cases of genocide you can't
*  just be neutral, you can't say well this little boy was shot in the head and killed and besieged
*  Sarajevo and that guy over there did it but maybe he was upset because he argued with his wife,
*  no there was no equality and we had to tell the truth. Who said that? Christiane Amampour,
*  the presenter in that interview speaking about the horror of Bosnia, she was absolutely right then.
*  The rate of killing of civilians in Gaza is much worse than it was in Bosnia and that's not to
*  belittle the horror of Bosnia because it was horrific, it's to emphasise the horror of Gaza.
