# This Gazan Christian's Story Will Shock You - w. Khalil Sayegh
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSfq9za7BqI)
*  What I've tried to do since this horror began six months ago now is to try and elevate the voices
*  that I think we desperately need to hear. And I'm really proud, given that, to be joined by a really
*  fascinating and insightful guest today, who's Khalil Sayek, who is a Palestinian from Gaza.
*  He's a Christian. There is a very small, embattled Christian minority in Gaza, and we'll talk about
*  that, though I know having spoken to you, you obviously, above all else, see yourself as a
*  Palestinian, it's important that we talk about that as well in the course of the discussion.
*  But has had a really fascinating kind of trajectory, I suppose, having gone to Bethlehem
*  in the West Bank, and now is in the United States, has worked with, we'll talk about this, some kind
*  of Christian pro-Israel groups and the impact that's had on you, and I suppose your political
*  journey. Your family are, at the moment, of course, in Gaza, and I should say that your father
*  obviously died in the course of this horror, so we'll talk about that. So given the huge trauma
*  that you and obviously so many other Palestinians are going through right now, it's a big honour to
*  be joined by you, so thank you so much. Thank you, Alan. I'm really an honour to be with you.
*  Can you just tell me a bit about your upbringing, where in Gaza you were born, and I suppose you
*  all just experienced growing up when, at the time, the IDF was still in military occupation of Gaza,
*  and this was before the rise of Hamas, so do you want to tell me just about your kind of earlier
*  years? Sure, yeah, so I was born to a middle-class family in the Gaza City, and particularly in the
*  west of Gaza, I mean, those of you who were following the news, the west of Gaza was the
*  part of the Gaza Strip that was bombarded the most in this world. It was actually the place where it
*  started, you know, when you hear about Shifa Hospital, when you hear about Rimal neighborhood,
*  all of that is within the west of Gaza, that's where I grew up, but I was also born to a family
*  that are considered our refugee, a family that our grandparents have experienced the ethnic cleansing
*  of 1948, and living in Gaza, in that context, you inherit a lot of trauma, and you inherit a lot of
*  greedinesses and certain feelings that you have about the situation in the context that you were
*  born into. When the Israelis were still in Gaza, I do remember very vividly that it impacted our
*  life in all sort of ways, I mean, we're talking about few thousand settlers that were in Gaza,
*  yet to protect them, there have been hundreds of, I mean, maybe hundreds, I mean, maybe tens of
*  thousands of soldiers in Gaza who really made our life very, very hard and very difficult. I mean,
*  one of the early memories I had of the Israeli occupation in Gaza is that my teachers at UNRWA
*  schools wouldn't be able to come from the southern part of the Gaza Strip to the schools, and thus
*  the classes would be canceled. Why? Because the Israeli occupation has closed the checkpoints.
*  Sometimes people will have to take five or six hours to move from the south part of the Gaza Strip
*  to Gaza City, so it really, really had impacted our life in all sort of ways. But my first
*  interaction, or first memory of the Israeli occupation in Gaza was in the second Intifada,
*  when the Israeli helicopters and air forces bombarded Gaza, and particularly bombarded the
*  presidential residence of former president Kisar Arafat.
*  Can you tell just about that? Because obviously, I mean, I think a lot. I spoke yesterday to a
*  brilliant James Elder, spokesperson for UNICEF in Rafa. It's difficult to process the trauma
*  now, children growing up in Gaza, the impact, what they're going through, it's just so unimaginable.
*  But so many young Palestinians have grown up with so many, you know, obviously not on a scale
*  anywhere near the scale today, but still horrific. I mean, just the impact of being a child and
*  growing up with being bombarded from the air, you know, these sorts of horrors, which for many
*  people who live in the global north, actually is quite hard to imagine, I think. But as a child,
*  can you just tell me the kind of the impact? You know, the first time you're shocked, and you're
*  scared, and you're traumatized, and you run to your parents asking them what is happening,
*  and your body is literally shaking. You wonder who is this enemy that's trying to kill us.
*  The second time, perhaps the same thing happened. And the third time, at least in my experience,
*  it became so normalized that you think of yourself as some sort of superhero, right? So
*  this part of the national collective self-understanding of resilience that even
*  our children can stand in front of the Air Force bombardments, etc. And you start feeling that
*  instead of running away from the Air Force bombardments, we would run toward it to see
*  what's happening. And I remember myself as a child running toward the places where Israel would
*  assassinate people at that time. They would use to target cars, in particular, it was against, you
*  know, a Fatah member, Hamas members, or other to assassinate them in car. And I remember as a child,
*  I would run to see what's happening there. So for so long, I thought I'm not traumatized. I don't have
*  any really trauma or things that we perceive there as weakness. But then it took me years to
*  realize that, no, I'm traumatized. And I'm very, very traumatized. And I have a very deep fear. And
*  that's not weakness to acknowledge. I remember that when I traveled out of Gaza for the first time,
*  I mean, when I came here to the US, the first time I heard a helicopter, I was really, really,
*  terrified because what my body starts shaking, and I start just remembering all these memories of
*  the helicopter, start getting Gaza, I don't live far from the airport here in Washington, DC. And
*  every time I hear a fly, until now, sometimes my body just act in a way that is very scared of the
*  bombardments. Like, am I about to die right now? And I have to remind myself that no, you're living
*  in Washington. There's no one to bomb you here. You're out of that major soon as there is a trauma
*  and there is really deep trauma. And I would say even maybe more for the people who lived after
*  the time that I left the Gaza Strip. I left Gaza in 2009, lived in Ramallah and Bethlehem for the
*  last 10 years, and then in 2001, I moved here to Washington. You took me just in terms of as a
*  Christian growing up in Gaza both before and obviously the rise of Hamas in the mid 2000s.
*  So growing up as a Christian, I mean, obviously in the very early years of your childhood,
*  you never really feel that you're different than anyone else. I mean, we look as the, we're from
*  the same race, the same ethnicity as our Muslims, brothers and sisters, we look the same. We have
*  the same national identity, same fly. We're very proud to be Palestinians. We see that our oppressor
*  and our enemy is the same. It's the state of Israel who oppressed us in 48, who are still
*  oppressing us right now. But then you start growing up and you start feeling that you're different.
*  I remember my first interaction to the different that of being a Palestinian Christian is going
*  to honor school and then realizing that people would sometimes even laugh at me or mock me or
*  make fun of my faith. And although I wasn't like a vocal Christian at the time, but like just from
*  my last name, I mean, not my last name, my middle name, which is my father name, Jerius,
*  who was actually named after the Saint of Palestine, Saint George, and they would just laugh and
*  and think that it's funny that there's such a thing as Christian because they don't understand.
*  And I would describe that experience. Usually it's a very similar to the experience of
*  minorities here in the south of the United States and a certain part of here. I mean, I met a lot of
*  Jewish people who grew up, let's say in Texas or Kentucky, and they had a very similar experience
*  during school or places where there are no really Jewish people. So it's a similar experience. But
*  then with the rise of Hamas in Gaza, there started all sorts of questions being asked by
*  Palestinian Christians. What does it mean to be a Palestinian Christian when you have an
*  illiberal Islamist regime in the rise? Hamas itself did not have an answer for what does it
*  mean to be a Palestinian distinctively from the Islamist framework, because it seemed that Hamas'
*  identity of what it means to be a Palestinian is connected to the relationship to Islam,
*  but they really defined what is our role. So we started asking ourselves, would Hamas now ask us
*  to be in a second class citizen sort of thing? Would they ask us to be Jizya as other Islamists
*  in the world have asked, et cetera. But we were actually surprised rather that Hamas has actually
*  provided protection for Christians, to churches, to other spaces. Now, although on a security level,
*  Hamas has protected the Christians and made sure that, for example, Salafist groups would
*  attack them, and Salafists have tried to attack Christians, and Hamas was the main protector of
*  Christians. On the other hand, the gradual Islamization of society that Hamas has produced
*  as it came there has made life harder for Palestinian Christians than any other groups there,
*  because all of a sudden the public square is becoming more Islamized, and it's not a very
*  welcoming space for Christians. But I would say not only for Christians, but also for secular
*  Muslims or people who don't want to adhere to our religion, the Islamization of society has
*  proven very challenging for those groups. You went to Bethlehem, weren't you, with
*  Manzreizek, who people may know. I've interviewed Manzreizek myself. He's a Palestinian Christian
*  theologian who did a sermon at Christmas, which went viral internationally, where he spoke out
*  against genocide in Gaza and condemned the silence of people who didn't speak out and how history
*  would consider them. Could you just tell me a bit about Bethlehem and the impact of that experience?
*  Sure, yeah. So after I moved to the West Bank, I became more religious. I had some moment of
*  coming to Jesus sort of thing, and I became more religious. I was always just Christian by name.
*  I was never adhered to any particular tradition of faith, and although my families are to those
*  Christian, I never really practiced Christianity. There in the West Bank, I became more religious,
*  and it was through a group of Protestant missionaries. And then I felt the call to go to
*  Bethlehem Public College and study theology, and that's where I met Manzreizek. He was the,
*  before he became the academic dean, actually, he was my professor. And I remember studying with him
*  first class was the book of Exodus, and we had to ask all sort of questions about, obviously,
*  the context of the book of Exodus and slavery and the Israelites, et cetera. But we had to also ask
*  questions about what does it mean in the Palestinian context? And I remember thinking of the text,
*  and that's a paper that I wrote at that time, of what does it mean to be oppressed as a group,
*  and then calling God to deliver you out of this oppression. Because for Palestinians, and I think
*  theologians like Manzreizek would say that they read in the Palestinian context that we are
*  oppressed, and they read themselves into the text too, of what's happening, sorry, of what
*  happened in the book of Exodus, such as calling God to deliver us out of oppression.
*  With, you moved then afterwards, didn't you, to the United States? Can you just explain,
*  when did you move to the US, and what was the debate, because you were there to do
*  postgraduate studies? Yeah, I lived in the West Bank for over 10 years, and obviously I did my
*  studies, I was working in the US as well. My first visit to the US was 2018, it was just a work trip
*  to speak at some churches, et cetera. I was really very involved in the Christian sort of Protestant
*  world at that time, and then I started thinking that I really don't want to be in the
*  world of theology. I didn't feel that I was pure enough to be a theologian, or to be a pastor,
*  or to be a man who would do religious duties, and I felt that I want to come to study political
*  science, so I came to American University here in Washington DC about three years ago.
*  I finished my studies, and then I got a job, I was working for a year, and my thinking was,
*  I would just work one year here, get some training, go back to the West Bank, and work in
*  the West Bank for a couple of years, maybe teach at university or something, come back, get a PhD.
*  I tried to go, and all of a sudden, I realized that Israel did not allow me to go back to the West
*  Bank. For 10 years, I lived in the West Bank, I established my entire life between Ramallah
*  and Bethlehem. I left Gaza thinking that just that's where I want to be, I don't want to leave
*  Palestine, but at the same time, I can't live in Gaza under the siege, and there are even Hamas's
*  authoritarian regime, etc. All of a sudden, the occupation did not allow me to go back to Gaza,
*  sorry, to go back to the West Bank. The only option I had is to go back to Gaza, which to me,
*  wasn't a starter, so I find myself going back to the U.S., and here I am seeking an asylum,
*  because I don't have a place to go back to, and have I went back even to Gaza, now we lost
*  everything. Toward the very beginning of this war, my family house was bombed, our family historical
*  jewellership in Gaza also was bombed, our churches were bombed in Gaza,
*  and part of the churches were bombed, so we've got nothing to go back to in Gaza.
*  Before, I mean, I'll obviously ask you about the horror that's been unleashed against Gaza. I mean,
*  one thing I should have asked as well before was about the siege of Gaza, which you just mentioned
*  there. Can you just tell us just what that was like growing up, well, living under that siege?
*  Sure, I mean, the siege has completely devastated Gaza, and devastated the economy of Gaza.
*  People start not even having, being able to make their daily life needs during, especially during
*  the peak of it, which was from 2007 to 2010, or at least the days that I was there.
*  Electricity will come out of the 24 hours of the day, one to six hours, and it could come while you
*  are asleep, actually. So you can imagine what does this mean in terms of having food and
*  the food during, at your home, or access to internet, TV, et cetera. It was really, really,
*  really difficult. There were all sorts of foods that were forbidden from coming from Gaza,
*  such as chocolate. Chocolate was considered something dangerous, apparently, for Israel.
*  You cannot have it in Gaza, et cetera. And this, I think, pushed also an alternative economy in Gaza.
*  So you're thinking that the Israelis were claiming that, oh, we are having that siege to
*  weakening Hamas. We want to punish Hamas. We're not really collectively punishing the Palestinians.
*  But that's false. That's completely false. It was to punish the Palestinian people collectively.
*  They were literally counting the calories of the Palestinian people. But not only that, Israel was
*  well aware that at the same time they are have siege in Gaza, Hamas have found a new venture,
*  which is they started building tunnels on the border with Egypt. And they start building all
*  these alternative economies that empowered more and more elites who are closer to Hamas. So yes,
*  you want to weakening Hamas. So what you ended up doing, you weakened all these middle class,
*  all those upper class who were relatively more secular, relatively more connected to the
*  Palestinian authority. And even some of them had partner businesses in Israel, et cetera. And you
*  empower these new businesses that are based on the tunnels, that are based on paying taxation to
*  Hamas. And they became the prominent new middle class and upper class in Gaza.
*  Can you explain why Israel banned you from going back to the West Bank?
*  So the life of the Palestinians in general is controlled by what's so called
*  regime permits. You need a permit to do anything. You need a permit to leave from the Gaza Strip
*  to visit the West Bank on Easter or Christmas if you are Christian. You need a permit to go and
*  pray in Al Aqsa Mosque if you are a Palestinian Muslim. And by the way, if you are from Gaza,
*  it's impossible for you to pray at Al Aqsa Mosque. If you are from the West Bank, maybe they'll give
*  you a permit. The permits are system to control your life and not only to control your life,
*  it's to control the demography of what is known as Israel and Palestine today.
*  So for the Palestinians who live in Gaza, you are not allowed to move to the West Bank.
*  But once they give you a permit for one week or two weeks, you can just go visit. And sometimes
*  you stay there. It's supposed to be like, you know, it's part of the Palestinian territories,
*  they're international, etc. It's the same state. So me, 2009, when I moved from Gaza to the West
*  Bank, I received what's so called Easter permit. It was an Easter of 2009. And I moved to the West
*  Bank on this two-week permit. Two weeks after I stayed there, actually, a law was passed by the
*  Israeli army that those who move from Gaza or have moved from Gaza to the West Bank are considered
*  illegal. So all of a sudden, I became illegal in the West Bank, in my own country. And the Israel
*  army would debark back anyone who lives in the West Bank with a Gaza ID. So for 10 years, I lived
*  in fear that the Israel army will send me back to Gaza. So I'll be scared even to go to villages
*  around Ramallah where I lived or to move between Bethlehem and Ramallah. However, 2018, I received
*  the permit for the first time. They call it, surely, a permit to Judea and Alexandria, which
*  is the West Bank of Israel. That's what the occupation call it. And it's a yearly permit
*  that is renewed. I thought that I'm safe once I have this permit. I would just always be able to
*  access the West Bank and live there. But you can imagine after 10 years, you just got this permit
*  after 10 years of living there. And then all of a sudden, I come to the US and they cancel my permit.
*  So I try to go back and they say, oh, well, you're from Gaza, go back to Gaza. But that's not
*  unprecedented. That's not about Khalil. That's how tens of thousands of Palestinians who are from
*  Gaza live in the West Bank. But take this, not only that, since October 7, there has been
*  thousands of Palestinians like myself from Gaza who live in the West Bank or had permit to access
*  to the West Bank who are now in jail for only the guilt of having an ID that says Gaza on the
*  address. People are being stopped at checkpoints today in the West Bank for having an ID of being
*  from Gaza and being tortured, being put in a specific jail where there is no food or no
*  water or no warm clothes to have. I mean, it's horrific. And I think just these are just facets
*  of the occupation, which I think people often aren't even aware of. And it's just so important
*  to discuss, obviously. I mean, in the US then, so you weren't able to access the West Bank for the
*  reasons you've explained, you ended up actually working and became involved with Christian
*  conservatives, who are obviously staunchly pro-Israel. I mean, just interesting, your
*  political journey, always fascinating with people's political journeys. But can you just
*  tell me about that and the impacts that had and kind of what it opened your eyes to, I suppose?
*  Sure. Yeah. So actually, it's fascinating because I worked for these groups before I came to the US,
*  actually. I was a contractor while in the West Bank, about around 2016 or so. I was like 21 years old.
*  And obviously, when I worked for these groups, I wasn't aware of all these views, their views.
*  I was approached by someone. He said, what you talk about in terms of Palestinian Christian
*  persecution, that sort of like, you know, liberalism, Hamas, Islamism, et cetera, is very
*  fascinating. I think there are very few people who are willing to talk about that. And we think you
*  pretty much should work with us on this. Now, obviously, I knew that they have a certain views
*  in Israel, but they said that's not the center of our life, et cetera. And we said, yeah, we can
*  work together as long as we think, as long as we talk about everyone who's causing troubles for the
*  Christians or religious minorities or the broader peace and stability in the region. Yeah, we would
*  work together. But it doesn't take me a long time, although I was not aware of American political
*  environment or the Western thoughts in general and Christian Zionism, et cetera. It didn't take me
*  a long time to realize that it's very clear that these people are not only interested about
*  amplifying Christian voices and the rights and the plight of Palestinian Christians and the broader
*  Christian minority in the middle, which is very real problem, by the way, that the idea that we're
*  facing an liberalism that's written or existing in the region is a very real problem. But it turns out
*  from my point of view that these people are not really interested in that as much as they are
*  interested in painting a certain orientalist view that only the only problem that exists in the
*  Middle East, the only problem that exists in that region is the persecution of Christians from
*  Muslims. But not only that, these groups are funded, not even some of them, not funded even by
*  Christians. They're funded by a particular Zionist businessman and entity. And the entire theme or the
*  goal of it is to distract from the role of the occupation that plays in that area and the role of
*  Western invasions and Western bad tours there. And I came to that realization, but at the same time
*  it was too late. It was too late in the sense that, oh, I'm already in it and I had to wait and
*  strategically think when is it the time to make a leave from the connection to these institutions.
*  But at the same time, I will be honest, I have interacted with a lot of people and those who are
*  not like the elites or the leaders of these institutions who are sincerely, sincerely trying
*  to do the right thing. They're not really coming out of racism or orientalism that want to do this.
*  They really believe they want to help Palestinian Christians. They really believe they want to
*  help the persecuted Christian in the region. However, they're being used by these elites who
*  are for a very particular ideological and financial reasons, pushing a certain agenda that harms the
*  Christians in the Middle East and harms also, I would argue, Western values and Western
*  interests in the region as well on the long term. So, I mean, for a while it felt, I mean,
*  they were kind of manipulating or trying to manipulate, for example, Christian Palestinians
*  to advance a particular cause in support. For sure. Yeah, for sure. And that's the issue.
*  The issue is within the light of polarization in the West, in the light of the polarization in the
*  West, a Palestinian Christian or a religious minority, let's say a Yazidi from Iraq even,
*  he has to be put between the two polarized groups in the US that neither of them is interested to
*  hear your story. And I will tell you, I was beaten up and thrown in jail twice by Hamas.
*  Once because I was more on the Fatih side and I was wearing a kofiya during Yasser
*  Al-Fatih Memorial in 2008. I was literally beaten up and thrown in jail as a 14-year-old in Gaza.
*  And that's a story that the left generally is not interested in hearing because how dare you,
*  you say that Hamas who are the resistance have any authoritarian dependency. On the other hand,
*  the right is happy to take that. They're very happy. Oh, well, you're saying about the Muslims
*  that they did such and such and that they persecute you also because you're Christian,
*  because I also had that. But then you say, but well, I was beaten up more than 15 times. And
*  that's true because I'm from Gaza more than 15 times. In the West Bank, I was taught because I am
*  from Gaza, I'm beaten up by Israeli soldiers for no reason, just because my ID say Gaza.
*  More than 15 times I was beaten up by them. That's not the story the right is interested to
*  hear, but the left is interested to hear. So you find yourself in the middle and stuck. No one from
*  these groups want to listen to you. And you end up, you have to make strategic choices sometimes on
*  who to be with. Obviously, once you grow up, you have more an academic career and you have more
*  accumulated knowledge, you find places where you can walk this fine line between the two polarized
*  schools. But in general, the unfortunate reality is that a Christian from Iraq or a Christian from
*  Palestine or generally the minorities in the region, they have a very, very, very tough
*  choices to make between the lying one or another part of their identity and experience.
*  Can I ask just obviously in terms of what's happened since 7th of October. So when 7th of
*  October happened, you must have known that a horror was going to be unleashed against Gaza
*  and your family were there. So you just taught me through that.
*  Absolutely. To start with, 7th of October did not surprise me personally. What have surprised me is
*  that the Palestinian violence respond to the Israel occupation on a part that have taken so long. By
*  no means this is a justification of everything that happened in October 7th. I obviously
*  terrified by some of the things that have taken place. The humanitarian international law was
*  broken and it's horrifying for me, a defender of Palestinian human rights. But the idea that the
*  Palestinians can be passive for so long where they are subject to such a violent and brutal occupation,
*  it's just, I don't know where it's coming from. It's an image or it's stupid. That's not human
*  nature works. Before October 7th, we already seen the most violent year in the Palestinian history
*  since the second of the father. More than 230 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank.
*  So actually I was speaking at an event two weeks before October 7th and I said,
*  there will be a bloodbath. There will come a point where things will change only because there will
*  be a huge break of violence and you guys will regret the Biden policy that assumes that you can
*  just ignore the Palestinians and go talk to the Saudis and to the others. So October 7th happened
*  and I also see, obviously was horrified by what I see and all the stories that came out about
*  civilians being killed, et cetera. But I was also more terrified because I knew what the response
*  on Gaza will be. I thought that this is it. Things will go bad. But I did not imagine it to go as
*  bad as it is right now, to be honest. I thought that at least the word can hold Israel to a certain
*  standard. Where do we enough? I did not expect that 33,000 people were killed. I did not expect
*  that all the hospitals of the northern part of Gaza will be destroyed. I did not expect that my
*  own father will pass away because of Israeli soldiers who were surrounding the church at that
*  time prevented him from going to a hospital or that ambulances would access that area. I did not
*  expect all these portilities. In a way, my entire belief in the system of international law,
*  international rights, sorry, international law, humanitarian law, et cetera, has been collapsing
*  since October 7 in the way the Israeli war, genocidal attack on Gaza has been conducted since
*  then. Just to begin, talk me through, a lot of people watching this now will be in their homes
*  and people obviously remember the homes in which they grew up. The house you grew up in is very
*  much a part of your own identity, it's part of your sense of self, even long after you've left.
*  When you found out about your house being destroyed, what went through your heads?
*  In terms of the claims, 70% or so, 70% of civilian infrastructure has been severely damaged or
*  destroyed. Gaza looks a different color and texture when looked at from satellites in space now.
*  Just the impact of knowing about your home and then how you fit that in with the claims now,
*  which are ludicrous to even say about these are targeted attacks and if homes are blown up like
*  your own, it's because of, for example, human shields. Yeah, there's two things here. I mean,
*  in an emotional and personal level, I felt completely hopeless. The fact that my mom
*  calls me crying that our home has been bombed and that they are in this, sorry, that they are in the
*  street and have no place, it shattered my heart. It was very hard for me to hear and also it restored
*  all these memories that they used to hear from my grandpa. In 48, when my grandparents were forced
*  to leave the city of Majda within historical Palestine, today there is an Israeli city that
*  is there called Ashkelon. I do remember my grandpa and how he felt and how he spoke always about how
*  much property had on there, how much land, how much two gold drops that he had on the Majda one
*  and Ramli. It felt the very same to me. It was the first time I feel what does it mean to lose your
*  home in the literal sense. I always knew about the homeland but to lose the home, the place where your
*  parents and your brothers and sisters will go in and sleep there in a Palestinian culture and also
*  like generally the Arab cultures in that area, a home is a place where collectively you come together
*  and you build it over years. You invest money above money. Sometimes it's like a hundred times
*  of your income to put it in one home so you don't have to be rented that you feel pleased that you
*  will be saving. All of this was shattered on that level. Now on the question about human shields,
*  etc., obviously this is ridiculous. The bombardment was in this commit. In the case of my family,
*  my family actually by chance or by a miracle they survived the bombardments of our home because
*  the home next to ours have received an evacuation order. My parents said okay we'll go to the street
*  stand for a few seconds so until they bomb the house next to us. So they went to the street,
*  they bombed the house next to them and like less than one minute after they bombed our home as well.
*  So my family could have even not left the home and they could have been dead right now. It's by
*  miracle that them and their neighbors have lived up there. So it's completely ridiculous that it's
*  targeted and also the Israelis themselves after that they've said that we are targeting what's
*  called our targets. That we will just like an AI would generate targets and they will just bomb
*  them without any reasons or justification militarily to bomb these places. Can you tell
*  me just a bit about your dad because I mean you know losing your father in those circumstances
*  is horrible and also you know it speaks to just how terrible the death toll may well end up being
*  as horrific as it already is in that there are the violent killings, people who are killed by
*  bombs and by bullets and we don't know exactly what that number is because so many are buried
*  under rubble and classified as missing and so the official death toll was actually an underestimate
*  obviously rather than an overstatement which is how obviously Israel's defenders have tried to
*  claim it. But then there were those who die who wouldn't have died were it not for what's happened
*  and you know it's a clinical term that we call it excess deaths obviously for those I'm sure people
*  listening might have heard that term. Which is you know there are projections of you know by August
*  120,000 Palestinians according to one academic study could be killed in Gaza and that includes
*  people through violent means but also people who don't get medical attention who need medical
*  attention. So can you tell obviously about your dad and you know seems a very traumatic thing for
*  you to go through so bearing that mind as I ask you? Sure yeah I mean obviously to lose a father
*  is a really difficult thing and to lose him in this situation and you cannot be able to go visit
*  him or visit his grave or even go to the burial and to the even the divine liturgy that we do
*  in the Orthodox Church is very very difficult for me. I just like can't express how how hard this
*  has been on me I mean my father have lived through a lot he was born in the 50s he lived
*  through the 67 war I remember my father telling me a story of the first time he decided to study
*  Hebrew and understand Hebrew actually and it was because the Israeli soldiers have arrested him from
*  the streets in Gaza for no reason and they beat him up and he was listening to them talking things
*  in Hebrew and he took a decision himself that I would go and work hard to understand their language
*  and I will understand what the hell they're talking about but despite all of that my dad was
*  all about actually living in peace with everyone and about justice about freedom for everyone and
*  he never ever told me that we have to fight we have to like you know that there is no room to
*  live with the other but he always said that there is a solution and can be achieved with a two state
*  solution or another but that we should live together in peace but for his life to end in this way
*  it's a really really a tragic and I would say even it symbolizes the tragedy of what is
*  the life of Palestinians even those who support peace and support who exist and would look like
*  he died as he had a heart attack or panic attack two days after the Israeli snipers has claimed
*  the life of two Christian women at the Catholic church where he was staying and also have shot
*  in the lower bodies eight people who tried to save these two women the tragedy that we don't
*  even know if it was a heart attack or panic attack because he was not able to access a medical center
*  he was not able to access hospital why two reasons the first is that Israel at that time has
*  devastated all the health care system in Gaza from an Ma'am Adani hospital to the Shifa except
*  they were all shut down second reason is because Haia Zaytoun neighborhood where they were where
*  the churches were surrounded by Israeli tanks and no ambulances were allowed to access there
*  and the sad part is that perhaps my father's story is perhaps my father is lucky enough that I am
*  out there and I'm speaking in English I'm telling more but I can only imagine I can only imagine
*  how many people don't have a son who speak English and he's outside and whose story is not
*  never heard to the world I can imagine how tens or even hundreds died of medical neglect because
*  the Israeli army have decided not to allow ambulances and because the Israeli army have
*  decided to destroy hospitals and we've seen today the pictures of Shifa hospital how it's
*  completely devastated and it's a really really difficult and horrific situation and it's really
*  shameful that our world has turned a blind eye to this strategist I mean you know I've been thinking
*  about this a lot this normalization of actually extreme atrocities and war crimes because
*  you'd have thought before the genocide law against Gaza there might have been a consensus
*  over the destruction of a entire territory's medical system and you know I remember our
*  chief of hospital towards the beginning there was this dispute about whether or not it had been
*  bombed by a misfire is that a jihad rocket and a or an Israeli missile and the point there is the
*  reason there was so much controversy over that and this is back in October was that it was
*  understood that bombing a hospital is one of the worst possible things that you can do
*  and even if as the argument would be and obviously we saw with our chief repeated claims that it was
*  being used I mean the idea is claimed it was the main headquarters of Hamas and the idea was that
*  it was the main headquarters of Hamas that's what they actually tweeted out
*  no evidence was ever provided the Washington Post did a detailed rebuttal actually of the claims
*  and yet not only was subsequent to that controversy over one bombing with our chief hospital
*  and after that the entire healthcare system has been destroyed I mean that Gaza no longer has a
*  healthcare system our chief hospital is is rubble there's been a mass slaughter of patients and
*  also doctors and nurses throughout Gaza and it just seems it's this normalization isn't it it's
*  of things which before there was an agreement that attacking one hospital and even if it was used
*  even if you could produce evidence it was being used for military means any attack has to be
*  under international law proportionate to a military aim but all hospitals being attacked I mean how
*  just watching that I mean you know what goes through your head I suppose just that we
*  where you've grown up a healthcare system has been destroyed and now we've normalized the idea that
*  you can just wipe out a healthcare system entire hospitals and without the whole world screaming
*  an outrage I think I think yeah I mean obviously the first to blame is Israel for these actions
*  but the second to blame in the US and the western backers I mean the fact that they couldn't
*  say a word about the fact that Biden and even spokesperson of state department repeatedly
*  this is real propaganda of central command of Hamas etc even when there were evidence it's
*  just disgusting I mean they're there to blame I think in the same way is to blame Israel but
*  as you say that I mean let's assume even let's assume for the sake of the argument that there
*  were Hamas members in this in this hospital let's say one or two or three that they were there
*  the international humanitarian law is very very very clear you cannot target place even if there
*  are military people there even if they're militants there you can target it or count it as a military
*  target only under one condition that is being used to target military to sorry it's being used
*  as a military active military base meaning that you have to actually fire from the hospital or
*  fire rockets from there and there is there is a reason why all this international humanitarian
*  law was developed because we are progressing toward a better world we are progressing supposedly to
*  a what's so called a civilized world this is the civilized world that they've been telling us about
*  it there is this whole notion that there is a civilized and against uncivilized but I am
*  afraid to say that what's so called a civilization what's so called a civilization as it portrayed
*  itself in Gaza is a mockery of a civilization it's nothing but barbarianism as far as I'm
*  concerned I do not think that a civilized world can watch and not only watch but defend and go
*  their speakers and the spokesperson to talk to us about how this is used by by Hamas's commands
*  etc when there is no evidence whatsoever it's really really shameful I mean at that point just
*  I mean the West's moral authority for much of the world was treated with a great deal of cynicism
*  given the history of western colonialism and the impact of western colonialism but nonetheless you
*  know moral power is kind of one of the underpinnings of western hegemony the kind of moral claims it's
*  made when you see the I mean if we look at Gaza the total devastation of civilian infrastructure
*  the destruction of the hospital system which imposes in itself a death sentence on vast
*  numbers of people and you mentioned obviously what the horrible that you know what happens
*  to your father there are lots of people in Gaza with cancer there are people with heart problems
*  there are pregnant women there is no longer a functioning healthcare system that will impose
*  a death sentence every single day on vast numbers of people you can't have a modern society with a
*  healthcare system it doesn't work and that alone will kill vast numbers of people for a very very
*  long time famine you know we just we could go on you know the fastest collapse in nutritional
*  status of a population in recorded history I just you look at that and say what is the legacy in
*  terms of western power and what's actually going you know what's in terms of the palatines of Gaza
*  and but beyond the impact of you know these things cannot be unseen and unlearned this is a big
*  educational moment for people in the worst possible way and what impact do you think that's
*  going to have I think the impact that's going to happen is an impact that we already have been
*  seeing in the middle east but it would even double and triple that is the disillusion of
*  with international law the disillusion with western values democracy etc there has been so
*  long for so long all sorts of movements in the middle east that rejects these notions rightfully
*  for seeing the hypocrisy in Israel in Israel and Palestine for seeing the hypocrisy of what
*  happened in the second intifada for seeing the hypocrisy of what happened even in the
*  iraq invasion in the region in other words as well there is a very clear hypocrisy that you look and
*  you see it and for people who tend to be more liberals like myself people who still believe
*  in the ideas of democracy individual liberty etc we used to be looked at and mocked and I would
*  always defend and say well yes there are all these problems but perhaps this is better than the
*  alternative look at russia this is better than russia look at china this is better than china
*  I am afraid to say at this moment that people like myself look like fools but yes perhaps we
*  were wrong perhaps everything that we believed about international human rights and international
*  human rights law perhaps the international law and the western powers government values perhaps
*  they're all fake they're not really applicable they don't really apply for people who look like
*  and this is really a problem because this will have ramification for the future there will be
*  all sort of movements that reject these notions completely there will be all sort of movements
*  who adopt violence because explain to me why why shall an average kid in Gaza
*  who witnessed his family being slaughtered in front of his eyes why shall he not grow wanting
*  to fight back and carry out guns but not only that look at as far as even the public opinion in
*  Tunisia after the invasion of Gaza and the genocidal attack in Gaza how it changed it used
*  to be and this is this is fun because the Arab barometer was doing this survey one day before
*  October 7 and then it's by chance and these the best kind of polls when when when something happens
*  by chance and you see the changes it used to be the Palestinian question and in relationship to
*  the relationship with America and their views of America quite positive of their view in America
*  just after the attack in Gaza we've seen like you know decrease in a way that is dramatic on
*  how they look in America and the reason why as the report shows it's because the attack on Gaza
*  so imagine how much people around this region will hate America will not like America and then you
*  know the Americans and the westerns will be crying oh they hate us just because who we are well no
*  we don't hate you because who you are people don't hate you because who you are people hate you
*  because your your political system has failed to produce the values that you claim to promote
*  in that region and I am afraid that that these things will continue as long as these really
*  corrupt political actors continue to draft to to to drag not only the Palestinians and the people
*  of the region but also they're dragging the American people their British people themselves
*  to a place where no one likes. Before I ask my final question about the future
*  in terms of just in terms of where generally is there any hope before I ask you that
*  in terms of the Christians of Gaza who have lived there for nearly as long as the entire Christian
*  religion has existed what do you see the future in terms of or the fate of the Christians of
*  Gaza what for your family and and and for their co-believers? I wrote an article for the New
*  Arabons where I said basically that's the first time since uh 2000 years where Gaza actually
*  faced a danger of uh extension for uh uh the Christians there for the first time I think
*  that it is very very plausible that there will be no Christians left after this war about three
*  percent of the Christians in Gaza have been killed by the Israeli attacks about three percent
*  we don't know how much injured probably more than three percent about four percent of the Christians
*  in Gaza who managed to be on the borders have already been able to left to leave and almost
*  everyone everyone who I talked to at the Catholic Church at the Orthodox Church in Gaza are saying
*  we want to leave the Gaza Strip as soon as we can whether during the war or after the war why
*  because even if the war stops tomorrow the conditions that Israel has created on the ground
*  does not allow people to continue to live there the collapse of the healthcare system the collapse
*  of the education system there are no functioning universities in Gaza anymore why would anyone want
*  to live in such a devastated city so that's that's the very uh sad thing is that I think that the
*  future of Palestinian Christians in Gaza is quite dark
*  I mean many will listen to all of us and think what hope is there what possible hope and I suppose
*  you know in terms of any a possible solution based on on on peace and justice and equality where
*  the land is shared by all those who live there on that basis or what possible hope do you see
*  the truth is I don't see hope in the near future I I do think that I've always thought that the
*  two-state solution is the only possible solution not because it's the most it's actually unjust it
*  means that we have to compromise as Palestinians on 78 percent of our land etc but I thought it's
*  the most possible it does not take a lot from Israel actually it's actually even saves Israel
*  some money to withdraw to the 67 border and it doesn't take a lot from from the Palestinians to
*  to also like make certain compromises on that however I do think that if this war if we emerge
*  out of this war without two-state solution I do think that the two-state solution is already dead
*  and there wouldn't be a two-state solution but here is the thing I do not think even
*  that what the Americans are calling right now a pathway to two-state solution will lead us to
*  anywhere we've had a lot of pathways Oslo was a pathway other deals that were proposed in Camp
*  David etc were a pathway we either need a two-state solution now like right now right away at a
*  recognition of a Palestinian state etc or I think there would not be a two-state solution and the
*  alternative to that will have to be a one-state solution however unlike other optimistic analysts
*  and thinkers who are thinking that the two-state solution will come through just peace and love
*  and solidarity with each other I do not think that if the two-state solution dies that the
*  alternative will be one-state solution through you know some sort of common solidarity between
*  people no it will be it will come through a lot a lot of blood and a lot of violence because here
*  is the thing there is one group that is dominant over the other and has all the power that these
*  are Israeli Jews there's one group that is really really weak and does not have any power and those
*  are the Palestinians and the dominant group does not seem to signal anything or any sign that they
*  are willing to give up power and I'm afraid that this put us in an inevitable situation where we
*  need a lot of violence and a lot of blood to produce a new sort of imagined ability to to be
*  able to build that that ability that's how unfortunately world history teaches and it looks
*  it looks very dark unless obviously the western power really put pressure in Israel to establish
*  two-state solution tomorrow but unfortunately I don't see them doing this well it's a side
*  being placed to end but the reality is what the reality is and it's really important that we have
*  these difficult conversations and Khalil honestly it's such an honour to speak to you you've it's
*  you know many of us again we've listened to so many Palestinian voices we've we've we've seen all
*  these horrors and yet it still I mean it becomes quite difficult for us to process the level of
*  trauma that you and other others have gone through and you've spoken so eloquently and movingly and
*  with so much insight about the plight of the Palestinian people and about your family your
*  community and Gaza and beyond and so we're really really grateful do make sure Khalil's voice is
*  heard do share this video press like subscribe and because honestly it was a it was a big big
*  honour so thanks Khalil thanks so much thank you and I really appreciate you having me
