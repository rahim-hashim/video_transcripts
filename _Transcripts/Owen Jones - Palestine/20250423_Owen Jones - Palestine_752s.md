# Israel Lies COMPLETELY IMPLODE:
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0)
*  Israel's latest pack of lies has now been so comprehensively destroyed, dismantled, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=0.0s)]
*  that any media organization which takes seriously still Israeli claims are somehow credible, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=7.12s)]
*  is simply outright complicit in becoming part of Israel's propaganda machine. Now, honestly, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  just wait till we go through this. The excuse now being given by Israel for the despicable [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  outrage which was the mass slaughter of 15 Red Crescent medics and first responders is frankly [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=29.12s)]
*  ludicrous even by the standards of that state's authorities. Now, this massacre of those medics [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=36.4s)]
*  and rescue workers in Raffa is something I've talked about a lot, but it is important and these [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=42.96s)]
*  additional developments need to be discussed. Israel released the findings of a farcical inquiry [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  conducted by the so-called Israel Defense Forces and they have claimed that a systematic massacre [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=53.28s)]
*  of these unarmed medics and clearly marked ambulances and emergency vehicles executed [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=58.48s)]
*  one after the other was, and let's quote this, caused by professional failures. Well, we'll come [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=63.279999999999994s)]
*  on to this absurdity, but even after Israel's multiple egregious lies about this atrocity have [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=70.72s)]
*  been taken apart, after so many exposés of Israeli lies, Western media outlets are still [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  treating Israeli claims as somehow credible. The BBC headline was, and I quote, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=80.24s)]
*  operational misunderstanding led to killing of Gaza medics IDF inquiry says. That was then changed [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=85.28s)]
*  to professional failures led to killing Gaza medics IDF inquiry says. If the Russian army had [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=90.16s)]
*  just conducted this heinous atrocity, systematically massacring Ukrainian paramedics and first [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=95.12s)]
*  responders and overwhelming evidence including actual video footage showed it was a pack of lies, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=101.12s)]
*  would the BBC offer this sort of credence to a report? Would they splash with operational [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=107.36s)]
*  misunderstanding led to killing of Ukraine medics? Russian army inquiry says. Let's not [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=112.56s)]
*  insult anyone's intelligence by even indulging this proposition. Now, before we talk about this [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=117.52s)]
*  report, Sky News have done a detailed expose of Israeli claims, which is very important and very [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=123.68s)]
*  commendable. Please do hold off before you celebrate the Western media as courageous truth tellers, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=129.68s)]
*  for reasons I will explain. Even before this expose, Israel's claims had fallen apart, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=134.96s)]
*  for example, claiming the medics vehicles did not have emergency flashing signals before Israeli [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=140.48s)]
*  troops fired on them. A lie which was then destroyed by footage extracted from the mobile phone [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=146.32s)]
*  of one of the victims, 24 year old paramedic Rifat Radwan, which showed emergency signals flashing [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=152.0s)]
*  before him and his colleagues were ambushed and shot at with no provocation of any description. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=158.39999999999998s)]
*  The Sky News headline is Two Hours of Terror. Sky News investigation reveals how Israel's deadly [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=164.88s)]
*  attack on aid workers unfolded about an atrocity which was perpetrated in the early hours of the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=170.16s)]
*  23rd of March. The report details how a mass grave of unarmed paramedics and first responders [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=175.04s)]
*  alongside the crushed remains of ambulances and a fire engine was uncovered. Sky News used visual [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=180.32s)]
*  evidence, satellite imagery, audio analysis and interviews with key witnesses concluding, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=186.24s)]
*  our findings contradict not only Israel's initial account of the attack, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=191.44s)]
*  but its subsequent accounts as well. Now Rifat and his colleagues were sent to try and locate [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=195.52s)]
*  an ambulance they'd lost contact with. The last conversation is reported and it is chilling. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=201.12s)]
*  Rifat tells his colleague Asad, I feel like I'm suffocating, while Asad says there is no answer [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=206.48s)]
*  on the missing crews mobile phones. We've lost so many and now we're losing more crews, Rifat says. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=211.76s)]
*  Now to lose a team of medics, we will be left with no one. They actually drive past the ambulance [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=217.2s)]
*  by accident they're looking for and Sky News notes there were no roadblocks, checkpoints, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=222.8s)]
*  indeed any other evidence that this area was a combat zone. They then spot another ambulance [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=227.68s)]
*  which is going in the other direction containing their colleague Saleh who states the ambulance [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=233.04s)]
*  is behind them noting, I myself saw the leg of one of them under the ambulance. They then U-turn [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=238.32s)]
*  and Saleh calls for backup. Asad actually tells Rifat to put away his camera, thankfully Rifat [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=245.36s)]
*  says these moments need to be documented. They are then overtaken by a fire engine belonging to the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=250.48000000000002s)]
*  Civil Defence which is an emergency and rescue department. A few minutes later they stumble on [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=256.40000000000003s)]
*  the ambulance with Rifat exclaiming, oh lord I hope they're ok, but they appear to believe initially [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  this is an accident. All of a sudden you hear bullets which go on for five and a half minutes, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=266.0s)]
*  Sky notes unarmed medics while Rifat recites the Shahada, a statement of faith many Muslims recite [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=271.04s)]
*  when they believe they're about to die, while adding mum please forgive me, this is the path I [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=277.68s)]
*  chose to help people. You then hear a voice in Hebrew yell get up before the recording suddenly [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=281.84s)]
*  stops. Sky News got hold of new audio finding that the shooting didn't end there, a 99 second [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=287.12s)]
*  phone call between the Red Crescent dispatch centre and another of the paramedics Ashraf [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=292.24s)]
*  who was killed. Sky News have established the audio is in a different location to that of Rifat [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=296.32s)]
*  and again you can hear Ashraf reciting the Shahada in the midst of heavy gunfire. After a moment [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=301.44s)]
*  in which the shooting abruptly stops he's heard saying there's soldiers and soldiers the armies [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=307.76s)]
*  are location. At the end you hear yelling in Hebrew so clearly Israeli soldiers specifically [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=312.08s)]
*  saying come multiple times. The Red Crescent also got in touch with another paramedic 37 minutes [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=317.28s)]
*  later named Saleh Mouama in which he reports being injured amidst heavy gunfire. The Red Crescent [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=322.24s)]
*  then got hold of yet another paramedic Asad al-Nasr who was described as scared and talking about his [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=328.16s)]
*  children. Then at 7am, two hours after the attack began, the Red Crescent heard him being arrested, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=334.08s)]
*  25 minutes later heard the soldiers ordering him to empty his pockets. Sky News note it took [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=339.04s)]
*  three weeks for Israel to confirm he was being held in detention, an example of forced disappearance [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=343.76s)]
*  which is a war crime. Sky News state there's no evidence he's a Hamas member and find photographs [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=348.24s)]
*  of him wearing his Red Crescent uniform going back 16 years. We should note countless medics have been [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=353.52s)]
*  arrested, tortured and indeed killed in detention by the Israeli army who have nothing to do with [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=359.68s)]
*  Hamas or indeed any other Palestinian militant groups. These are hostages. An unnamed UN employee [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=365.12s)]
*  was also found in the mass grave with the UN official stating with no reason to believe he's [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=370.88s)]
*  doing anything aside from his job. Sky News assess seven key Israeli claims. The first, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=374.96s)]
*  the vehicles had their lights off, the footage shows this as a lie. Israeli claim number two, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=380.96s)]
*  the vehicles didn't have the requisite permission to travel in a combat zone, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=385.35999999999996s)]
*  but the area wasn't declared a combat zone for four and a half hours after the attack, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=388.71999999999997s)]
*  no coordination necessary. Third, Israel claimed Israeli troops didn't fire from a close distance. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=393.52s)]
*  Sky News did expert analysis of the audio and found that some of the shots were fired [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=400.88000000000005s)]
*  from as little as 12 metres away. A fourth Israeli claim is that the victims didn't have hands or [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=404.88000000000005s)]
*  feet tied together. Sky News do say there's no evidence to show they were restrained, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=409.92s)]
*  although representatives of the Red Crescent and a doctor did say at least one victim was found with [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=415.04s)]
*  hands or legs tied together. The doctor who did the post-mortem said the bodies were in too advanced [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=419.84000000000003s)]
*  the state of decomposition to be able to ascertain this. The fifth Israeli claim that the vehicles [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=425.20000000000005s)]
*  were crushed by accident when they were moved off the road, that's taken apart. Satellite imagery [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=430.0s)]
*  which Sky News have shows they were crushed only after they'd been moved off the road. Lies, lies, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=434.56s)]
*  lies. The sixth Israeli claim is that the convoy included Hamas terrorists, zero evidence provided [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=440.72s)]
*  that any of them were militants and the IDF have only named one of the supposed Hamas militants, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=445.68s)]
*  and he was not named as a victim by the UN, Red Crescent or civil defence, that is, as being in [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=451.12s)]
*  the mass grave. The final Israeli claim Sky News investigate is that the original ambulance contained [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=456.96s)]
*  three Hamas police officers, once again no evidence whatsoever for it, all of the victims have [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=462.23999999999995s)]
*  extensive photo and social media evidence going back many years of being serving medics. Furthermore, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=467.91999999999996s)]
*  Sky News interviewed a survivor who corroborated the accounts. He was in the first ambulance [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=474.47999999999996s)]
*  which was attacked without provocation by the Israeli army and he listened to his two colleagues [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=478.64s)]
*  He said after that he was stripped and physically assaulted by Israeli soldiers. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=484.64s)]
*  The evidence is absolutely overwhelming, the Israeli army perpetrated a war crime [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=489.12s)]
*  against defenceless medics and first responders and then lied about it over and over and over again. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=493.52s)]
*  Now the IDF inquiry, when you read the findings is frankly a very bad joke and can be summed up as [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=499.68s)]
*  IDF exonerates itself. They claim the findings show that the incident occurred in a hostile [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=505.04s)]
*  and dangerous combat zone under a widespread threat to the operating troops. It wasn't a [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=510.24s)]
*  combat zone. Next, they claim that Hamas repeatedly used ambulances for terrorism, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=514.88s)]
*  claims used to justify Israel's systematic destruction of Gaza's healthcare system. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=519.6800000000001s)]
*  They've done these claims over and over and over again without providing evidence. They say the [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=524.16s)]
*  examination found no evidence to support claims of execution or that any of the deceased were [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=528.48s)]
*  bound before or after the shooting. We know about how far away these medics, unarmed medics, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=533.84s)]
*  were executed. The inquiry goes on to say that these are blood libel's against IDF soldiers. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=541.6800000000001s)]
*  This is an example of how the very real evil of antisemitism is used to shut down scrutiny [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=546.96s)]
*  of the Israeli state and its crimes. Blood libel refers to medieval hateful lies about ordinary [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=552.96s)]
*  Jewish civilians killing children in ritual sacrifices. Nothing to do with the crimes [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=558.4000000000001s)]
*  committed by a state, a colonial state. Now, the inquiry claimed in the first incident, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=563.12s)]
*  the troops fired a vehicle identified as a Hamas vehicle, an ambulance with unarmed paramedics. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=568.48s)]
*  That's what it was. They then say approximately an hour later, the troops opened fire on suspects, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=574.16s)]
*  emerging from a fire truck, an ambulance is very close to the area in which the troops were [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=578.8s)]
*  operating after perceiving an immediate and tangible threat. Again, we know these were unarmed [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=583.2s)]
*  medics and first responders trying to rescue the first ambulance they attacked. We know they were [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=588.4s)]
*  not a threat. We can see in the footage. The inquiry then claims about 50 minutes later, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=592.32s)]
*  the troops fired a Palestinian UN vehicle due to operational errors in breach of the regulations. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=596.6400000000001s)]
*  This is the only so-called error that they're actually willing to claim here. They say at [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=602.08s)]
*  dawn it was decided to gather and cover the bodies to prevent further harm. Yes, that's definitely [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=606.1600000000001s)]
*  why they dumped a load of bodies of people they had executed in a mass grave. The army does concede [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=610.6400000000001s)]
*  the decision to crush the vehicles was wrong. No explanation given for why they crushed the vehicles [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=616.4000000000001s)]
*  and indeed preposterously they pushed back at accusations of a cover-up. They simply claim the [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=620.88s)]
*  Israeli state this heinous crime was an operational misunderstanding followed by a breach of orders [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=625.84s)]
*  during a combat setting. What are the consequences of this massacre of so many innocent medics and [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=630.96s)]

*  But it isn't, I'm afraid to say, good enough. As I've noted repeatedly, sporadically, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=650.8s)]
*  Western media outlets have taken apart Israel's lies about atrocities. I've given examples, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=656.0s)]

*  lies and lies and lies again as it commits war crime after war crime after war crime after war [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=671.6s)]
*  crime. It's not just that these rebuttals are too infrequent, too late, too lacking in prominence, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=675.6s)]
*  it's that they are detached from the wider coverage, with Israel in that wider coverage [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=680.24s)]
*  and its claims still treated as credible, as though this work hasn't been done in the first [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fr30udDU0&t=684.8s)]
