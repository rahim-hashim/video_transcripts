# Israel's Lies DEBUNKED
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [November 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpCFzUOzmfg)
*  There are two things which the Israeli state really excel at right now. One, killing innocent
*  people on a mass scale and the other is deceit. Now it is standard practice you might argue for
*  states to engage in wartime propaganda at times of conflict. Be that as it may, Israel's current
*  deceit intends specifically to cover up serious war crimes and a massacre which I think is a better
*  description than a war. This is far too asymmetrical, that is with one side so much
*  stronger than the other, to be accurately described as war. Now this is all happening of course with
*  the direct complicity of our governments thus this is in part done in our name. Israel official lies
*  have all of that in mind. They wish to manipulate western public opinion because they fear with
*  sound grounds that if public opinion tips decisively against Israel then politicians will be
*  forced to stop giving a blank check to Israel through arms and diplomatic support. Now Israel's
*  authorities lie and lie and lie again. They have a track record of doing so like the Cana massacre
*  of 1996 when they bombed a UN base and killed over 100 civilians and just spread misinformation
*  about it. When they killed the award-winning British filmmaker James Miller by shooting in
*  the head in 2003, likewise they spread a load of misinformation about it and when they shot dead
*  the celebrated Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akhli last year which they claimed
*  was actually done by Palestinian gunmen, it wasn't, it was done by the state of Israel. Now let's have
*  a recap of some of Israel's deceit in this murderous assault on Gaza. The Israeli authorities keep
*  posting claims that Palestinians are faking their own injuries and deaths, a particularly gruesome
*  form of atrocity denial. Ofe Gendelman who is the who is one of the spokespeople for the Israeli
*  prime minister posted a clip claiming to show Palestinians faking injuries declaring triumphantly
*  Paliwood gets busted again. They keep using this term Paliwood. Here's the thing it was actually a
*  clip from a Lebanese film about Palestinians called The Reality. Here's another example which
*  keeps coming up which centers on the Palestinian Instagram influencer Saleh Al-Jaffarari. Now the
*  claim is he's a crisis actor something which has been spread by Israel's official account
*  and pro-Israel accounts in general that he's a crisis actor. Now I've seen a senior British
*  broadcast journalist share this false claim. One such meme which has gone particularly viral mocks
*  in various ways a blood donor, revived corpse, resilient patient, American Idol, tour guide,
*  wall cross one amongst many other things. The claim is pretending to be a deeply injured patient is
*  the one which they particularly focus upon. Israel's official account claims that this patient was him
*  supposedly of him on his deathbed a couple of days after an alleged airstrike with in capitals most
*  of the machines are disconnected and the ones which are have fake stats but that wasn't him at
*  all. It's another Palestinian a 16 year old called Mohammed Zendik who lost his leg in July before
*  the current conflict began when Israeli occupation forces invaded Nersham's refugee camp in the West
*  Bank where he was visiting because he's a Palestinian citizen of Israel and the hospital
*  isn't just real is actually an Israeli hospital. Now the revived corpse in quotes is actually a
*  Thai child in a ghost costume for Halloween last year the rest is just him doing his Instagram
*  vlogging he's just singing too. Here's another one Israel's official Arabic account run by its
*  ministry of foreign affairs posted a video of a nurse which went viral in which she claims
*  Hamas had overrun the Al-Shifa hospital and was stealing all the fuel and morphine in which she
*  spoke with a non-Palestinian accent. I can't believe I'm doing this but the world has to know
*  has to know what is making here they're taking over the entire hospital they're taking over
*  the fuel the medicine. Now the hospital said there was no such nurse at the hospital they
*  deleted it without any explanation now it really is I mean it's just so bad so bad turns out she's
*  actually an Israeli Mexican actor. Now let's just focus on Al-Shifa hospital what we've seen is
*  Israel waged war on Gaza's medical health care system a siege which deprives the hospital of
*  medicine and energy self-causing mass deaths with premature babies taken out of incubators and
*  children having their limbs amputated without anesthetic they've bombed ambulances they've
*  bombed the hospital they've killed doctors nurses and patients with bullets and bombs what's left
*  of our chief hospital no longer functions as a hospital but as a first aid treatment centre in
*  which wounded patients are condemned to unnecessary death sentences. Now the bombing of hospitals I
*  thought we'd all agreed after Putin's brutal invasion of Ukraine was despicable indeed here's
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken earlier this year. We can never let the crimes Russia's committing
*  become our new normal. Bucha is not normal. Mariupol is not normal. Earpin is not normal.
*  Bombing schools and hospitals and apartment buildings to rubble is not normal. Israel's
*  justification for this obscenity that the Al-Shifa hospital is the command and control centre of
*  Hamas. Now let's just watch now the BBC debunking this and it's striking that even the BBC is
*  pushing back on these lies given how outrageous and large in scale they are. Israel described
*  the Al-Shifa hospital as the main headquarters for Hamas's terrorist activity.
*  This IDF animation posted in late October claims to represent a Hamas tunnel system
*  underneath the hospital but having been inside Al-Shifa since early Wednesday Israel's yet to
*  produce evidence of the tunnels. It has allowed the BBC and Fox News to film at the hospital
*  though only locations of Israel's choice. This is what they found. Israel also released its own
*  seven-minute video which BBC Verify has analysed. A watch visible in that video suggests it was
*  filmed a few hours before the BBC arrived and this IDF video was posted then deleted
*  then reposted this time without a section referring to an Israeli soldier who'd been held hostage.
*  I don't know when this was used the last time. Also in the video we see a room with an MRI machine
*  and if you zoom in and we get some light over here what you'll be able to see are is military
*  equipment. The BBC was shown the same room and what we see in the two videos doesn't precisely
*  match. For example there's one gun in the IDF video two by the time of the BBC footage. Israel
*  has told BBC Verify this is because more weaponry and terrorist assets were discovered throughout
*  the day. And as always in AK-47 Israel also says its video is a single shot with no edits
*  but this appears to be an edit. We don't know the reasons for that edit nor how significant it is.
*  The IDF though says suggestions it's manipulating the media are incorrect. The IDF video also shows
*  military equipment in other locations though we can't verify how it came to be there. And what
*  we see in this IDF video doesn't equate to Israel's description of Al-Shifa as an operational command
*  centre for Hamas. The US is using a different phrase saying Al-Shifa was used as a command and
*  control node. That implies a much smaller facility. Israel is adamant this hospital was a command
*  centre but for now at least it's either not found supporting evidence or it's not sharing it. Back
*  to you Sophie. So a total lie used to justify destroying the hospital killing so many of its
*  patients and medical staff turning it into a mass grave where so many dozens of decomposing
*  bodies meant they had to just put them in a mass grave. Now there's some other examples related to
*  this. The IDF posting a video in which they claimed they found a calendar listing terrorist names
*  in Arabic showing each agent's rotor for the guarding hostages at the Al-Rantis Children's
*  Hospital turned out it's just in Arabic a calendar of days of the week. They offered up the presence
*  of a laptop and CDs as evidence it was a command and control centre. WTF why are we even I don't
*  even know why I need to engage in discussing that. No evidence has been provided to show Al-Shifa was
*  a command and control centre for Hamas. This is a war crime. They attacked our hospital for absolutely
*  nothing and they should be condemned in the strongest possible terms and yet western states
*  refuse to do so when they've done exactly the same things they denounced Vladimir Putin for in the
*  strongest possible terms. In another case Israel claimed Palestinian militants had misfired
*  projectiles which hit the hospital turned out according to a New York Times analysis that
*  at least some of those projectiles claimed as Hamas were actually Israeli. After ordering the
*  evacuation of northern Gaza and holding about chief of hospital as a command and control centre
*  now they say Khan Yunus in the south is the centre of Hamas. Let's listen to this particularly
*  chilling threat from Israeli spokesperson and propagandist Mark Regev. You saw what happened
*  to the city of Gaza. Khan Yunus is a centre for Hamas activity as well. We're asking civilians
*  please vacate the area for your own safety. We don't want to see you caught up in the crossfire.
*  So they're making clear there what happened to Gaza City total destruction will now happen to Khan
*  Yunus. Where are those people supposed to flee to? Where are they supposed to flee to? There is
*  nowhere for them to go. The north has been destroyed and now the south will be destroyed as well. These
*  are epic war crimes crimes against humanity committed by a state which is wiping Gaza off
*  the map and inflicting a death rate far higher than conflicts to give some examples Bosnia, Yemen,
*  Ukraine, Syria. So they are resorting to lies on a grand scale in a desperate attempt to manipulate
*  public opinion. We need to call them out for what they are lies and they are lies in the service
*  of a particular dark indeed gruesome end which is covering up the mass slaughter of innocent
*  civilians and the wanton destruction of Gaza with the possible aim of the murderous ethnic cleansing
*  of the Palestinian population. Please like and subscribe do share the video to get the message
