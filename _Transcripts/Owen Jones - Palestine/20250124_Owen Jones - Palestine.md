# You're Being LIED TO About Gaza Protests To Justify Repression
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho)
*  Now, the police repression of protests in Britain over the genocide in Gaza and the broader [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=0.0s)]
*  assault of the Palestinian people should chill you. It is truly disturbing, in my view, what's [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  happening in terms of democratic freedoms and also the general attempt to turn the world upside down [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=12.56s)]
*  to portray those who oppose genocide as the hateful, dangerous extremists, rather than those who, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=17.12s)]
*  I don't know, use their platform to support it. I was at the protests on Saturday and it was [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=23.28s)]
*  awful, horrible, hideous to see the behaviour of the police there. What happened has happened [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=30.64s)]
*  since. I'm going to discuss now with what happened there and since with the director of the Palestine [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=36.64s)]
*  Solidarity Campaign, Benjamin Al, who has been charged. I need to just make that clear when we're [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=41.36s)]
*  talking about this because there is a process, a legal process, which I don't want to cause problems [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=46.8s)]
*  with. So I will speak freely and I will avoid doing anything which could cause any difficulties [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=54.88s)]
*  for you, Ben. How are you doing, first of all? I'm fine. I've had easier weeks but, look, I'm [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  not stupid enough to see what's happening to me is not about me. It's about what I represent [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=73.44s)]
*  and it's about a wider attempt to suppress the movement of solidarity that has been going on [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  for many, many years but on Saturday we saw it to some degree on steroids. At the heart of all of [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=88.64s)]
*  that, of course, we are always conscious as solidarity activists what's at the root cause [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=96.56s)]
*  of that. It's part of suppressing the voices of Palestinians in order to enable Israel to [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=101.12s)]
*  continue its system of oppression. So we're not naive about all of that and we fight back against [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=108.0s)]
*  it from that framework but thank you for asking. Nobody wants to be in this personal position [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=112.48s)]
*  but I know why I'm in it and I know what it's about and we will fight it and I will fight it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=120.4s)]
*  You showed courage and moral clarity as ever. Just a recap, very quick recap for those who [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=126.4s)]
*  don't know, the protest was originally going to march to the BBC, given the BBC's dire coverage [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=130.08s)]
*  of the genocide which I myself wrote about and investigated for DropSite News and what then [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=137.12s)]
*  happened is the BBC, sorry, the Metropolitan Police banned that on the basis there's a nearby [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=146.16s)]
*  synagogue. There's no synagogue on the route. The protest was going to due to arrive at the BBC when [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=151.36s)]
*  the service at the synagogue had finished two hours later, in fact two hours after the synagogue. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  So there's talk about disruption to the Jewish community when the march itself included, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=160.56s)]
*  of course, many Jewish protesters including Holocaust survivors and the descendants, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=164.32s)]
*  the relatives of Holocaust survivors. But then what happened is I got there and police everywhere [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  blocking people. It was on Whitehall and what happened then? Explain what you called for [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=174.88s)]
*  and what happened. Yeah and just to add I think from very early in the morning as people began [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  to assemble we saw extremely excessive policing. There was one, without complicating the picture, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=188.16s)]
*  there was one almost farcical element of the arrangement on Saturday which is the police had [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=194.64s)]
*  informed us shortly before that there was a marching band from a private school that every [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=200.88s)]
*  day on this date marches up and down a section of Whitehall for an hour and therefore they'd sort [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=205.44s)]
*  of segmented Whitehall into three sections, a northern section where between 12 and 1 we could [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=211.04s)]
*  assemble a southern section between 12 and 1 and then this area in the middle where [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=216.32s)]
*  preserved for the marching band. But when they discussed this with us we said that's, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  we can manage that but we have to make sure there's a way for people to filter from one to the other. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=226.88s)]
*  People will need to catch up with family, friends and their speakers and organisers etc etc. What we [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=231.6s)]
*  got very very early on was evidence of very very heavy-handed police and I've got numerous stories [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=238.24s)]
*  and saw some of this myself of people who were inadvertently in that middle section but just [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=243.84s)]
*  standing there being just taken away, others who were arrested for being in Trafalgar Square, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=249.44000000000003s)]
*  but excessively heavy-handed. I think that your viewers would have heard Zach Polanski's account [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=256.24s)]
*  of him intervening to stop the arrest of an elderly woman who was standing outside a toilet [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=262.40000000000003s)]
*  I think near Westminster Tube and was told you were... The Debussy leader of the Green Party for those who don't know. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=266.8s)]
*  Yeah so that was the environment. I mean to give a flavour of it Khalid Abdullah the famous [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=272.32s)]
*  actor who was one of our speakers when he arrived came up to me and said this is reminding me of [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=277.36s)]
*  being in Egypt. That was the general feel and tone of it and the police had indicated in advance [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=281.76s)]
*  there were police officers from eight forces. It's worth remembering these are for protests that have [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=287.68s)]
*  been overwhelmingly peaceful where there'd been no scenes of disorder. They weren't again on Saturday [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  and they had a heavy police presence and we were also conscious there were empty coaches the police [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=300.16s)]
*  had brought along with them in order to fill up with people that they intended to arrest. So that [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=306.40000000000003s)]
*  was a general environment when we arrived. Well I would say that many people believe that the police [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  had an interest in provoking scenes of disorder. That's my own view. Based on what people have said [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=317.20000000000005s)]
*  lots of people have said that around the protests based on their extensive experience I would say [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=323.92s)]
*  of protests over many many decades you made very clear you know we won't have any scenes of disorder [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=328.72s)]
*  here and don't you know so important you know emphasise the peaceful nature of it. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=335.12s)]
*  Just quickly on that so because I'm going to show you some footage now because the police claimed [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=341.44000000000005s)]
*  that the delegation forced their way through. Chris Ninam who you've known for years he's an [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=346.72s)]
*  activist a veteran activist and was then really really horribly aggressively arrested but let's [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=352.24s)]
*  just show the footage of what actually happened and I'll let viewers decide themselves if they [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=360.88s)]
*  think the police claims about forcing through and what actually happened are lying. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  So [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=382.56s)]
*  well what's your thoughts just I mean what the police have said and the footage it's quite [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=402.64s)]
*  striking. Yeah and look just to emphasise so and again the video of my speech and what I said is [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=407.68s)]
*  available online. Our intention today was to march to the BBC we wanted to do so because of its [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=414.08s)]
*  complicity through the bias of its reporting a bias confirmed in a recent investigation by Owen Jones [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=424.48s)]
*  so today as we end this rally a delegation comprising all of the leaders of the six [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=435.91999999999996s)]
*  organisations that united have organised the marches and protests for the last 15 months. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=447.44s)]
*  The PSC which I represent the Palestinian Forum in Britain the campaign against nuclear disarmament [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=456.56s)]
*  the Muslim Association of Britain friends of Al Aqsa and the Stop the War coalition. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=466.08000000000004s)]
*  The leaders of each of these groups and our speakers today who you see lined up behind me [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=474.64s)]
*  and members of the Jewish Bloc will now walk as a delegation towards the BBC. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=483.76s)]
*  We will carry with us flowers that we intend to lay at the gates of the BBC. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=496.32s)]
*  Now when a ceasefire is about to be called they want to distract attention from their shame by [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=507.36s)]
*  creating scenes of disorder on the streets we will not give them that victory. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=516.48s)]
*  So we will walk peacefully we will walk in silence if the police stop us which they probably will [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=525.6s)]
*  we will lay those flowers at the feet of the police force to mark their complicity in supporting [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=538.32s)]
*  genocide by suppressing protest against that genocide. So as you said I got up on stage I said [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=547.2s)]
*  a delegation and you know of the leaders of the organisations MPs and we had John McDonald [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=558.88s)]
*  Jeremy Corbyn and other politicians including Zach Polanski trade union leaders Eddie Dempsey [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=566.88s)]
*  was there Kevin Courtney former general secretary of the NEU and cultural figures Alexei Sale [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=574.08s)]
*  Juliet Stevenson Khaled Abdullah members of the Jewish Bloc including the Holocaust survivor [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=580.32s)]
*  Stephen Kapos all of the people who had spoken at the day or had come to support the demonstration [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=585.9200000000001s)]
*  we are now going to as you say walk peacefully towards the BBC in order for the reason to [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=590.72s)]
*  assert our protest at their complicity we take flowers to mark the slaughter of Palestinians [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=599.3599999999999s)]
*  and the BBC's complicity in that and to me that's a straightforward moral argument. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=606.2399999999999s)]
*  If you're not reporting properly on the genocide and fulfilling your responsibilities then you [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=610.3199999999999s)]
*  share some of the responsibility for the outcome and the impact of that genocide and if as I suspect [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=615.68s)]
*  we will be we get stopped and we thought we'll be stopped at the police line at the top of Whitehall [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=622.3199999999999s)]
*  then we will lay down the flowers at the police's feet as a mark of their complicity and we will [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=627.04s)]
*  disperse. So as you say when we got to the top of Whitehall as people can see on the video [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=632.56s)]
*  to we said we'd like to walk to BBC to our surprise the line parted and police officers very [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=638.3199999999999s)]
*  orderly said please filter through and they began to let people through. Then we got about 500 meters [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=644.8s)]
*  further on we went round Sheffargar Square got into a road I think it's Palmwell East but there's a [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=652.0s)]
*  second very thick line of police backed up by police vans etc we got there we said to the police [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=656.64s)]
*  officer John McDonnell and I were at the front of the delegation said to the police officer we'd [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=663.12s)]
*  like to walk through to the BBC and he said you can't so we said we are formally requesting that [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=666.8s)]
*  a delegation of 25 of us can go to the BBC and he said that I've got to pass up the line so in [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=671.4399999999999s)]
*  other words I don't know the answer whether you can do that or not as a formal delegation I'll check. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=678.3199999999999s)]
*  We were waiting then for a response Chris Nineham was beckoned over to talk to the police so we're [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=683.6s)]
*  still in negotiation and that was the point as you say and again the video of this is available [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=688.96s)]
*  it's shocking it was violently arrested three or four police officers dragged him to the ground [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=694.0s)]
*  and we then had obviously you know scenes of distress lots of people very distressed trying [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=701.1999999999999s)]
*  to move forward to support Chris and then what I did I grabbed the megaphone again it's all on video [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=707.84s)]
*  I said we're not going to give them the scenes of disorder they want [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=713.44s)]
*  this is what we're doing here today we are now going to lay down the flowers at the feet of the [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=718.1600000000001s)]
*  police and then we're going to turn around and we're going to walk back towards Trafalgar Square [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=722.0s)]
*  and the extraordinary discipline of this movement and this crowd that's exactly what people did and [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=726.72s)]
*  again all of that is available on the video evidence. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=732.08s)]
*  You I mean in terms of just what happened to you can you just explain what happened? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=738.0s)]
*  Yeah so the Sunday morning I woke up to a letter through my door from the police I don't know when [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=743.2s)]
*  it was delivered saying will you attend the formal interview at five o'clock I became aware [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=748.48s)]
*  very quickly that both Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell have received similar letters and they [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=755.5999999999999s)]
*  were going in for formal interview I think three o'clock four o'clock I attended that interview [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=762.56s)]
*  I think I was there for about two hours or so was told you will be notified there now needs to be a [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=767.92s)]
*  very thorough process of review looking at all of the evidence you will know within a week whether [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=773.92s)]
*  you are going to be charged with a violation of a public order and inciting others to violate the [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=779.84s)]
*  public order act. I gave a statement with my lawyers that emphasised everything I've just said [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=787.0400000000001s)]
*  to you about what happened. I arrived back home and within 30-40 minutes police officers from the [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=794.96s)]
*  same station I just left so this thorough process took all of 20-30 minutes arrived at my doorstep [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=804.8s)]
*  and proceeded to read out a charge sheet to me. My response obviously was you have no business [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=811.52s)]
*  being at my doorstep you could have posted this to me and I have been reading by myself [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=817.12s)]
*  for many many years I don't need you to read to me and they left at that point. So I am due in court [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=822.24s)]
*  on the charge of inciting a violation of the public order act and breaching it myself and I'll be in [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=829.6s)]
*  court on February the 21st and I will be vigorously contesting these charges. Quite rightly so and [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=839.0400000000001s)]
*  it's so important obviously that everyone who opposes the genocide but also supports democratic [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=846.96s)]
*  freedoms is there behind you in every possible way. I mean why should we worry all of us? Why [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=852.08s)]
*  is the onslaught that we're seeing here and I appreciate let's just generalise it the big [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=858.08s)]
*  picture so we're not focusing because obviously there's a legal process in underway. Why should [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=864.72s)]
*  this disturb us? Well I would say too fundamental and look part of what's going on we know is an [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=868.96s)]
*  attempt to distract those of us who are campaigning for Palestine to further chill us and to distract [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=874.96s)]
*  the conversation away from why we're protesting. So in the first place and I know Owen you've said [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=881.0400000000001s)]
*  this extremely eloquently a number of things that you have said about the Orwellian world that is [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=887.28s)]
*  trying to be constructed here. You know we have been campaigning for a ceasefire. We may now have [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=892.4s)]
*  a ceasefire. We have one implemented. It may last. We have an Israeli government whose prime minister [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=898.0799999999999s)]
*  has said well I reserve the right to be you know renew the murderous assault upon the people of [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=903.76s)]
*  Gaza. This is only a temporary pause. He's effectively used language to say you know [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=910.4s)]
*  President Trump has promised me new weapons you know extra special weapons. He's not used that [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=916.88s)]
*  phrase but weapons of a specific force and capability and after phase one of this we may [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=922.64s)]
*  be prepared to go back in. So the Palestinian people are living in a moment where in Gaza [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=929.04s)]
*  they are trying to find the dead under the rubble. They're beginning a process of can they rebuild [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=934.3199999999999s)]
*  their lives and that's going to be a torturous and long process but knowing that Israel may [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=939.3599999999999s)]
*  renew its assault. Meanwhile the rest of the oppression of the Palestinian people elsewhere [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=945.52s)]
*  across historic Palestine but particularly in the West Bank Israel is ramping up its military [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=951.1199999999999s)]
*  invasions and assaults on Palestinians in one day in the last couple of days eight Palestinians [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=956.7199999999999s)]
*  were killed. So that's the first thing and our government remains complicit in that and one of [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=961.76s)]
*  the things Benjamin Netanyahu said is you know Keir Starmer is indicating to me he may be about [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=967.52s)]
*  to reverse his decision to you know stop the sale of some weapons the suspension of some arms [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=972.72s)]
*  licenses. So that's the first thing why this matters. This is an attempt to repress a movement [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=979.6s)]
*  of people that are putting pressure on government on public bodies on companies and corporations [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=984.88s)]
*  to end their complicity in that genocide and they should not be allowed to do so. But secondly [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=990.64s)]
*  this is a fundamental assault on democratic freedoms. We have a pernicious body of legislation [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=996.64s)]
*  the Public Order Act. The numerous bodies including Liberty are seeking to have overturned. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=1001.76s)]
*  We have a Labour government that now seems to be ramping up how that its willingness to see how [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=1007.76s)]
*  that act is going to be employed. We have the Commission of the Met Police going to the Board [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=1013.12s)]
*  of Deputies of British Jews the day after this and using phraseology saying we've turned the dial. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=1019.12s)]
*  So in other words you should expect to see more of the type of thing we did yesterday in terms of [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=1025.84s)]
*  how we're going to use conditions and seek to impose them. That's not just an issue for those [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=1030.24s)]
*  of us who care about the rights of Palestinian people. It's an issue for anybody who wants to [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=1035.44s)]
*  protest on any issue wants to stand up against climate injustice wants to protest for social [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=1039.76s)]
*  rights. Every trade unionist should be concerned about this. Everybody who cares about any fundamental [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=1046.4s)]
*  issue of rights and justice and wants to protest should now be concerned that the police are [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=1052.88s)]
*  exercising the powers and saying this is how we're prepared to use them to suppress people's [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=1059.68s)]
*  rights and there's no protection for you if you're a leader of a movement or anything else or an [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=1064.64s)]
*  ordinary person out there protesting you're vulnerable to this. They're trying to frighten [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=1069.28s)]
*  people they're trying to chill people but they're also trying to utilise this law to exercise [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=1073.92s)]
*  extremely repressive powers. That should concern everybody which is why it's important. In the [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=1081.8400000000001s)]
*  past few days we've seen Liberty we've seen Amnesty we've seen Human Rights Watch we've seen [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=1087.52s)]
*  MPs we've seen a body of legal lawyers and scholars saying this is a deeply concerning [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=1093.6s)]
*  moment and calling for an independent inquiry calling on the Home Secretary to say there needs [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=1099.36s)]
*  to be an independent inquiry into what happened because going back to what you said at the start [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=1105.76s)]
*  the account that the police are given to justify their behaviour is contradicted by the video [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=1111.28s)]
*  evidence that is widely available and that people have seen. It's a scandal it's a disgrace and [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=1116.48s)]
*  everybody needs to be standing up to say this is not the sort of society we want to be living in. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=1122.88s)]
*  Amen to that and I think as anyone who can see the footage can see very clearly that the [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=1129.2s)]
*  narrative being spun is just false you know we're being told don't believe your lying eyes and don't [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=1135.2s)]
*  believe your lying ears well we can all see what happened and hear what happened. This is such an [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=1141.28s)]
*  important case and this is about the acceleration of repression against those who are fighting [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=1145.52s)]
*  against one of the great crimes of our age and more broadly it's about the authoritarian turn [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=1152.8799999999999s)]
*  which is reaping the western world including in this country. The foundations laid by previous [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=1156.8799999999999s)]
*  new labor and Tory administrations are now built on by the Starm administration as well so please [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=1162.8799999999999s)]
*  everyone get this message out share the video press like subscribe leave comments all of that's good [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=1167.92s)]
*  for the algorithm more people then engage that's the whole point but Ben solidarity with you as [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=1171.76s)]
*  ever you've been a brilliant crucial voice throughout all of this these mass rallies which [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=1176.16s)]
*  huge numbers of people of all faiths and non have been part of fighting against this the great crime [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=1181.92s)]
*  of our age so thank you and solidarity. Thank you. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuoqxHs1nho&t=1188.4s)]
