Video Description: This week South Africa presented a devastating case against Israel at The Hague alleging genocide - and then Israel offered its defence. So what will the International Court of Justice likely rule?

This is such an important interview with Dr. Alonso Gurmendi. He says "the Master's tools will not dismantle the Master's house." He cautions those expecting the ICJ to issue a definitive ruling on genocide - but explains the real significance of what has just happened.

# Israel Genocide Case: What Will The ICJ Likely Rule? - w/ Dr. Alonso Gurmendi
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM)
*  Hello. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=0.0s)]
*  South Africa's case at the International Court of Justice [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1.4000000000000001s)]
*  has, I think, had a profound impact [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=4.68s)]
*  on a huge number of people. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=7.04s)]
*  It gave a kind of glimmer of hope, I think, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  that Israel's impunity finally was challenged. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=9.96s)]
*  And many, of course, felt that South Africa presented [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=13.56s)]
*  an overwhelming case in its argument [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=16.2s)]
*  that Israel is committing genocide against specifically [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=18.16s)]
*  the Palestinians of Gaza. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  Now, Israel has itself responded. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=24.72s)]
*  It refused previously, it's actually boycotted the ICJ. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=28.36s)]
*  It certainly ignores its rulings. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=31.64s)]
*  But it has presented its own case today. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=32.84s)]
*  Now, what I'm going to do is talk to a brilliant expert. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=36.64s)]
*  I've been following his coverage on social media. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=40.32s)]
*  And I was really, really struck by the depth, the nuance, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=42.94s)]
*  the intelligence of what he wrote. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=46.36s)]
*  It's Alonzo Gimandi. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=48.56s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=52.32s)]
*  You'd think I would have checked before. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=52.92s)]
*  We had a chat before about your first name. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=54.6s)]
*  Should have also checked how I pronounce your second name. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=57.32s)]
*  So can we just correct myself? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=59.84s)]
*  It's Gimandi. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=62.36s)]
*  Gimandi. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=63.6s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=64.28s)]
*  There we go. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=64.92s)]
*  Alonzo Gimandi. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=65.6s)]
*  And it's a real honor, you lecture [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=66.68s)]
*  at International Relations in the Wall Street [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=68.16s)]
*  Department at King's College. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=70.0s)]
*  Hello. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=71.6s)]
*  Big honor to speak to you. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=72.52s)]
*  How you doing? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=73.48s)]
*  Hi, it's great to be here, Owen. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=74.56s)]
*  Let's just start. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=76.88s)]
*  I want to just do a kind of quick summary of Israel's case. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=78.08s)]
*  Because in terms of South Africa's case, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=80.44s)]
*  obviously, many of us watched such a compelling presentation [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=82.28s)]
*  by some incredible lawyers from South Africa, also [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=86.08s)]
*  Ireland and Britain, but overwhelmingly, of course, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  South Africa, where they made the points about, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=90.96s)]
*  rarely has genocidal intent been so rarely spoken [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=93.12s)]
*  because of the sheer level of genocidal statements [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=98.12s)]
*  from politicians, ministers, army officers, and so on, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=100.48s)]
*  that they linked it to conduct by soldiers on the ground, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  that they made the point about how supposedly humanitarian [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=109.0s)]
*  gestures were themselves genocidal, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=113.16s)]
*  forced removal of population, threat of violence [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=115.36s)]
*  without them able to, without the means of life [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=119.64s)]
*  being there, and elderly people, the infirm being forced [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=122.8s)]
*  to flee at drop of a hat, that kind of thing. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=126.24s)]
*  The assault on the conditions of life, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=129.24s)]
*  leaving 80% of the world's most likely people in Gaza, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=132.32s)]
*  the destruction of the medical system, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=136.68s)]
*  the leveling of all infrastructure. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=139.32s)]
*  It was so overwhelming that many felt, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=141.44s)]
*  how on earth could Israel respond to that? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=143.96s)]
*  Now, without turning you into a spokesperson [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=146.2s)]
*  for the Israeli states, which is not what we want to do, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=148.0s)]
*  what was the Israeli counter-argument [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=150.76s)]
*  to such a formidable argument? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=153.4s)]
*  Right, so I think it is important to start [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=156.8s)]
*  by saying that the Israeli defense has its flaws [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=159.72s)]
*  and has its points where you can, let's say, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=164.4s)]
*  counter-argue successfully. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=170.08s)]
*  It is not a perfect presentation. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=171.56s)]
*  But it is also, I've seen a lot of people say, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=174.72s)]
*  oh, this was terrible. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=178.08s)]
*  It wasn't. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=179.16000000000003s)]
*  It was a qualified, well-made defense [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=180.24s)]
*  with enough arguments to make against it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=185.48000000000002s)]
*  So let's not idealize it, and let's not say, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=190.36s)]
*  oh, this is going to be a walk in the park. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=194.20000000000002s)]
*  I guess within that middle ground [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=196.8s)]
*  is where we should operate. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=199.44s)]
*  And in that middle ground, Israel had a few key points. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=200.83999999999997s)]
*  The first one would be that there's no dispute. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=206.64s)]
*  They say that for there to be a dispute, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=209.48s)]
*  you need to have, let's say, a dialogue between two parties. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=211.95999999999998s)]
*  You cannot just say, I have a dispute with you, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  and that's it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  You need some level of engagement. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=219.67999999999998s)]
*  And this engagement never happened. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=221.12s)]
*  This meeting between South Africa and Israel [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=222.67999999999998s)]
*  where they say, oh, we don't agree, never happened. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=225.68s)]
*  Honestly, this was the weakest point of the argument, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=229.64000000000001s)]
*  so I would just brush past it. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=231.88s)]
*  Clearly, the rest of Israel's presentation [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=234.4s)]
*  demonstrated that there's a dispute about whether there [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=236.92000000000002s)]
*  is genocide going on or not. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=239.16s)]
*  The second one is that Israel was very detailed [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=241.64000000000001s)]
*  in trying to argue that all the things that they are doing [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=248.16s)]
*  in Gaza to mitigate civilian hardship [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=252.04s)]
*  is evidence that there cannot be genocidal intent. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=257.59999999999997s)]
*  They argue like no party that is actually [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=261.03999999999996s)]
*  committing a genocide would go through, quote unquote, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=265.48s)]
*  so much trouble at the expense of their military operations [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=267.8s)]
*  to address civilians, like dropping leaflets [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=273.0s)]
*  and constructing hospitals, like field hospitals [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=276.64s)]
*  and floating hospitals, and then, I don't know, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=279.08s)]
*  allowing aid in, and all of these things. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=281.64s)]
*  I mean, it was a long part of the presentation. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=287.76s)]
*  My problem with that is we are dealing with a situation where [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=290.47999999999996s)]
*  I think South Africa said that 80% [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=294.84s)]
*  of the people with extreme hunger in the world [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=297.47999999999996s)]
*  are in Gaza right now. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=300.03999999999996s)]
*  So at some point, if you know that that's what you're doing [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=301.68s)]
*  and you have a response that is clearly even Israel's allies [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=304.88s)]
*  are acknowledging the devastation that [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=310.44s)]
*  is occurring in Gaza right now, if you know that what you're [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=312.56s)]
*  doing is not enough, so that's the weak spot. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=316.56s)]
*  That's the weak point of that, right? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=320.48s)]
*  Because then they can claim that they're doing things, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=322.12s)]
*  but South Africa can counter, you're [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=325.36s)]
*  doing not enough knowingly. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=327.56s)]
*  And so that still reflects intent, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=329.68s)]
*  which I think is what South Africa tried [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=332.6s)]
*  to do yesterday, anticipating this line of argument. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=334.24s)]
*  Then the other main argument that Israel has [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=337.08s)]
*  is this longstanding claim that everything it does [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=340.92s)]
*  is a consequence of Hamas's own tactics and strategies [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=344.32s)]
*  of using civilians as shields. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=347.96s)]
*  And so all the agency goes to Hamas, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=350.4s)]
*  and Israel is just responding, to which I think, again, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=354.04s)]
*  the South African claim was quite successful in showing [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=356.72s)]
*  that there was this line at the end of the South African [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=360.0s)]
*  presentation that said, if you claim that you are specifically [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=363.16s)]
*  targeting Hamas, and then you show images [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=367.08s)]
*  of entire neighborhoods burnt to the ground, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=369.48s)]
*  bombed to the ground, sorry, then that's not [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=373.12s)]
*  how a manhunt looks like. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=375.56s)]
*  So again, there's an argument that says, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=378.24s)]
*  well, we have to deal with the reality on the ground [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=381.24s)]
*  that Hamas presents to us. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=384.24s)]
*  And the counterargument would be, well, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=386.28000000000003s)]
*  but is that the way to do it? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=388.0s)]
*  Does that denote that you're being forced to do this, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=390.6s)]
*  or are you going overboard? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=394.04s)]
*  And then there's the other, I guess, the key part of this, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=397.28s)]
*  not necessarily of the provisional measures part [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=401.0s)]
*  of the discussion, but the merits of the case [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=403.03999999999996s)]
*  that Israel is claiming that it has a right to self-defense [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=404.96s)]
*  and that any provisional measures that stop it [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=409.4s)]
*  from defending itself in Gaza would go against the inherent [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=413.47999999999996s)]
*  right of self-defense, which is a principle of international [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=417.59999999999997s)]
*  law. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=420.0s)]
*  And I guess here's the crux of it all, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=422.08s)]
*  because there is a previous opinion, an advisory opinion [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=424.68s)]
*  from 2004 by the International Court of Justice that [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=428.40000000000003s)]
*  said that Israel has the occupying power in Gaza, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=431.0s)]
*  does not have a right to self-defense over territory [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=435.44s)]
*  that it occupies, because it is exercising force already. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=438.2s)]
*  So it is interesting to see what the court will do with this. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=444.52s)]
*  And we can talk about this in more detail. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=447.12s)]
*  But I think this is a key aspect of the discussion. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=448.92s)]
*  And it will definitely shape how an order for provisional [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=452.56s)]
*  measures is drafted, because this [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=455.68s)]
*  is an aspect of the entire case that I don't think [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=457.79999999999995s)]
*  the court will want to deal in 20 pages of provisional measures. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=460.32s)]
*  It will want to dedicate enough time [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=463.71999999999997s)]
*  to address this claim in the merits phase. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=466.03999999999996s)]
*  So this will impact how any order looks like. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=469.52s)]
*  And it will impact, let's say, not impact, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=472.68s)]
*  it is very important, because it's [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=478.88s)]
*  a key argument of Palestine is that Israel [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=481.08s)]
*  doesn't have a right to self-defense [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=483.96s)]
*  in the Palestinian territories. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=485.47999999999996s)]
*  And I would assume that this is one key part of what [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=487.15999999999997s)]
*  South Africa is going to bring into the merits phase. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=491.59999999999997s)]
*  In terms of before we talk about what happens next [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=495.28s)]
*  with the court itself and what could happen [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=498.59999999999997s)]
*  in terms of provisional measures, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=500.44s)]
*  could you just explain a bit about the International [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=501.4s)]
*  Court of Justice, which is United Nations' top legal body. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=503.44s)]
*  It's got 15 judges on it. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=506.52s)]
*  Many would look at it and go, well, each judge [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=509.12s)]
*  is appointed by a particular state. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=512.04s)]
*  Is it basically just a forum for international real [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=514.52s)]
*  politique, where each judge is just a stooge of their state [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=517.44s)]
*  and will just reflect the international power [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=522.32s)]
*  dynamics and the strategic interests of that given state? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=525.12s)]
*  Or is it more complicated than that? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=529.04s)]
*  And how do you think the makeup of the judges, the 15 judges, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=531.6s)]
*  is there any sense of how that could bode for the outcome? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=536.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's actually a very good question. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=540.04s)]
*  I've seen many people commenting on this saying, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=541.88s)]
*  oh, but it's impossible to think that an Australian judge will [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=547.0799999999999s)]
*  side with South Africa because they're [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=551.1999999999999s)]
*  appointed by that state. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=553.68s)]
*  That is a very common misconception. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=555.6s)]
*  That is not how it works at all. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=557.16s)]
*  The judges don't represent their states. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=560.04s)]
*  They don't have to vote in accordance [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=564.84s)]
*  with their state policies. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=566.6800000000001s)]
*  They have to vote in accordance with their own approach [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=568.76s)]
*  to the law. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=572.2s)]
*  And this, of course, I mean, I'm not [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=573.08s)]
*  going to be naive enough to say that there [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=575.48s)]
*  is no role played here by a political process of selecting [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=577.24s)]
*  judges. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=580.76s)]
*  But these judges come from different traditions. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=583.12s)]
*  And they should not be seen as mouthpieces for their state. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=587.76s)]
*  In fact, for example, the court just elected new judges. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=593.4s)]
*  So the court composition that we have right now [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=598.16s)]
*  will change for the merits face. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=601.28s)]
*  For example, there won't be a Russian judge. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=604.12s)]
*  There will be a Mexican judge instead of a Jamaican judge. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=607.0799999999999s)]
*  Well, I guess the main point is these judges [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=611.4399999999999s)]
*  will represent specific traditions. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=618.88s)]
*  So there is actually, there might [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=620.24s)]
*  be surprises for people that think [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=622.64s)]
*  that they're just mouthpieces. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=624.24s)]
*  The Australian judge, Hillary Charlesworth, for example, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=625.88s)]
*  is expected to be among the judges that would theoretically [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=630.88s)]
*  be more willing to accept South Africa's position [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=634.6s)]
*  and she's Australian. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=639.32s)]
*  And then there are, let's say, it shouldn't, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=642.52s)]
*  we shouldn't ignore the fact that this court exists [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=649.36s)]
*  to operationalize a thing called international law. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=652.52s)]
*  And the international law is itself [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=656.0s)]
*  a product of a specific history. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=658.36s)]
*  I say this as someone who studies [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=660.12s)]
*  the history of international law. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=661.6800000000001s)]
*  It's filled with genocide in its history. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=663.12s)]
*  It's filled with war crimes and it's filled with colonialism. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=666.84s)]
*  So I don't want to be naive in saying [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=669.92s)]
*  this will have no influence. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=673.92s)]
*  There is a phrase that the people who [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=675.88s)]
*  deal with post-colonial approaches [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=678.4399999999999s)]
*  to international law and critical approaches [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=680.92s)]
*  to international law, I guess we struggle with, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=682.84s)]
*  is that the idea that the master's tools will not [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=685.52s)]
*  dismantle the master's house. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=689.56s)]
*  It is difficult to use international law [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=691.96s)]
*  to solve a conflict like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=696.64s)]
*  that is a product of international law itself. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=700.32s)]
*  I mean, it goes back to the days of the British mandate [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=703.92s)]
*  of Palestine. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=708.68s)]
*  This is what international law does. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=710.12s)]
*  So I do want to be cautious with this, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=711.88s)]
*  that there is a broader context here involved [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=714.4s)]
*  that complicates things. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=719.56s)]
*  But at the same time, it's not like this [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=722.24s)]
*  is going to be a committee of states that will say, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=725.88s)]
*  no, of course not. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=728.4s)]
*  This lawsuit is ridiculous. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=730.4399999999999s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=732.04s)]
*  It will be a reasoned decision. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=732.68s)]
*  It will be a good faith decision. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=735.12s)]
*  The people that will make these arguments [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=738.7199999999999s)]
*  will generally believe what they're saying. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=740.3599999999999s)]
*  It's not going to be a real politic thing. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=742.8399999999999s)]
*  The thing is that the things that people believe [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=746.52s)]
*  are often encased within specific cultural settings. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=748.52s)]
*  And the idea of, for example, is Palestine a state [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=750.92s)]
*  is very contextual to where you learned international law. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=755.5999999999999s)]
*  Before I ask about provisional measures, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=760.72s)]
*  so for those who don't know, this actual case [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=762.32s)]
*  would take years. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=765.5600000000001s)]
*  But provisional measures can be issued in the meantime. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=766.6s)]
*  Before I ask you about that, what is the actual power [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=772.84s)]
*  of the ICJ? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=775.2s)]
*  Because a lot of people go, well, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=776.0400000000001s)]
*  they've issued rulings against Israel. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=777.36s)]
*  Israel just goes, yeah, and what? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=779.24s)]
*  And just cast the gates in a kind of rogue, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=781.2s)]
*  statey manner of the United Nations [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=783.52s)]
*  and everything associated with it. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=785.0400000000001s)]
*  So what does it actually mean in practice as power? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=786.48s)]
*  So there's two elements to this. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=790.12s)]
*  There's one short term and one long term. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=791.8s)]
*  In the short term, I'll say, so the court's rulings [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=793.4799999999999s)]
*  are binding, as in states need to comply with them, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=796.28s)]
*  especially because Israel, before this, Israel [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=799.3199999999999s)]
*  has dealt with advisory opinions, which there's [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=801.3199999999999s)]
*  debate about how binding they are. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=805.9599999999999s)]
*  But this would be binding. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=807.4s)]
*  It has to be complied with. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=808.52s)]
*  And of course, we all know international law [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=809.92s)]
*  has no international police force that [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=811.8399999999999s)]
*  can compel you to comply. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=814.1999999999999s)]
*  The Security Council is theoretically [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=815.8s)]
*  in charge of making sure that these judgments are complied [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=818.08s)]
*  with, but the US holds veto power, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=820.36s)]
*  so that's not going to work out. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=822.24s)]
*  So I know there's a little bit of helplessness with that, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=823.8000000000001s)]
*  that Israel can just ignore the ruling. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=826.0s)]
*  But there are also mechanisms. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=828.1600000000001s)]
*  Well, first of all, reputational mechanisms. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=833.8000000000001s)]
*  It's not easy to just say, I'm not [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=835.6s)]
*  going to comply with these rules. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=837.4000000000001s)]
*  But the more important ones, I guess, are also domestic ones, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=839.1600000000001s)]
*  in that in countries like the UK, like the US, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=842.1600000000001s)]
*  there are laws designed to prevent these states [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=847.08s)]
*  from trading weapons or having links with countries [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=851.76s)]
*  that violate human rights. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=856.2800000000001s)]
*  So those mechanisms could be activated [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=858.1600000000001s)]
*  with a ruling like this. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=861.5200000000001s)]
*  That's on the short term. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=864.0s)]
*  On the long term, and I guess this [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=865.24s)]
*  is of little consolation to people, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=866.88s)]
*  but let's think about for a second [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=868.64s)]
*  how the world looked like 200 years ago. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=871.12s)]
*  I come from Latin America. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=874.36s)]
*  200 years ago, if a country, say Argentina, say Venezuela, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=875.96s)]
*  didn't pay its foreign debt, the next day [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=879.5600000000001s)]
*  it would have a fleet of English, German, French warships [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=882.08s)]
*  blockading its ports. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=886.36s)]
*  They would put soldiers in the customs agency in the port, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=887.88s)]
*  and everyone trading with Argentina [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=891.1600000000001s)]
*  would pay to Germany or England, who would keep the money. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=894.0s)]
*  That was not only legal, but absolutely normalized [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=900.2800000000001s)]
*  and accepted. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=904.0s)]
*  And that's 200 years ago. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=905.48s)]
*  20 years ago, an African country submitting [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=908.52s)]
*  a claim in the International Court of Justice, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=912.9200000000001s)]
*  a contentious claim, against Israel for genocide [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=915.28s)]
*  was unthinkable. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=918.96s)]
*  This would not happen. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=920.64s)]
*  And so there is an argument for the long arch of history [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=923.12s)]
*  here in that, yes, international law [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=927.36s)]
*  and the international community move slowly, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=929.48s)]
*  and sometimes it moves backwards, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=931.8000000000001s)]
*  like we've recently seen in Europe and the United States. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=933.44s)]
*  But in the grand scheme of things, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=939.6s)]
*  we have moved away from a world of gumbo diplomacy, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=941.48s)]
*  for example. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=945.0s)]
*  It still happens, but it happens less overtly. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=946.72s)]
*  So if you insert this case within that longer process, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=949.8800000000001s)]
*  there are important victories that [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=954.2s)]
*  can be made in the mid to long term in this case that are [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=955.9200000000001s)]
*  perhaps even more influential for people 10, 20, 30, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=962.48s)]
*  100 years from now than just the moment that we're living in. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=966.08s)]
*  Not to say, of course, that there are no immediate things [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=970.28s)]
*  that we cannot do. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=972.76s)]
*  Like I said, there are domestic mechanisms [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=973.48s)]
*  to keep states like the US, the UK, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=975.1800000000001s)]
*  from collaborating with countries that are committing [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=977.72s)]
*  genocide, for example, or countries that are failing [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=980.72s)]
*  to sanction genocide. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=982.52s)]
*  Because that's another thing we should discuss is this case is [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=983.72s)]
*  not just about is genocide being committed. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=986.4s)]
*  It's also about whether Israel is punishing [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=988.64s)]
*  people that commit genocide and incite to genocide. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=990.84s)]
*  And is Israel preventing genocide [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=994.64s)]
*  from happening in Gaza? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=997.8000000000001s)]
*  And that's a very striking point, actually, isn't it? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1000.24s)]
*  Because the Genocide Convention of 1948, which Israel, of course, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1002.5600000000001s)]
*  is a signatory to, it does adjust, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1005.5600000000001s)]
*  as people might expect, to prohibit the acts of genocide. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1008.2800000000001s)]
*  It also makes a criminal offense inciting genocide. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1011.48s)]
*  Israel interpreted that into its own legal system in 1950 [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1016.0400000000001s)]
*  and actually made, at the time it remains, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1019.84s)]
*  it introduced a death penalty. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1022.76s)]
*  And I've checked with a Israeli, sorry, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1024.68s)]
*  a legal specialist on Israeli law. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1027.3600000000001s)]
*  It remains, in theory, although the death penalty [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1029.24s)]
*  has only been enacted twice in Israeli history, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1032.04s)]
*  but it is a capital offense not only to commit genocide, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1033.76s)]
*  but there are four other crimes, including conspiracy [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1037.6000000000001s)]
*  to commit genocide and inciting genocide. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1040.8s)]
*  And the law says they should be treated the same as actually [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1043.3600000000001s)]
*  someone who commits genocide. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1045.8400000000001s)]
*  And the death penalty actually applies in all cases, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1048.08s)]
*  though in practice that hasn't happened or wouldn't happen. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1052.6799999999998s)]
*  But anyway, it's just quite interesting. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1056.48s)]
*  Well, Israel has been a bit of a trap here also, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1058.08s)]
*  because in its case, it is arguing [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1060.4399999999998s)]
*  that these leaders, these officials that [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1062.32s)]
*  have made all of these amalek statements [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1065.96s)]
*  and all these genocidal statements that South Africa [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1068.48s)]
*  has complained of, they're saying, well, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1071.84s)]
*  but they don't have operational control of hostilities. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1073.76s)]
*  So that does not demonstrate intent. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1077.6s)]
*  The obvious response to that is, and I'm sure South Africa [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1081.12s)]
*  will do that, is, okay, they don't hold operational duties, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1085.4s)]
*  but they still said something genocidal. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1091.92s)]
*  And your troopers listened to them, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1094.72s)]
*  and they did things that we consider are genocidal. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1098.04s)]
*  So what are you doing to keep these people [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1100.12s)]
*  from making these statements? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1103.56s)]
*  I think it was a minister that said, let's nuke Gaza. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1105.56s)]
*  What did you do with them? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1107.72s)]
*  Did you slap them on the wrist or did you prosecute them? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1109.52s)]
*  And then what are you doing to the soldiers [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1112.84s)]
*  that you find that are committing things [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1115.0s)]
*  that could be considered genocidal? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1118.28s)]
*  Again, let's not forget, yes, there could be an argument [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1120.9199999999998s)]
*  that this entire war is genocidal. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1123.6s)]
*  There's also the possibility that the court says, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1126.04s)]
*  the entire war is not genocidal. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1128.3999999999999s)]
*  This specific act was a genocide act. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1129.84s)]
*  That's what happened with the Bosnia-Serbia case, right? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1132.04s)]
*  The entire war was not decided as a genocide, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1134.2s)]
*  but Serbianicia itself was a genocidal act. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1137.8400000000001s)]
*  So if Israel proves that it has, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1140.88s)]
*  let's say, no genocidal intent based on these assertions, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1145.3200000000002s)]
*  practice, its own practice could also reveal [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1148.16s)]
*  genocidal intent, but if these assertions are not sufficient [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1150.52s)]
*  because they don't have the operational control [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1153.92s)]
*  of facilities, okay, but proving that means [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1155.6000000000001s)]
*  that you didn't do enough to prevent genocide [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1159.3200000000002s)]
*  or to sanction the incitement of genocide, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1161.16s)]
*  because Israel isn't doing it. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1163.84s)]
*  If we were seeing Israeli politicians go to jail, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1165.12s)]
*  that would be different. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1167.52s)]
*  Really important point. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1169.28s)]
*  I mean, they tried to defend, for example, Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1170.12s)]
*  who obviously has operational decisions, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1173.1599999999999s)]
*  he's prime minister who referred to Amalek, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1174.9199999999998s)]
*  and they tried to bog that down in theological discussion, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1177.84s)]
*  but also, we know obviously the Minister of Defense [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1180.76s)]
*  used human animals, and they claim that's about Hamas, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1184.04s)]
*  but he was talking about siege measures [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1186.08s)]
*  against the civilian population. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1188.6s)]
*  But I suppose the really important point there is, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1190.28s)]
*  incitement is criminalized for a reason in itself, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1192.44s)]
*  and that is because it has, the argument is, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1196.52s)]
*  it can have genocidal implications in conduct, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1199.52s)]
*  and the argument of South Africa is, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1202.68s)]
*  even if those other genocidal statements [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1204.4s)]
*  are not issued by people with operational power, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1206.8000000000002s)]
*  they can lead to genocidal conduct. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1210.0s)]
*  That's the whole reason, isn't it, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1211.52s)]
*  why the law criminalizes it. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1212.76s)]
*  But just in terms of what happens next, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1213.8400000000001s)]
*  in terms of provisional rulings, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1215.96s)]
*  because again, this is why it's so important [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1217.44s)]
*  to talk to you, because it will end up, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1220.76s)]
*  I think on an optimistic note, and people will see why. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1222.76s)]
*  But I think some people have built up, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1224.84s)]
*  well, this was such an overwhelming case by South Africa, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1227.3999999999999s)]
*  as we would see it, that there'll just be these kind of [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1229.96s)]
*  very clear, damning provisional rulings, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1233.12s)]
*  which will say there's clearly [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1235.6399999999999s)]
*  at least a huge risk of genocide here. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1237.0s)]
*  The war, the fighting must immediately end, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1239.1999999999998s)]
*  and that's just not probably likely at all to happen, is it? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1242.0s)]
*  I don't wanna be the negative one, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1247.0800000000002s)]
*  but yeah, I don't think that it will be the case. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1251.4s)]
*  And I mean, not because of any kind of conspiracy [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1255.48s)]
*  or anything, but just because of how this case is working, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1261.76s)]
*  I don't see the court addressing Israel's, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1265.56s)]
*  one of Israel's key arguments here, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1269.76s)]
*  that this is Israel's right to defend itself. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1272.0800000000002s)]
*  In a 20 page provisional measure order, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1276.56s)]
*  I think that is something that the court will wanna reserve [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1280.3600000000001s)]
*  for the merit stage. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1283.04s)]
*  And so I think at the provisional measure state, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1285.3600000000001s)]
*  it will have to acknowledge the fact that [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1289.6000000000001s)]
*  it doesn't have jurisdiction over Hamas. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1291.8400000000001s)]
*  So it cannot actually order Hamas to stop hostility, right? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1293.56s)]
*  Because it's not a member state, Hamas is a country, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1297.56s)]
*  Gaza is a nation, therefore it's not a member of the, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1300.0800000000002s)]
*  it's not part of the RCJ or the Genocide Convention. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1303.84s)]
*  Right, Hamas is a non-state armed group [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1306.8799999999999s)]
*  that is operating in the territory of another state, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1309.12s)]
*  which is Palestine. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1311.36s)]
*  Or if you're Israel and you don't recognize [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1312.72s)]
*  Palestinian statehood, the occupied Palestinian territories. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1315.28s)]
*  And so the court is not, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1320.8799999999999s)]
*  probably not going to address that [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1325.24s)]
*  at the provisional measure stage, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1326.8s)]
*  because it needs to acknowledge this fact that Hamas exists. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1328.72s)]
*  So say for example, one thing that the court could do is say, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1331.92s)]
*  look, you need to being, let's say, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1335.0800000000002s)]
*  I guess, I don't know if optimistic with this, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1339.5200000000002s)]
*  but like the court could say, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1341.6000000000001s)]
*  you can defend yourself from further attacks, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1343.68s)]
*  but your original response to October 7th [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1346.68s)]
*  needs to be limited in this way, this way, this way. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1350.48s)]
*  Don't attack hospitals, don't do this, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1353.64s)]
*  don't order 1.2 million people to evacuate [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1355.5200000000002s)]
*  from one day to the other. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1358.0400000000002s)]
*  But say if there's a, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1360.0800000000002s)]
*  you don't need to like withdraw all your troops, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1363.64s)]
*  but you need to do these conditions [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1365.64s)]
*  and you need to let a fact-finding mission come in [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1367.28s)]
*  and investigate, you need to let the press to come in, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1369.72s)]
*  all of those things are possible. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1371.64s)]
*  I'm not sure that the court will say, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1374.3600000000001s)]
*  stop hostilities point blank, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1376.76s)]
*  because Israel made an interesting claim today [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1379.5600000000002s)]
*  in its defense. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1382.8400000000001s)]
*  It said, you cannot do that, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1383.88s)]
*  because that would be what the court did [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1386.1200000000001s)]
*  in the Ukraine v Russia case. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1388.84s)]
*  And it claimed in that case is manifestly different [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1393.28s)]
*  from my case, from South Africa v Israel, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1396.48s)]
*  because what Russia was arguing [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1400.0s)]
*  was that it had a right to intervene in Ukraine, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1403.72s)]
*  because there was genocide happening in Ukraine. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1408.1599999999999s)]
*  And the court said, no, no, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1410.28s)]
*  actually the genocide convention [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1411.6799999999998s)]
*  does not allow you to go into Ukraine. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1413.04s)]
*  The only thing that can allow you [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1416.04s)]
*  to go into another country forcefully [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1417.44s)]
*  is a security council authorization of self-defense, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1419.0s)]
*  none of them happened here, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1421.0800000000002s)]
*  this is a blatant act of aggression, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1422.68s)]
*  so you need to stop. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1424.44s)]
*  And Israel is saying, that's not the same as this case, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1426.3600000000001s)]
*  because in this case, there is an ongoing armed conflict [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1429.6000000000001s)]
*  and you don't have power over one part of the conflict, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1431.76s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1435.8400000000001s)]
*  So if you order me to stop [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1436.8s)]
*  and you cannot get Hamas to stop, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1438.72s)]
*  that means that I need to be attacked by my enemy. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1441.1200000000001s)]
*  Because of this, the court would need to address [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1448.24s)]
*  the Israeli claim of self-defense. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1452.24s)]
*  The Israeli claim of self-defense [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1453.72s)]
*  is a longstanding Palestinian argument [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1455.0800000000002s)]
*  that Israel doesn't have a right to self-defense [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1458.88s)]
*  within the state of Palestine [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1461.04s)]
*  or the Palestinian occupied territories. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1462.44s)]
*  Because it argues that as the court itself did in 2004 [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1466.0s)]
*  in the wall advisory opinion, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1471.3600000000001s)]
*  that if you're occupying territory, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1474.3200000000002s)]
*  then you cannot possibly have self-defense [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1475.64s)]
*  against the territory which you are already controlling. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1477.72s)]
*  So there's a big argument to have here [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1482.44s)]
*  that will probably be reserved to the merits [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1485.16s)]
*  on does Israel have that right? [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1486.8400000000001s)]
*  And it would be an incredible victory for Palestine [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1489.4s)]
*  if the court said in a binding ruling, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1493.76s)]
*  that in effect, when Israel occupied the West Bank, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1497.0400000000002s)]
*  well, probably not the West Bank, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1502.96s)]
*  because we're gonna talk exclusively about Gaza, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1503.96s)]
*  but when Israel occupied Gaza and then withdrew [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1505.88s)]
*  and left control and all of that story, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1508.4s)]
*  the logical thing for South Africa to argue is, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1515.8s)]
*  well, you're saying that Russia did not have a right [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1519.16s)]
*  to intervene in Ukraine because it was an act of aggression [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1523.32s)]
*  because there was no possible claim to have a self-defense. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1525.76s)]
*  So South Africa would need to argue, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1529.72s)]
*  well, do you have a valid claim to occupy Palestine? [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1531.6s)]
*  And remember, Israel has a peace treaty with Egypt. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1535.24s)]
*  Egypt is the country that was occupying Gaza [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1540.1599999999999s)]
*  at the time of the 1968 war. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1543.4399999999998s)]
*  So the war between Egypt and Israel is done. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1546.36s)]
*  So you're not occupying Gaza because of that war. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1551.12s)]
*  You're not occupying the West Bank [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1555.12s)]
*  because you're at war with Jordan either. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1556.32s)]
*  So what is your legal basis for occupying Gaza? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1558.64s)]
*  And of course, Israel will say, I'm not occupying Gaza. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1563.2800000000002s)]
*  And that'll be the discussion. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1566.0400000000002s)]
*  But there is a scenario here where, yeah, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1567.8400000000001s)]
*  the court says, actually, yeah, I mean, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1571.0400000000002s)]
*  what is the rationale for you to be in Gaza? [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1574.0800000000002s)]
*  And that would be huge. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1576.88s)]
*  That alone would be huge. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1579.1200000000001s)]
*  It's not probably not the result that everyone's imagining. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1580.2800000000002s)]
*  Everyone would like it to the court to say, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1583.5600000000002s)]
*  this whole genocidal war needs to stop. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1585.44s)]
*  But winning on that front would also be important. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1588.92s)]
*  Yeah, but before I ask the final question, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1592.04s)]
*  just generally about, I guess, the question [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1595.0s)]
*  of what has been achieved regardless, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1597.36s)]
*  I suppose, of what the outcome is, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1600.8s)]
*  is we did hear, obviously, what Israel did, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1602.6s)]
*  as predicted partly was to focus on the atrocities [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1605.92s)]
*  committed by Hamas on the 7th of October [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1609.16s)]
*  when atrocities, war crimes were committed [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1611.76s)]
*  against the race of Indians. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1614.08s)]
*  And the whole point is South Africa [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1616.36s)]
*  has acknowledged that and accepted that. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1618.04s)]
*  The point it made is there was never, ever any justification [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1620.24s)]
*  for genocidal response to anything, literally anything. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1625.04s)]
*  So it's actually not relevant in that sense. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1627.3999999999999s)]
*  Those atrocities are something to condemn, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1630.6399999999999s)]
*  but they're not relevant to whether. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1632.96s)]
*  So I'm just wondering, because then the question, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1634.36s)]
*  I'm just wondering how they might adjudicate, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1636.76s)]
*  because that's what South Africa anticipated, didn't they? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1639.48s)]
*  South Africa anticipated that Israel would say, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1641.4399999999998s)]
*  this is self-defense against atrocities [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1643.56s)]
*  committed on the 7th of October. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1645.28s)]
*  And they anticipated it in two ways. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1646.9199999999998s)]
*  A, by saying it didn't begin on 7th of October, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1648.44s)]
*  there's a long history here. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1650.76s)]
*  Genocide is a continuum. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1652.24s)]
*  It was explained as such by the man who coined it. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1653.3999999999999s)]
*  Therefore, we need to put the context [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1656.04s)]
*  of colonization, apartheid, ethnic cleansing, and so on. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1657.6s)]
*  But they also said, well, you can't do, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1661.52s)]
*  this is not, you can never claim this is self-defense. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1663.56s)]
*  What do you think, how they respond to that? [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1666.44s)]
*  Yeah, I think, so South Africa had two points. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1669.0s)]
*  The first one was you don't have a right to self-defense [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1672.2s)]
*  in occupied territory. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1674.48s)]
*  You are the occupying power of Gaza, and that's it. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1675.52s)]
*  The second claim was the one that you're saying, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1678.8400000000001s)]
*  in the event that we decide that you do have it, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1680.8400000000001s)]
*  then that self-defense is taking the form of genocide. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1686.32s)]
*  And genocide is an absolute prohibition [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1690.56s)]
*  in international law. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1692.56s)]
*  Nothing can justify it. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1693.3600000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think it is your initial point [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1697.56s)]
*  of Hamas atrocities. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1701.9199999999998s)]
*  I mean, yes, what Hamas did was atrocious. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1704.36s)]
*  It was, for all intents and purposes, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1707.56s)]
*  I mean, at least from my personal point of view, [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1710.08s)]
*  it was itself a genocide or a genocidal act. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1711.96s)]
*  But it cannot justify a second set of atrocities, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1715.24s)]
*  even less it cannot justify another genocide. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1721.6s)]
*  So the argument that Hamas' tactics are [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1724.96s)]
*  this guiding Israeli conduct, which [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1732.8400000000001s)]
*  is the claim that Israel did, that all I'm doing, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1735.68s)]
*  I'm doing because Hamas is shielding behind civilians, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1738.0800000000002s)]
*  seen from the eyes of South Africa is, yes, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1743.44s)]
*  but if to do that you need to commit genocide, [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1745.96s)]
*  then you're doing it wrong. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1750.68s)]
*  And there's, of course, a second argument [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1752.44s)]
*  that is not on trial here. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1754.16s)]
*  It's not in the docket here. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1756.1200000000001s)]
*  But the second argument is, OK, if it's not genocide, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1757.76s)]
*  if it's systematic war crimes, it's also not allowed. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1761.52s)]
*  There's just no jurisdiction in the International Court [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1765.2s)]
*  of Justice to make that claim. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1767.48s)]
*  But very often, this is something [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1769.96s)]
*  that happened in the Gambia v Myanmar case. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1771.88s)]
*  Countries that are defending themselves [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1774.8400000000001s)]
*  against accusations of genocide have to concede, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1777.1200000000001s)]
*  this is not genocide because it is crimes [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1779.64s)]
*  against humanity and war crimes. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1781.6000000000001s)]
*  This is something that Israel did not do. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1783.2s)]
*  But it might end up, I mean, in the broader merits hearings, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1786.8s)]
*  it's something that might come up. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1791.04s)]
*  And they might have to concede that. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1792.8400000000001s)]
*  Because South Africa tried to do, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1794.88s)]
*  they anticipated that, didn't they? [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1796.24s)]
*  They were saying, look, we understand [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1797.6000000000001s)]
*  there are crimes against humanity that aren't genocide. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1798.8400000000001s)]
*  We're trying to make this separate from that. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1801.8s)]
*  Because obviously, crimes of humanity are part of genocide. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1804.4s)]
*  There are precondition for genocide, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1808.2s)]
*  but crimes against humanity doesn't [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1810.24s)]
*  mean genocide has been committed. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1811.8s)]
*  Just finally, then, in terms of what's been gained, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1813.28s)]
*  what could, because lots of Palestinians [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1816.3999999999999s)]
*  are saying to actually feel whatever happens, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1818.52s)]
*  Israel's impunity has taken a big old knock. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1820.96s)]
*  That actually, the sense Israel has had, and partly explains [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1824.12s)]
*  why it's become in rhetoric, so we can all [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1827.2s)]
*  agree a genocidal hothouse, literally just saying, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1829.32s)]
*  willy-nilly, genocidal statements like confetti [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1832.32s)]
*  to the point where the attorney general had to intervene [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1836.28s)]
*  in Israel to say that, begging them to stop, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1838.52s)]
*  on the grounds that it would incriminate Israel. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1841.36s)]
*  But then some continued, because they were just so addicted [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1843.4799999999998s)]
*  to genocidal sentiment. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1846.12s)]
*  So just finally, what's been gained? [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1847.1999999999998s)]
*  What can Palestinians say, regardless of outcome, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1848.6399999999999s)]
*  what's being achieved here? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1851.12s)]
*  So I think, before I go into that, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1852.8799999999999s)]
*  there is a scenario where South Africa wins. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1855.7199999999998s)]
*  I just, I want to say that outright. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1858.12s)]
*  Good. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1860.36s)]
*  That's what we think. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1860.84s)]
*  Such a scenario exists. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1862.8s)]
*  It's not like the, it's not an impossibility. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1865.1599999999999s)]
*  I feel like I don't want to be perceived as too negative here. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1868.32s)]
*  I'm just cognizant of the limitations [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1872.12s)]
*  within the setting that we're in, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1875.2s)]
*  in a world that doesn't allow a state to say, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1878.28s)]
*  you're committing war crimes, you're committing crimes [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1880.84s)]
*  against humanity, and you're committing genocide. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1882.8s)]
*  And then the court can say, well, in my opinion, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1884.24s)]
*  it's just war crimes. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1885.8s)]
*  That doesn't exist. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1886.6799999999998s)]
*  And so we need to get through that hurdle. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1888.1599999999999s)]
*  And it's a very tall hurdle because [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1890.1599999999999s)]
*  of the history of the Genocide Convention, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1891.6s)]
*  of proving intent. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1894.0s)]
*  It probably shouldn't be that high of a hurdle. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1896.12s)]
*  We have this impression that genocide is this [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1900.68s)]
*  once in a lifetime crime, that we will only see it once [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1902.8s)]
*  in our entire lifetimes. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1906.92s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1908.24s)]
*  If you think about it, any country, most countries, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1910.0s)]
*  will have one genocide in their history, at least. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1914.72s)]
*  They just, we just call it our national mythos. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1917.68s)]
*  Right? [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1920.28s)]
*  I'm from Peru. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1920.8s)]
*  I can assure you, Peru has committed more than one genocide. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1921.68s)]
*  Against indigenous people in the Amazon, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1925.4s)]
*  against indigenous people in the Andes. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1927.52s)]
*  I can make that critique. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1931.56s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1934.32s)]
*  Because people have often seen it as simply [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1936.48s)]
*  in the popular imagination that there's the Holocaust, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1938.56s)]
*  and then there's Rwanda and Bosnia, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1941.16s)]
*  but actually beyond that, people don't really [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1943.6399999999999s)]
*  have an understanding of genocide. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1945.6399999999999s)]
*  I don't know if that's often the case. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1946.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1948.08s)]
*  And I mean, it is important to be [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1948.56s)]
*  aware of the absolute extraordinary levels [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1951.64s)]
*  of systematic brutality and genocide of the Holocaust [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1957.76s)]
*  as probably the most systematic, most open genocide in history. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1962.2s)]
*  But within other degrees of genocides, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1968.8400000000001s)]
*  genocide is actually how the world was made. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1971.64s)]
*  Our current global order was built on colonial genocides. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1974.0s)]
*  And so it is not a once in a lifetime crime. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1980.4s)]
*  And this means that probably the intent requirement shouldn't [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1983.92s)]
*  be this high. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1986.72s)]
*  Actually, when the Genocide Convention [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1987.92s)]
*  was first drafted, African-American communities [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1989.44s)]
*  in the United States tried to use the convention to argue [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1993.6000000000001s)]
*  that Jim Crow was genocide. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=1999.24s)]
*  And much of the hesitance in the United States [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2002.4s)]
*  about ratifying the convention was, what if they decide then [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2006.52s)]
*  that Jim Crow was genocide? [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2009.44s)]
*  So the bar was set really high for not the best reasons. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2011.1200000000001s)]
*  And we end up in this scenario where [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2017.0800000000002s)]
*  it's like the Jack Nicholson and a few good men [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2019.1200000000001s)]
*  having to yell that he ordered the court read [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2024.68s)]
*  as the only proof of genocide. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2026.8400000000001s)]
*  And that's not how it should be. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2029.2s)]
*  But that's the limitations of the system [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2030.6000000000001s)]
*  that we are operating in. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2032.3200000000002s)]
*  We do have a high hurdle. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2034.04s)]
*  So I'll return to my original point. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2037.72s)]
*  I do think there's a scenario where South Africa can [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2039.6000000000001s)]
*  win this case. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2043.28s)]
*  But there is more than one other potential big victories [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2045.68s)]
*  for the cause of the Palestinian people in this case, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2051.2400000000002s)]
*  including the self-defense argument that I've made. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2055.88s)]
*  But the one that you made in particular [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2057.96s)]
*  is also very important, this idea [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2059.6s)]
*  that it's not just this specific iteration [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2061.0s)]
*  of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2069.16s)]
*  is being evaluated here. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2070.64s)]
*  The entire global South is watching this case [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2072.52s)]
*  with a lot of attention. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2074.84s)]
*  And there is a claim from the hegemonic powers right now [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2076.48s)]
*  of a rules-based international order. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2081.64s)]
*  It's a very strong claim. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2084.52s)]
*  It is something that they place great importance in. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2085.68s)]
*  And I feel like on one result, yes, South Africa prevails. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2089.52s)]
*  And therefore, there is a rules-based international order. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2094.88s)]
*  Because in whatever degree it prevails, [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2099.44s)]
*  there was a system through which to hold Israel to account, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2103.0s)]
*  whether about genocide, whether about not preventing genocide, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2105.56s)]
*  or not punishing those that incite genocide. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2110.84s)]
*  Whatever victory is achieved, there [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2112.92s)]
*  would be a mechanism, a rule of law [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2115.2400000000002s)]
*  that you can follow in this system. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2117.16s)]
*  The other alternative is one where that end result is [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2121.24s)]
*  completely disappointing. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2125.8399999999997s)]
*  And then the whole idea that there is such a rules-based [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2128.3199999999997s)]
*  order collapses. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2131.04s)]
*  And that opens up spaces for other powers, hopefully [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2133.04s)]
*  democratic powers like Brazil, like South Africa itself, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2137.64s)]
*  to carve, to use their newly gained geopolitical relevance [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2143.56s)]
*  to carve new interpretations. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2150.16s)]
*  And to be, and this is very important, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2152.04s)]
*  to be rule enforcers in international relations. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2153.96s)]
*  Because right now, the whole game [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2157.36s)]
*  of international relations is who can get enough power [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2159.2s)]
*  to be a rule bender. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2162.12s)]
*  If you get enough power, you can bend the rules. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2163.36s)]
*  And we're seeing this also with China and Russia. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2165.72s)]
*  If they gain enough power, they can bend the rules [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2168.56s)]
*  and invade Ukraine and commit abuses in Hong Kong. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2170.76s)]
*  There is another way of doing this. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2177.48s)]
*  And maybe it's idealist of me. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2179.44s)]
*  But there is a way where you can get enough power [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2181.6800000000003s)]
*  to be a rule enforcer. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2184.88s)]
*  And that's what South Africa is doing here. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2186.84s)]
*  It's trying to be a rule enforcer. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2189.2400000000002s)]
*  Do I wish that they were a little bit more [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2191.6000000000004s)]
*  tougher on Russia? [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2195.1200000000003s)]
*  Yes, I would wish that. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2196.32s)]
*  But at the same time, they didn't invite Putin [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2197.96s)]
*  to Johannesburg recently. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2202.7200000000003s)]
*  So I just hope that as a result of all this, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2204.04s)]
*  we can carve these new understandings for the world [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2208.76s)]
*  and how it should work, and how it should be about actually [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2213.6s)]
*  a rules-based order, and not just the real politic [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2216.88s)]
*  as you described it in the beginning. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2219.56s)]
*  That's a great way to end. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2222.6s)]
*  I think that does show optimism, regardless of what happens. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2223.88s)]
*  I do think South Africa's case is truly historic. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2227.72s)]
*  I think it will have huge repercussions for a long time. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2231.08s)]
*  It will certainly be studied, I think, [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2233.56s)]
*  for a very, very long time by academics, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2235.6s)]
*  but also by people who strongly follow [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2238.7999999999997s)]
*  the struggles of liberation of people [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2244.8399999999997s)]
*  who suffer huge, huge oppression and look for whatever tools [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2246.9599999999996s)]
*  are at their disposal at any given time. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtwXm6BIVnM&t=2249.9599999999996s)]
