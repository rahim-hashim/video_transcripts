# He's Trapped In Gaza - And Tells Me What's Happening
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [December 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0)
*  From the start of this current round of horror, I have promised to use this platform as best I can to elevate the voices we desperately need to be hearing from right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=0.0s)]
*  Crucially, of course, that must mean people in Gaza itself, but that is fraught with challenges. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=7.8s)]
*  Of course, Gaza is a war zone. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  Much of it has now been destroyed by Israeli weapons. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=14.24s)]
*  The vast majority of its inhabitants have been forcibly removed from their homes and they are living in the most desperate circumstances imaginable. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=16.92s)]
*  Communications networks there are unreliable and there are obvious challenges like charging mobile phones with enough electricity. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=24.419999999999998s)]
*  But I'm very glad to say that I've been corresponding with someone there called Narada. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=31.5s)]
*  He has fled with his family, including his children, of course, to Gaza City for Rafah at the south of the Strip on the border with Egypt, which is, of course, closed. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=34.9s)]
*  He worked as a journalist for 25 years and he is now a strategic consultant. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=43.980000000000004s)]
*  We first corresponded a few weeks ago, but he has not been able to use communications since then. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=50.14s)]
*  Here's his first message, which includes many things that he wants a Western audience to hear. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=55.980000000000004s)]
*  They have forced us to move from Gaza to the city of Khajounis in the south of Gaza Strip. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=80.82s)]
*  And after that, they have forced us to move from all us as a civilian, civilian people to move from Khajounis to Rafah on the Egyptian border. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=87.82s)]
*  And all the time we are under the attacks by all the weapons you can imagine or you can't imagine. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=98.82s)]
*  The heavy weapons that that is used by the big armies around the world. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=106.82s)]
*  So they are using these these weapons, the American weapons and the Western weapons against the innocent people, civilian people, children, babies, old people, women. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=113.82s)]
*  And they are saying that we are fighting Hamas. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=126.82s)]
*  But the truth, they are fighting the people. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=129.82s)]
*  They are killing the people. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=131.82s)]
*  And I don't know if we and my family will have the chance to survive or not. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=132.82s)]
*  But at least until this moment, we are killing the people for more than two months for no reason. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=142.82s)]
*  This is not a war. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=148.82s)]
*  I want to explain that this is not a war. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=150.82s)]
*  This is a genocide process from the Israeli military forces by their supporters from United States and Western countries like United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=152.82s)]
*  Unfortunately, all of them, even these countries send them the weapons and the support them by very heavy weapons all the times. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=169.82s)]
*  And they get the support, political support from these countries. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=180.82s)]
*  For what? For killing the innocent people. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=184.82s)]
*  And if this if they are honest that they are fighting Hamas, why they are killing the people? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=187.82s)]
*  They are fighting my friend. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=195.82s)]
*  They are fighting us by all the means that and the tools that they can get. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=198.82s)]
*  I mean that they are fighting us by the American weapons, by the Western weapons, by making the situation very complicated. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=203.82s)]
*  I mean by making the people die by hunger. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=217.82s)]
*  So there is no food. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=222.82s)]
*  There is no electricity. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=224.82s)]
*  There is no water. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=226.82s)]
*  There is no medicine. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=227.82s)]
*  There is no hospitals because there is nothing because they have destroyed everything. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=229.82s)]
*  And the people are there is no houses even. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=235.82s)]
*  The people are now it's the winter time and it's raining. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=238.82s)]
*  It's very cold. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=244.82s)]
*  And the majority of the people, they are living in the streets. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=245.82s)]
*  So everyone who can injured, he's dying. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=250.82s)]
*  Everyone he can sleep in the streets with his kids, with his wife. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=254.82s)]
*  Mostly he will be illness. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=259.82s)]
*  And there is no treatment or medical treatment of any kind. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=262.82s)]
*  So regarding this issue, it's complicated as well. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=269.82s)]
*  And it's some kind of punishment, collective punishment against the innocent people, civilian people. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=272.82s)]
*  Those people and those women and those kids and those babies are not fighters. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=282.82s)]
*  For which reason they are killing them and punishing them by forbidding the food and the water and the medicine. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=289.82s)]
*  For which reason? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=297.82s)]
*  Is this democratic values? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=298.82s)]
*  Is this the Western values? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=301.82s)]
*  Is this Israel the only democratic state in the Middle East? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=304.82s)]
*  Is this the human rights they are talking about? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=310.82s)]
*  But I want to tell you something. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=313.82s)]
*  From the start of this military operation against the people in Gaza, the defense minister of Israel said that we are just only some kind of animals. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=315.82s)]
*  So they are dealing with us as animals, not as a human. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=326.82s)]
*  He goes on to tell me about the attacks on Gaza's Christian community and on places of worship which have existed for so many centuries. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=329.82s)]
*  Do the people of the West believe that they are really Christian? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=337.82s)]
*  If they say yes, why Israel has started to bombard the Christian institutions in Gaza from the first, before they have destroyed the oldest church in Gaza, one of the oldest churches in the world? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=342.82s)]
*  Why they have destroyed it and they have killed the Christian people of Gaza beside the Muslim people? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=363.82s)]
*  Why they have destroyed the only Christian hospital in Gaza? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=371.82s)]
*  And inside this hospital, it's a Christian hospital, they have killed 800 people in one only, one missile, one bomb. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=382.82s)]
*  Is this Muslims? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=395.82s)]
*  If they are saying this because Hamas are Muslims. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=397.82s)]
*  Why they have destroyed the oldest mosque in the Gaza city which was church? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=401.82s)]
*  It's one of the oldest buildings in the Middle East and in Palestine. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=406.82s)]
*  It's the time from the Jesus, just only 300 years after Jesus was born. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=411.82s)]
*  He goes on to talk about Israel's attack on Al-Shifa hospital. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=416.82s)]
*  Let's just be clear first about what happened here. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=419.82s)]
*  On the 27th of October, the IDF declared that Al-Shifa hospital is the main headquarters for Hamas' terrorist activity. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=422.82s)]
*  They also released a video which their extremely imaginative and creative graphic designers clearly spent a lot of time and effort on, showing a kind of James Bond-esque mega layer with sprawling tunnels and meeting rooms. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=429.82s)]
*  They repeatedly attacked this hospital. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=440.82s)]
*  They killed doctors, they killed nurses, they killed patients. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=443.82s)]
*  A mass grave had to be dug. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=446.82s)]
*  Premature babies were left gasping for air as they were taken out of their incubators. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=448.82s)]
*  The World Health Organization declared that this hospital was a death zone. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=452.82s)]
*  I shouldn't need to tell you that attacking hospitals is a war crime. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=456.82s)]
*  There is an exception if it can be proven that it serves a military function and even then attacks can only be justified if there is proportionality. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=459.82s)]
*  Now, there clearly was no proportionality. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=467.82s)]
*  But not only that, the evidence provided for Israel's claims, and I'm quoting them here, that Al-Shifa hospital was the main headquarters of Hamas were non-existent. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=470.82s)]
*  We already knew that Israel had built a bunk of tunnels under Al-Shifa hospital themselves in 1983. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=480.82s)]
*  The evidence they went on to offer were a few weapons and an extremely feeble looking tunnel with an old toilet, which for some reason they then destroyed while the independent investigators look at it. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=485.82s)]
*  Now, they also issued a feeble statement to justify arresting the hospital's director, claiming they'd found indisputable evidence indicating the Shifa hospital served as a Hamas command and control center. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=495.82s)]
*  Sorry, what? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=508.82s)]
*  You said it was the main headquarters for Hamas' terrorist activity. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=509.82s)]
*  You then downgraded this to a Hamas command and control center, to which you offered no meaningful evidence of any description after you butchered doctors, nurses, patients. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=513.82s)]
*  That most media outlets have let them get away with this outrage is a disgrace, as is the fact many actually justified it, legitimizing Israel's numerous attacks on other hospitals. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=523.82s)]
*  So with that context, let's listen to Narada. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=533.82s)]
*  All the time that they have said, we will find the leaders of Hamas in the Al-Shifa hospitals, the main hospitals in Gaza city and Gaza Strip. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=536.82s)]
*  And they have reached this hospital. They didn't find anything. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=546.82s)]
*  And they have killed the poor people. They're just poor. The baby who was just born. They have killed them. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=549.82s)]
*  They have killed all the people in the hospital, the doctors, the nurse, the ill people, and they have destroyed it. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=556.82s)]
*  And they didn't find anything regarding Hamas. They just destroyed the hospitals. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=566.82s)]
*  I go on to ask him how much both him and his family are able to eat. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=571.82s)]
*  Regarding eating the food, to be honest, me, for example, me and my family, now we are for almost one week without flour to make bread. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=577.82s)]
*  There is no bread. There is no rice. There is no vegetables. There is no any kind of fruits. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=589.82s)]
*  And we are eating the minimum, the minimum of any human being should eat every day. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=598.82s)]
*  We eat one time with a small amount of anything we can find. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=607.82s)]
*  I then ask him if he's losing loved ones in this horror. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=614.82s)]
*  Regarding my relatives, look my partner. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=619.82s)]
*  Every time I'm afraid to open the Facebook if I have the chance to get internet connections. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=624.82s)]
*  And every time I'm afraid to make any call or to receive any call. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=630.82s)]
*  You know why? Because I'm afraid that to find some of my relatives have been killed or destroyed or scratched under their buildings by these crazy weapons and heavy weapons. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=635.82s)]
*  But the answer is yes. Every day I am losing my relatives and my friends and my neighbors and my friends. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=651.82s)]
*  So it's complicated to come to it's continuous. It's continuous for more than two months. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=660.82s)]
*  This is a killing process, continuous killing process for more than two months. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=666.82s)]
*  And every moment, every moment we are losing, every moment we are losing people we are knowing. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=673.82s)]
*  And to be honest, without any emotional words from my side. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=680.82s)]
*  Now you are talking to me. Maybe while you are talking to me after one second or two seconds the voice might be stopped. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=686.82s)]
*  Because a missile will kill me with my kids and where I'm living here. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=698.82s)]
*  He has something else he wants to say about how public opinion in western countries has turned against this horror and yet that's been resisted by our governments. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=705.82s)]
*  Regarding the western propaganda, there is a very important and tricky point. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=716.82s)]
*  If these governments came to the rules and to the office in western countries by the will of their people. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=722.82s)]
*  Now the people all over the world, they are saying stop this war. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=731.82s)]
*  Don't kill the Palestinian peoples by our names because we are free human people. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=737.82s)]
*  And for more than two months the governments of western countries, even they don't make any attention for their people. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=745.82s)]
*  And by the way, now Americans they have the elections next year. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=757.82s)]
*  Despite the people of the United States they have started to understand the situation. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=764.82s)]
*  And they ask their government and the congress and the white house to stop this massacre. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=770.82s)]
*  They don't care about their people. Even they don't care about their states. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=777.82s)]
*  They just only care about Israel. What a tricky thing this. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=782.82s)]
*  What is this Israel? It is above these people, above these states, above this international law. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=787.82s)]
*  Even they have destroyed the United Nations headquarters in Gaza. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=794.82s)]
*  The UNDP, the UNRWA, it's an immeasurable. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=799.82s)]
*  This is a really important point by Navadah. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=805.82s)]
*  Polling in the US, in the UK and across Europe shows decisive support for a permanency's fact that is being ignored. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=808.82s)]
*  Now the fact that so many people are opposed to this onslaught, this horror, which has killed around 20,000 people in Gaza and maimed and injured so many more [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=814.82s)]
*  and caused so much horror and trauma to people in Gaza. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=827.82s)]
*  Well we owe it to Palestinians like Navadah, like his family, to keep building pressure on our governments to stop this horror. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=830.82s)]
*  I'll keep trying to correspond with Navadah as best I can. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=839.82s)]
*  I will read to the comments that you leave and will try to put anything to him that you suggest as best I can. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu5S08nqZz0&t=842.82s)]

*  And I will keep using this platform and space to provide a platform for voices which we need to hear and which are being ignored, marginalised or frankly demonised by other media outlets during this, one of the great atrocities of our age.
