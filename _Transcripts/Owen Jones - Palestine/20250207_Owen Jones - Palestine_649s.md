# Trump Sanctions ICC: The US Is A ROGUE STATE
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU)
*  The United States of America is a rogue state. That is what Donald Trump's decision to impose [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=0.0s)]
*  sanctions on the International Criminal Court underlines. Last November, the ICC issued [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=4.72s)]
*  arrest warrants against the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=9.92s)]
*  defence minister Yoav Galan for war crimes and crimes against humanity. That came after [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=13.84s)]
*  a very long process. It had to go through judges from different countries. It had to [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=18.96s)]
*  first as well go through a legal panel of preeminent lawyers. It was last May, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=25.28s)]
*  a very long time ago, when the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karen Kahn, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=29.36s)]
*  issued requests for those arrest warrants against Israeli leaders and Hamas leaders. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=33.28s)]
*  There were 125 countries on earth party to the Rome Statutes which established the ICC [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=37.84s)]
*  back in 1998. While the vast majority of western states signed up, like the UK, France, Germany, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=43.68s)]
*  the United States voted against the Rome Statute. Why? Because the world's only superpower knew [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=49.6s)]
*  its behaviour across the world involved an array of war crimes, and quite rationally feared its [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=54.24s)]
*  military personnel and political leaders could face legal action for committing war crimes. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=59.52s)]
*  This was before Iraq and Afghanistan and all that by the way. Now Israel too refused to sign up for [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=64.24000000000001s)]
*  the court. Don't need to guess why. The state of Palestine, which is recognised by most countries [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=69.28s)]
*  on earth, was accepted as a member in 2015. That meant that the ICC had jurisdiction for crimes [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=74.88s)]
*  committed in the state of Palestine and also crimes committed by those from the state of [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=80.56s)]
*  Palestine. Now just as Russia has refused to ratify the Rome Treaty, that doesn't matter [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  because Ukraine has ratified the Rome Treaty. That's why the ICC issued arrest warrants for [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=91.84s)]
*  Vladimir Putin in March 22, 23, as well as the Russian Commissioner for Children's Rights [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=98.48s)]
*  for the war crime of unlawful deportation, transport children, as well subsequently as [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=102.88s)]
*  Russian military figures. Russia might not be a signatory, but Russia has committed grave war [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=107.44s)]
*  crimes in Ukraine. That's what matters because Ukraine is a signatory. In just the same way, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  Israel might not be a signatory to the ICC, but that's irrelevant. It's committed war crimes and [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=116.24s)]
*  crimes against humanity in a territory where the ICC has jurisdiction, the state of Palestine, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=119.92s)]
*  and that jurisdiction is also why the ICC issued arrest warrants for Hamas leaders, all of whom [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  have since been killed by Israel. The ICC doesn't have its own police force. Instead, its member [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=129.68s)]
*  states are obligated to act on the arrest warrants, not least if those subject to its [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=134.8s)]
*  arrest warrants land on their territory, arrive in their territory. We'll come on to that. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=139.84s)]
*  Now Trump's executive order places financial and visa restrictions on ICC staff and anyone [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=144.4s)]
*  assisting ICC investigations against the US and its allies, claiming the ICC is guilty of illegitimate [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=149.84s)]
*  and baseless actions targeting America and a close ally Israel, claiming Israel is a democratic state [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=155.60000000000002s)]
*  whose military strictly adheres to the laws of war. Well, this is clearly completely and utterly [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=161.04s)]
*  deranged. Donald Trump has spent the last few days justifying the ethnic cleansing of [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=166.0s)]
*  Gaza on the grounds it's hell on earth. It's a demolition site, as he said, inhospitable to life. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=172.48s)]
*  The only explanation for that is because Israel carpet bombed Gaza, which is how Joe Biden [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=177.92s)]
*  described it. The man who armed the carpet bombing, that itself is a grave war crime. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=184.23999999999998s)]
*  Now, two US government agencies concluded last April Israel was deliberately preventing the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=189.11999999999998s)]
*  essentials of life from getting to the people of Gaza, the main plank of the current ICC case, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=193.76s)]
*  I should note, and that is a war crime. While Israeli leaders and officials made clear from [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=198.23999999999998s)]
*  the beginning they were committing war crimes as well. It is exceptionally rare for criminal intent [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=203.12s)]
*  in such circumstances to be so brazenly and repeatedly and unapologetically stated [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=210.72s)]
*  that the Minister of Defence, Yov Galan, of course, subject to an arrest warrant from the ICC, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=216.16000000000003s)]
*  who declared on 9th October 2023 that Israel was imposing a complete siege on Gaza. No electricity, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=220.72s)]
*  no food, no water, no fuel, everything is closed. We are fighting human animals and we are acting [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=226.16000000000003s)]
*  accordingly. Or indeed, the Israeli general Ghassan Alyan, who is in charge of Koga, the Israeli [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=231.36s)]
*  military civilian arm, who said on the same day Hamas became ISIS and the citizens of Gaza are [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=236.24s)]
*  celebrating instead of being horrified. Human animals are dealt with accordingly. Israel has [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=242.08s)]
*  imposed a total blockade on Gaza. No electricity, no water, just damage. You wanted hell, you will [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=246.16000000000003s)]
*  get hell. Making clear no distinction there existed in the minds of the Israeli authorities [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=251.60000000000002s)]
*  between the civilian population and military targets. The civilian population had collective [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=257.04s)]
*  guilt in their mind and they would suffer collective punishment, which he made clear there were no [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=261.92s)]
*  subtle terms. They made clear from the start they were going to commit hideous war crimes. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=266.88s)]
*  To find them guilty, you just need to read out what they said. We could go on. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=272.08s)]
*  Now the threats of the ICC are long-standing. Joe Biden denounced the ICC when the chief [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=275.92s)]
*  prosecutor first made his request. Last May, Republican senators sent the ICC chief prosecutor [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=280.4s)]
*  a letter threatening him and his staff, declaring, target Israel and we will target you, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=285.92s)]
*  adding they will sanction your employees and associates and bar you and your families from [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=290.96s)]
*  the United States, concluding you have been warned. Let's call these people, they are gangsters. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=294.16s)]
*  Now Karim Khan, the chief prosecutor, was asked about this by CNN's Christiane Amanpour last year. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=300.8s)]
*  You have been warned. Is that a threat? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=307.44000000000005s)]
*  I think that's the plain meaning of it in English. But you know, there's hotheads everywhere and [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=312.16s)]
*  there's people that are mature statesmen and stateswomen and leaders. There are those that [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=319.52s)]
*  have fidelity to something greater than themselves, whether it's their constitutions, but ultimately [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=324.71999999999997s)]
*  it's the rule of law. Now, of course, this situation, unfortunately, lies on the San Andreas [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=328.88s)]
*  fault of international politics and strategic interests. And of course, I've had some elected [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=335.52s)]
*  leaders speak to me and be very blunt. This court is built for Africa and for thugs like Putin, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=342.56s)]
*  was what one senior leader told me. We don't view it like that. This court is the legacy of Nuremberg. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=350.8s)]
*  This court is a sudden indictment of humanity. This court should be the triumph of law over power [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=359.68s)]
*  and brute force. Grab what you can, take what you want, do what you will. And we're going to [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=367.36s)]
*  simply be, we're not going to be dissuaded by threats or any other activities because in the end, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=372.96000000000004s)]
*  we have to fulfill our responsibilities as prosecutors, as the men and women of the office, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=380.08000000000004s)]
*  as judges, as the registry, to something bigger than ourselves, which is the fidelity to justice. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=386.88s)]
*  And we're not going to be swayed by the different types of threats, some of which are public and [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=392.40000000000003s)]
*  some maybe are not. Very instructive what he was told there. This court is built for Africa and for [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=397.28s)]
*  thugs like Putin. And that sums it up. The West can behave as it so wishes, it is above the law, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=401.76s)]
*  it has impunity. Now, as is, some Western signatures to the ICC have said they're going [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=406.32s)]
*  to refuse to act on these arrest warrants, like Italy, like France, like Poland. Britain has been [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=412.47999999999996s)]
*  not exactly clear. They're willing to destroy whatever remains of the world order to protect [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=418.23999999999995s)]
*  Israel from the charge of genocide. What does all this mean for the ICC? Well, let's listen to this [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=422.71999999999997s)]
*  former ICC official, Eric Ritter, on Al Jazeera. Given the US and Israel don't recognize the [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=426.8s)]
*  authority of the ICC, what effect will sanctions actually have? And how soon? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=433.2s)]
*  Well, it a lot depends on whether the 125 countries that are party to the Rome Statute, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=440.64s)]
*  which created the ICC, choose to block the worst effects of this action. But if they don't defend [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=447.52s)]
*  the court, this executive order poses an existential threat to the ICC's ability [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=454.88s)]
*  to function not just in the situation of Palestine, but really in all situations before the court, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=462.64s)]
*  including Ukraine, Myanmar, Sudan, Afghanistan, and others. Governments and companies may try [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=467.6s)]
*  to support just the Ukraine investigation, for example. But services like banking services or [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=474.64s)]
*  provision of software can be used by the court across situations. And so companies and governments [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=481.36s)]
*  may choose to try to avoid providing those services, or individuals may choose to avoid [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=489.28000000000003s)]
*  providing support to the court out of fear of retribution from the US government. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=495.2s)]
*  This threatens the ICC's ability to hire and retain staff. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=501.76s)]
*  And, you know, again, though, there are actions the member states can take to defend the court. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=506.48s)]
*  And I think the onus is particularly on the European Union here. And it's good to hear Ursula von der Leyen [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=516.96s)]
*  rhetorically commit to defending the court. But will the commission issue a blocking statute [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=523.44s)]
*  to nullify the effects of this executive order on the territory of the European Union? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=530.88s)]
*  I just want to end here actually by just noting the role of so-called liberals. I'm not a liberal, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=535.52s)]
*  I'm a socialist. But where are these self-described liberals? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=539.92s)]
*  What's more liberal, supposedly, than defending international law, the rules-based order, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=545.8399999999999s)]
*  the rule of law? So many of them are so often self-righteous, you know, like to see themselves [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=551.1999999999999s)]
*  as the good guys in the episode of the West Wing that they clearly all think they live in. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=556.16s)]
*  And yet many of them acquire are actively complicit. Where are their great polemics, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=560.8s)]
*  their searing speeches defending liberalism and the liberal order, the rule of law? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=567.92s)]
*  The utter bankruptcy of Western liberalism has been brutally exposed by this genocide. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=575.4399999999999s)]
*  And it has essentially just willingly killed itself off in favour of the rise [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=582.8s)]
*  of right-wing authoritarianism. Very instructive, isn't it? And the truth is the US is a declining [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=586.64s)]
*  power. It's a superpower in crisis. Trumpism is a morbid symptom of that crisis, I would also say [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=591.76s)]
*  an accelerant. The case against Israel is overwhelming. It is guilty of some of the worst [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=597.4399999999999s)]
*  crimes of our age. And Trump and other Western leaders are complicit in those crimes. And justice [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=602.64s)]
*  must come to them as well. Please like and subscribe with your thoughts, your comments, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=607.6s)]
*  help us as we expand this challenge, which is what this is, to a bankrupt mainstream media. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=612.1600000000001s)]
*  You can see us expanding all over Instagram, TikTok, Facebook. Do I have to call it X? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=619.2800000000001s)]
*  That's thanks to you, patreon.com. We will do best we can to present a growing challenge. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=627.2s)]
*  I do have to write a book at the moment, Call the Fall of the West, notably, but [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=634.08s)]
*  that alongside this and then when I get there done, we'll expand even more. Anyway, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=637.6s)]
*  take care. Speak to you in a bit. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7tMhZqwvU&t=641.2s)]
