Video Description: After the Houthis staged attacks on shipping in the Red Sea - claiming a defence of Palestinians - Britain and the US have staged attacks on Yemen. But who are the Houthis, what is the war in Yemen all about - and why would more bombs on Yemen work given a Saudi-led coalition armed and backed by the US and Britain has bombed the country for years? What's the actual alternative to bombing - and what kind of catastrophe could beckon?

I'm joined by the brilliant Dr. David Wearing, Lecturer in International Relations at the University of Sussex and author of Angloarabia.

# Why Bombing Yemen Could Spark Catastrophe - w Dr. David Wearing
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmCEKvdWOxo)
*  Hello, so yet another Western military invention in the Middle East which are I would say well known
*  for their success and general triumph. This time it is of course the US and the UK bombing Yemen
*  that is after the dominant Houthi movement there which rules much of Yemen after a particularly
*  gruesome civil war there which has gone on for many years, declared that in solidarity with the
*  people of Gaza they would stage attacks on ships, major shipping routes, Britain and America have
*  gone well we will now retaliate with bombing. That is just the general gist of what's happened,
*  it's a little bit more complicated than that, that crazy, but we have the best possible expert
*  to talk us through what the hell is going on, what the hell is going to happen plausibly and what an
*  alternative is because that question is going to be asked what would you do then, what would you do?
*  So we're joined by the brilliant David Waring who is a lecturer in international relations at the
*  University of Sussex, he wrote a brilliant book called Angola Arabia which after this you should
*  all google and then buy. Hi David, how you doing? Hello. Yemen right, so you had the Arab Spring in
*  2011 and in many countries you had revolutions, Yemen was no exception, what happened, I mean it
*  doesn't just start in 2011 because the Houthi movement predates that, so who are the Houthis,
*  what happened between 2011 and 2015 basically? So the Houthis are a paramilitary group who
*  originate in the northern part of Yemen, this mountainous region in the northern part of Yemen,
*  who have this kind of antipathy with the central government, who aren't too impressed with the
*  Saudis as well and what they perceive as Saudi interference in Yemen. The Houthis are kind of
*  religious fundamentalists but also kind of anti-western, there's some religious convergence
*  with Iran as well, not complete but it's enough for them to build up a kind of relationship with
*  Iran. The central government in Yemen, supported by the British and the Americans, throughout the
*  2000s, this war and terror period, wages repeated small wars against the Houthis which achieved
*  nothing, the Houthis are resilient, they withstand this assault. 2011, as you mentioned, these are
*  about risings around the region including in Yemen, the president Ali Abdullah Saleh who's been
*  fighting these small wars against the Houthis is overthrown, replaced by an interim government.
*  Now at this point that president who's been fighting all these wars with the Houthis somehow
*  enters into an alliance of convenience with the Houthis and together they topple the interim
*  government and try and take over. Now from sort of 2014, 2015 when that happens onwards there's a
*  war between the Houthis and Saleh on the one hand and pretty much everyone else in Yemen on the other
*  hand and the interim government is backed by an intervening coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the
*  United Arab Emirates and behind them the British and Americans who are providing all the arms for
*  the Saudis and the Emirates to use to fight this war. The Houthis grow stronger and stronger,
*  the Saudis thought that this whole war could be done and dusted in a few months, they in fact they
*  got stuck in the quagmire for seven years, the Houthis get stronger, they sweep Saleh aside
*  and now they're in command. Where we are now seven years on, seven or eight years on from that war
*  starting, is that the Houthis have gotten from a small paramilitary force in the northern part of
*  Yemen to being effectively a para-state controlling the most populous part of Yemen, the north and
*  west and controlling this bit of coastline crucially and next to the Red Sea past which
*  15 to 20 percent of global shipping flows. So that's a long period of various people
*  bombing the Houthis and that's not new from the Houthis point of view and it hasn't made them
*  weaker put it that way and that's exactly where we are today. So it's interesting this because
*  a lot of people Yemen has not been on the radar, something I've written about over the years,
*  I've been to a Yemeni refugee camp that children who've gone through terrible traumas drawing
*  pictures of not of you know cats and animals but kids on swings but rather of dead bodies in the
*  streets with blood, really horrible. I'm just wondering I mean a lot of people think well this
*  is a new intervention you know this is Britain and America they're bombing it but the point is
*  that actually the Saudi-led coalition has been armed and backed, not just armed and backed by the
*  US and Britain but we're more involved than that aren't we? Oh yeah I mean this war between 2015
*  and 2022 which is kind of on a period of unofficial truce now and going through negotiations
*  but which ran with sort of full-blown war for seven years. This was one of the worst wars in
*  the face of the planet for a long time and Britain and America were right in the thick of it in the
*  sense that it wasn't them doing the fighting it was as I mentioned the Saudi-led coalition
*  largely through airstrikes, Saudi airstrikes, supporting forces on the ground and also a blockade
*  on the Houthi controlled parts of Yemen. So indiscriminate bombing and a blockade of the
*  area in which your enemies are located which obviously will sound familiar to people who've
*  been following the war in Gaza it's basically the same kind of collective punishment an attempt to
*  terrorise and coerce and punish the population to get them to turn against the rebel group.
*  It's a kind of former state terrorism basically and you can see this kind of former violence going
*  right back. Well the British and Americans were actively facilitating this it wasn't just a question
*  of you know the the arms that the Saudis and the Emiratis were using were arms that had been
*  salted them in the dim and distant past and now happen to be being used in Yemen. It was a Britain
*  and America providing an ongoing supply of bombs, missiles, spare parts and components,
*  maintenance of these jets, training of the pilots. The British and Americans facilitated this aerial
*  bombing campaign. The Americans were providing mid-air refuelling for the jets and the jets
*  were on their you know bombing runs these indiscriminate bombing runs and so Britain and
*  America really were accessories to mass murder to put it in sort of you know basic like real terms
*  throughout this period. They facilitated this whole thing just as they're facilitating what's
*  happening in Gaza at the moment and so you know the antipathy that the Houthis have towards the
*  British and the Americans isn't something that comes out of nowhere. It's rooted in that and
*  of course I mean this is a wider story but just to note that Britain was the colonial power in
*  Aden in southern part of Yemen for a long period of time from the 1830s until the 1960s
*  and so people in Yemen have long you know they have memories just as people
*  just as we do in this country. They're aware of that history you know and so that antipathy
*  goes a long way back and it's based on something. I mean there's been a huge terrible
*  human consequence hasn't there, the Saudi led war in Yemen. Around 300,000 it's believed have been
*  killed and 15,000 directly from Saudi led airstrikes and I make that point to make a
*  petite recent point I've made previously which is when we look at Gaza and we're looking often at
*  the moment at the death toll is the violent death toll. People directly killed by weapons but in
*  war most people don't die as a direct consequence of the violence they die of other reasons
*  including the collapse of the medical and the healthcare system and that has happened
*  and that's been one of the big contributing factors of course to how many people have died
*  in Yemen but you know I mean that scale of humanitarian catastrophe is something which
*  most people aren't aware of but I mean it is the consequences isn't it of a UK and US backed
*  war. This isn't just a new thing that happened this is just yet more violence which the UK and
*  the US have been involved in. Yeah I mean that humanitarian crisis as you say it's a really
*  important point that you raised the fact that you know large amount of people will be killed by
*  indiscriminate bombing but the damage to healthcare the damage to the economy the undermining of
*  people's ability to secure the means of survival is actually more dangerous you know I mean there
*  was a report from the Sada Children I think this was in 2017 so only a couple of years after the
*  war started they reported that 85 000 infant children so talking about children from the age
*  of 0 to 18 talking about children under the age of five according to Sada Children's estimate had
*  died as a result of starvation or disease in Yemen as a result of this man-made humanitarian
*  catastrophe man-made humanitarian catastrophe created in no small part not exclusively because
*  the Houthis had their role as well but in no small part created by our allies and I can't stress this
*  enough with our help with our active assistance and so you know I think people who are you are
*  shocked and unsettled by what they see in Gaza now I think it's really important to stress that
*  this isn't something new and unique I mean Western violence often looks like this you know we could
*  talk about a whole host of precedents in the colonial era and after that but just in the last
*  few years you know this horrific humanitarian crisis names us by the UN for a period is the
*  world's worst humanitarian crisis the um the crisis in Yemen man-made as I say and we're
*  seeing it repeating here I think what's shocking about Gaza is that in some ways it's almost worse
*  you know and as people both of us we followed this war in Yemen throughout
*  it's particularly shocking because I think I just you know Yemen struck me as just sort of
*  catastrophe of biblical proportions and yet we've got something that's happening in Gaza now
*  which somehow is even is even worse in terms of you know proportion of people affected in the
*  territory proportion of people killed well that's the thing isn't it yeah because it's basically
*  there's lots of people have tried to play water boundary and with Yemen people who did not care
*  about Yemen before Gaza happened why don't you say anything about Yemen well we have we can talk
*  about Yemen for years actually um but the this isn't a belittle the horror of Yemen Yemen has a
*  much much bigger population than Gaza its population is about 33 million the pre-war
*  population of Yemen was about 2.2 million in any case so when we talk about the figures
*  the horrible figures in Yemen it's over a much longer period of time yeah there's a there's a
*  much bigger population yeah but what what I was wondering is a lot you know one response I could
*  just come up with is to go well does it really matter about UK US bombing actually other than
*  you know the if there were civilian fatalities that obviously that is a horrible thing which we
*  need to condemn but I mean I mean in a crude cold calculating way which is if or if Britain is
*  and the US are already getting the Saudi-led coalition do their dirty work and that's failed
*  the Houthis are still there thriving on their own terms after so many years does it really matter
*  if the British and the US say well we're doing it directly now we're not just it's not just the
*  Saudi-led coalition doing it we're now doing it directly in a sense you could go well it doesn't
*  really matter it's just a PR stunt but is it actually potentially a lot more serious than that
*  yeah it could be I mean look the Saudis have been trying to get out of this for a while you know the
*  war sort of ground to a halt in 2022 there's been an informal truce and there's been negotiations
*  um getting close to a kind of peace deal until this happens you know and what little I've been
*  able to read in the past or 24 hours from reports from Yemenis on the ground is this kind of
*  well we lived through that and we thought we were getting to peace and now here we are again
*  um you know it's worth saying that if you can't defeat the Houthis with 20 years of bombing by
*  various different people it's difficult to see how a few extra missiles last night is gonna is
*  gonna change much I don't see the Houthis being deterred particularly from from the disruption
*  ever causing in the Red Sea um and these these airstrikes you know they can they can have an
*  effect in the sense that you know it needs this escalatory dynamic right I mean the British and
*  the Americans appear to seriously believe that they can deter the Houthis through you know a
*  night of direct airstrikes on Yemen it strikes me as incredibly unlikely the Houthis look confident
*  to me they've come out of seven years of war stronger than ever you know they fought off
*  original military power backed by the world's leading military powers um they looked extremely
*  extremely confident and ready for more you know they've been able to rally a lot of support to
*  their side within Yemen seemingly certainly in the wider uh middle east they've been able to
*  present themselves as you know the one one of the few serious military forces that are pushing back
*  against Israel um I'm sure they welcome this they certainly appear to welcome this and
*  the danger is for the for the region and for the world that they don't do what the British
*  and the Americans do which is take the hint and stop but rather they carry on they carry out
*  another strike on shipping maybe even on British and American shipping and at that point what did
*  the British and Americans do because the dangerous escalatory logic is that you take certain measures
*  expecting your opponent to then back down but your opponent doesn't back down and then your
*  credibility is at stake you've invested your credibility in your apparent ability to to deter
*  your enemy when your enemy isn't deterred you have to up the ante and then they from the same point
*  of view also up the ante and then where are we I mean the big danger is now you have a regional
*  conflagration which doesn't just disrupt shipping in the Red Sea but ends up spreading to the Persian
*  Gulf which is the artery through which a youth proportion of the world's oil flows and then you've
*  got a huge inflationary shock but put aside the carnage that we'll see in the middle east beyond
*  even what I've seen now for the rest of the world you're going to have a huge inflationary shock
*  that's going to impact on politics in the west if you're Joe Biden um not only losing support
*  from certain groups because of what you're doing in Gaza but you're going to start losing support
*  because of your you know you'll be blamed for your stewardship of the economy if inflation goes back
*  up and then you end up with Donald Trump in the White House so the thing about these dynamics is
*  their impacts can spread around the world in all these unpredictable ways and the idea that chucking
*  a few missiles at the problem is a prudent sensible serious approach is exactly what what we need is
*  de-escalation in this moment serious diplomacy to de-escalate because this is getting really out
*  of hand now it's really concerning yeah i'm just a couple of the questions i mean also firstly
*  about also what this is going to do in terms of Houthi support i mean we've seen a huge rally
*  in the Yemeni capital sana of about a million people and that's I mean as I said the population
*  is about 32.3 million I mean admittedly not the entire population is ruled by the Houthis but as
*  you said the bulk so it's a huge number of people and I don't know some might say well you know it's
*  an authoritarian movement and how do they mobilize people I don't know but what's your thoughts on
*  what that means and also because often there's this presentation of the Houthis is they're just
*  basically an Iranian proxy and they are backed by Iran they are they have their weapons provided by
*  Iran that kind of thing but they do have their own base clearly in Yemen that is authentic so will
*  this just basically for the Houthis it will help mobilize them and present themselves as we are
*  you know while most of the Arab states are just standing by while Ghalas is being slaughtered
*  whatever the actual reality of what the Houthis are actually doing but that's how they'll present
*  themselves won't it that's how they'll support yeah yeah yeah as I say just this this strengthens them
*  this is what they're looking for um you know I won't pretend that de-escalating this is going to
*  be easy you know um it will be hard and it will involve diplomacy and the tricky thing is as you
*  rightly say the Houthis are not just puppets or proxies of Iran you know that's a the simplistic
*  way that a lot of mainstream coverage looks at these things in the middle age this you know this
*  actor is a proxy of Iran that act as a proxy of Iran yeah yeah yeah exactly that that kind of
*  you know and it can boil things down you know to a really simplistic degree the Houthis do have a
*  really productive from their point of view relationship with Iran they've really which
*  they've really benefited from but they also have as you've indicated their own interest their own
*  agency apparently in 2015 the Iranians didn't want the Houthis to go down and seize the capital
*  they argued against that but the Houthis did it anyway so it gives you a sense of the degree of
*  independence they have but nevertheless if there's going to be de-escalatory diplomacy and I really
*  hope the Americans cotton on to the fact that they've got nowhere else to go with their current
*  approach and they're going to have to do something else if there really is de-escalatory diplomacy
*  which has to include Iran then it's not going to be a case of well we'll just do a deal with the
*  Iranians formally or informally and then the Iranians will yank the Houthis chain and that will be it
*  it the Iranians will have to exert what influence they can over the Houthis but
*  you know and we would have to hope that that succeeds but certainly that approach has got a
*  far more it is far more promising and far more likely to have some success than as I say just
*  throwing some missiles at the problem which is a kind of you know it's a usual case of military
*  action it's a case of looking serious rather than actually being serious yeah I mean on that
*  because the question is always thrown at us is well what would you do then and at this point I
*  find that quite insulting because they said that about Afghanistan and look what happened they said
*  that about Iraq and look what happened they said that about Libya look what happened I think at this
*  point I'd have some introspection if I were these people and yet they walk from crime scene to crime
*  scene splattered with more and more blood still presented as learned elder statesmen who we should
*  or listen to on their wisdom or foreign policy well were the crazy extremists who were proven
*  wrong in the worst possible way over and over again but they'll still say it what would you do
*  and the point they would make here is look whatever you think about how we got here these are the
*  shipping lanes the global economy does depend on it we have to take action that's just the way the
*  world works we our local populations would expect us to when they suddenly see price rising they
*  work out why and it's because we take action so I suppose the argument then to these people I mean
*  the obvious answer would be if he stopped stopped enabling a massacre in Gaza whatever the Houthis
*  in fact just happen to be here yeah clearly but I mean just in terms of how we get out of this because
*  that is the Houthi demand and and you know again just on that you know I think a lot of the world
*  because there's such a west-centric view of looking at this a lot of the world is looking at the west
*  at the moment and a lot of them did not have illusions in western moral authority in the first
*  place for good reason but now they're seeing for most of us in the world they say oh I see so the
*  west will take shipping lanes seriously but not living human beings seriously they'll intervene
*  to stop saying the shipping lanes they're only intervening to save Palestinian citizens so I'm
*  just wondering about what you think about you know that that alter you know in terms of the
*  alternatives and why it's shouted down and what we do instead yeah yeah I mean before I was talking
*  to you I did interview on Times radio with um with Davidson look at you yeah that was great
*  um and you know she was giving me that line which was you know you have to do something don't you
*  and you do have to do something you have to do something that works you know um and
*  and
*  as I said you know just throw more missiles at the problem doesn't work you know that that proposition
*  has been tested you know not that I don't necessarily want to analyze this purely from
*  the west point of view and what works for the west but you know I think you know people at home
*  watching this are going to be in their arguments with family and friends and colleagues and what
*  have you are going to hear well what would you do and the the answer to that is you know if we're
*  thinking about what's happening in in the Red Sea and how inflation is going to affect all of us
*  you know I I don't want more inflation any more than anyone else it's like it's painful for all
*  of us this stuff the best way to get past that is to de-escalate the conflict through diplomacy
*  Gaza is at the heart of this I think an increasing number of people understand that there has to be a
*  ceasefire in Gaza um pure you know above all because of the horrible effect on the Palestinians
*  above all because we're you know we're watching the world's first live stream genocide and in
*  addition to that because it's dragging the whole region into what could be a truly awful conflict
*  and in addition to that because it's dragging the world into a crisis which um you know will impact
*  on the global economy seriously and which could in turn have loads of knock-on effects in American
*  politics for example which you know we none of us in the world want to need a fascist in the
*  White House but that's the way it's going in part because of because of this and I cannot stress
*  enough again you know we've seen western military action time and time again not have not not reached
*  the goals that the perpetrators set themselves it's not only that it's criminal these various
*  interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan and you know the backing of the Saudis in Yemen the backing
*  of Israel in Gaza it's the worst thing is that it's criminal but it's also true that you know
*  they don't even get the results they're looking for yeah you know when have they won when have
*  they won on their own terms you know so all these things are important to bear in mind if we want
*  this Red Sea crisis to stop and if we want to avoid the return of really high inflation then
*  we'll need to push for we need to push for diplomacy and above all that means a ceasefire in
*  Gaza not just for the you know above all for the for the sake of the people in Gaza but for the
*  rest of us as well because this is getting worse and worse which is why I think reframing this is
*  we said that the onslaught against Gaza will lead to a human catastrophe it has and we also said it
*  risks a major regional escalation it has and the answer to that isn't to go well we'll just up the
*  ante with the regional escalation is to deal with what we warned about the root of the problem the
*  onslaught against Gaza which will deal with two things which is the human catastrophe which is
*  man-made and the regional escalation just finally end then on that kind of pity finale do you fear
*  this actually threatens catastrophe and I don't just mean that it's the twofold it's the catastrophe
*  for people in Yemen who've suffered so much as we said and the catastrophe for the world unless
*  there is a major de-escalation yeah yeah I do and you know like I don't think a region a full-blown
*  regional war involving you know Iran and the UK and the US fighting directly with Iran is likely
*  I don't think you can completely rule it out because de-escalate an escalation can take you
*  to all sorts of places but you know some risks they don't have to be probable for you to take
*  them really seriously you know it may be something that's not so likely but would be so absolutely
*  catastrophic if it happened that you have to take it very seriously and even if it's not something
*  quite that bad already this disruption is having an effect on the oil price it's disrupting car
*  production in Germany increasingly the more this disruption goes on in the Red Sea which could get
*  much much worse I would expect it to get much much worse if there's not a change of course then yeah
*  that can have a serious effect that can stop inflation coming down if we're talking about
*  the effect on the wider world and if we go back to Gaza you know I mean it seems to me that Netanyahu
*  will be loving this as well the longer this war goes on the big thing this war has achieved
*  apart from lots of dead people is to keep Netanyahu in power you know it seems to me at least he I don't
*  about the rest of the regime but at least he want an escalation you know they want this they want all
*  of this in the realm of violence the minute it goes to the realm of diplomacy and the end of war
*  stops then there's a reckoning with Netanyahu domestically so you know there were all these
*  all these factors pushing it you know pushing the escalatory dynamic and you know we in British
*  civil society and around the world for all sorts of reasons for the sake of people of Palestine for
*  the sake of the people of Yemen but the sake of the rest of the world in various different ways
*  really need to push for a de-escalation for a ceasefire in Gaza but a wider de-escalation as well
*  David fantastic stuff we've I think a real masterclass there I think we've covered that
*  in the detail that I've acquired so make sure you get this sort of spread the word everyone we need
*  to make sure people are aware that this does actually threaten disaster threatens a real real
*  massive escalation with potentially catastrophic consequences so do like and subscribe and share
*  the video but Dave thank you so so much for joining us thank you
