# Rafah Invasion Means 'CATASTROPHE Upon Catastrophe' - w/. Unicef's James Elder
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54)
*  Now, I spoke to James Elder, who's spokesperson for UNICEF, who I'm sure you all know all [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=0.0s)]
*  about, last month, and he was in Rafa at the time, which is obviously in the south of Gaza, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  where most of Gaza's population have been forced to flee. They were told that was a [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=10.58s)]
*  safe zone, that was a safe place for them to go. Rafa now is under assault by the Israeli [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=14.0s)]
*  states. The Rafa crossing, the key point for where aid comes in, has been captured by them. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=19.48s)]
*  James, you're a very busy man, so just get straight to the point. Just talk us through [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=25.0s)]
*  this. Firstly, you were there in Rafa. What were the conditions there, as was? Just that [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=29.8s)]
*  idea that most of the people there, most of Gaza's population fled to Rafa on the basis [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=36.24s)]
*  it's a safe zone. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=40.84s)]
*  Well, exactly, Owen. People who have come to Rafa, most of them have lost a home. Let's [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=42.08s)]
*  start with the basics that they've done, what people around the world do, which is save [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  up, save up, sometimes for generation, put it in brick and mortar. That's been destroyed [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=51.36s)]
*  So they've come to this realization that their home, their earnings, everything, quite possibly [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=56.44s)]
*  a loved one killed at the same time. So with all that trauma, they've moved three or four [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=60.64s)]
*  times, been told, right, go here. Then they live in a tent. Okay. They're living a tent [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=64.52s)]
*  in a sandy block. It's a day long wait for a shower. So for a teenage girl or a grandmother [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=68.8s)]
*  or a pregnant woman, three and a half thousand people to a shower. So they wait all day for [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=74.88s)]
*  that. And they've moved from a three bedroom house. This was their home. Now they're in [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=80.0s)]
*  a tent. Now every night remembering and Rafa still, this is not just happened now. For [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=84.4s)]
*  the last two months, it's a relentless bombardment. Every night I had this moment when I stayed [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=89.16000000000001s)]
*  there and I felt like I was lying in a coffin. You lie there, you come to learn these ridiculous [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=93.88000000000001s)]
*  things about how close a bomb is landing. Okay. That's about 800 yards. That's about [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=99.16000000000001s)]
*  300 yards based on how much you're building shakes for them. It's a tent. All right. So [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=103.44s)]
*  every night, that's every night, there is no place for a child to recover from trauma [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=108.64000000000001s)]
*  because every night they go to bed and their parents have lost the ability to mask that [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=112.84s)]
*  this is a horror show. And now they're told to leave. They've got nowhere to go and we [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=117.0s)]
*  can get to that. But that's their moment right now. They're putting their things on the back [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=121.44s)]
*  of the car or donkey, whatever they've got, as long as they haven't got an elderly person [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  or as long as some of the children I saw have got amputations, they should be in a hospital. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=128.32s)]
*  There's no space given what's happened to kids. So they move somewhere, somewhere. They [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=132.24s)]
*  run for their lives with nowhere to go. I mean, just in terms of, I mean, I spoke to [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=137.24s)]
*  a Palestinian called Nahadeh, who I interviewed on this channel in Gaza. And he told me that [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=143.56s)]
*  they've been, we've been trying to get him out and his family, he said they've been [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  forcibly raffled from his season now as a Khanunis. We just reached, I can't describe [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=152.36s)]
*  what is Khanunis. It is totally destroyed. It's something like the end of the world movies, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=155.76000000000002s)]
*  horrible, sad, empty, death everywhere, no inhabitants. There's no, I mean, just that [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  point of the evacuation of Rafa, what that actually means. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=163.76s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. So Nahadeh is right. I've never, in my 20 years with UNICEF, I've never seen [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  anything like, like us, like Khanunis, the city right neighbouring, right neighbouring [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=173.56s)]
*  Rafa. So people get to return home, just to add to your trauma of bombardment, bombardment. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=179.23999999999998s)]
*  Then the last couple of weeks, they get to go back 360 degrees on everywhere you look. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  It is, it is rubble. So people can go there, but there's nothing there. Don't forget, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=189.28s)]
*  people need, need health services. So there's none of those. The largest remaining [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=193.0s)]
*  hospital, the European hospital, so named because it was from European donors. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=197.2s)]
*  That's on the edge. That's in Rafa. That's on the edge of this evacuation zone. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=201.8s)]
*  OK, so they move to a place where there's nothing, where there's nothing but rubble. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=205.84s)]
*  What's important to remember here is that we're told this will be a limited operation. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  We've got to move away from language because so often it's been disinformation. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=213.88s)]
*  People in Gaza see for their eyes what's happened. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=218.12s)]
*  When I was in Gaza the first time in November, we were told we were promised from the highest [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=221.12s)]
*  levels that the devastation, the ferocity from the north would not happen in the south. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=226.16s)]
*  Now, as you talk there about Nahida and what I've seen in Khanunis, it's every bit as [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=231.52s)]
*  ferocious, maybe more so. That happens in Rafa. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=236.36s)]
*  Not only do we see many, many more children and civilians killed, but there's almost [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=239.52s)]
*  nothing left of the Gaza Strip then. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=245.0s)]
*  And that's unfortunate. People in Rafa are thinking right now because that's what [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=247.08s)]
*  they come to learn. That's their experience. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=251.08s)]
*  I mean, I've got the impression that some people just they've been forced to move so [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=254.92000000000002s)]
*  often. They don't think there's anywhere to go. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=259.12s)]
*  Whatever they're told, they're not. Some just won't leave Rafa, will they? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=261.32s)]
*  No, some of them won't. Some of them can't. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=265.32s)]
*  Some of them are just stunned. I spoke to a friend, Rawan, gosh, yesterday anyway, the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=267.92s)]
*  first day when this latest horror show started happening, she'd been aware she may have to [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=273.40000000000003s)]
*  move her family home again, family home, grandmother. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=277.48s)]
*  Everyone's had to move in there. Her two dogs, they're all out. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=280.8s)]
*  They've got to go somewhere. She said, James, I don't even know what to pack. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=283.68s)]
*  She was frozen with fear. She just she's bemused by what's going on. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=286.88s)]
*  So some people don't have the means to move. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=292.2s)]
*  Some people are so traumatized. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=294.44s)]
*  There's a lot of sick children. There's a lot of malnourished children. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=296.36s)]
*  There's a lot of children with existing injuries. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=299.28s)]
*  Every single child is traumatized. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=301.04s)]
*  Where do they go? There's a place called Al Mawassi. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=303.12s)]
*  OK, that's sand. That is literally either a beach or sand. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=305.64000000000004s)]
*  And the numbers I spoke about with girls and mums queuing for a day for a shower. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=309.24s)]
*  It's much worse there. Khan Eunice's rubble. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=313.92s)]
*  They call it the middle area, Derry Bala. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=316.6s)]
*  Derry Bala literally has rivers of sewerage now because, of course, the sanitation system [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=318.76s)]
*  and the health and the sanitation workers have literally been blown up. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=323.96000000000004s)]
*  So when we told of safe zones, they call humanitarian zones now, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=327.68s)]
*  which is pretty ironic because I work for a humanitarian organization. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=331.44s)]
*  No, humanitarians are calling them that humanitarian zones or so-called safe zones [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=334.6s)]
*  legally and ethically. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=340.04s)]
*  They have to be more than just not being bombed. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=341.6s)]
*  They must also be places where there is a an amount of food, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=344.04s)]
*  water, medicine, protection on that will keep someone alive. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=347.76000000000005s)]
*  It's not there. It hasn't been there. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=351.12s)]
*  There's been no intention to put it there. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=353.04s)]
*  We've seen intention throughout this war. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=354.96000000000004s)]
*  Indiscriminate bombing shows an intention, not ensuring there is not [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=356.76000000000005s)]
*  the medical services available, in fact, a systematic devastation [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=360.44s)]
*  of medical services that shows intention. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=364.24s)]
*  So safe zones must have many qualities. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=367.16s)]
*  They have none of those. In fact, Al Mawassi, there was a little boy, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=369.76s)]
*  Mustafa, who Eunice met a couple of weeks ago. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=373.28000000000003s)]
*  Mustafa was in Al Mawassi. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=376.36s)]
*  The safe zone, the safest of all zones, was shot in the head [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=377.92s)]
*  while he was going to get parsley for his family dinner. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=381.88s)]
*  And when we met him, he died about a day later. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=384.56s)]
*  That's the reality behind the language. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=387.16s)]
*  Just a couple of other things. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=390.88s)]
*  The Rafah crossing is a crucial point for aid to get into Gaza. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=392.28s)]
*  And very little, not enough aid has gone in, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=396.35999999999996s)]
*  combined with the destruction of food, domestic food production and agriculture. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=398.71999999999997s)]
*  Roads being destroyed across Gaza. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=402.35999999999996s)]
*  UNRWA, the main humanitarian organisation, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=404.91999999999996s)]
*  having a massive attack on it based on no evidence we could go on. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=407.79999999999995s)]
*  But I mean, you know, Cindy McCain, by the way, the wife of the late [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=412.03999999999996s)]
*  John McCain, for those who don't know, is the head of the World Free Programme, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=415.59999999999997s)]
*  says famine is moving north down to the south. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=417.91999999999996s)]
*  What does this mean, the Rafah crossing now? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=420.76s)]
*  Now it's been taken in terms of aid getting in to those who are now [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=424.08s)]
*  facing forcible displacement from Rafah. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=428.88s)]
*  What does that mean in practice? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=431.76s)]
*  So that is the exact question now, right now, that every single aid worker [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=433.16s)]
*  still in Gaza is grappling with. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=436.8s)]
*  If you just try to imagine that people are hanging on, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=438.8s)]
*  they are literally psychologically and physically, they are on their last [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=441.72s)]
*  like six, seven months. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=445.36s)]
*  It's amazing what the human spirit can do. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=446.44s)]
*  And people are doing that, I have to say, on the back of their own generosity. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=448.6s)]
*  People are in Gaza are doing it because they've got four families [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=451.40000000000003s)]
*  living in their house and they take another family or two. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=454.56s)]
*  They share their last meal, but they are at breaking point. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=457.12s)]
*  Rafah is that lifeline. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=460.84000000000003s)]
*  Rafah is where almost almost all humanitarian aid comes through. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=462.40000000000003s)]
*  The Rafah is for you. It's the water. It's the medicine. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=467.0s)]
*  It's the fuel that keeps hospitals running. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=469.36s)]
*  We are down to a day or two maximum of fuel for the Gaza Strip. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=471.68s)]
*  OK, so no power in hospitals whatsoever. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=475.56s)]
*  So Rafah gate, Rafah crossing is that lifeline. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=478.44s)]
*  And right now, the idea of preventing a famine without Rafah, that's impossible. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=482.36s)]
*  The idea of doctors who've already been operating, you know, sometimes [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=487.03999999999996s)]
*  without anesthetic. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=491.0s)]
*  Now they'll do it without anesthetic or without light. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=492.08s)]
*  So it's hard on because it's catastrophe upon catastrophe. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=494.71999999999997s)]
*  And it's somehow we have to get our heads round that this is actually getting worse. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=498.76s)]
*  And just very finally, you obviously you're supposed to be UNICEF. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=504.64s)]
*  Your priorities, children and about half of the population of girls, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=508.76s)]
*  a half the population of those in Rafah, the kids. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=511.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, what what what? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=515.0s)]
*  I mean, where are kids after seven months of just the most unimaginable horror? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=516.16s)]
*  Many of them losing parents, many of them injured. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=521.72s)]
*  I mean, where what's the kind of plight of kids [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=524.64s)]
*  that you'd really want to emphasize right now? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=526.92s)]
*  Yeah, I think the thing that sticks out, there's many scenes that stick [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=529.12s)]
*  in my mind and stick in my senses as the smell of children's burning flesh [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=532.52s)]
*  on a bus as it came down from Sheafford, because it took three days for a bus [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=536.96s)]
*  to be allowed to go 20 miles. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=540.76s)]
*  There's the sight of children with just unspeakable wounds of war. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=543.6s)]
*  The burns, the burns, the shrapnel shrapnel designed to rip through concrete, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=547.52s)]
*  what it does to a child, the broken bones. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=551.6s)]
*  But oh, and there's also just the silence. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=553.9200000000001s)]
*  Last month, when I was last there, sitting in tents with children [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=555.72s)]
*  who've either had their whole family wiped out, whole family, mom, dad, sisters, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=559.12s)]
*  grandparents, I mean, I didn't think I'd ever say that sentence. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=563.96s)]
*  And now it's becoming normalized. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=567.4s)]
*  Almost just their silence. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=569.24s)]
*  When I sat with a little girl, Shima, I hadn't seen her for a couple of months. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=571.0s)]
*  I don't think she's spoken in a couple of months. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=574.96s)]
*  So we are in uncharted territory for the trauma of these children. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=576.96s)]
*  And yet tonight, as you say, more than one in two of all children, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=580.88s)]
*  the girls of Stripper and Raffa, they will go through as an intense bombardment [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=584.2s)]
*  as as we've seen, and it will be the same again. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=588.16s)]
*  And maybe the next day they pack up and they move for the sixth time. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=590.56s)]
*  So it heartbreakingly. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=593.68s)]
*  But it's got to be on the heartbreaking. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=596.68s)]
*  We've got to understand there are still a few people with power [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=598.3199999999999s)]
*  to put a stop to this, and they I wish they could see those images [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=602.12s)]
*  and hear that silence of children. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=605.8399999999999s)]
*  Well, James, I mean, they won't bet. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=608.68s)]
*  Well, they choose not to because the unfortunately that the footage [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=610.56s)]
*  is often there, but they've chosen not to. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=614.4s)]
*  But your voice has been so crucial in that in terms of getting across [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=616.12s)]
*  the sheer horror of what's happened. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=619.24s)]
*  And I know your work has just been so instrumental [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=621.04s)]
*  in terms of getting the message across about the apocalyptic conditions [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=623.68s)]
*  imposed on the people and children of Gaza. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=626.68s)]
*  So do share this video. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=629.48s)]
*  Make sure it gets out. Press like, subscribe, leave your comments. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=630.48s)]
*  So that encourages more people to watch it and listen to James. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=632.56s)]
*  But James, thanks so much for your work and thanks for joining us. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=635.6s)]
*  Always on. Thank you, mate. Good to see you. You too. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdg3wh9n54&t=639.32s)]
