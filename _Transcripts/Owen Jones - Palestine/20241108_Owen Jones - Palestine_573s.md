# Racist Israeli Football Thugs RAMPAGE In Amsterdam - And Media LIES
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [November 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY)
*  The Western media and Western politicians are lying to you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, police are shone, as you might think, but this is a very specific case study and it is deeply illustrative and deeply alarming. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=3.48s)]
*  Yesterday, racist Israeli football thugs rioted in Amsterdam while publicly inciting genocide, a criminal act under the 1948 Genocide Convention. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  This is the proximate cause of the violence. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=21.2s)]
*  Now, to be clear, I'm not a vigilante sort of guy and I'm not going to pretend to know exactly what happened in Amsterdam. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=24.52s)]
*  I wasn't there. I'm not on the ground. Nor would I ever justify violence against anyone unless in self-defense. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=30.0s)]
*  These are important caveats. I'll always stick to the truth and always be morally consistent. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=36.84s)]
*  What matters is you can say all that without erasing what we know happened in Amsterdam because we can all see and hear for ourselves. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  Now, the narrative being pushed is that there was a pogrom against Jewish people in Amsterdam yesterday, an exceptionally serious claim. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=50.12s)]
*  Very one of the most serious things you could possibly say. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=59.76s)]
*  Now, the King of Netherlands declares that we failed the Jewish community as the country did during World War Two. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=62.64s)]
*  And to be clear, the Netherlands suffered the worst impact of Nazi occupation of any Western European nation, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=68.75999999999999s)]
*  with three quarters of its pre-war Jewish population exterminated by the Nazis. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=76.0s)]
*  It is absolutely obscene, obscene to compare what happened to Amsterdam to that abomination. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=82.72s)]
*  Now, the headlines across the media simply betray the Maccabee Tel Aviv fans as victims. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=90.56s)]
*  Israeli soccer fans attacked in Amsterdam, authorities say, is a typical such headline. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=95.52s)]
*  Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU Commission, says, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=99.8s)]
*  outraged by last night's vile attacks targeting Israeli citizens in Amsterdam. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=103.2s)]
*  I just spoke with the Dutch prime minister. I strongly condemn these unacceptable acts. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=107.64s)]
*  Anti-Semitism has absolutely no place in Europe and we are determined to fight all forms of hatred. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=111.92s)]
*  She has shown more outrage here, I would note, than she has for the mass murder of tens of thousands of Palestinians by the Israeli state. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=118.28s)]
*  And she says all forms of hatred, but there was very specific forms of hatred being expressed on the streets of Amsterdam. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=125.0s)]
*  We'll come on to, which she clearly did not condemn. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=132.51999999999998s)]
*  Now, this is Napoli Bennett, he's the former Israeli prime minister. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=135.64s)]
*  At this very moment in Amsterdam, Jews are being attacked at multiple locations with brutal force. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=139.48s)]
*  It's pogrom in action. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=146.76s)]
*  I call upon the Dutch authorities, the Amsterdam authorities, to act immediately to prevent further injury and to prevent the loss of lives. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=149.0s)]
*  Now, before I put that in context, this is Sky News talking about Kristallnacht, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=160.12s)]
*  the murderous Nazi pogrom of Jews across Germany in 1938. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=165.64s)]
*  Some of those people who perhaps live in Amsterdam, those Jewish people that were remembering Kristallnacht, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=171.2s)]
*  which was a pogrom that happened before World War II, where Jews were targeted, of course, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=177.72s)]
*  you can understand how upset, how angry, how afraid they are that this happened in their own country in modern times. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=184.68s)]
*  Now, as the Israeli analyst, Mayrave Zonjain, puts it, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=192.0s)]
*  comparing what is happening in Amsterdam to the Holocaust, the pogroms in Russia, is absurd, offensive, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  and a cynical weaponization of anti-Semitism that undermines Jewish safety everywhere, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=200.4s)]
*  all things that will become further normalized in a second Trump Netanyahu period. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=204.88s)]
*  The Israeli leftist politician, Afa Kassif, a lone courageous voice amongst Jewish Israeli politicians in the Knesset, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=209.68s)]
*  the Israeli parliament, offers far more accurate coverage than the vast majority of the Western media, saying, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=215.44s)]
*  The spirit of Israeli fascism reached Amsterdam. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=220.35999999999999s)]
*  Fans going a violent rampage, beating, tearing Palestinian flags in the streets as if they were an occupying force [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=223.04s)]
*  and shouting Nazi slogans in favor of the extermination of a nation [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=228.32s)]
*  and whining when the situation degenerates into complete chaos and violence returns to them like a boomerang. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=232.68s)]
*  Any violence is obscene and unacceptable. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  Both sides should be held accountable for the hooliganism and Israeli media, as usual, approaches highs and distorts reality in the service of the authorities. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=239.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, not just the Israeli media, to be very clear. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  What actually happened? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=251.12s)]
*  These racist Israeli football hooligans went on the rampage. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=252.36s)]
*  Firstly, at the stadium, they jeered through a minute's silence for victims of Spain's floods [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=255.28s)]
*  because Spain has recognized the Palestinian state and spoken in support of arms embargo. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=259.76000000000005s)]
*  Do you know what they were chanting there? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=271.0s)]
*  There's no schools in Gaza because we killed all the kids. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=272.40000000000003s)]
*  What do you even say? What do you even say at this point? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=276.64000000000004s)]
*  This attempt to turn the world on its head and reality upside down. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=280.36s)]
*  This just simply cannot carry on. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=285.20000000000005s)]
*  This gaslighting. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=287.6s)]
*  They tore down Palestinian flags in Amsterdam. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=289.68s)]
*  Put the flag down on the table, so it won't fall. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=292.16s)]
*  Come on! [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  No, no, Israel! [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=303.6s)]
*  That's it, come on! [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=304.88000000000005s)]
*  No photos, no photos! [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=305.76000000000005s)]
*  No photos, no photos! [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=307.76000000000005s)]
*  No photos, no photos! [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=309.76000000000005s)]
*  No photos, no photos! [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=311.76000000000005s)]
*  No photos, no photos! [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=313.76000000000005s)]
*  They chanted death to the Arabs and let the IDF fuck the Arabs, which is incitement to genocide [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=316.64s)]
*  and a grave criminal offence in all countries which have ratified the 1948 Genocide Convention, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=320.8s)]
*  which of course includes the Netherlands and, I might add, Israel. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=326.0s)]
*  The BBC headline was, Israeli football fans attacked in Amsterdam, officials say, with a clip of this purported attack. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=345.76s)]
*  Indeed, you can see this clip for yourself. It does indeed look disturbing. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=369.59999999999997s)]
*  Just a minor issue here. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=375.76s)]
*  A Dutch photographer responded to someone sharing this clip with the following. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=387.03999999999996s)]
*  I'm the creator of this video. You're spreading fake news. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=390.48s)]
*  This is a group of Maccabee supporters starting a fight and beating one Dutch man. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=392.8s)]
*  Delete this content. I didn't give you permission. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=396.48s)]
*  A sto- I mean, that just sums it up, doesn't it? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=399.52s)]
*  That just sums it up. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=401.2s)]
*  The attempt to turn reality on its head. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=402.4s)]
*  Literally sharing a video of Maccabee fans attacking a Dutch man and then portraying it as though it's Maccabee fans, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=404.32s)]
*  Israeli fans, football hooligans being attacked. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=410.96000000000004s)]
*  And as dire as the vast majority of the coverage has been, even Sky News posted this. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=413.04s)]
*  And buried in the BBC coverage, its live feed is the following. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=434.88s)]
*  The BBC has spoken to a fan who went to the match last night who reports seeing Maccabee Tel Aviv fans, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=437.28000000000003s)]
*  supporters, on the Amsterdam Metro going up and down the carriages three or four times looking for a fight. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=442.24s)]
*  Connor says everyone was going into the city so everyone knew what was going to happen. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=446.88s)]
*  He has his shocks by the betrayal of the incident in the media, adding that the attacks were [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=449.92s)]
*  completely provoked and Palestinian flags were torn down the night before. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=453.6s)]
*  It then adds in italics as a disclaimer below it though. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=457.6s)]
*  As a reminder, authorities and the Netherlands have condemned anti-Semitic attacks on Israeli fans [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=459.84000000000003s)]
*  with Amsterdam's mayor reporting Israeli supporters were actively sought out for violence across the city. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=463.68s)]
*  Look, anti-Semitism is real. It's a danger. It's rising. It has to be confronted. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=468.96s)]
*  The constant attempt to dilute its meaning is beyond irresponsible. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=473.44s)]
*  If Russian football hooligans had chanted their way through a minute's silence for the dead victims of a country [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=477.84000000000003s)]
*  which had taken some sort of stance against the invasion of Ukraine by chanting in support of the mass murder of Ukrainian children, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=483.36s)]
*  if they had rampaged through a city ripping down Ukrainian flags, if they were chanting [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=491.52s)]
*  death to Ukrainians, if they violently attacked residents of that city, if they then suffered violence, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=496.32s)]
*  how would the media frame it? You know the answer to that question even though it's a total hypothetical [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=501.59999999999997s)]
*  because Russian football clubs are banned from these competitions, correctly, unlike Israeli football clubs, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=508.08s)]
*  even though that country is committing genocide, you are being lied to. You are not being told the truth. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=515.44s)]
*  Our media will consistently bend reality when it comes to Israel. That happens over and over again [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=523.36s)]
*  and they're showing more outrage and horror at what happened to Israeli football hooligans than they have [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=528.4s)]
*  for the mass slaughter of Palestinians, including so many children. The children, these hooligans, relished murdering. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=534.88s)]
*  Something's got to give guys. This is a disgrace and we cannot let our media consistently gaslight [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=545.6800000000001s)]
*  and lie to us, not least concerning one of the grave atrocities of our time. Please like and subscribe, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHlvgOPrWY&t=553.92s)]
