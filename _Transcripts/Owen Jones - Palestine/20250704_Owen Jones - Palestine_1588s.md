# Piers Morganâ€™s OUTRAGEOUS Gaza Hypocrisy EXPOSED - Our Clash This Week
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [July 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE)
*  This week, I went back on Piers Morgan's YouTube channel to discuss Israel's genocide against the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=0.0s)]
*  Palestinian people. Alas, Piers still will not accept that as a fact, or even the question of [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=4.88s)]
*  war crimes. Honestly, you're going to have to listen to this to believe what I'm actually [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=9.92s)]
*  telling you here. We had a lot to talk about. We got very heated, techy. You can see my ADHD on [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=14.08s)]
*  full display. Although I think it's fair to say he barracked me extensively. Morgan had an inadvertent [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=19.2s)]
*  gotcha, which circulated pretty extensively on Twitter. Alas, his team did not include natural [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=25.92s)]
*  response, which I think is pretty naughty behaviour, but whatever. I'm afraid that comes [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  with the territory. Keep to the end of this video, you can actually hear what I really said, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  rather than Piers just not letting me talk and then his team abruptly ending the clip. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=38.24s)]
*  Last time I went on the show was back in November 2023, towards the beginning of the genocide, when [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=45.52s)]
*  I argued it was genocide. That interview got approaching 2 million combined views on YouTube [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=49.68000000000001s)]
*  at the time. I would say it has stood the test of time in the most gruesome way possible. Check [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=53.6s)]
*  it out if you've got time. I do have reservations about going on the show because I've just cards [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=58.08s)]
*  on the table. I'm aware I'm a culture war prop, basically, for a section of his natural audience. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=62.56s)]
*  I do have self-awareness. And the last thing I want is for Palestine to be a culture war topic. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=67.44s)]
*  It's got a big reach. Channel's platformed a lot more pro-Palestinian voices than mainstream channels, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=71.68s)]
*  which is a damning indictment of them, of course. Some have said Piers has made progress in his [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=76.88s)]
*  views about what Israel's doing to the Palestinian people. Let's put that to the test. On the subject [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=81.12s)]
*  of Israel committing war crimes, I'm sorry, but what Piers says here is beyond absurd. Wait, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=85.68s)]
*  do you hear this logic? Is Israel ever allowed to defend itself? Israel needs to become a single [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=90.08000000000001s)]
*  state from the river to the sea in which Jewish people and Palestinians have equal rights. That's [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  what it needs to do. And until that happens, there will never be peace. I believe in a two-state [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=99.92s)]
*  solution where they all get the same human rights. On that I agree. Okay, but the reason [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=104.08000000000001s)]
*  war crimes, which you keep erasing because you keep... I want to see the evidence of the war crimes. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=108.16s)]
*  So when it comes, I will be the first to lambast them. They did them on camera. But I prefer [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=112.56s)]
*  due process on these things. Yeah, but when they declare to the world they're fighting human animals [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=118.48s)]
*  and they're going to... From the very beginning they said... I would call Hamas human animals. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=124.32s)]
*  They didn't say... They said civilians. They said the residents of Gaza. And they said they [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=128.16s)]
*  were cutting off, at the very beginning, water and fuel. Is a deliberate siege of... Do you know what? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=132.72s)]
*  Is a deliberate siege of a civilian population, is that a war crime? Yes or no? If you're asking [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=137.04s)]
*  me, do I agree with the occupation, no. No, I'm talking about the siege. They announced the siege. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=140.72s)]
*  No, they shouldn't have been able to do it. Is it a war crime or not? Probably. So you accept they [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=144.88s)]
*  committed war crimes from day one, then? I think the siege that they enacted because they were able [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=149.44s)]
*  to is indicative of the wider, bigger picture problem of the occupation. I agree with that. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=153.76s)]
*  So you conceded the point, then? You've conceded the point that this doesn't begin, obviously, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=159.04s)]
*  in the 7th October. Of course not. But then... I've never said that. You would never say... I think [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=163.2s)]
*  you should watch my show more often. Well, I've got life too... It's good to have you back. Life's [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  too short. It's good to have you back. But honestly, life isn't too short for you to be better [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=170.64s)]
*  informed about what I do on my show. Well, you don't accept Israel's committing genocide. You throw out [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=174.0s)]
*  all these generalisations which make me think you haven't watched it enough. You don't think Israel's [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=177.28s)]
*  committing genocide. You'd be better informed if you watched my show more often. Do you think Israel's [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=180.56s)]
*  committing genocide? As you were about our friend Bob Violet, who it turned out made you look a right [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=183.92s)]
*  chump. Well, you look more of a chump when you went and accepted Israel's committing genocide. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=189.04s)]
*  It's really easy to do. You could just say it now. When the ICC says it's genocide, I will say it's genocide. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=192.72s)]
*  So that's what we have. That's the only time you're awake. That's kind of the legal process I'm [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=197.28s)]
*  waiting for. OK, so you will never... But we're running out of time. OK. It's good to see you. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=200.48s)]
*  You don't think Hamas is committing war crimes either? Come back again soon. OK, fair enough. Hamas [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=205.12s)]
*  committed war crimes. You've not waited for the ICC to make their case? No, because Hamas broadcast [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=208.64s)]
*  it on their own GoPros. So have Israel. We're committing war crimes. It's literally on camera. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=213.2s)]
*  Do you know what? We've run out of time. Literally the studio has run out of time. However, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=218.56s)]
*  I would love to have you back more often. I enjoy our debates. Actually, we agree with a lot more [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=224.24s)]
*  than probably people think. You do need to move over to accepting it's genocide. I think that would [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=228.24s)]
*  be very important given your platform and influence. And there may be a time I do that. OK, well, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=232.88s)]
*  let's see. But it's good to see you. Appreciate it. Thank you. So we have to wait for due process for [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=236.56s)]
*  Israel's war crimes, but we don't have to with Hamas's war crimes because they were recorded. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=240.32s)]
*  Not to be rude here, but has he ever used the internet? Does he use the internet? I think he [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=244.0s)]
*  does, actually, quite extensively. What gives? No crime has been more documented on camera as it [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=247.76s)]
*  actually happened than Israel's genocide of the Palestinian people. It's a live streamed genocide. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=256.8s)]
*  It's called that for a reason. The mass indiscriminate destruction of civilian property. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=262.88s)]
*  Israeli soldiers gleefully posting war crimes as they sing and chant and celebrate committing war [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=268.15999999999997s)]
*  crimes. The mass butchery of civilians. I mean babies, hundreds, thousands maybe, cooked alive, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=273.36s)]
*  suffocated in a rubble and yet beheaded by Israeli weapons. Israeli soldiers gang raping [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=282.72s)]
*  Palestinian detainees on camera. Israel repeatedly broadcasting it's imposing a total siege in Gaza [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=287.28000000000003s)]
*  with itself a war crime. There are so many war crimes which are recorded. If I had to talk about [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=292.88s)]
*  them all, we'd be here forever. As well as the films, if we're going to go there, countless [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=297.84s)]
*  statements of criminal and genocide intent made by Israeli leaders and officials. Goodness me. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=303.12s)]
*  The idea that you don't need a process, a legal process, to judge that Hamas has committed war [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=308.96s)]
*  crimes because of camera evidence, but not Israel. I honestly just, I don't know what to say. How [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=314.24s)]
*  could you possibly argue that? But what about specifically the question of Israel committing [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=323.84s)]
*  genocide? What Israel's been doing in Gaza in the last few months has crossed, I don't think it is [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=327.91999999999996s)]
*  genocide. This is a real problem. No it's not a problem. It is a problem. You're a genocide [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=334.23999999999995s)]
*  denier. Hang on, I'm not a genocide denier. You are. Do you think Israel's committed genocide? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=339.2s)]
*  Yes or no? Do you know what genocide is? Yes I do. What do you think it is? Genocide is the intention [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  to destroy a people in whole or in part. Right. Do you not think that's what's happening to the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=348.08s)]
*  Palestinians of Gaza? Do you think they're trying to kill every Palestinian? That's not the definition [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=352.8s)]
*  of genocide. Which genocide is every single person being killed? I think what is happening is more [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=355.76s)]
*  ethnic cleansing, okay? It's how I would describe it. We can disagree. No no no no. You can disagree. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=360.08s)]
*  A lot of people think it is genocide. It has not been officially declared a genocide, right? What [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=365.44s)]
*  does that, obviously. It hasn't been officially declared yet. The International Court of Justice, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=370.40000000000003s)]
*  it's the only arbiter you could point at. No just quickly, they would have to take years to do that. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=373.36s)]
*  Okay let me just put you. I would call it, what Smodrich is talking about is ethnic cleansing. A [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=377.44s)]
*  consensus of genocide scholars believe Israel is committing genocide. Okay. And that includes just [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=381.68s)]
*  quickly Israeli scholars of genocide, Omar Bartov. He's a professor of genocide in Holocaust. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=385.92s)]
*  You're asking what I think. No no no no no. I don't know but this is what I'm going to ask you because we're [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=390.40000000000003s)]
*  talking about experts. People actually dedicate their lives. But many experts say it isn't. No name, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=393.2s)]
*  okay. Let me quickly, Omar Bartov, Raz Segal. These are only Israeli genocide scholars. Amos Goldberg, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=397.6s)]
*  Israeli professor of Holocaust history. Daniel Blattman, he's the head of the Institute. What's the ICC [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=404.72s)]
*  saying? The Israeli history, the ICC is still investigating and their charges are public. Now come [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=410.88s)]
*  up with another one. What's it saying? Well we don't know because they've been ordered not to face any [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=415.2s)]
*  future charges. We do know that it has not declared it a genocide. Yet. Right. Yeah. There's evidence [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=418.4s)]
*  it's potential. I agree with that. Can you tell me, I agree with that by the way. Can you give me a [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=423.12s)]
*  single word in. Can you tell me a single genocide scholar who thinks this isn't genocide. Let me get a word in. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=427.44s)]
*  Okay. My biggest problem with all of this is that you and I can argue the toss about numbers and this [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=432.8s)]
*  and that scale and genocide, the ethnic cleansing and so on. The reason we don't know more about how [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=438.56s)]
*  to assess this is because British and international journalists have not been allowed into Gaza to do [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=444.8s)]
*  their job. On that I think we completely agree, right. If the international journalists were allowed [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=450.72s)]
*  in they could get to the bottom of all this stuff. I think when they finally get in we are going to [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=455.04s)]
*  find evidence of appalling war crimes. I really believe that. I believe that is why the Israeli [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=459.12s)]
*  government continues to ban international journalists. So it may well be that when the [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=464.64s)]
*  journalists get in that you and I meet again and I say to you I believe the bar for genocide was met. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=469.28s)]
*  At the moment I don't. So can I just ask you, can I ask you, you spoke for a long time there. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=476.24s)]
*  I've read several genocide scholars, there's a consensus of genocide scholars who believe this [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=484.4s)]
*  is genocide. I'm asking you to name me one. I'll just name the ICC who have not ruled that yet. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=490.0s)]
*  We don't know that. We do. Sorry, the ICC, just quickly, is this true or not? Do you know this? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=495.04s)]
*  The ICC have ordered any future charges cannot be made public. We don't know what other charges [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=501.28000000000003s)]
*  they've made. The bar for genocide because of intent is much higher. So we don't know what [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=509.12s)]
*  charges they're going to make. So we don't know genocide yet? You just submitted it? No. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=514.8s)]
*  It takes years, that process. The legal process takes years. So why don't we wait for that to [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=520.0799999999999s)]
*  determine what is genocide? We can rely on the evidence of genocide scholars who dedicate their [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=523.76s)]
*  lives. Do you think you know better than genocide scholars? You think the scholars know more than [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=528.56s)]
*  the ICC? Maybe they don't. It's clearly an arguable point. It isn't because the ICC take years, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=532.7199999999999s)]
*  that legal process takes years. Now, for example, on the 9th of October, the head of Kogut, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=540.0s)]
*  the Israeli general in charge of Kogut, he said, this is Major General Ghassan Ali, he said Hamas [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=547.36s)]
*  has become ISIS. He said, the citizens of Gaza are celebrating instead of condemning. Human beasts [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=554.24s)]
*  will be dealt with accordingly. You will get no water or energy, just damage. You asked for hell, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=561.2s)]
*  you wanted hell, that tweet was addressed, it was a video, to Hamas and the residents of Gaza. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=566.0s)]
*  Do you accept that's genocidal? I think it falls into the category of what I've said repeatedly. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=571.76s)]
*  Why is that not genocidal? It's genocidal language. OK, so he's the, who is he? He's the IDF general. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=576.96s)]
*  IDF in charge. Smotrich talks in genocidal language. I don't dispute that. So you accept [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=584.24s)]
*  intent is that? You're asking me to... You ask me, do I believe yet it is genocide? I do not. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=588.4s)]
*  Do you believe there is genocidal intent? I believe it's genocidal rhetoric. No, well, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=595.04s)]
*  what does that, what's the difference between rhetoric and intent expressed by a minister and [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=600.48s)]
*  a general? Describe to me the difference between a genocide and ethnic cleansing. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=604.48s)]
*  Well, ethnic cleansing is just the forcible removal of people from their land on the basis [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=608.64s)]
*  of ethnicity. Genocide is when you attempt to destroy people in whole or in part. You don't need [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=613.52s)]
*  to, you don't actually need to kill people to do that, by the way. Well, he's all over the place here [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=618.7199999999999s)]
*  because the most difficult element actually to prove genocide is genocidal intent. He actually [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=622.24s)]
*  concedes genocidal intent by Israeli leaders, but then redefines it as rhetoric, as though the [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=626.08s)]
*  official statements of actual Israeli leaders whose utterances are backed up with firepower [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=631.76s)]
*  and consequences doesn't represent intent. How does that work? He got name of respective school [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=637.36s)]
*  of genocide, he says is genocide because none exist. It's really straightforward. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=641.6800000000001s)]
*  The International Criminal Court, as noted, their process is now secret. We don't know what [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=645.6s)]
*  charges now they're going to put. We know they start with a set of charges which focus on starvation, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=650.72s)]
*  but that's just the initial charges. The legal process goes on forever, not forever, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=658.24s)]
*  goes on for a very long time. His definition of genocide isn't clear to me, but based on what [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=663.36s)]
*  he's saying, that means previous genocides aren't genocides. Let's hear some other parts. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=667.6800000000001s)]
*  Had you watched the show for the last few weeks and months, you would know. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=671.6800000000001s)]
*  I don't watch everyone, Pierce. I have. You've watched it for months, have you? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=674.8000000000001s)]
*  But there we go. You're admitting that for the first part of the genocide, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=678.48s)]
*  when it was clearly a genocide, you were treating pro-Israel guests. It wasn't clearly a genocide. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=682.96s)]
*  Yes, it was. They said from the beginning what they were going to do. The first part was the obvious response. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=686.56s)]
*  When was the most lethal month? Hamas, first month. Of Palestinian civilians? Yes, first month. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=690.48s)]
*  So when they were wiping Gaza from the face of the earth, where Gaza within three months was a [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=696.64s)]
*  different colour and texture when looked at from space, when they had the biggest, worst [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=701.28s)]
*  trishion, when Israeli news officials made clear they did not see a distinction between [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=705.9200000000001s)]
*  civilians and officials, you don't think that was genocide and you were treating those people [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=709.84s)]
*  as though they had respectable views, but their views are more extreme than the Israeli. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=714.32s)]
*  I thought the Israeli military response was a direct response to Hamas's official spokesman [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=718.8000000000001s)]
*  saying on camera, for the world to see, we're going to keep trying to do more and more October the 7th. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=723.6800000000001s)]
*  Did you think this about Rwanda? You keep saying what about Rwanda? No, it's not what about Rwanda. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=729.44s)]
*  It's about consistency. What happened in Rwanda? What's the difference? I'm not going to talk about [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=734.16s)]
*  every conflict around the world. You've asked me a direct question about the first month [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=737.36s)]
*  in which Israel bombarded Hamas in Gaza. They murdered innocent civilians. They killed [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=743.6s)]
*  civilians. Thousands of innocent civilians. It's not murder if you were doing a proportionate [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=750.16s)]
*  response to a terrorist attack. It wasn't proportionate. Do you accept that? I kept asking what is proportionate. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=754.16s)]
*  I have now concluded in the last few months it's gone way past proportionate. But this is the thing, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=758.56s)]
*  you spent months... You don't blame Hamas for what happened in the first few weeks. It was in the obvious... Do you not blame Hamas? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=763.44s)]
*  The war crimes. I blame them for their war crimes. You don't blame them for what Israel then did? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=768.5600000000001s)]
*  Every war crime Israel committed. So Hamas built a massive tunnel network. They then launched the worst [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=772.6400000000001s)]
*  terror attack on Jewish people since the Holocaust. And when Israel inevitably responds the way they did, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=778.24s)]
*  that's not on Hamas. There is no legal basis for what you just said. You cannot say when you commit [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=784.8800000000001s)]
*  war crimes I was made to do them. Benjamin Netanyahu in the first week was given a list of 100 targets [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=790.0799999999999s)]
*  by his general and he said that's not enough targets. I want 400. And he said destroy their [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=795.68s)]
*  homes. That's what he said. This was revealed in an Israeli newspaper. Now the idea that they were, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=802.24s)]
*  you know, the reason that they slaughtered so many civilians in that first week was because of tunnels [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=809.1999999999999s)]
*  is a lie, Pearson. You must know that. Once again nobody can claim that if you have committed war [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=813.04s)]
*  crimes. They're not war crimes because they're in response to other war crimes. I don't need to [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=818.88s)]
*  keep talking about that because anyway. Let's just hear this segment. Do you believe that Israel had [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=822.56s)]
*  a right to defend itself? Gaza, as you know, under international law, wasn't another state. It's [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=827.04s)]
*  occupied legally as per international law. But all the terrorists came from Gaza? Yeah, because... [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=833.12s)]
*  So did Israel have a right to defend itself? But again, do you know why I regard this as so [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=838.96s)]
*  offensive to the worth of Palestinian life? I'll tell you why. In 2020... Do you think Hamas cared [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=843.76s)]
*  about the lives of Palestinians? No, I haven't argued that. You know what I think I haven't got to say, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=849.92s)]
*  we don't have to 632 days into genocide have to start going back to do you condemn Hamas. You know [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=854.88s)]
*  my views on that. We don't arm us. That wasn't my question. We don't arm us for Hamas. I said... [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=860.16s)]
*  The reason... I said do you think Hamas cared about the lives of Palestinians when they launched [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=863.84s)]
*  that attack? Having built an intricate tunnel system which protected Hamas but exposed the [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=868.08s)]
*  civilians to certain deaths. I don't know why Hamas is not relevant. Relevant? No, it isn't [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=873.52s)]
*  relevant. I'll tell you why it's not relevant. Hamas is irrelevant. No, you would find this question [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=878.3199999999999s)]
*  offensive if I put it to you. If I had said to you, in 2023, 240 Palestinians had been killed [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=882.64s)]
*  that year by the Israeli state, including 40 children, what else was Hamas supposed to do on [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=889.52s)]
*  the 7th of October? What would you say? Are you justifying? No, that's the point. I'm saying you [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=895.28s)]
*  would say correctly there was never any excuse for war crimes. This is an outrageous question [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=899.76s)]
*  for you to... Responding to a terror attack isn't a war crime. What has happened in the last few [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=905.36s)]
*  months to me has now crossed the line between legitimate self-defense to the worst terror attack [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=910.24s)]
*  of modern times against the Jewish people. Has gone a mile past that into and clearly from what [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=916.24s)]
*  people like Smodridge are saying has gone into a plan, it seems to me, by the government to cleanse [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=922.08s)]
*  Gaza of Palestinians, which is a war crime. It's so easy if you say Smodridge is your bogeyman. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=927.68s)]
*  Yeah, because he says it on camera. No one doubts that Smodridge and Ben-Gavir are deeply [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=933.12s)]
*  unpleasant mass murdering genocidal mania. Well, people do deny it, unfortunately a lot of people [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=938.8s)]
*  coming on the show, but who should be in prison, OK? From the very beginning, Israeli leaders and [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=942.9599999999999s)]
*  officials made clear they were going to commit a genocide. They made clear they saw no distinction [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=947.68s)]
*  between civilians and people. And the problem is people like yourself now, you're literally [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=952.4s)]
*  fueling a continuing rampant campaign about a rapper and what he said on stage when... [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=956.8s)]
*  Well, a rapper you've defended. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=962.56s)]
*  Now, the point I was making here, at least that important maxim, nothing can justify 7th October, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=963.8399999999999s)]
*  but everything can be justified by 7th October. So even though Israel's gone on this monstrous [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=967.8399999999999s)]
*  genocide of rampage and indeed Israel's leaders and officials made clear from the very beginning [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=972.24s)]
*  that they regarded the civilian population of Gaza's fair game, that can still be rationalized as [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=976.56s)]
*  self-defense in response to 7th October, even if Piers now thinks it's gone too far. But he would [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=980.7199999999999s)]
*  never ever accept that logic being applied to 7th October. Even though, and I've never denied [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=986.08s)]
*  in terms of crimes in 7th October, never denied that, the crimes committed since are infinitely [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=993.76s)]
*  worse. But the point is Israel committed a litany of war crimes in the months leading up to it, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=999.84s)]
*  let alone the years and decades and generations. So what's the argument for saying that one is [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1004.8000000000001s)]
*  self-defense has gone too far, whilst the other isn't? I mean, that's what would happen if you [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1010.24s)]
*  applied his logic. And as I've said, Israel's crimes are objectively far, far greater than [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1016.4s)]
*  7th October. That's just a fact in terms of lethality, destruction. I mean, it's every single day. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1021.8399999999999s)]
*  My view is you should never do war crimes. The point here is the dynamic, obviously, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1028.24s)]
*  Israel's the illegal occupying colonizer, which is a military superpower, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1033.12s)]
*  armed back to the teeth by the West. Whereas the Palestinians are utterly subjugated and colonized, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1036.0s)]
*  the permanent position that Israel has imposed on the Palestinian people is inherently criminal. I [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1040.96s)]
*  mean, the dynamic is one where it's a permanent crime, or lots of permanent crimes. But again, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1046.4s)]
*  it's this idea that you could say, even though what Israel has done is the most obscene crime of our [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1053.52s)]
*  age, you could still claim that self-defense has spiralled out of control, even though actually [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1060.88s)]
*  it's so spiralled out of control. It was inherently genocidal from the start, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1066.48s)]
*  but obviously he would never say that about 7th October. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1071.04s)]
*  You can see the issue there, can't you? Here's the gotcha moment regarding Bob Villain, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1076.24s)]
*  this time with the context of Piers Morgan's team stripped away. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1079.84s)]
*  You and I locked horns a little bit on X a couple of days ago about what happened at Glastonbury. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1083.04s)]
*  I just felt, I mean, that when people try and pretend what they mean is, well, we just mean [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1087.76s)]
*  the entity, we don't actually mean IDF soldiers. It's disingenuous. When a crowd charts death to [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1092.72s)]
*  the IDF, what they mean is they think IDF soldiers should be killed. People talk about the death of [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1099.2s)]
*  institutions all the time. Keir Starmer, when he said the NHS must reform or die, did he mean, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1104.0s)]
*  and maybe you should probably give a bit of warning to doctors, nurses and patients around [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1108.32s)]
*  the world, does he literally mean they're going to be killed? Of course not. So just to be clear, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1112.88s)]
*  you're comparing, you're comparing. So when people say the NHS will die, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1118.0s)]
*  literally they say the NHS will die without reform, are they saying that they're going to [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1122.8799999999999s)]
*  be the mass murder of doctors and patients? So to be clear, when you watch that rapper at Glastonbury [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1127.36s)]
*  chanting and leading a chant with thousands joining in of death to the IDF, you instinctively believe... [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1132.9599999999998s)]
*  He said himself. He said himself, it means the dismantling of a violent military machine. He said it since the [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1138.48s)]
*  Fiori blew up. But he also said he's opposed to the death of Jews, Arabs or any other race or group. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1142.0s)]
*  People would piss, I don't want to be rude, but that puts him in a rather different category than [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1145.68s)]
*  your pro-Israel. But hang on, when did he post that? Well the next day. Of course. What do you mean, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1149.92s)]
*  of course? It wasn't the next day, it was actually the day after. So you're saying that a rapper [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1154.3200000000002s)]
*  should have done a long verbose statement on stage. He's a rapper. If the Russian army on Friday, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1158.16s)]
*  if Russian officers and soldiers had confessed that they had been ordered to deliberately shoot [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1163.8400000000001s)]
*  Ukrainian civilians, they had been ordered to starve already, they'd put a total siege on Ukraine [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1169.28s)]
*  for several months, they had been ordered to shoot dead those unarmed starving civilians and [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1175.12s)]
*  they had killed over 600 of them, including an 18-month girl who they shot in the chest. And then [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1181.1999999999998s)]
*  the next day, having seen those reports people talking about the death of the Russian army, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1187.12s)]
*  would you honestly, and you really do need to answer honestly here, and I want to just say it [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1190.3999999999999s)]
*  from the heart, would you honestly regard that as an outrage? Or would you regard that as an obvious, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1194.2399999999998s)]
*  emotional response to an absolute unbelievable war crime? Right, so you accept then that the [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1200.3999999999999s)]
*  rapper was talking about soldiers? No, people call for the death of the Russian army all the time. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1206.48s)]
*  Because new footage has emerged and circulated today of Bob Bylan saying on stage, villain, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1211.6799999999998s)]
*  death to every single IDF soldier, May 2025. To be honest, I mean I don't know about that [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1219.76s)]
*  footage, I haven't seen it, to be honest that still puts him, I'm afraid to say, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1227.6799999999998s)]
*  in a better category than most of your pro-villain guests. But he's completely contradicted everything [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1232.9599999999998s)]
*  you've just said. I'm not Bob Bylan's spokesperson. By the way, I'm not playing Godshit, I just got [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1237.76s)]
*  told that myself. No, no, fair enough. They've literally put it on the iPad because it's gone [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1242.56s)]
*  round today. Fair enough, I would never myself... But clearly, clearly that shows his actual meaning [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1246.0s)]
*  was not what he put as an excuse two days later, what he meant was death to every single IDF soldier. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1251.76s)]
*  So then the argument becomes you're one about the Russian troops in Ukraine and my point is, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1258.16s)]
*  coming from a family full of military, military do the orders of their government. Often on pain [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1262.96s)]
*  of imprisonment. I'm afraid to say... You may want to say that that's not the case but actually an army [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1268.96s)]
*  goes into battle, the orders... When we went into war against Iraq in 2003, many of those soldiers [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1275.28s)]
*  would have had serious misgivings. So who is accountable? Tony Blair, who orders them in, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1281.28s)]
*  or the soldiers who do their job? We established at Nuremberg that I was just following orders [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1287.04s)]
*  is not a legal excuse. You're absolutely right, the perpetrators of genocide should be hauled [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1293.52s)]
*  before the courts. That's principally the likes of Benjamin Netanyahu and those at the top but [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1299.2s)]
*  Israeli soldiers who are massacring knowingly unarmed civilians, it doesn't matter. Okay, so... [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1304.48s)]
*  They are legally required, trickily, they are legally required to refuse to enact those orders. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1309.44s)]
*  Now just on that point, by the way, people like myself oppose sending IDF soldiers into Gaza and [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1314.08s)]
*  if that had happened, not only would hundreds of thousands potentially of Palestinians lives and be [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1319.52s)]
*  saved and not maimed and all the rest, but those hundreds of Israeli soldiers wouldn't have been [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1325.6s)]
*  killed either. A lot of your guests, ironically the pro-Israel guests, supported sending hundreds [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1329.84s)]
*  of IDF soldiers to their deaths in pursuit of what is a genocide campaign of extermination. Out of interest, what would you... [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1334.8s)]
*  He's made all of you look like complete prunes. No, the people I'm defending principally are the [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1340.56s)]
*  people in the audience. I do not believe thousands of people attending glass didn't support that and [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1344.48s)]
*  what I find actually even more grotesque, to be honest, and this is what I find grotesque, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1348.8799999999999s)]
*  that view, which I don't support, I don't support killing anyone, which is what IDF soldiers [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1354.1599999999999s)]
*  shouldn't be sent into Gaza to kill and therefore be killed. Hang on, hang on, let me agree. No, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1357.84s)]
*  your guests... You don't believe in killing them, I agree with you. Your guests, who you treat as [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1364.0s)]
*  respectably people who come on this show, have more extreme views than he does. Now, the reason [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1368.88s)]
*  what he said, which I do not support by the way there, is... Well, that's good. Less extreme... [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1373.6000000000001s)]
*  That's good. Less extreme than your guests. It's under international law, it's legal to kill [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1378.16s)]
*  combatants. It is not legal to kill civilians either because of disproportionate actions, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1382.5600000000002s)]
*  intentionally or recklessly. Your guests, who come on this show, who are pro-Israel guests, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1387.68s)]
*  they support a non-slut, which doesn't just kill combatants but kill civilians. That is more [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1393.1200000000001s)]
*  extreme than what that man said, but you don't treat them as that. Why don't you treat those [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1398.32s)]
*  people as more extreme than that man? Why? Now look, just from a basic point of view, I'm just [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1403.52s)]
*  a not-let's-rejoice-in-killing sort of person. I oppose the death penalty even for the most [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1408.6399999999999s)]
*  extreme crimes, that's my own heartfelt view. I'm not a pacifist, for example, in the case of World [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1413.9199999999998s)]
*  War II, I supported the Just War against the Nazis. I do think, by the way, war crimes were [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1418.32s)]
*  committed by us, so to speak. I mean, you know, Dresden, for example. The point is, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1423.76s)]
*  I regard human violence as utterly abhorrent and to be avoided in every possible circumstances [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1430.4s)]
*  possible. I think turning human beings into killing machines is repulsive, not least when [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1436.64s)]
*  you turn human beings into instruments of genocide. Every moral person should agree that the IDF has [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1440.16s)]
*  forfeited its right to exist by perpetrating genocide. If people like me had been listened to, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1445.92s)]
*  then there'd be no IDF soldiers in Gaza and they wouldn't be perpetrating genocide. And obviously, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1449.92s)]
*  as well as not having killed countless civilians, hundreds of IDF soldiers wouldn't have been killed [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1456.24s)]
*  too. The point is, whatever interpretation of death to the IDF, and it's absolutely clear to me, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1461.1200000000001s)]
*  because I was there at Glastonbury, that people chanting death to the IDF forget the performer, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1467.92s)]
*  they understood that is the end of the IDF. That is, even if it was kill IDF soldiers, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1473.3600000000001s)]
*  that's actually still much less extreme than the pro-Israel position. That's the point. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1479.36s)]
*  Because as I've noted, under international law, it's actually legal. You can legally kill competence. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1484.3999999999999s)]
*  It is never legal to kill civilians by intent, disproportionality or recklessness. All three [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1488.9599999999998s)]
*  apply to Israel's genocidal onslaught of Gaza. It's baked in. Its genocidal intent couldn't be [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1494.0s)]
*  clearer based on the statements of Israeli leaders and officials. And of course, we can all see the [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1498.9599999999998s)]
*  mass extermination that the Palestinian people are suffering from the wiping from the face of the [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1502.4799999999998s)]
*  earth of entire extended families, the murder of over 1,400 medics. That alone, by the way, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1506.56s)]
*  is more than the total number of Israelis killed in 7th October. Now, Bob Villan is being monstered [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1511.04s)]
*  for a position which is less extreme than the pro-Israel position, which is dominant in British [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1515.6s)]
*  media and politics. If you're saying an abomination to say kill IDF soldiers, then where does that [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1520.24s)]
*  leave people who are backing an onslaught that's murdering civilians en masse? Far more civilians [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1524.8s)]
*  and competence. Now, it's deranged, of course, that there is more outrage over chant than the mass [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1531.04s)]
*  extermination of a people. As I keep saying, the world's been turned on its head. You can see in [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1535.52s)]
*  context what I actually said now, rather than the very selectively edgy diversion put out by his team. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1539.68s)]
*  I would love to hear your thoughts. So do leave them in the comments, by the way. I'd love to [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5hIUQGXqE&t=1546.8799999999999s)]
