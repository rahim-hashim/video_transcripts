# Gaza: A War Crime In YOUR NAME #Live
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0)
*  Hello, hello, hello and welcome to a special edition of our live show. Now right now, as [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=0.0s)]
*  I talk and as you listen, a bloodbath is taking place in Gaza and beyond. Now that bloodbath [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=18.12s)]
*  concerns you for two principal reasons. Firstly, your humanity, that you should abhor suffering [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=23.8s)]
*  and death imposed upon your fellow innocent civilians wherever they are. But secondly, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=29.6s)]
*  and this is extremely important, because this bloodbath is happening with the direct complicity [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=35.72s)]
*  and involvement of Western governments. Even if you were to strip away the power dynamics [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=42.0s)]
*  at play, which would leave you unable to understand a single thing happening right now, our governments [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=47.96s)]
*  arm Hamas, they arm and back Israel. Now, the vast majority of us were disgusted by the atrocities [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=54.72s)]
*  committed by Hamas against Israeli civilians. What we are now seeing is a military superpower [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=61.24s)]
*  unleash unimaginable horror against the strip of land around the size of Washington, DC, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=66.64s)]
*  a tiny strip of land, which has been subjected to a 15 year blockade by land, air and sea, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=72.44s)]
*  a brutal siege, which under international law is under occupation with Israel in control [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=78.32s)]
*  of its water, food, the works. Now, senior Israeli government officials and figures have [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=83.04s)]
*  declared a total siege, cutting off all electricity, water and food. This is collective punishment. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=88.08000000000001s)]
*  And that is illegal under international law. It is a war crime. They are issuing blood [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=94.2s)]
*  curdling threats to reduce Gaza to a city of tents, for example. They have ordered Gazans [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=99.64000000000001s)]
*  to flee, but it is impossible to flee Gaza. It is the world's largest open air prison. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=105.44000000000001s)]
*  Now, right now, many hundreds of civilians are dying, including at least 300 children. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=110.88s)]
*  Now 80% of Gazans depend on international humanitarian assistance to survive. Around [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=116.75999999999999s)]
*  half of the population of Gaza are children. That context is crucial. And there is an attempt [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=123.84s)]
*  by much of the media to strip any context as somehow being apologism. What Palestine [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=131.2s)]
*  has been subjected to is the longest occupation in modern times. Now, before these horrifying [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=137.78s)]
*  and truly repulsive events occurred, around 96% of those who had died in the last 15 years [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=143.94s)]
*  were Palestinians. That isn't to minimise the deaths of anyone, but it is important [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=151.34s)]
*  to emphasise the humanity of Palestinians, which has been stripped away entirely. Before [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=156.74s)]
*  the atrocity committed by Hamas, this year alone, 248 Palestinian civilians were killed, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=162.74s)]
*  40 of them children. And it is controversial, even outrageous in this climate, to say that [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=167.70000000000002s)]
*  Palestinian lives matter. They are of equal inherent worth to an Israeli civilian life, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=174.02s)]
*  a British civilian life, an American civilian life. That is not how this is being treated. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=180.94s)]
*  The media in this country are not accepting the equal humanity of the Palestinian people [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=186.02s)]
*  in no way is that reflected in their coverage. And that goes for politicians. Our government, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=192.34s)]
*  the Conservative government in Britain, and the opposition Labour Party are supporting [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=197.62s)]
*  what Israel is unleashing, which is in violation of international law. Now, treating life as [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=202.3s)]
*  inferior to another because of their inherent racialised characteristics, there is a word [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=208.86s)]
*  for that and it is called racism. And that racism is defining the way that this is being [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=213.9s)]
*  covered. Now, in this show and beyond, I will be elevating the voices we need to hear from. I will [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=220.06s)]
*  be using my channel as best I can in the coming days and weeks and months to elevate those voices, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=224.94s)]
*  Palestinians in the Middle East and elsewhere, Israeli peace activists, and we will try and offer [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=229.98s)]
*  an alternative to the coverage we are seeing on much of the mainstream media as best I can. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=235.18s)]
*  I have tried to battle myself on Sky News the other day. Many of you may have seen Margaret Hodge, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=240.38s)]
*  a former Labour MP. I denounced Hamas's atrocity at late great length. And as soon as I spoke [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=246.38s)]
*  about the suffering imposed on part of the Palestinian people, I was shouted down. Now, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=252.54s)]
*  we will stick to the facts. Facts matter in horrors such as this. They can become a matter of life [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=256.21999999999997s)]
*  and death. Now, before I bring in our first brilliant guest, let's just hear from Al-Jazeera's [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=262.21999999999997s)]
*  Gaza correspondent, Yunmeh El-Sayed, just to provide some context about what Gaza is currently enduring. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=267.26s)]
*  Bombardments are still very heavy. Artillery shells and gunboats still [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=273.74s)]
*  bombarding many homes in the Gaza Strip. What we're seeing is the carpet bombardment strategy [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=279.58s)]
*  that Israel is using, which means that it is leveling entire neighborhoods, bombarding the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=287.1s)]
*  entire neighborhoods with all its buildings, like what is happening now in several neighborhoods, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=293.5s)]
*  what happened in Karama yesterday neighborhood, today in Al-Mukhabarat neighborhoods, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=300.06s)]
*  Haras neighborhood. These are all residential neighborhoods that I'm talking about in Gaza [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=304.62s)]
*  city itself. And the bombardment is still going on very intensively, not just from the air, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=311.9s)]
*  but from the air, from the sea, and from the land through the tank shells that are targeting [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=319.02s)]
*  many areas now. Now, if you're watching, please like and subscribe and support the video because [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=326.54s)]
*  we're trying to elevate these voices. So do share this video far and wide. I know the vast majority [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=335.02000000000004s)]
*  of you don't watch live, but do like and share the video as best you can. And let's make sure [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=338.38s)]
*  we get the voices that need to be heard heard as widely as possible. And I should say just quickly [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=344.54s)]
*  a note about what those journalists are going through. Several Palestinian journalists have [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=352.54s)]
*  been killed. It's extremely dangerous, obviously, to be in Gaza. Several medics have been killed. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=356.14000000000004s)]
*  An activist I know, I've known for many years, their friend who is a senior medic has just been [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=362.78000000000003s)]
*  killed in Gaza. UN officials are being killed. I mean, that itself, I think, just is testament [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=366.70000000000005s)]
*  to the sort of indiscriminate slaughter that we're seeing. You can also use Super Chat to put [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=373.74s)]
*  questions to the guests and support the show. Now, I'm going to bring in Samir McKaylee from [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=379.34000000000003s)]
*  Betsalem, who are an incredible human rights organisation in Israel itself. And I have to say, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=383.66s)]
*  Samir, your work is courageous at the best of times, and it isn't easy, and it couldn't be harder [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=388.86s)]
*  still. So it's an honour to have you with us. And thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=396.7s)]
*  So this is the first live show I've done since the atrocities began. So I do want to begin with [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=401.9s)]
*  what we know about the attack from Hamas and the reality on the ground. So if you could just explain [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=407.82000000000005s)]
*  what do we know in terms of the attack on civilian lives and the atrocities committed, because it is [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=415.90000000000003s)]
*  important that we speak truthfully and honestly about a whole range of events. So if you could [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=422.06s)]
*  just explain what do we know has dreadfully occurred. Yeah, no, I totally agree that we have [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=426.78000000000003s)]
*  to talk about the facts as horrific and as difficult and as dissonance invoking as they [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=434.38s)]
*  might be. So on Saturday morning, there was a very, very large scale invasion of Hamas militants into [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=441.02s)]
*  southern Israel, accompanied with a massive bombardment. I'm not going to go into all of [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=448.21999999999997s)]
*  the details, because they're also still emerging. We did not know anything in the first few hours, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=453.5s)]
*  and slowly the picture emerged of massive carnage of civilians, of attacks directed against homes [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=460.14s)]
*  in the Gaza perimeter, in communities in the Gaza perimeter, in civilians in those homes, and against [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=467.82s)]
*  civilians in various other slightly larger communities a bit further off Gaza, and also [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=475.09999999999997s)]
*  against a very large number, hundreds of young Israelis in a rave, in a party that was held [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=481.65999999999997s)]
*  in that area. And we're talking about a planned and organized and orchestrated attack. I think it's [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=490.38s)]
*  very important to acknowledge this, because there have been also discussions now that some of these [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=496.06s)]
*  horrors, atrocities, war crimes that have been committed were kind of like the initiative of [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=506.21999999999997s)]
*  individuals. I think that's quite a shameful accusation. They were conducted by the military [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=509.82s)]
*  wing of Hamas, and also I think of Islamic Jihad, that has a very clear command chain. These are [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=518.22s)]
*  planned premeditated attacks. There's also a lot of very credible reports by credible journalists [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=527.02s)]
*  and reporters who show, who demonstrated examples. For example, a large number of cars, vans that were [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=534.7s)]
*  used to bring in these militants into Israel, equipment that they used. So all of this was [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=541.74s)]
*  clearly premeditated. And in addition to this massive killing, deliberate, willful killing of [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=548.9399999999999s)]
*  civilians, there were also attacks against this military infrastructure and against soldiers [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=555.0999999999999s)]
*  that led, I think, to the basically to the collapse of any sort of military response [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=563.8199999999999s)]
*  of the Israeli security forces. Additionally, it is emerging now, or it has emerged, that many [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=569.1s)]
*  military units were transferred from the Gaza perimeter to the West Bank in order to safeguard [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=576.46s)]
*  various settlement and settler activities in the days and weeks before this attack. And one [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=582.6999999999999s)]
*  crucial issue additionally to mention was that the militants and possibly other Palestinians who [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=591.18s)]
*  entered Israel also kidnapped over 150 Israeli civilians. The numbers are not clear yet. Again, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=597.82s)]
*  women, in some cases children and toddlers, in some cases the elderly and people who were ill [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=605.4200000000001s)]
*  and need treatment, and they are currently held in the Gaza Strip and their whereabouts unknown. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=611.82s)]
*  I think, again, the absolute horrors of what has been happening in the south of Israel is just slowly [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=617.98s)]
*  trickling out and every day brings new realizations and also new names and faces and [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=626.78s)]
*  friends and relatives of everyone we know. I think every Israeli here is aware and is familiar and [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=635.18s)]
*  knows people who either themselves were lost in this, in this, the events of Saturday or [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=641.8199999999999s)]
*  are kidnapped, including many people from our movement, from the peace and human rights [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=650.38s)]
*  movement. And I think that's, you know, the fact that they have these politics certainly not [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=654.86s)]
*  relevant to their captivity, but they are, I think, certainly relevant to the context in which [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=660.3000000000001s)]
*  this event occurred internally inside Israel, which is a context of almost a year, right, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=668.0600000000001s)]
*  of almost 10 months of a government that has been inciting against the left, against Israelis who [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=674.3000000000001s)]
*  promote human rights like myself and my colleagues, and accusing us of various accusations, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=682.7s)]
*  including that we're, you know, in this whole conversation in the run-up in the debate around [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=689.9000000000001s)]
*  the judicial coup, and I think all of this is crucial because maybe one final point to mention [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=697.9000000000001s)]
*  in terms of, again, in terms of the context is that this attack, this terrible war crime, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=703.6600000000001s)]
*  perpetrated by Hamas, has also exposed the total breakdown of a functioning government and public [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=711.74s)]
*  service structure in Israel, which many Israelis, myself included, but not just people from the left [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=719.58s)]
*  or from the human rights movement, are showing as the result of the way this government has been [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=726.78s)]
*  functioning, I mean, on the, both on the individual level of ministers involved in, you know, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=733.5s)]
*  only trying to promote this judicial coup, but also in the systematic breakdown of functioning [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=740.54s)]
*  institutions in Prime Minister Netanyahu's attempt to evade his trial. And maybe then one final issue, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=750.54s)]
*  which is a massive risk, and I know some wonderful interviewees will discuss it later, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=758.86s)]
*  a massive risk of intra-escalation, internal escalation in our own society and in the [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=763.26s)]
*  and it's incredible to see Israelis and Palestinians, Jews and Arabs, working now to [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=770.14s)]
*  avert this risk. So this is a very, very short description, I think, of what has been occurring. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=774.14s)]
*  And a very powerful description it was too, Sarah. In terms of now, in terms of what's [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=782.46s)]
*  obviously happening on the ground in Gaza, and in terms of the rhetoric that's coming from [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=788.54s)]
*  the Israeli state, because, you know, in the past you will hear claims from the Israeli state, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=793.58s)]
*  we don't target civilians, etc, etc. But a lot of the rhetoric has been blood curdling, I would say. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=798.86s)]
*  And, you know, for example, stating we are targeting for damage, not for accuracy, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=806.0600000000001s)]
*  we will reduce Gaza to a city of tents, and, you know, just very vicious, and we are fighting human [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=814.54s)]
*  animals, you know, kind of genocidal language, I would say. What does that tell us about the [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=822.54s)]
*  what, because a ground invasion now seems likely, what does that tell us about, I mean, what do we [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=827.4200000000001s)]
*  know is happening, firstly, on the ground, because, I mean, that's obviously very hard, given the [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=833.1s)]
*  situation in Gaza, but what are you hearing on the ground in Gaza, and what, given the rhetoric? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=837.0200000000001s)]
*  So, yeah, I mean, the rhetoric is also reflected in what we have seen happening on the ground, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=843.9000000000001s)]
*  both in terms of the absolute broad and indiscriminate nature of the attacks, the [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=850.5400000000001s)]
*  airstrikes that we see, but also in terms of the absolutely, you know, shocking shutting off of any [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=857.1s)]
*  kind of humanitarian assistance and any kind of humanitarian services to Gaza. Israel shut off the [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=865.98s)]
*  water and electricity that it sells on a normal basis to Gaza, because there's virtually no [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=873.26s)]
*  potable water drinkable in Gaza, not enough electricity for any kind of basic survival of [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=878.3s)]
*  the population. These are, I should also say that in past Israeli operations, wars, you know, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=885.66s)]
*  against the population of the Gaza Strip, there have been indiscriminate attacks, attacks that [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=894.6999999999999s)]
*  we characterized were clearly indiscriminate and targeted civilians and the civilian population, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=901.9s)]
*  but this level, this scope of attack and this level and scope of like a total [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=909.34s)]
*  negation of any sort of humanitarian need is unprecedented, and it is simply staggering. I mean, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=915.9s)]
*  I think the real risk that two million residents of Gaza are going to have to deal with [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=922.54s)]
*  no electricity, no water and no food, because food is also running out, is real, and this is not, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=931.9s)]
*  it does not appear as if there is any action on behalf, certainly not of the Israeli government, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=938.06s)]
*  but of the international community that gave Israel carte blanche with all of these support [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=944.06s)]
*  statements. There are no, it does not look like the international community is really accepting [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=948.4599999999999s)]
*  that the result of these Israeli actions is an absolute devastation of the civilian population, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=954.2199999999999s)]
*  of two million human beings who are living in Gaza. I have to say that on an individual level, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=964.4599999999999s)]
*  I have colleagues and I have people who work with me and partners and friends, and I've tried to [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=969.9s)]
*  talk to them and listen to them and the stories that are coming out, both individually in these [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=976.06s)]
*  phone calls and also in the media, are just absolutely shocking. And these are people who [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=980.3s)]
*  are used to war upon war upon war and siege and a living, something that they all describe as [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=985.5799999999999s)]
*  unprecedented. And I think what we've been trying to do at the Tzalim with our very, very minor [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=993.9799999999999s)]
*  ability is to say the very basic thing that I think any person who cares about the humanity of [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=999.8199999999999s)]
*  ourselves as well as the humanity of others is that the horrors that have been inflicted on us [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1009.18s)]
*  cannot justify this sort of treatment of Palestinians. I understand that I'm in the [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1015.0999999999999s)]
*  minority currently as an Israeli. It's clear and we have to accept that and acknowledge the reality [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1020.38s)]
*  that many Israelis, the majority possibly of Israelis, are now asking for revenge and this [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1026.7s)]
*  is what our government is doing. But I also know that there are many other Israelis, both Jews and [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1031.98s)]
*  Arabs, who do agree with me. And we are making our voice heard on social media and we are talking [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1036.46s)]
*  about how this is not the way beyond the fact that it's simply morally abhorrent to have this [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1042.06s)]
*  policy of revenge, to exert revenge on two million civilians who, like myself, did not elect the [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1050.6200000000001s)]
*  government that controls them, have no control over this. Beyond that, it's also going to lead [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1056.8600000000001s)]
*  just to more and more carnage to a future where we are all just expected to kind of live through [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1061.82s)]
*  these periods of horror and carnage without any kind of hope. So this is the message and I know [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1068.54s)]
*  we're not, we're few, but there are people who agree with us on both sides. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1074.3s)]
*  And just a couple of other things. We're very lucky to have you and it's an extremely busy time [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1082.06s)]
*  for you to say the least. I mean Rohan Talbot, who's director of advocacy and campaigns here, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1085.82s)]
*  medical aid for Palestinians here in Britain, and he says Gaza's health system has started to collapse, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1090.14s)]
*  1,354 killed, over 6,000 injured, savable cases due to lack of capacity, staff resources, beds, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1095.0200000000002s)]
*  ICUs are filled, operating theatres are filled, there's not even enough space in the corridor, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1102.14s)]
*  this is slaughter. And that's the point, isn't it? It's not just people, you know, it's the bombs that [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1105.42s)]
*  drop, but it's the fact that the entire health system is in a state of collapse. Absolutely. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1109.42s)]
*  And on a very basic level, the lack of electricity means people cannot pump water up to their homes, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1116.86s)]
*  the homes that have survived. Many people I know who have either their own homes were just basically [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1122.86s)]
*  bombarded and don't exist any longer, or have relatives trapped in homes that have collapsed [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1129.8999999999999s)]
*  without any ability to call for help, to have any kind of like emergency services that will be [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1136.1399999999999s)]
*  somehow pulling them out of the rubble because there's virtually no capacity currently. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1143.66s)]
*  I just simply cannot express enough how, as an Israeli who has looked at people in my own country [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1149.98s)]
*  suffer such a horrific attack, I just, none of this can provide any sort of support, comfort, or [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1160.0600000000002s)]
*  future for us, for as long as we continue to follow the same path of revenge. I understand that [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1168.22s)]
*  currently there isn't a lot of willingness of people to hear both internationally and in Israel, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1175.9s)]
*  but I do think that we have to work towards the escalation and we have to demand, the international [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1181.5s)]
*  community has to pressure Israel to accept a prisoner swap in order to bring these more or less [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1187.26s)]
*  150 Israelis back home. This has to be the first step that could, I pray, I hope, lead possibly to [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1193.98s)]
*  de-escalation and certainly not to allow the additional escalation, which is happening also [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1204.46s)]
*  in the West Bank, where Israeli settlers are simply using this opportunity to take over [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1209.02s)]
*  land, to forcibly transfer Palestinian herder communities, while all of this is happening [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1214.3s)]
*  around in the Gaza perimeter. And in Gaza. Sorry, I can't express my gratitude just [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1221.5s)]
*  for the time you've been able to spend with us. No, I'm absolutely also so happy to be able to [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1228.3s)]
*  raise this voice and to say these things. Thank you. It's a huge honour and for those who aren't [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1234.94s)]
*  aware of Betsalem's work, do look up Betsalem and support them in any way you can, share their [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1241.3400000000001s)]
*  material. They're incredibly courageous and brave and we desperately need them more than ever. So [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1246.78s)]
*  thank you so, so much and all my love and solidarity. Thank you. Thank you very much. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1252.94s)]
*  It's hard to listen to. It's hard to listen to this, you know, but we do have to listen to this. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1260.22s)]
*  I'm going to bring in now Saleh Abed, who, very lucky to have, who is one of the leaders of [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1265.26s)]
*  Standing Together, which brings together Arabs and Jews in Israel and in the fight for peace. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1273.02s)]
*  Saleh, I guess I wanted to start on just a basic human question, if you don't mind me [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1282.54s)]
*  asking, because you're a Palestinian who actually lives in Israel. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1287.74s)]
*  What are your just thoughts from that vantage point? I mean, this is a, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1292.46s)]
*  in terms of everything that happens on Saturday, what's, what are the emotions that are going [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1296.46s)]
*  through your head? I think we have a duality of experience that is very, very tough to navigate. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1300.62s)]
*  You know, we are experiencing the trauma, you know, our society, we live within the Israeli society. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1316.4599999999998s)]
*  As Sarit also said, you know, many of our colleagues and partners within the [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1324.6200000000001s)]
*  anti-occupation community and social justice community have been heavily, directly impacted [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1331.98s)]
*  by this. Some of them lost their lives, some of them lost loved ones, some of them are currently [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1339.18s)]
*  captives in Gaza. And so we live this fear and insecurity, but we are also immediately [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1344.5400000000002s)]
*  labeled traitors until proven loyal within Israeli society. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1356.5400000000002s)]
*  It's a very difficult situation to be in, in a sense that you are, you know, you have to, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1362.46s)]
*  there's no space for us to mourn our people while we are also mourning, you know, our friends and [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1375.26s)]
*  colleagues here. And we are extremely worried, especially here in mixed cities, I mean, here in [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1383.66s)]
*  Haifa, you know, we are seeing many people and many organized groups getting armed and getting [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1389.5s)]
*  ready and, you know, getting to go. It's very scary to go on the streets and just speak Arabic [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1396.06s)]
*  and look around and just make sure that no one is actually having a reaction to it. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1402.22s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard to articulate. Of course. Well, that was very powerfully done. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1412.3s)]
*  I was going to just show a quick clip from a doctor in Gaza and I just wanted kind of your [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1416.8600000000001s)]
*  response to it. I know you've been, also you've been on British media outlets, I have to apologize [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1421.74s)]
*  for that. Having worked in the British media now for 12 years, we've got an interesting media ecosystem [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1427.34s)]
*  here. Let me just put this clip and just to get your response to this. We've heard the Israeli [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1434.06s)]
*  prime minister say this is only the beginning. Can you imagine what it is going to be like where you [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1438.38s)]
*  are if we go into week two, three, four, five, six? The beginning for the Palestinians was in 48 [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1443.42s)]
*  and it's been continuing for 75 years. My generation lived through the Israeli invasion [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1451.8200000000002s)]
*  and the siege of Beirut in 82 and we saw that destruction, 30,000 killed. It ended with the [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1457.5800000000002s)]
*  Israelis allowing the massacre of Sabra and Shatila. You know, if the Israelis want to repeat that [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1464.8600000000001s)]
*  again, then this is going to be absolutely catastrophic. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1470.78s)]
*  The reason I play that is context is often stripped completely from what happens in Palestine and [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1476.1399999999999s)]
*  Israel. The British media often with news events generally acts as they day one was last week [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1482.06s)]
*  and that's how this is treated. It's particularly because coverage only often happens when you get, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1489.02s)]
*  for example, Hamas attacks in the way that they did. Just in terms of that broader context though [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1493.8999999999999s)]
*  why it's important to place it in that broader context and what that tells us about what will [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1500.7s)]
*  happen next in your view. You're like one step further even, you know, talking, contextualizing [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1504.7s)]
*  all of this in the continuous efforts to ethnically cleanse Palestinians from their homeland. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1514.54s)]
*  Sarit mentioned what is happening right now in the West Bank. She is mentioning [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1524.94s)]
*  you know what is happening in Gaza. We are seeing it all. Just take it one step before that if we [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1531.3400000000001s)]
*  want to equate between what is happening right now. The atrocities conducted by Hamas, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1540.6200000000001s)]
*  all of us within the Palestinian community as well as the Palestinian solidarity movement, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1547.9s)]
*  when we want to express our voice, it's conditional for us to condemn Hamas as we should. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1553.9s)]
*  But then I don't see any Israeli politicians going on the media and asked to condemn [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1567.9s)]
*  the Israeli regime, the very oppressive, violent, decades-long Israeli regime, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1579.1s)]
*  and the fact that there are Jewish supremacists, openly Jewish supremacists, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1586.4599999999998s)]
*  openly calling for the annihilation of Palestinians, not of Hamas, of Palestinians. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1591.6599999999999s)]
*  I think this context that you're showing is something that has been, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1600.2199999999998s)]
*  there is a monopoly over violence and there is a monopoly over morality [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1605.82s)]
*  that the West and the most powerful countries in the world unfortunately endorse. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1612.62s)]
*  And it's very difficult, you know, you can't even get out of that [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1621.02s)]
*  to go, you know, you don't even have the privilege to talk about 48. You don't even have the privilege [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1627.8999999999999s)]
*  to talk about 48. You have no privilege to talk about 67. You have no privilege, you know, I can't [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1633.98s)]
*  at the moment in Israel, you know, I don't have any right to do that. You know, you are allowed to [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1641.66s)]
*  talk about, you know, we have no space to mourn for both of us as people. And, you know, when we are [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1651.34s)]
*  looking at the condemnation contest, then Hamas, you know, is immediately equated with all [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1661.34s)]
*  Palestinians. Therefore, they are all rendered, you know, animals and, you know, it's okay to kill [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1669.5s)]
*  as many as possible. And then we look at Israel and, you know, we have a government that is [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1674.9399999999998s)]
*  backing settler terrorism, that is expanding settlements, that is, you know, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1683.5s)]
*  displacing thousands of Palestinians from their land and from their homes in the West Bank, that [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1689.5s)]
*  is, sieging Gaza, committing war crimes. And no one is expected to condemn that, you know, while [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1694.54s)]
*  expressing solidarity for Israeli people as they should. They should express solidarity for [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1705.18s)]
*  Israeli. They should express solidarity for Israeli citizens. We are all impacted by this. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1711.1s)]
*  And I want everyone to do that. And I think the Palestinian solidarity movement around the world, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1716.86s)]
*  you know, I really invite everyone to really take the moral stand on that. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1722.6999999999998s)]
*  But we really need to insist on, you know, our demand. They created the rules, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1734.3799999999999s)]
*  you know, of condemnation and what is morality and what is not. They have the monopoly over [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1742.3s)]
*  morality and we need to demand from them to play by their own rules and they're not. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1747.26s)]
*  I mean, what you said, I think just so brilliantly speaks to the core of your racist treatment, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1754.7s)]
*  which is even as Palestinians have been killed in vast numbers, you have no permission to even [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1759.6599999999999s)]
*  talk about that. You were expected to just begin everything with a condemnation of the actions of [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1766.38s)]
*  Hamas and even that doesn't give you permission, does it? No, and let me be clear, I'm not condemning [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1773.0200000000002s)]
*  Hamas because I want to talk about the occupation. I'm condemned because I am extremely appalled [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1779.9s)]
*  because I'm personally impacted by this because I literally have colleagues right now. I've been [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1784.7800000000002s)]
*  going to funerals and to shivas and I've been, you know, living the loss, the catastrophe [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1789.66s)]
*  that my friends and my communities and my society is going through. It's just suffocating [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1796.22s)]
*  to see the monopoly, you know, here in Israel as well as around the world [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1808.38s)]
*  for morality and for violence and what it means and what is justified and what is not justified. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1815.66s)]
*  And it's suffocating. It's a very, very small space to express ourselves and I really want [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1825.5s)]
*  to thank you for this platform and I want to say that, you know, listening to Sarit as well, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1832.06s)]
*  people really need to understand that the shared civil society within Israel, it's probably one of [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1840.7s)]
*  the very few places where we're able to ache and mourn both the loss of human lives while also being [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1848.38s)]
*  extremely critical of our leaderships and this is exactly where we need to be. If we want to imagine [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1856.54s)]
*  a just and equal place, a future for all of us, you know, we need to learn to mourn people [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1867.26s)]
*  and really without endorsing any oppressive regime and I really want to bring that here, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1877.1799999999998s)]
*  you know, here in civil society, shared civil society is one of the most important things [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1885.8999999999999s)]
*  that we can strengthen right now. Can I ask you, in terms of, for example, talking about the West [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1891.66s)]
*  Bank, now we know settlers are being armed, we know yesterday that there was an attack by [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1897.02s)]
*  settlers which killed four Palestinian civilians and then at the funeral today, mourners were shot [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1902.22s)]
*  and a father and a child, and a father and their son was shot dead. That isn't framed as terrorism, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1908.22s)]
*  for example by Western politicians, not even marked upon. What are your fears in terms of [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1916.5400000000002s)]
*  the West Bank where we have huge numbers of illegal settlements, the mass colonisation, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1921.42s)]
*  the theft of Palestinian land, the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from their land, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1926.46s)]
*  which has been happening of course for many, many decades, but what's your fears about what [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1931.02s)]
*  this will mean for the West Bank? It's terrifying, you know, on Saturday we were all in shock [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1934.46s)]
*  trying to understand the magnitude of the attack here and the second thought I had was like, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1941.5s)]
*  like what is going to, like I literally was like there's gonna be a slaughterhouse in the West Bank, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1953.5s)]
*  everyone's gonna go to the, everyone's gonna go to Gaza right now for an invasion, for a retaliation [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1958.4599999999998s)]
*  and the West Bank, you know, that the Palestinians there are just gonna be, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1965.34s)]
*  you know, for themselves against, you know, settlers, armed settlers, heavily armed settlers [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1972.06s)]
*  who are probably backed by some of the soldiers as well who are left there. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1979.34s)]
*  I think what we are gonna witness is just a deepening of the military control, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1985.5s)]
*  it's gonna be a deepening of the violence escalation of the brutal violence that [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1994.8600000000001s)]
*  Palestinians go through in the West Bank by settlers and by an army, the Israeli army, [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=1999.8200000000002s)]
*  and I think we're gonna see a lot of more evacuations and displacements [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2008.14s)]
*  and more posts and settlements being done there. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2015.66s)]
*  It's very concerning. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2019.26s)]
*  Just the other thing I wanted to talk about, you're part obviously of the peace movement, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2028.14s)]
*  an attempt to bring together Palestinians and Jews together, I mean that's what standing together [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2031.1s)]
*  does. On the one hand you have a policy of collective punishment being meted out by a [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2035.82s)]
*  far-right government which has the active and unconditional support of Western powers, [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2042.22s)]
*  you also, I mean, you know, this is important to talk about, I saw a comment which was about [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2049.82s)]
*  apartheid and Betsalem, the human rights organization as well as Amnesty for National [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2056.1400000000003s)]
*  Human Rights Watch term the oppression of the Palestinians as a form of apartheid, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2060.5400000000004s)]
*  and apartheid ended through struggle but also the sense that white South Africans had that they [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2065.6600000000003s)]
*  wouldn't be killed in the event of apartheid ending, and I just think with those two facts [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2072.62s)]
*  thrown in that you have an increasingly radicalized majority of the population who want vengeance, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2079.9s)]
*  the mass dehumanization of Palestinian people, and also now in the aftermath what happened, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2087.8199999999997s)]
*  that sense of the idea of, well, you know, making the argument of the peace movement of living [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2092.94s)]
*  together has become much harder, which was a precondition for the fall of apartheid. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2099.58s)]
*  What happens next? What happens next for a peace movement which has been [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2104.62s)]
*  increasingly besieged over the last few years? Owen, you're asking very tough questions. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2109.34s)]
*  I know. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2115.2599999999998s)]
*  I think, you know, I'm crying because I feel like I've never felt, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2121.74s)]
*  you know, people are always admiring how much we are able to maintain hope, how much we're able [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2131.66s)]
*  to maintain our ability, our belief in our ability to change, and I think in my years of activism [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2140.62s)]
*  and looking at my colleagues around me, so devastated, and it's just so raw still, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2152.7799999999997s)]
*  I think this is the least that we have believed in our ability to change, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2161.66s)]
*  but I also know that I don't have the privilege to lose that belief. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2167.34s)]
*  I think, you know, if you really look, there are bright spots, you know, we have, at Standing [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2172.86s)]
*  Together since Saturday, have been organizing, you know, thousands and thousands of people, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2179.7400000000002s)]
*  and we hope to get to 10,000s of people in Jewish Arab solidarity watches here in mixed cities, [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2186.78s)]
*  in mixed areas, and we are trying to do mutual aid, we're trying to really strengthen our [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2194.46s)]
*  communities and really create an alternative of what we see can happen, you know, our government [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2201.58s)]
*  is not giving us an alternative, the only answer they have for us is revenge and flattening Gaza [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2209.82s)]
*  and, you know, killing people, and I think many people here in Israel, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2215.18s)]
*  I want to believe that many people in Israel see that that's not the solution. I know that [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2223.98s)]
*  people are heated right now, and they are unfortunately condoning the atrocities being [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2231.42s)]
*  done in Gaza, and I do think that we have the ability to build the political will within the [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2240.14s)]
*  Israeli society to look at this differently, to shift the paradigm, you know, I do, you know, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2250.8599999999997s)]
*  that the context just before the war was a mass protest, you know, of hundreds of thousands of [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2259.74s)]
*  people against the current government, Israeli government, and we are still seeing these voices, [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2267.9s)]
*  you know, being heard about this government failing to prioritize our security while [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2275.02s)]
*  prioritizing expansion, you know, settlement expansion and backing settlers in the West Bank [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2281.82s)]
*  and creating an impossible reality for us here to be secure, and I do believe in our ability to [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2288.62s)]
*  shift that paradigm, not only about, not only through talking about peace, but also, you know, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2298.54s)]
*  standing together works into connecting social justice issues and really understanding how we [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2304.94s)]
*  can build a new majority in Israeli society that understands that the majority of the people that [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2310.78s)]
*  live here, Palestinians and Jews, have the interest and the right for equality, for social justice, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2316.06s)]
*  for prosperous society, and for peace. It's in our interest, and I think this, you know, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2323.7400000000002s)]
*  the catastrophe that the Israeli society has been experiencing these past six days, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2331.1s)]
*  I hope that we will be able to highlight the urgent need for us to build the resistance within [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2337.18s)]
*  Israeli society for peace. You know, we see the father of abducted children, we see [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2344.22s)]
*  a sister of a killed activist who are calling saying, we don't want, you know, further killing [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2352.54s)]
*  in the name of our children, just bring them back, we just want peace. This invasion and these war [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2359.58s)]
*  crimes and further killing of Palestinians is just not going to get us anywhere, and I really hope, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2366.3799999999997s)]
*  I really hope, and maybe I'm naive, that we will be able, that there will be a junction where we [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2372.54s)]
*  will move towards a place where we will build a larger, a stronger political will within the [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2380.3s)]
*  Israeli society that will challenge our leadership and replace it into one that can actually advance [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2387.1s)]
*  better, more humane policies. Salah, I just want to say thank you so, so much. That was [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2395.18s)]
*  incredibly powerful and I can't even believe the level of courage right now for those of you [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2402.06s)]
*  fighting for peace in the environment you're in is astonishing, and I hope you know that there are [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2412.86s)]
*  those of us in actually greater numbers than ever now, I would say, in these countries who will [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2418.2999999999997s)]
*  stand with that equivocation behind you, and it's so important we keep talking and elevating your [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2424.38s)]
*  voices. I just want to say thank you, thank you so, so much and love and solidarity. Thank you so [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2429.02s)]
*  much, Owen. Thank you so much. Take care, Salah, and thank you so much again. Thank you. Thank you. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2434.06s)]
*  Incredible stuff there from Salah. It's difficult, isn't it, to just listen to [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2440.14s)]
*  what's happening on the ground. The coming days and weeks are going to be far worse than [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2452.22s)]
*  what's already passed and it's important we're honest about that, and it's important that we [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2457.82s)]
*  listen to these voices in these countries as we build solidarity. Now I'm going to bring in now, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2462.7000000000003s)]
*  we have been running a bit late, but we've been obviously had these incredible voices, I'm bringing [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2468.54s)]
*  in Yanal Jabarin, he was a Palestinian activist based in Jerusalem. Yanal, I'm so sorry that we've [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2473.1000000000004s)]
*  been a bit alone talking, but I really, really appreciate you taking the time. I know you're [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2478.06s)]
*  based in Jerusalem. Yeah. That's right. Well, Jack, can I just take first your, I mean, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2483.42s)]
*  as a Palestinian, just give me your general sense of the last few days. You can just talk to me just [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2491.98s)]
*  from the heart, how you feel, you know, your instinctive response to the last few days. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2498.86s)]
*  Well, Saturday the bombs were in Jerusalem, I think at eight o'clock. Saturday it's the last day [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2505.26s)]
*  in the Sukkot, in Dez, and all of us were in Jerusalem in Shabbat, [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2512.94s)]
*  there was nothing to do in Jerusalem in Shabbat, but at eight o'clock I was awake, but all the [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2523.9s)]
*  bombs, all of the rocks, I heard everything, and I just need to down and down and make to all my [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2531.34s)]
*  neighborhood to go out their homes. I was afraid. It was the first day, I think, and it was, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2540.7s)]
*  I don't know what happened, what happened. I just know that we in Jerusalem have a lot of bombs. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2549.74s)]
*  After that, we go back to see television. I see the news. I'm a journalist and I see [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2557.8199999999997s)]
*  all the news. It's so horrible, so difficult to imagine what happened there. After that, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2566.2200000000003s)]
*  it took me two days to write the first thing that I think about, thought about. I think I write [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2574.94s)]
*  the first thing. It was horrible to see and know a lot of stories there in Saturday in the South, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2585.42s)]
*  just not just the party, also in the village and the kibbutz there. After that, also as a Palestinian, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2595.26s)]
*  I have to know what happened in Gaza because the IDF soldiers also bombs in Gaza now, like five days. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2604.94s)]
*  And I'm in a difficult situation as an Arab, as an Israeli, as a Palestinian. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2617.34s)]
*  I have two hats, the hat of an Israeli. My friends were in the party. My friends also [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2625.42s)]
*  live in the South of Israel. Also, my journalist colleagues are living in Gaza. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2636.54s)]
*  I have always been talking with them all the time and it was so difficult to hear from them [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2645.9s)]
*  also stories. That was very difficult for me to be in this situation. Two hats, a Palestinian and [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2652.54s)]
*  an Israeli. My people as a Palestinian and my neighborhoods, my friends as an Israeli. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2662.06s)]
*  Can you tell me in terms of over the last few days, I know civil society organizations have [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2670.78s)]
*  been active on the ground and something is planned for tomorrow and Friday. Can you just tell us a bit [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2676.3s)]
*  about that? Yeah, the community here in Israel prepared very well. Where is the state? Where is [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2680.6200000000003s)]
*  the soldiers? What is the government? The state did it. The community did it. The organizations [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2688.46s)]
*  do it. They just have a lot of people, volunteers, to make a lot of stations to help soldiers, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2699.9s)]
*  to help in the South, Bedouins and Jewish, to help all of the poor guys already in the South. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2709.58s)]
*  The South is the poorest area in Israel and the toys, papers, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2720.14s)]
*  psychologies, also players of soccer teams go to the South and after that all of the South [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2731.9s)]
*  people go to our hotels in Elahat, Tel Aviv and here in Jerusalem. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2741.02s)]
*  That's how we can also easily go there and be with them. I think also the second thing we are [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2748.22s)]
*  doing is to calm the situation here in Israel. We don't want to restart as it was like in 2021 [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2758.78s)]
*  May when it was very difficult to see it here in Israel between Arab and Jewish people. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2769.9s)]
*  We just have to calm the teenagers. We have to calm the students. We have to calm all of the [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2779.9s)]
*  community, Arab community here and tell them we just have to remember we are also a citizen. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2788.1400000000003s)]
*  We're not just like a Palestinian who are also a citizen here in Israel. We have to be [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2797.2599999999998s)]
*  at the law, at the Israel law, to have to talk, to post, to tweet, but just in the law. Not talk [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2805.82s)]
*  about Israel as a criminal war or apartheid or anything because of this situation here. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2815.34s)]
*  In Israel this time Hamas started the world. Hamas started the murder of the Israeli people [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2826.54s)]
*  and we just have to figure it out. We are one citizen here in Israel. We just have to do it [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2837.02s)]
*  as a citizen also if we want to create critical the Israeli people and the government people. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2848.86s)]
*  Yeah, I'll just say thank you so much for joining us. I know you're just on mobile phone as you're [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2857.18s)]
*  running around so I really really appreciate it and solidarity and please you can follow [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2860.62s)]
*  Yanal Jabarin on social media so please do that. But Yanal thank you honestly so much. I really [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2865.66s)]
*  appreciate you joining us. Take care. And finally last but not least I'm going to bring in Hamza [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2870.7799999999997s)]
*  Ali Sharpe who is a Palestinian journalist based here in Britain. I often read your stuff Hamza so [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2878.46s)]
*  it's really brilliant to be able to have you join us like this. Thank you very much. I just [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2885.34s)]
*  want to start if it's okay. I know you've been doing media, British media, lucky you as ever. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2891.1000000000004s)]
*  We are blessed with that ecosystem. I want to start with this actually because I think it's so [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2897.7400000000002s)]
*  shocking. It just tells us a little bit about, I think it's a good jumping point, which is an [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2903.34s)]
*  interview on Newsnight with Hussain Zomlot who heads the Palestinian mission. We don't have an [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2908.78s)]
*  embassy because Palestinian statehood is not accepted. It isn't realized. We have a mission [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2915.7400000000002s)]
*  and he heads that and he was being interviewed by Kirsty Wilker News. Let's just listen to this. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2920.94s)]
*  Now of course there's more than 800 dead in Gaza including members of your own extended family. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2925.02s)]
*  What do you know what happened to them? They were just sitting at their home and they were [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2932.0600000000004s)]
*  simply bombarded. Their entire building was brought down. My cousin Aya, her two children, [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2937.18s)]
*  her husband, her mother-in-law and two other relatives died immediately, were killed instantly [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2946.3799999999997s)]
*  and two of her youngest children, a twin two years old, are now in intensive care. This is truly [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2953.58s)]
*  heartbreaking and the issue here, Kirsty, is that they have no bankers, they have no iron dome, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2961.5s)]
*  they have nowhere to go. They are simply sitting ducks for the Israeli war machine. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2967.34s)]
*  I'm sorry for your own personal loss. I mean can I just be clear though, you cannot condone [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2972.7000000000003s)]
*  the killing of civilians in Israel, can you, nor the kidnapped families? No, we don't condone and [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2977.9s)]
*  we are very clear, Kirsty, we reject any targeting or harming. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2983.5s)]
*  The video froze there for some reason of mine but I think when people could hear the audio, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2993.5s)]
*  which was sufficient, I just don't know where to start there. He was talking about the mass killing [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=2996.86s)]
*  of his own family and a journalist says, yes I feel lost. Anyway, are you going to condemn the [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3006.22s)]
*  mass murder of Israelis? You're a Palestinian, you're here in Britain watching this coverage [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3011.74s)]
*  unfold. What does that tell us about that one incident, about the way this is being covered? [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3020.9399999999996s)]
*  I think as a confirmation with what Palestinians have always thought of, which is that we are [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3028.22s)]
*  considered second-class citizens or at least our lives are not worthy because the premise that [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3032.7799999999997s)]
*  the presenter is speaking from is on the basis of innocent civilians being murdered, which of [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3039.18s)]
*  course there's nobody that is actively celebrating or at least nobody is rational anyway. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3044.7s)]
*  But then he's just emphasised that he's lost his own, Palestinians have lost civilians, his family [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3050.7s)]
*  have been murdered as well and that's just kind of relegated to a secondary status. It's seen as not [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3056.7799999999997s)]
*  as important as the other lives and I think that summarises and sums up the kind of the logic that [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3060.8599999999997s)]
*  has dictated much of the conversation on this, which is that Palestinian lives are considered [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3067.26s)]
*  fair game, the death, destruction, murder and trauma inflicted on Palestinians is considered fair [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3074.1400000000003s)]
*  game, whereas it's unspeakable and it's abominable that Israelis and civilians die and it should [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3078.3s)]
*  just be the same barometer applied and the same standards set for both civilians and both parties, [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3085.1800000000003s)]
*  but obviously that's not the case. Are you in terms of talking to people back in the occupied [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3091.26s)]
*  territories in Israel, what kind of stories you're hearing that are coming off the ground that it's [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3098.46s)]
*  important that we talk about? It's just a sense of helplessness but at the same time especially [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3104.94s)]
*  people in Gaza, it's the sense of you know we haven't even recovered from the previous round [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3110.1400000000003s)]
*  of bombardment, this one's more vicious, this is a newer round, but it's the same feeling, it's the [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3113.6600000000003s)]
*  feeling of helplessness, it's the fact that from what they say this will eventually perhaps subside [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3117.98s)]
*  and it will perhaps wane, but in the end there'll be more infrastructure that will be destroyed, [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3122.62s)]
*  more children have died, I mean four and five children already live with depression, grief in [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3127.1s)]
*  Gaza and this is only going to compound those matters and in the West Bank it's the same thing, [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3131.66s)]
*  it's the fact that this is a product of Israel's 75 years of you know multifaceted oppression, [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3135.26s)]
*  it's systematic ethnic cleansing, that is why we are where we are and too often we keep [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3141.18s)]
*  viewing things from the framework of you know what happened four days ago on the Saturday, [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3147.66s)]
*  that Saturday morning, which of course is an important moment or an important junction but [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3152.06s)]
*  the bottom line is that this came about as a result of you know decades of you know the siege [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3157.02s)]
*  on Gaza, the occupation of Palestine and the West Bank, you've got kind of the creeping annexation, [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3162.22s)]
*  the increasing settlements, the number of prisoners detained without charge or trial, the number of [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3167.1s)]
*  Palestinians that were murdered this year before Hamas even began devising a plan to reach the [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3171.74s)]
*  border. So this is an ongoing system of you know Israeli oppression and systematic ethnic cleansing [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3178.06s)]
*  on the Palestinians which has been so normalized and it's really shocking to see figures here, [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3185.3399999999997s)]
*  particularly in Britain, that you expect better from very irresponsible sentiments and like I [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3192.3799999999997s)]
*  said that the feeling back home is the same, it's helplessness, I was working to fellow [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3198.2999999999997s)]
*  journalists or fellow people in the field who have family back home and they've said we've [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3204.54s)]
*  well there's no electricity, we've sent WhatsApp messages and we don't know if they'll ever reply, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3208.94s)]
*  we don't know that may be the last message we've sent and these are things that even as we speak [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3212.62s)]
*  out loud it's you know it's incomprehensible, it's like something out of a sick movie and yet it's [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3216.86s)]
*  people's daily lives. I mean just in terms of that the stripping away of context, I mean the British [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3222.06s)]
*  media generally starts day one with any event and as being sorry day one being three days ago [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3228.3s)]
*  and tends to strip context from everything but this is obviously particularly the case since [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3235.34s)]
*  you get coverage when Israeli civilians are killed or Israelis are killed and obviously as we've said [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3240.78s)]
*  it's horrendous when that happens, that isn't afforded to Palestinians so this year 248 [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3247.1000000000004s)]
*  Palestinians were killed, 40 of them children before what currently happened and obviously [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3252.78s)]
*  there was almost no coverage whatsoever of that. I mean just in terms of I mean [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3259.1000000000004s)]
*  you know that stripping away of context, there was a media study a few years ago [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3265.26s)]
*  and it found that a significant chunk of the population thought that Palestine was occupying [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3270.38s)]
*  Israel and I know that sounds astonishing and many people will find that maybe difficult to [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3277.26s)]
*  believe but that's what the findings found and that had a lot to do with the framing of media coverage [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3283.82s)]
*  where you often get reactive coverage, the incidents involving for example Israeli life whilst [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3290.1400000000003s)]
*  with Palestinian life we just don't let alone occupation, let alone apartheid. I mean the fact [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3296.78s)]
*  that Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Israeli human rights organization Betsalem amongst [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3302.7000000000003s)]
*  many others call it apartheid, if you try saying that on a national media organization, well I tried [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3307.02s)]
*  it, you know the pushback is extreme, I mean that's what the challenge isn't it, it's just [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3311.9s)]
*  the context, any context based on fact is stripped away. Yeah and it's the fact that for example, [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3316.14s)]
*  we use an example in the Labour Party and people always you know latch, and you know it's more than [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3323.1s)]
*  anyone, they'll say oh why are you holding the Labour Party to a higher standard than the [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3327.66s)]
*  Conservative Party because the Conservative Party does what it says on the tin, they are ruthless [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3330.86s)]
*  in their world, the Labour Party is supposed to be an internationalist party, a progressive party, [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3334.7s)]
*  one that stands and supports liberation and freedom for everybody, irrespective of race, creed, [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3339.1s)]
*  colour, whatever it might be and yeah there is a double standard applied when it comes to [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3344.14s)]
*  Palestine. Keir Starmer about a year and a half ago maybe longer rejected with an interview with [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3349.3399999999997s)]
*  Jewish Chronicle, rejected the use of the word apartheid. Now he's a former human rights lawyer, [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3354.2999999999997s)]
*  he knows how forensic and rooted in law and you know conclusive research these reports are and he [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3358.46s)]
*  just rejects them casually just because for whatever reason you know it might be he's [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3364.54s)]
*  conflating it he said because this is a new party and you know this is a new but who said you have [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3369.42s)]
*  to you know this is a complete derelictional duty, who said anything to do with criticising Israel, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3373.58s)]
*  anything to do with anti-Semitism and the new look of the party that you're after. So in Britain like [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3377.9s)]
*  you said it's there's Palestinians are never given a voice and as the ambassador or the head of the [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3384.06s)]
*  mission pointed out brilliantly on the media numerous times it's the fact that like you said [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3388.7s)]
*  we've had several Palestinians murdered this year, several homes demolished, communities displaced, [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3394.54s)]
*  settler violence has gone up it's at a record level we've seen more annexation, more settlement [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3400.62s)]
*  threats in the West Bank. At no point have I seen anybody on BBC Sky or elsewhere being asked to [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3406.14s)]
*  condemn Israel's actions and that and then suddenly something happens which is like a [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3411.98s)]
*  flashpoint which they that like you said that starts a conflict off for them that is now [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3416.7s)]
*  the starting point for all intents and purposes and just deliberately it's a deliberate inaccurate [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3420.7s)]
*  reading of history. Just that point about the Labour Party and I'm just going to show a clip [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3425.3399999999997s)]
*  now from Emily Thornberry who's the Shadow Attorney General pretty important because that means she [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3430.54s)]
*  sets the tone of the legal position of the Labour Party she's also my local MP I should say and I've [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3437.58s)]
*  known her for many years let's just play this clip on Newsnight. Do you think cutting off food, [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3443.5s)]
*  water and electricity is within international law? I think that Israel has an absolute right [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3448.06s)]
*  to defend itself against terrorism. It is an answer to the question that you've asked and I [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3455.1s)]
*  think it's an appropriate one at this time. She was asked about a war crime I mean it's it what [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3460.3s)]
*  she was asked was do you think Israel has the right to commit war crimes that's essentially what she [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3468.14s)]
*  was asked it is illegal under international law to impose collective punishment it is illegal under [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3472.78s)]
*  international law to cut off food and electricity and water from a civilian population and the [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3478.0600000000004s)]
*  Shadow Attorney General of the British Labour Party sat there and responded that Israel has an [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3484.0600000000004s)]
*  absolute right to defend itself. I mean that is the Labour Party leadership lining up in support of [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3489.7400000000002s)]
*  war crimes against a civilian population and I should note actually that there's been a [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3496.7s)]
*  resignation let me just make sure I get the title right of the resignation oh yeah so it's the Young [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3503.3399999999997s)]
*  Labour's BAME officer has just resigned saying is with a heavy heart that today I've handed in my [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3508.14s)]
*  resignation for my role as the Young Labour BAME officer as a Palestinian with direct family in [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3513.02s)]
*  Gaza and absolutely appalled by the comments made to LBC by the leader of the Labour Party my local [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3517.3399999999997s)]
*  MP Kirstama this is another interview who said that Israel has the right to withhold water and [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3520.9399999999996s)]
*  electricity collective punishment is a war crime under international law this position was then [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3525.42s)]
*  reaffirmed by Emily Thornberry I've spent the last few days worried about the safety of my family [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3529.5s)]
*  with electricity now cut off and communication limited these worries are only exacerbated I [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3532.6200000000003s)]
*  received zero support from the Labour Party a common theme experienced by Muslim other Muslim [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3536.5400000000004s)]
*  Palestinian members the comments from the leadership this week have been the last straw I can only [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3540.86s)]
*  conclude the Labour Party is no longer a safe space for Palestinians and Muslims and that is [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3544.5400000000004s)]
*  Lubaba Khalid just your response to that. Yes it's unsurprising and it's a sentiment I've had people [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3548.2200000000003s)]
*  message me over the last few days and reach out say you know this is I think it's about time that [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3554.22s)]
*  we we hold the Labour leadership to account because this is this has been a long time coming [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3558.22s)]
*  that if you remember the Batley and Spen by-election the way that I think there was a there was a comment [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3561.8199999999997s)]
*  once from one of the journalists who said this is about Palestine not Peter it's become about [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3566.3799999999997s)]
*  Palestine not Peter for the Labour Party this obsession and you know like I said it's the [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3570.4599999999996s)]
*  dehumanization of Palestinians and and Kirstama himself and the leadership around him and the key [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3574.62s)]
*  figures have for a long time neglected and overlooked the Palestinian cause and as we [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3579.5s)]
*  mentioned the rejection of the word apartheid and the continuous you know when when the numerous [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3585.5s)]
*  rounds in which Israel has pummeled Gaza since Kirsta became a leader it's the same robotic [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3590.3s)]
*  recitations that he that he transmits you know he says Israel has the right to defend itself [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3595.26s)]
*  Emily formed his comments there again she's not alone because David Lammy was on [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3600.54s)]
*  was on LBC when asked and he said I back a ground invasion now Gaza is widely recognized [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3604.7s)]
*  as an open-air prison it's it's considered by UN Secretary-General as hell on earth why on earth [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3610.4599999999996s)]
*  is David Lammy asking for a humanitarian catastrophe to be made worse a ground invasion [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3615.8999999999996s)]
*  will be detrimental to every to unleash carnage on a scale perhaps unseen in Gaza even in Gaza's [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3620.2999999999997s)]
*  unseen and and so this is like it seems like this is the top line from the from the Labour [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3627.5s)]
*  Party and it's it's a complete dereliction of duty it's a it's an encouragement and you know [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3632.14s)]
*  green lighting war crimes and as I said as as the hypocrisy of the European Commission in a I think [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3637.58s)]
*  a tweet you shared Von der Leyen last year calling you know starving populations as a war crime you [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3644.94s)]
*  know imposing that on when it was Russia and now they can't commit to the same sentiments when it's [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3651.58s)]
*  when it's happening in in Gaza so I think that we'll be we'll see a lot of reactions not just [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3656.54s)]
*  from the Labour Party but broadly where people are effectively fed up and this may be the last [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3661.26s)]
*  straw for a lot of people but I from a personal experience have just in the last I guess 40 hours [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3665.34s)]
*  people have reached out and I've spoken to people who've said the line coming from the Labour Party [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3670.38s)]
*  is um is you know it's the it's the straw that brought the camels back and my automatic response [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3674.78s)]
*  as well it should have been ages ago but obviously and the Labour Party now I suspect this will be [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3681.0200000000004s)]
*  a major issue for a lot of people who otherwise might have given Labour Party benefit or whatever [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3687.26s)]
*  and finally just in terms of for those of us who support um standing in solidarity with the [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3692.2200000000003s)]
*  Palestinian people in this really bleak dark moment there is a demonstration in London a [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3698.2200000000003s)]
*  national demonstration which I'll be taking part in and I hope everyone listening or watching to [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3704.3s)]
*  this if they listen or watch it before Saturday join and take part and spread the word as much [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3708.1400000000003s)]
*  as possible and also in terms of donating to um uh in particular to um uh medical aid for Palestine [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3713.02s)]

*  to that broad audience? I think um we've seen you know we've seen attempts to at least uh fight [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3739.58s)]
*  back against some of the narratives I think I think that's important even though a lot of people [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3746.06s)]
*  have said you know the media is you know is controlling the dominant narrative or prevail [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3749.5s)]
*  by actually um even just having discussions like these and stalling sort of now checking up on [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3753.34s)]

*  shouldn't um we shouldn't give into that fear there are a lot of avenues like you said there [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3785.74s)]

*  where we had more voices who were prepared to do that and we're working on it so you know people [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3886.46s)]

*  didn't uh I'm just so important that we just let them speak as obviously as long as possible [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3906.38s)]
*  um hello there a lot of what's happening here and indeed around the world is due to western and [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3911.1800000000003s)]
*  British imperial intervention do you know what I mean yes absolutely and that obviously goes [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3914.94s)]
*  particularly here I mean used to have the the the mandate in Palestine under British rule [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3920.5400000000004s)]
*  and I have to say we're going to do some basic historical lessons here guys um what happened [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3925.18s)]
*  there I don't know obviously people again context a few days generally apply to what's happening [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3931.18s)]
*  here uh self-described Zionist militias undertook terrorist bombing campaigns in the run-up to the [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3936.94s)]
*  foundation of Israel not something you get heard about take the Urgun for example who bombed the [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3943.18s)]
*  King David Hotel in 1948 and killed around 90 uh uh mostly civilians um who are now venerated [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3948.38s)]
*  by the Israeli government and their leading figures ended up prime minister and the like um [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3956.3s)]
*  erased from history because you know there's almost a sense of well there's a difference here in terms [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3962.06s)]
*  of how the Palestinians what they've done and and what's come before them but civilians were [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3967.58s)]
*  targeted in terrorist attacks by amongst others those who founded the state of Israel [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3973.58s)]
*  um and what we've seen throughout I'm afraid the world is the role of the British Empire [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3979.8199999999997s)]
*  historically um in terms of carving up land and and and and the conflicts it's exacerbated and [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3986.94s)]
*  left behind and nurtured um and of course the way the west has behaved for much of the last few [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3994.14s)]
*  decades Afghanistan Iraq Libya and of course Palestine with their support of Israel it's very [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=3999.1s)]
*  important we make this people don't like history do they often they don't like that historical [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4004.46s)]
*  context but you cannot understand the evil the horrors of this world unless we look at what came [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4009.1s)]
*  before it it's really important that you made that point David Bratter what's the likelihood [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4016.46s)]
*  of this war spiraling into a much larger conflict across the middle east I think is a really [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4020.46s)]
*  important point and the problem is so much misinformation is flying around at the moment [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4024.14s)]
*  you know in terms of you know you get reports of incursions from Lebanon and then it turns out not [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4029.66s)]
*  to be the case and but there is a danger of a war what broadens and involves you know Syria Lebanon [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4033.66s)]
*  Iran um it's it's very it's very disturbing and worrying and you know we don't know um you know [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4041.98s)]
*  there's the point as well about what happens in terms of talk about Egypt um because I know [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4051.42s)]
*  though there's some talking sometimes you know from a good place um about um Egypt taking in [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4057.82s)]
*  refugees from Gaza but there's a danger of just the entire population of Gaza being emptied in [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4064.46s)]
*  a new Nakba Nakba is the catastrophe as the Palestinians call it in 1948 when they're driven [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4068.86s)]
*  from their homes and you get a new Nakba where they're driven from Gaza and they never come back [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4073.1s)]
*  and they're driven into the Sinai desert which is what Egypt believes actually whatever I think [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4077.42s)]
*  about the Egyptian regime by the way which is an abhorrent dictatorship in its own right [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4082.06s)]
*  um but yeah that's that's also a danger which we need to need to be very very clear about um FSM [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4086.2200000000003s)]
*  is a dog far-right politician siding with the far-right government look it's important to point [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4092.62s)]
*  out the far-right government because do you know what was so astonishing you know what you could [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4095.66s)]
*  almost you know before Israel decades ago had at least this image of having this kind of like you [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4099.58s)]
*  know Zionist socialist the kibbutz the kibbutz and all the rest of it and this kind of progressive [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4103.98s)]
*  sort of veneer even though it was based on the deprivation of Palestinian's right to national [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4109.339999999999s)]
*  self-determination this is a far-right government I mean you've got essentially you know self-described [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4113.66s)]
*  centre-left politicians cheering on a government what to the right of Donald Trump I mean [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4119.339999999999s)]
*  you know that's what you know when they're talking about so long they'd stand with Israel [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4127.179999999999s)]
*  there's a far-right government which is talking in a way it expects far-right government to talk [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4131.26s)]
*  about in terms of how they dehumanize the Palestinian people and they're talking about [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4135.26s)]
*  unleashing unspeakable horrors but yeah it's you know it's not just far-right politicians I'm sorry [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4139.9800000000005s)]
*  it's important point to make it's people who clearly aren't whatever I think of Margaret Hodge [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4145.42s)]
*  she's not far-right and she says well I don't stand with the you know Benjamin Netanyahu's [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4149.34s)]
*  government I've always opposed it and yet found it an affront to talk about the reality for the [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4152.780000000001s)]
*  Palestinian people. Dengas Van Sant, Labour's horribly weakened in response to this crisis [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4158.22s)]
*  left me feeling I'm likely to spoil my ballot next general election well I can more than sympathize [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4165.34s)]
*  with that I'm going to do a video shortly about what Labour has said because it really needs a [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4169.66s)]
*  response. Kieran Buckley, Hamas attacks were unjustifiable but politicians are regular people [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4173.9800000000005s)]
*  wanting to see normal Palestinians suffer and kill this truly sickening agreed. FSM is the dog [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4178.780000000001s)]
*  supporters of Ukraine support Israel go figure well look I support Ukraine's right to defend [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4183.82s)]
*  itself from an illegal and a brutal invasion by Russia but yeah I mean the point that was actually [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4188.299999999999s)]
*  made before actually really important point let me just bring up this is Ursula hold on let me [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4194.0599999999995s)]

*  it's important obviously that we that we talk about this at great length but anyway Ursula von [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4207.74s)]
*  Delaine who is the the the the European president of the sorry the president of the EU commission [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4211.66s)]

*  support for the existing bds campaign which is boycott divestment of sanctions modeled on the [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4268.94s)]
*  movement against um apartheid in South Africa David Ratter why does the media and western [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4273.5s)]

*  and in in a general sense state-diff persecution on any side is appalling especially when the [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4320.46s)]
*  crook west has your back I mean that's the point that's why people go what about hammers what about [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZyexB7hiw0&t=4324.54s)]
