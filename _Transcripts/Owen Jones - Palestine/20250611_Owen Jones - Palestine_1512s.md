# How Gaza Is Being STARVED To Death EXPOSED By UN's James Elder
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc)
*  You are about to hear the horrifying truth, live from Gaza, about how an entire people are being deliberately starved by Israel, facilitated by the West, in front of our very eyes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=0.0s)]
*  Today I'm speaking to one of the most important and eloquent Western voices during this hideous age of Israel's genocide of the Palestinian people. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=12.0s)]
*  He's James Elder, many of you will have seen him and heard from him. He's the spokesperson for UNICEF, of course the world's leading children's charity. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=22.0s)]
*  He's been in Gaza repeatedly since this genocide began. He's there now and he has truly compelling, horrible stories that we need to hear about what Palestinians in Gaza are going through. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=30.0s)]
*  First thing I want to ask you James is, I mean Israel imposed a total siege on Gaza, that's just unambiguously true, they declared that on the 2nd of March this year. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=43.0s)]
*  And that was already in the context obviously of, well I mean there was a blockade on Gaza before the 7th of October and since then obviously repeated blocking of aid, destruction of local food production and so on. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=52.0s)]
*  What was the impact, what's been the impact of what was imposed on the 2nd of March? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=63.0s)]
*  Yeah those three blockades now, one across the entire strip, two others, 75 to 90 days, the impact is you've got a population on the edge of famine, you've got hundreds of thousands of people, the very real risk of starvation. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=71.0s)]
*  Now it's been done in a way that these blockades, remembering it's clearly a war crime to use food as a weapon of war, that will be determined. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=86.0s)]
*  But each time there's a blockade, when the population becomes so stricken with hunger, then international pressure mounts on and there's a slight loosening of it, a slight loosening. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=97.0s)]
*  And then as soon as international attention dissipates again, it's tightened. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=108.0s)]
*  Now the thing with a famine is that once you have a famine, you have mass deaths. It's way too late, that's always been the case. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=113.0s)]
*  The difference with starvation is that starvation is the slow collapse of a child's body or an adult's body, the body literally starts to eat itself, you get cognitive decline. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=120.0s)]
*  Now starvation is happening here. Children's bodies in Gaza are not waiting for some declaration. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=131.0s)]
*  So there's this very nasty test being done around how far you can push a population and loosen it for a moment and then go again. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=138.0s)]
*  The entire conversation here, everyone, is about food. It's all about food, everyone I speak to irrespective of their economic circumstance. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=147.0s)]
*  One of the justifications for this siege, and I'll come on to the new so-called system that Israel has introduced, but is that Hamas is stealing the aid. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=155.0s)]
*  And that has been contradicted by amongst other things Cindy McCain, who's the director of the World Food Programme and also I should say the widow of the late Republican hawkishly for Israel, John McCain. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=165.0s)]
*  She said that wasn't true. But what's your, what, as someone you know, you know, you know, you're talking about the world food programme, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=176.0s)]
*  someone, you know, you know, this inside out, is that claim which was used to justify the siege true? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=184.0s)]
*  No, in the most clear sense, the answer from UNICEF is show us the evidence. At no point have we been presented with any evidence of aid diversion to any meaningful level, none whatsoever. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=191.0s)]
*  Remembering that this is not the first time we've worked in a place that's lacking governance that is a war zone. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=204.0s)]
*  And the United Nations does. From Somalia to Sudan, since World War II, you know, scores and scores of crises like this. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=209.0s)]
*  So it just doesn't bear out in evidence. It's as simple as that. So we're at this situation where these statements are made to try and discredit tried and tested aid systems so as to replace them, so as to supplant them. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=217.0s)]
*  Remembering aid workers, you're talking about doctors, nurses, logisticians. You're not just talking about, you know, armed soldiers handing out food. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=234.0s)]
*  So there is no there is no evidence. And I think the other important thing to note, Owen, is that aid is so much more than just food. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=242.0s)]
*  Aid is incubators, it's ventilators, it's vaccines, it's, you know, water purification tablets, it's hygiene kits for girls. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=250.0s)]
*  So firstly, aid is not just food in a box. And secondly, what on earth? What possible reason would Hamas have for these? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=261.0s)]
*  So it doesn't bear out in evidence. And the most clear sense, either in formal channels or informal channels, we've never had evidence presented to us. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=267.0s)]
*  I mean, Israel has set up something called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a shadowy organization. We don't know who's funding it. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=277.0s)]
*  The US Marine who headed it resigned, saying it would not fulfill the principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=284.0s)]
*  And it only set up aid points in the South, forcing people in the North to flee to the South if they want to eat very little food, a lot of it unusable. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=294.0s)]
*  And Bezelow Smoczcich, the finance minister, said its purpose was the entry of the minimum minimum necessary so that the world does not stop us and accuse us of war crimes. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=306.0s)]
*  What do you make? And then, of course, the key part is repeated massacres of starving Palestinians by the Israeli military as they try and get the very little food that is then being given out. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=316.0s)]
*  What do you make of this foundation and this project? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=330.0s)]
*  It's incredibly dangerous and this is not 20-20 hindsight. We said it a month ago before it started in terms of how utterly out of sync it is with what our humanitarian principles. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=335.0s)]
*  So let's go back a step to look at what humanitarianism actually is, because we saw it. We don't have to look at the scores of conflict zones that the United Nations and brave partners have been doing since World War II. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=347.0s)]
*  We only have to go back two months for the ceasefire. Hostages went home. The Gaza Strip was flooded with food, with water, with medicines, malnutrition dropped, disease dropped, access to painkillers increased. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=357.0s)]
*  This was because the United Nations and partners, we had 400 distribution sites across the Gaza Strip. It's what humanitarian aid is. You go to where people need it. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=368.0s)]
*  What they've set up, two, three, four sites just in the south. So if you're elderly, if you're a single mum with kids, if you're wounded, there's thousands of those. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=379.0s)]
*  If you're an amputee, if you're disabled, forget it. You don't get aid. More than that, it's two or three sites. It's militarized, as you rightly say. On the days it has been open, it's often closed. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=389.0s)]
*  When it's closed, there's contradictory information. People are told to go there. Then they're told it's a combat site in a war zone. Contradictory information kills people. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=400.0s)]
*  It's militarized, so it's not aid workers. You see the images. It is armed men throwing boxes of food on the ground. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=408.0s)]
*  And we've seen the worst case scenario, not only the deprivation of aid for so many other people who need it, as this effort is to try and remove an aid system that's tried and tested around the world. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=417.0s)]
*  You see children have been killed just trying to get aid. I was at a hospital three or four days ago. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=428.0s)]
*  And there's a little boy, a 13-year-old boy. Oh, and he got given money from his dad to go and buy bread. The family's one meal. That's your responsibility. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=434.0s)]
*  Off the kid goes, he suddenly sees all these people moving to one of these distribution points, and he thinks, I can be a hero in my family, not just bread. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=442.0s)]
*  I'm going to help bring my family, whatever's in one of these boxes. He goes there, and it's a standard story. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=450.0s)]
*  There is chaos. There is shooting. There is a tank shell. He gets shrapnel all through his body. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=456.0s)]
*  When I saw him, and I've seen way, way too many children with the wounds of war here, what's striking me this time on my fifth trip back is I'm not just seeing these little girls and boys. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=462.0s)]
*  I'm hearing them. The screams, the blood curdling streams. Little boy's still got open wounds. He's got shrapnel in his pancreas. He's got shrapnel they can't remove. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=473.0s)]
*  He gets five mils of painkiller in the morning at two o'clock in the afternoon. His dad's in tears as he recounts the story. That's a little boy. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=482.0s)]
*  You and I are speaking now. I'm getting the same thing from ICRC that another child was killed yesterday. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=491.0s)]
*  So it's dangerous. It's deepening hunger. And these are sites where people go to get a bag of flour and they come home in body bags. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=496.0s)]
*  I should say the Tory MP, Kit Malthouse, said that they replaced the existing humanitarian structures with a shooting range and an abattoir. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=507.0s)]
*  And that's coming from a Conservative member of parliament in this country. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=519.0s)]
*  I mean, as well as one of the things which, I mean, there's lots of aspects which aren't properly discussed, but, you know, I mean, what is that the aid being provided, for example, includes dried pasta and flour, but things like basic cooking materials are being banned from coming in. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=523.0s)]
*  People can't make often the food they have, can they? What are you going to do with flour if you don't have energy or fuel to cook it or water, fresh water, for example? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=541.0s)]
*  Absolutely spot on. People spend their day trying to cook. So there's no ready to eat food. Again, that's what humanitarianism is. You give people the things that they can use in the circumstances where they are. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=552.0s)]
*  So there's no ready to eat food. Nutritionists will always tell me what food poverty is for a child, right? There's seven types of food. You should get seven different types. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=562.0s)]
*  If you get less than food, it's for its food poverty. And that then starts to have a long term impact on a child's nutrition, on their cognitive development and so on. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=574.0s)]
*  This thing, far from helping nutrition, delivers food poverty in a box, according to nutritionists. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=583.0s)]
*  On top of that, I'm told by many, many people, because I spend my time here trying to bring evidence to see what's happening, it does frustrate me. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=590.0s)]
*  At times I'm constantly told, you know, there's no international journalists on the ground. I'm well aware of that. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=599.0s)]
*  There should be. There are reasons there are not. There are reasons why they're banned so they can't bear witness to this. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=604.0s)]
*  There are a lot of brave Palestinian journalists on the ground and I'm not quite sure when the United Nations stop being an impartial observer. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=609.0s)]
*  Anyway, I reach out to as many people as I can like that little boy, Abdulrahman, who is now in hospital. He's still alive. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=615.0s)]
*  And I'm told a couple of things. One is that the sugar and the cooking oil, which are the two most valuable things on the black market, are frequently stolen from the boxes before they're distributed. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=622.0s)]
*  And the other thing is it's a bit of a strongest person wins. I was with a family yesterday that I've known for a long time since November. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=632.0s)]
*  We're talking here, oh, and sorry to digress, but it's important this family is just extraordinary. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=642.0s)]
*  50 year medical student, sister is fourth year English lit. There is a mechanical engineer. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=647.0s)]
*  They are, as my Palestinian friend said, a family of geniuses. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=653.0s)]
*  And the English literature students said it's just humiliating. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=657.0s)]
*  Every day is humiliating. This is in English. Her English is better than mine. Her eloquence is immense. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=661.0s)]
*  But within that eloquence means that they also see through all this. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=666.0s)]
*  They that the depression and the sadness of what's happening to them, you know, seeps through. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=671.0s)]
*  So she said it's just utterly humiliating to go every day to a to a hospice and hope that you'll get a ladle of food. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=676.0s)]
*  They as a family always make a decision. Do they stay again? Do they move? They'd move four times. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=683.0s)]
*  I met Marwa, the medical student in November, 2023. They've been displaced three times. They went back to their home of rubble. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=689.0s)]
*  She said she wished she didn't if she knew what it looked like. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=697.0s)]
*  It's what psychologists have warned me when people go home and see what they've lost. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=700.0s)]
*  The level of depression gets worse. Then they were evacuated again. They had a discussion. Do we leave? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=704.0s)]
*  When I met them now, they're back in a tent. The mother is terribly depressed because she does have children who are geniuses. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=709.0s)]
*  And she's utterly aware of what they are lacking and what they are losing. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=715.0s)]
*  And they had a discussion with one of the sons in their 20s, the mechanical engineer, go to this site and try and get food. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=720.0s)]
*  They all agreed that, no, they're better to starve where they are than to go and be shot and to be starving. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=727.0s)]
*  Apparently, the scenario is, and I've heard this multiple times now, that many of those people, not all, many of those people getting aid have knives. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=733.0s)]
*  So if you've got a knife, you get a box. If you don't, like 99.99 percent of people in Gaza, you get nothing. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=741.0s)]
*  Or you get, as I've seen many times, you get shrapnel or a bullet. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=748.0s)]
*  This is the system that is somehow being designed to replace the one thing that's proven since World War II to be able to keep people alive in hell zones like this. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=752.0s)]
*  I mean, combined as well, what again is neglected is it's not just the lack of food aid getting in that Gaza's [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=765.0s)]
*  domestic food production has been destroyed. Over 95 percent of agricultural land rendered unusable. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=772.0s)]
*  Eighty one percent of cropland damaged. Eighty three percent of plant life destroyed. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=777.0s)]
*  Almost all cattle and poultry dead. Milk production nearly halted. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=781.0s)]
*  I mean, that's the point, isn't it? It's the need is much, much greater and the provision is much, much smaller. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=787.0s)]
*  Absolutely. And those things sort of meditate on them for a moment. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=793.0s)]
*  You know, like the systematic destruction of agriculture, of the economy, of universities, of of an education system, the pride of this region, the literacy rates in Gaza, my goodness. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=798.0s)]
*  And yes, just that lack of access to proper food. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=811.0s)]
*  And I think people can be tempted, even the people, the outpouring of support and solidarity from people around the world, they can be tempted to think, OK, well, there's a bit of rice and so on. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=815.0s)]
*  The family I mentioned before, they're not a rich family at all. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=825.0s)]
*  They are a working class family here. Spent 30 years building their home, though, because that's what you do. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=828.0s)]
*  That got destroyed in a flash. But Gaza's chicken, they eat meat. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=833.0s)]
*  That's what they do. They just had to eat a la ha. They celebrate none of that. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=836.0s)]
*  That's all gone. And as I said, this lack of dignity that people feel. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=840.0s)]
*  So it's important as we try so hard to humanize this scenario. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=844.0s)]
*  I never thought I've spent on pretty much my working life doing this. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=848.0s)]
*  And for UNICEF, when you advocate for children, it's not that complicated. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=855.0s)]
*  You advocate publicly and privately that children, you know, they get the nutrition that they need, that they're safe, that children are in classrooms. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=858.0s)]
*  When I stood in hospitals and seen little girls and boys ripped apart and children had an amputation and now they're going to lose their other leg because there's no they're not allowed to be medically evacuated. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=866.0s)]
*  I suddenly dawned on me once. My challenge here is not to start that level of advocacy. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=876.0s)]
*  My challenge here is to advocate that children are in fact children here. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=882.0s)]
*  And that is a terrifying place to start from. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=886.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, just on that, I mean, my twin sister just given birth, obviously, very special moment. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=891.0s)]
*  And it just could not stop thinking, you know, there's this constant fretting of a newborn child, making sure it's it's it's it's a very special moment. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=898.0s)]
*  It's it's it's in a comfortable environment. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=905.0s)]
*  You know, a lot of new mothers often obviously very anxious in a very healthy, protective way, making sure they're fed at the right time or that kind of thing. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=907.0s)]
*  And I just think, you know, what is under discussed, we've got 20 months of this and you think about the impact on a child's development in terms of not being fed properly, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=916.0s)]
*  the constant mental trauma, not being educated, not having health care. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=926.0s)]
*  And you kind of think, how does a child ever recover from that? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=931.0s)]
*  Yes, that's what we think of, too, because we are in uncharted territory. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=937.0s)]
*  There is there's no headline in saying that every single child in Gaza needs mental health support. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=941.0s)]
*  That's never been said before of a population. Every single one. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=947.0s)]
*  There is no doubt, as you say, that decimation of things that mothers need before October 7, there were 550 health service points across Gaza, 550. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=951.0s)]
*  There is now not one that's fully functional. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=964.0s)]
*  If you're a mother with a sick baby or you're a mother who's unwell herself and is seven and a half months pregnant and premature, well, the incubators you need are blocked. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=967.0s)]
*  They're restricted. They're on the other side of the border, five miles away. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=975.0s)]
*  And if your baby gets sick, can't go to a hospital. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=979.0s)]
*  The hospital floors are full of children with the with the wounds of war. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=982.0s)]
*  And then so this is the devastation of a society. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=986.0s)]
*  I mean, that's why I'm so reluctant when we call this a war, because firstly, wars have laws. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=990.0s)]
*  Secondly, this is devastation of a society, as you rightly point out, the educated, the education, the agriculture, the economy, the devastation of children. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=996.0s)]
*  Child by child. Education here is the envy of a region. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1006.0s)]
*  There are you can talk to any universities around the region and they always talk about how they want Gaza. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1013.0s)]
*  They're all multilingual. They're all great at sciences. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1018.0s)]
*  And I've seen that I've noticed that that no matter how many crises occurred in the last 20 years, moms, dads, grandparents consistently found ways to keep their kids in school. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1020.0s)]
*  It was extraordinary. The value they place on it. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1032.0s)]
*  But yeah, that that's been literally bombed away. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1034.0s)]
*  You know, and still still I talk to young people who are like, can you bring me in a tiny solar, you know, little solar panel so I can charge things because I'm studying at night. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1038.0s)]
*  They're studying at night. Medical students are studying 16 year olds are studying for their exams at night in the bombardment after spending four hours looking for firewood and trying to bring a few bowls of soup. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1048.0s)]
*  It's extraordinary. And the answer is no, I'm restricted from bringing in those things. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1058.0s)]
*  I mean, that's not my answer, of course, but formally, that's the restriction. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1063.0s)]
*  So, yes, for UNICEF knowing what we know around the world when it comes to deprivation, this is all manmade deprivation, what that means to a child, what that means in terms of stunting, the scientific impact of stunting on a child's brain, the lifelong impact it has on the child and therefore on the family, therefore on the community and therefore on the society. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1068.0s)]
*  It's just another reason why anyone with influence has to act. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1089.0s)]
*  My executive director got it right in October 2023, the destruction of Gaza and the killing of so many children cannot possibly bring peace to the Middle East. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1093.0s)]
*  So whether leaders choose pragmatism or principle, they need to choose one of them and they both lead to the same place, which finally is to protect civilians, girls, boys, mums, dads in Gaza. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1101.0s)]
*  One thing, this is a, well, these are all grim things to ask about, but the economists, which actually backed Israel's onslaught, they did a study and they suggested that the death toll from violent means alone from people killed through traumatic injuries, being bombed, shot, that kind of thing, could be up to 110,000. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1113.0s)]
*  We know, I mean, for example, in Yemen, the UN's own estimates were that most people who died died of indirect causes. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1132.0s)]
*  They didn't die because of the violence that I went to a Yemeni refugee camp with UNICEF, in fact, and I'm not in any way belittling the horror of Yemen, but Yemen was not reduced to the level of apocalyptic ruin and total siege that Gaza has. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1141.0s)]
*  I mean, from what you know, you know, it's a horrible term often used called excess deaths, indirect deaths, which are not recorded because they're not violent deaths. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1154.0s)]
*  Is that something including amongst children? Do you think this is something which is not properly being taken into account when we think about the lethal impact of this? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1167.0s)]
*  Without a doubt, without a doubt. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1176.0s)]
*  You know, I meet children all the time to try to tell their stories. They seem not to resonate with people, but there's kids here with cancer. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1179.0s)]
*  You know, you talk of your sister. Congratulations, by the way. It's a beautiful moment. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1185.0s)]
*  It's a beautiful moment for moms here and being pregnant is a beautiful moment. Not now. It's horrific for people. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1189.0s)]
*  It's terrifying for them as they as they see what's happening to their what's happening to their children. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1196.0s)]
*  So there are kids with cancer, you know, but there's treatment for cancer. There was a very, very world class cancer cancer, a part of Shefa Hospital, by the way. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1202.0s)]
*  I was destroyed diabetes. The most simple things. There's no doubt. Yeah, absolutely. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1210.0s)]
*  Children are being killed. Children are dying. Children are suffering and suffering greatly, too. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1215.0s)]
*  That's the thing as well. Some of these some of these ailments without the right drugs, not only to treat them, but just to prevent that pain, make life horrendous for children. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1220.0s)]
*  And it all speaks into that idea of medical evacuation. These children who have existing conditions as you and I speaking about all those children that we see who somehow survived the bomb blast, the fire in their house, the airstrikes, somehow they survived it. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1229.0s)]
*  The ones I see. And then they're in hospital and they're like watching kids be torn apart. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1244.0s)]
*  The number of children who I've kept in touch with and had an arm amputated and then because they were denied medical evacuation three weeks later had their hand amputated and two weeks later I'm warned if they don't get out, James, they'll lose their leg. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1252.0s)]
*  And they do. So that medical evacuation is there's no logistical reason for that. It can happen. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1263.0s)]
*  It's it's a simple reason of being denied an exit and not enough third party countries, not enough countries in Europe saying, yes, we will take these children. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1269.0s)]
*  And so these children who survive horrific, horrific bombardments or who are fighting cancer or have got diabetes and need that care that a host of European countries offer are denied the chance to leave here and the chance to go there. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1278.0s)]
*  And I'm sorry, it's so graphic. And so they and so they die, but they don't they don't die gently. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1295.0s)]
*  It's rather horrendous how how some of these girls and boys. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1301.0s)]
*  Yeah, I saw her. We're seeing things now. Oh, and repeated. I met a little girl yesterday, Donna Donna six. I met her in our hospital. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1306.0s)]
*  And I really noticed because she had these beautiful pink fingernails all aunts and uncles were there. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1317.0s)]
*  And so they explained to me that she was silent, but they explained that her home was targeted in November 2023 killed both her parents. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1322.0s)]
*  The story you and so many others have heard along for a long time, killed both her parents and she didn't speak for six months, but she's got these amazing aunts and uncles. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1330.0s)]
*  So after six months, they brought that back. And, you know, bringing a little bit of Donna back out of herself. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1339.0s)]
*  And then two weeks ago, the home she was staying in was targeted and 10 of the 10 family members were killed. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1346.0s)]
*  Children have endured things that none of us can possibly imagine. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1352.0s)]
*  We hope like hell we'll never know anyone that it happens to. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1355.0s)]
*  Now it's happening again because this 600 day horror show doesn't stop. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1358.0s)]
*  We're just finally based on what you've seen in terms of what the children of Gaza, because obviously UNICEF exists there to protect and defend the rights for children to be able to live decent, comfortable lives in safety. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1365.0s)]
*  What do Western states need to be doing? What is the urge? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1380.0s)]
*  What is, you know, what needs materially to happen to stop the children of Gaza suffering what is, as you say, an unprecedented catastrophe, which is entirely human made. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1384.0s)]
*  Yeah, and it's it's not complicated to ceasefire to ceasefire. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1397.0s)]
*  We've done it before. A ceasefire hostages go home. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1400.0s)]
*  Let's end that horror. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1403.0s)]
*  I hate floods. The Gaza Strip. Mums can promise their kids, promise them you will wake up tomorrow morning. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1405.0s)]
*  Children look in their parents eyes. They're well aware their parents have lost that ability to protect them and their parents are well aware they've lost the ability to protect their children and ask any parent, even me with grown up kids, that sends a shiver down my spine. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1411.0s)]
*  So it's a ceasefire. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1422.0s)]
*  And if they can't come to terms of a ceasefire, then let's stop breaking every international law known and let aid, medicines, water, food, nutrition, hygiene kits, let that come across the come across the Gaza Strip. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1423.0s)]
*  At the very least, that humanitarian aid come not men with guns, private contractors guarded by Israeli soldiers, the organizations that have been doing this work since World War Two and did it during the ceasefire. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1437.0s)]
*  At the very least, don't let these children starve. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1450.0s)]
*  I mean, it's chilling that that is the bar really is on the floor. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1458.0s)]
*  James, your work is ever in terms of communicating one of the great crimes of our age has something which I think we're all beyond appreciative of. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1463.0s)]
*  You've been in Gaza now repeatedly. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1473.0s)]
*  And I can't imagine the emotional labor involved in terms of witnessing these horrors being inflicted on children and not being able to stop it. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1475.0s)]
*  And you communicate this so brilliantly, so well, and it does spur people into action. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1483.0s)]
*  So, you know, beyond appreciative. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1488.0s)]
*  So everyone do share the video, press like, subscribe, leave your comments. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1490.0s)]
*  That all helps people then listen to James, which is the point. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1493.0s)]
*  James, as ever, thank you so much. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1497.0s)]
*  Good on you, Aaron. Great to speak. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVYX_vH0dc&t=1500.0s)]
