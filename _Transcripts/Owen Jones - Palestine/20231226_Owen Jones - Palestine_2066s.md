# "This Won't End Well For Israel": Palestinian Ex-Negotiator Diana Buttu's Masterclass
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [December 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE)
*  Hello, hello, hello. I'm particularly delighted today to be joined by Diana Boutou. Now, Diana [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=0.0s)]
*  Boutou is a Palestinian who grew up in Canada, lives in the West Bank, previously took part in [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=4.72s)]
*  the peace negotiations between Palestine, the representatives of the Palestinian people and [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Israel, former advisor to the Palestinian president and prime minister. But now, since then, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=16.48s)]
*  a lawyer, an analyst, a writer, you do have a lot of hats, Diana. We were talking about this [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  beforehand. You were like, I don't have many hats. You have a lot of hats. That's many hats. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=28.48s)]
*  But it's an honor to have you. So thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=32.96s)]
*  Thank you, Owen. Thank you. It's really the honor is all mine. Thank you. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=35.76s)]
*  I just want to start with, I mean, you know, there's so many horrors taking place right now. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=39.28s)]
*  It's very difficult to know where to begin in some ways. I think I keep circling back to this when [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=44.16s)]
*  I talk to people about this, which is the intent. I chatted to Raz Seigal, who is an Israeli-American, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=50.56s)]
*  for those who don't know, historian of genocide and Holocaust studies. And he said it's very rare [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=60.24s)]
*  that intent is so openly stated in these cases, often when regime states engage in gross human [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=64.0s)]
*  rights abuses, war crimes, they try to cover it up. They're quite subtle about it. Not so in this [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=71.92s)]
*  case. And the latest example is Benjamin Netanyahu essentially confessing that the plan is to [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=76.64s)]
*  ethnically cleanse the Palestinian people from Gaza. He was asked about in terms of what's called [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=82.88s)]
*  voluntary migration. And that being, he's saying that's what we're working towards. No one thinks [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=88.56s)]
*  voluntary migration is a thing. It would mean the forcible displacement of the Palestinian people. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  I just want your thoughts, your response to that, given you're someone who had to negotiate [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=101.6s)]
*  previously with the Israeli state, in terms of the context, because obviously there's the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=105.84s)]
*  Nakba 1948 when you got the mass expulsion of 700,000 Palestinians, more than, what's your [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=109.36s)]
*  thought, what's your response to what Benjamin Netanyahu said there? You know, this is precisely [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=114.72s)]
*  what Professor Raz Seigal was talking about, which is that it's rare that you see [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=119.12s)]
*  these leaders come out and very openly describe intent. When we look at genocide, there's two [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=126.16s)]
*  components to it. One is the actual carrying out of genocide, ethnic cleansing, etc., crimes against [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=131.44s)]
*  humanity. And the second part is the intent. And it's that intent part that is often the most [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=138.16s)]
*  difficult to prove. But here we are from day one. This Israeli prime minister made clear that what [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=145.2s)]
*  he wants to see is the elimination of Gaza. We heard this through members of the Israeli cabinet, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=152.96s)]
*  we heard this through members, through the Israeli president himself, who came forward and made these [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=161.76000000000002s)]
*  claims that Gaza needs to be made smaller, that there are no innocents in Gaza. And what Netanyahu [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=169.68s)]
*  has been saying all throughout this period is that he wants to push Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  into the Sinai Peninsula and then other places as well, in order to make a, as they put it, smaller [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=183.52s)]
*  and smaller in size Gaza Strip. So the intent is very clear there. And one of the things that's [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=191.12s)]
*  very interesting is that not only has he made this intent clear, he's made the actions clear. The [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  actions have exactly followed and replicated his intent. And yet we see people try to stretch their [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  imagination and try to do these mental gymnastics to somehow think that that's not exactly what [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=210.16s)]
*  Netanyahu wants. But he's made it very clear this is what he wants. Again, it's not just him, it's [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=217.6s)]
*  members of his cabinet, it's members of the Israeli army, it's the Israeli president. Across the Israeli [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=222.72s)]
*  spectrum, this is what you see. And instead of the world putting the brakes on Netanyahu, they [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=228.95999999999998s)]
*  somehow seem to be falling into this plan. What he has done is he has made the Gaza Strip unlivable. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=235.44s)]
*  If you look at Gaza City, Gaza City used to be the largest Palestinian city [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=242.8s)]
*  in the occupied Palestinian territories. And it now no longer exists. He wiped Gaza City off the map, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=247.60000000000002s)]
*  making the Gaza Strip unlivable. And the next step is to do everything from say, you want education? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=255.28s)]
*  Sure, go to the Sinai. You want health care? Sure, go to Egypt. Do you want to have a house? Sure, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=261.52s)]
*  go to Egypt. Or from there, go to Canada, or go to Austria, or go to Australia, or wherever it is. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=268.16s)]
*  This is the problem, is that nobody has been listening to what he is saying and nobody is [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=275.12s)]
*  actually stopping him as he's clear that he's carrying out genocide. I mean, another example [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=281.12s)]
*  is, I mean, there's so many, but in terms of that point you make about making Gaza inhospitable, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=288.48s)]
*  the conditions being for life being made impossible, which is one of the basic [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=292.88s)]
*  of course, tenets of making a genocide possible, is flooding the, they say they're going to flood [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=297.84s)]
*  Hamas tunnels with seawater. And that would then flood the water supplies of Gaza and then obviously [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=304.15999999999997s)]
*  make it impossible for people to drink fresh water. I mean, just that point I interviewed as well, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=312.56s)]
*  Omar Bartoff, who's another Israeli-born historian, scholar of genocide studies. And he was talking [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=318.79999999999995s)]
*  about ethnic cleansing and genocide and when one becomes the next. And he says, the thing is, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=326.48s)]
*  genocide can so easily become, sorry, ethnic cleansing could become genocide because people [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=330.72s)]
*  don't want to move. And then you have to kill them. And I just think in Gaza, it seems very striking [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=334.88s)]
*  to me, the Palestinian people obviously do not want to move. They know the history of the Palestinian [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=340.96000000000004s)]
*  people, which is once you leave, you don't come back. So I'm just interested in that kind of how, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=345.04s)]
*  when they talk about voluntary migration, what would it take, do you think in terms of, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=350.8s)]
*  in practical terms, would Palestinian people, even if things become so difficult, would that happen? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=356.56s)]
*  Would they leave under duress? Yes. And that's what he's doing. This is precisely what he's [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=363.20000000000005s)]
*  aiming to do. Look, the attack that Israel has been carrying out on Palestinian hospitals, on schools, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=369.28000000000003s)]
*  on churches, on mosques, this is deliberate. It's deliberately designed to ruin the infrastructure [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=377.76s)]
*  that existed within the Gaza Strip. Add to that the flooding, as you've already mentioned, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=385.84s)]
*  of the water supply. Now, I'm sure you already know this, Owen, 95% of the water supply that [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=391.03999999999996s)]
*  was in the Gaza Strip was actually undrinkable. And it was undrinkable because Israel was never [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=398.24s)]
*  allowing Palestinians to repair the water aquifer that rests underneath the Gaza Strip. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=403.2s)]
*  And so it was already unlivable. But now with the bombing of all of this infrastructure, with [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=409.28s)]
*  all of this, these people who are wounded, the thousands of people wounded, the thousands of [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=415.59999999999997s)]
*  people who, under the age of 18, who required amputations, this, in order to treat them, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=421.36s)]
*  requires infrastructure. And he knows that in order for people to get this treatment, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=427.92s)]
*  they're not going to be able to do so in the Gaza Strip. So just to be able to stay alive, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=436.32s)]
*  they're going to go out and they're going to leave to Egypt and then further onwards, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=441.6s)]
*  whether it is to Jordan or other parts of the Arab world or to North America or to Europe. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=447.44s)]
*  This is precisely what he is working towards. And he said as much. This is precisely what they're [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=454.96s)]
*  looking towards doing. And this is why it amounts to genocide. It's not just wiping people and [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=460.79999999999995s)]
*  killing them and wiping them off the map, but making it so that they cannot survive, that they [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=467.76s)]
*  cannot have a sustainable life, cutting off all measures of having a life. And that's what he did [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=472.56s)]
*  with day one when he announced that there was going to be no electricity, no water supply, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=479.2s)]
*  no fuel, no food supplies, and no medicines either. The amount of humanitarian aid that is coming into [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=484.4s)]
*  the Gaza Strip now is barely a trickle to meet the needs of one day of the population of the Gaza Strip, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=493.44s)]
*  much less after 81 days of a sustained bombing campaign. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=502.8s)]
*  And with just your thoughts about the role of the US in all of this, we get what I would describe as [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=509.12s)]
*  hand-wringing. I think that's the right term for what Joe Biden keeps doing, occasionally talking [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=513.6800000000001s)]
*  about the sheer number who've been killed innocent civilians in Gaza. Jeremy Scarhill, the brilliant [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=517.84s)]
*  investigative journalist who works for The Intercept who I interviewed, said that Joe [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=526.16s)]
*  Biden could end all of this with a phone call. I'm just wondering what your thoughts about this, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=529.52s)]
*  about the kind of moral posturing you sometimes get from Joe Biden and then what in practice [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=533.12s)]
*  the US role actually is. Look, this isn't just, this isn't a war Israel versus, over Gaza. This [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=540.24s)]
*  isn't an Israeli attack on Gaza. This is an Israeli-American attack on Gaza. And why do I [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=547.68s)]
*  say that? You know, the Israelis could have stopped this a long time ago, and the Americans [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=554.32s)]
*  could have stopped this a long time ago, but neither one is stopping this. Neither one is [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=561.2800000000001s)]
*  choosing to do it. In fact, in the first days of the attack on the Gaza Strip, we saw everything from [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=566.48s)]
*  more aid come into Israel from the United States. We saw that aircraft carriers came into [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=573.36s)]
*  Israel. We saw that more weapons came in and army personnel as well. And so this isn't just a simple [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=580.88s)]
*  support for Israel as it continues its very brutal attack on the Gaza Strip. This is very [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=590.4799999999999s)]
*  much funded and facilitated by the United States. And the fact that we've seen Biden repeat these [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=596.64s)]
*  false claims day after day after day, the fact that we've seen that they have not actually [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=604.4000000000001s)]
*  supported any UN Security Council resolution calling for a complete stop to Israel's bombing [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=610.5600000000001s)]
*  campaign. The best that they could do was call for humanitarian pauses, and only then they abstained. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=617.44s)]
*  It's very clear that this is not just an Israeli war on the Gaza Strip, but it's an Israeli and [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=623.9200000000001s)]
*  American war on the Gaza Strip. Now, when it comes to the one phone call, one of the things that's [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=631.36s)]
*  very interesting is that the Israelis in their own media are talking about how it is that they're the [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=637.04s)]
*  ones who are calling the shots, that it's no longer up to the United States to tell Israel when it is [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=643.6800000000001s)]
*  that it can and should stop things. And yet at the same time, this is the same country that is [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=650.0s)]
*  accepting this military aid, that is accepting these weaponry, that's accepting the aircraft [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=654.8s)]
*  carriers, and that is accepting the military personnel. And so as much as Israel wants to prop [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=661.12s)]
*  itself up and show that this is a question of their own free will, we know very well that this is very [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=666.8s)]
*  much funded and fueled by the United States. This is Biden's war. In terms of what happens next in [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=672.88s)]
*  the role of the US, the polling is very clear that many natural large chunks of the democratic [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=679.76s)]
*  coalition, I'm thinking of younger people, I'm thinking of Muslim Americans, Arab Americans, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=687.12s)]
*  are obviously very angry about this, to say the least. Younger Americans, according to the poll, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=691.8399999999999s)]
*  are the most pro-Palestinian generation in American history. And what often happens is [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=696.2399999999999s)]
*  the democratic establishment will scream at these people, you have to vote against Trump, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=701.76s)]
*  you have a duty and a responsibility, rather than try to listen to their concerns, they'll just [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=705.92s)]
*  scream at them, like, you're a disgrace, you're a moral outage, how dare you, we hate you, but vote [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=709.92s)]
*  for us. And that doesn't generally often work with people, and a lot of them might not vote and sit [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=713.76s)]
*  on their hands, and the consequence of that could be Trump. So I'm just wondering what your thoughts [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=718.88s)]
*  of what that could mean in practice, that Biden's strategy just to allow this mass slaughter [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=722.16s)]
*  could lead to his own voters refusing to vote for him and then Trump, and what would that mean [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=730.8s)]
*  in terms of Trump in all this? It's not clear, it's not entirely clear, because the Democratic [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=734.64s)]
*  Party has always been very good at dangling Trump out as saying you must vote for him, if not, if [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=740.4s)]
*  you don't vote for Biden, then you're going to get Trump. It's not entirely clear to me what will [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=746.48s)]
*  happen. That said, I do think that there is a lot of movement in the United States, and a lot of [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=751.1999999999999s)]
*  people who are cutting through the propaganda machine that they've seen come to play over the [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=756.8s)]
*  course of the past 81 days. What's fascinating is that you see that people are actually searching [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=762.96s)]
*  for the truth, and as much as Israel, aided by the way by many mainstream outlets, as much as they're [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=769.52s)]
*  trying to hide the truth, as much as they're trying to portray this as a war of equal sides, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=776.8000000000001s)]
*  people are looking for what's actually happening in Gaza, and when they find out, when they see [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=782.72s)]
*  that over 20,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli bombs, when they see that these bombs [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=789.3599999999999s)]
*  are also killing kids, when they see that the basics of food and medical supplies and water [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=796.24s)]
*  are not being allowed in, and when they see that hospitals are being deliberately targeted, it's [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=804.0s)]
*  not at all, it's not a stretch of the imagination for them to be calling out their representatives [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=810.0799999999999s)]
*  and saying, we want this to stop. The real question becomes what's going to happen in the [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=817.12s)]
*  future, and whether these people are actually listening to how it is that younger people, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=822.24s)]
*  and not just younger people, but people all across the spectrum, how it is that they're actually [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=827.68s)]
*  feeling, or if they're going to continue to hide behind the bogeyman, i.e. Trump. One of the things [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=832.16s)]
*  I'm interested in just in terms of broader context, given your role that you used to be on, you know, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=838.88s)]
*  negotiating with Israel, I'm interested because I know you ended up regretting that, and I think [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=843.6800000000001s)]
*  that itself is quite interesting in itself, so it'd be good to talk about that. It's just recently [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=846.88s)]
*  there was an intervention by Zippy Hotevelli, who, and I use this in the worst possible way, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=851.36s)]
*  an extraordinary individual, is the Israeli ambassador to the United Kingdom, and when she [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=859.44s)]
*  was asked about the possibility of a two-state solution, she said, absolutely not. And then [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=864.4s)]
*  Mark Regev, who I would say is a very slick performer, if you want an apologist for mass [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=868.32s)]
*  slaughter, then he's a slick performer, but he was asked about this, and he said, and I think [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=873.04s)]
*  this was actually one of the most important interviews of the whole horror show, which he [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=878.48s)]
*  said, well actually if you look back at Yitzhak Rabin, the former Israeli prime minister, who was [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=883.36s)]
*  seen as a peacemaker, but he said the Palestinians were getting an entity less than a state. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=888.3199999999999s)]
*  And the reason I bring that up is, what's often, you know, the narrative is, well the Palestinians [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=893.28s)]
*  have these opportunities to have a state, they have these opportunities, and they turn them down, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=897.1999999999999s)]
*  and therefore they are the architects of their own catastrophe. And I'm just wondering, just given [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=901.04s)]
*  that he basically blew that narrative up, I thought unintentionally, what your thoughts are [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=906.4s)]
*  as a former member of the negotiating team, and why, you know, why you regretted it, I suppose, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=910.56s)]
*  in that context? Look, the architects of the catastrophe are Israel, that's what we call [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=913.5999999999999s)]
*  the Nakba, the Nakba literally means catastrophe in Arabic, and the architects of it are Israel, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=918.16s)]
*  and Israelis, who believe in the ethnic cleansing of Palestine, who continue to maintain a [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=924.56s)]
*  state on the ruins of Palestinian villages, including my family's own village, who to this [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=930.8s)]
*  very day continue to maintain a system of apartheid, who continue to push and advocate and carry out [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=937.1999999999999s)]
*  plans of ethnic cleansing, albeit in a slower fashion, before this latest attack began on the [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=944.8s)]
*  Gaza Strip. So if anybody's the architect, it's them. But to get to the point about what Yitzhak [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=951.3599999999999s)]
*  Rabin said, Mark Regev is right, and this is why I think it's so important for people to understand [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=957.04s)]
*  that there has never in the Israeli mindset been an idea that Palestinians are entitled to equality, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=963.5999999999999s)]
*  or to be entitled to an equal state. They've never had this in their mindset. For them, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=970.9599999999999s)]
*  the mindset is all about ethnic cleansing, which is something that both Sippy and Mark Regev [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=977.4399999999999s)]
*  believe in, or they have in their mind the idea that Palestinians are less than, and therefore [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=983.44s)]
*  deserving less than, a state. And so what Yitzhak Rabin in his very last speech before the Knesset, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=990.08s)]
*  before he was assassinated, what he said was that there were going to be settlements that would [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=999.28s)]
*  remain, that Palestinians would be maintaining their own affairs, but that it would be less [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1005.0400000000001s)]
*  than a state. And that has been the maximum of what Israel has ever thought through. And when I [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1010.48s)]
*  was part of the negotiations, and the reason that I regretted it is that it very much provided this [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1017.36s)]
*  facade that there were two equal parties that were somehow negotiating together, and if only they [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1027.2s)]
*  could just come to an agreement, then there would be peace, and there would be a state, and there [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1033.76s)]
*  would be all these wonderful things. But what it really did was it masked this colonization plan, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1037.6s)]
*  it masked Israel's establishment of settlements, it masked the taking of Palestinian land, it [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1044.8799999999999s)]
*  masked the killing of Palestinians, it masked the caging in of Palestinians, it masked their [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1051.6s)]
*  imprisonment, it masked everything. And for what? All that Israel has ever said that the maximum [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1057.28s)]
*  that it would be willing to do is to expand the cages that we already live in. They never had in [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1065.44s)]
*  mind to let us free, it was just to simply expand the prisons that they've put us in for all of [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1071.76s)]
*  these years. And that's why I speak about regretting it, because I regret being part of a process that [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1078.48s)]
*  served as a facade. Again, I wasn't the person who created the facade, but the mere fact that we had [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1086.48s)]
*  these negotiations really led people down this path to think that everything was going to be [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1093.52s)]
*  magically undone, the occupation would be magically undone, if we just reached an agreement where we [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1101.04s)]
*  dotted the i's and crossed the t's. And that, of course, was not anything that was ever on the [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1106.6399999999999s)]
*  table. And that's eventually why I quit. What I think is I want to talk to you about is the West [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1111.84s)]
*  Bank, and you're in the West Bank right now. The West Bank, the horror there has been overshadowed [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1116.4s)]
*  by just the moral depravity of the assault on Gaza. I mean, before 7th of October this year, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1122.72s)]
*  around 240 Palestinians had been killed in the West Bank, including dozens of children. And [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1129.52s)]
*  it's just horrible. But I think that's also interesting in the context of when this idea [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1136.56s)]
*  there was a ceasefire that existed before the 7th of October, because if 240 Israelis had been [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1141.68s)]
*  killed, including dozens of Israeli children, before the 7th of October, nobody would be talking [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1147.68s)]
*  about that in the context of a ceasefire by Palestinian forces, for example. So I'm just [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1152.48s)]
*  interested in terms of what's been happening even before this in the West Bank, how this has escalated [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1156.8s)]
*  and what you think the overall kind of Israeli strategy is in the West Bank. It's what I would [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1161.68s)]
*  call death by a thousand cuts. And what do I mean by that? What the Israelis have done is that each [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1168.24s)]
*  and every day, up until October the 7th, they had been systematically killing Palestinians. In fact, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1174.56s)]
*  2023, before October the 7th, was actually the deadliest year for Palestinians in the West Bank. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1182.08s)]
*  And that was because almost every day there was an Israeli raid on a Palestinian town. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1189.36s)]
*  Almost every day a Palestinian was, Israel killed a Palestinian. Almost every day there were attacks [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1195.36s)]
*  by Israeli settlers against Palestinians. And each and every day the Israelis were turning a blind [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1202.8799999999999s)]
*  eye. The international community was turning a blind eye to this. I mean, they were, it was just [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1209.44s)]
*  as though we were invisible and didn't exist. And this is just, is the price of living under military [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1213.44s)]
*  occupation. What I don't think that people understand is that occupation is violent. It's very violent. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1219.52s)]
*  To live under occupation is to live under a system of violence. For Israel to take land, it requires [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1226.72s)]
*  violence. To build a settlement requires violence. To put up a checkpoint requires violence. To [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1234.08s)]
*  maintain the checkpoint requires violence. When you look at the numbers of Palestinians [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1239.6799999999998s)]
*  that Israel has imprisoned, you're looking at roughly 20% of the Palestinian population [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1245.36s)]
*  has been thrown in jail at one point in time or another. And so each and every day [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1252.1599999999999s)]
*  living in the West Bank is to live with Israeli violence. In addition to living with the system [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1260.48s)]
*  of apartheid, in addition to living in the midst of settlers and so on, it's a very violent [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1267.84s)]
*  existence that Israel's meeting out against Palestinians each and every day. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1274.56s)]
*  But the way that it's done is that it's done slowly and methodically. And because this violence [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1279.92s)]
*  is ever-present, it's slow and it's methodical, it doesn't reach those headlines. It doesn't [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1287.52s)]
*  make the news, but it matters to us because our loved ones matter to us. It matters to us because [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1294.8s)]
*  our future matters to us. And it's that level of the meeting out of violence daily by Israel. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1301.84s)]
*  And the fact that the world has ignored all of this, it leads to such desperation and despair. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1310.08s)]
*  Even looking today, since October the 7th, more than 240 Palestinians have been killed by Israel. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1318.08s)]
*  And again, it's daily violence with daily people, Israel arresting people, throwing them in prison [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1327.2s)]
*  without charge, without trial, including Khaled Al-Jarrar, who was again just picked up. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1334.32s)]
*  Again, no clear reason why. That's what it means to live under Israeli military rule. And it's [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1340.24s)]
*  become so commonplace and so methodical and so every day that Israelis have ignored it, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1350.0s)]
*  the world has ignored it, and we're just somehow expected to live with it. This, Owen, is the height [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1358.1599999999999s)]
*  of dehumanization. When it gets to the point where Palestinians are somehow just expected to [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1365.52s)]
*  live with it and behave as though life is normal when it's not normal. As you said, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1370.72s)]
*  if it had been Israelis, the world would be going crazy because they don't dehumanize Israelis, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1378.8s)]
*  but they do dehumanize Palestinians. That point you made about incarceration, again, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1385.6s)]
*  something which I think we've heard obviously so much about the hostages and obviously taking [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1390.24s)]
*  hostages as a war crime. The incarceration of Palestinians, which often the world don't, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1394.08s)]
*  many people aren't aware of the conditions. So you get this military court system, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1400.8799999999999s)]
*  the only so-called democracy, obviously Israel isn't a democracy by virtue of the occupation [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1404.8799999999999s)]
*  of the West Bank, it can't be, but children being tried in a military court and save the children, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1409.4399999999998s)]
*  the charity, their investigation found that children are sexually abused, physically abused. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1414.48s)]
*  I mean, just that point, isn't it, that incarceration, the number who've been [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1421.1200000000001s)]
*  incarcerated, just the impact, the violence that isn't reflected in Western media coverage? [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1424.3200000000002s)]
*  Not at all. During the first prisoner exchange, I interviewed many of these children, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1430.4s)]
*  because they were children, who had been released by the Israelis in exchange. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1439.0400000000002s)]
*  And the stories that they told me were harrowing. These stories should keep people up at night, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1444.08s)]
*  and I'm just going to give you a little flavor. Each and every one of them talked about being [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1450.7199999999998s)]
*  abused on a daily basis, of being tortured on a daily basis. The Israelis often put [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1456.08s)]
*  upwards of 10 boys in one cell together, and gave them enough food for two to maximum three, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1463.04s)]
*  only twice a day. So they were effectively starved. They let them use the, let them have a shower [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1471.6s)]
*  once every third day, for a maximum of 10 minutes a day. They weren't allowed to see family, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1481.04s)]
*  they weren't allowed access to their lawyers, they weren't allowed access to any electricity. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1488.08s)]
*  If they asked questions about their incarceration, they were beaten. And as they were finally being [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1494.3999999999999s)]
*  released, each and every one of them told me about massive beatings, and showed me the beatings that [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1502.48s)]
*  they received. Some of them, in fact all of them, were denied medical attention, including a boy [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1511.76s)]
*  where the Israelis broke his arm in several places, denied him any medical treatment. Others talked [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1519.2s)]
*  about being raped. And these are things that were happening to children, the vast majority of whom [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1526.64s)]
*  were being held without charge and without trial. If that doesn't trouble people, then I don't know [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1536.0s)]
*  what will. It's certainly something that the world has the power to end this, and they choose not to. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1544.8s)]
*  They choose not to. Well, that's my final point really that I was going to ask you. You know, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1554.56s)]
*  sometimes I think about the fact that there's a lot of people who are in prison, and they're [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1558.48s)]
*  in prison. When I first moved to London many years ago, this was back in 2005, and I'm from the North, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1561.6799999999998s)]
*  found people in London particularly friendly compared to Northerners. And this woman started [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1572.6399999999999s)]
*  a conversation with me, she was a young South African as it turned out, and I mentioned that [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1576.6399999999999s)]
*  my dad had known to have been back in the exile back in the 60s, they shared a coat bottle once [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1582.8s)]
*  with each other, that's my claim to fame. And she suddenly said, yes, apartheid wasn't working [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1586.96s)]
*  anymore, which kind of chilled me at the time. The point I'm making is most white South Africans [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1591.8400000000001s)]
*  did buy into apartheid, actually for a very long time and passionately so, that's just a fact. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1597.3600000000001s)]
*  And they ended up abandoning it for the reasons that young South African said, which was international [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1602.56s)]
*  pressure made it unviable. They were forced against their will to abandon that system. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1607.76s)]
*  And the difference is, in terms of the Israeli population, most of whom, they're very brave [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1613.36s)]
*  Israeli peace activists, I'm always in awe of who I keep interviewing, they're so marginalized [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1617.52s)]
*  because there's an overwhelming, at the moment most according to the polls, most Israelis think [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1621.9199999999998s)]
*  not enough firepower has been used in Gaza. What on earth does that even look like in practice? [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1626.32s)]
*  So I'm just wondering how this ends, because as things stand, the US, as you say, it's essentially [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1631.9199999999998s)]
*  US-Israeli attack. The last remaining superpower has given a blank check to Israel to behave as it [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1638.4s)]
*  wishes. Israeli public opinion knows that, and therefore there isn't any incentive to do anything [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1644.0s)]
*  to change. So how does this possibly end? I think you're going to be surprised by my answer. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1649.2800000000002s)]
*  And maybe I'm actually also surprising myself. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1658.24s)]
*  I don't think this is going to end well for Israel. And the reason that I say this is, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1661.28s)]
*  you know, even in that conversation that you had with this maybe former or current South African, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1667.9199999999998s)]
*  the response was apartheid wasn't working. And today, if you look at South Africa, I think you'd [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1674.8s)]
*  be really hard pressed to find people in South Africa who will very proudly proclaim that they [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1685.6s)]
*  were pro-apartheid. There are some, but I think the vast majority are people who say, oh, I was [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1692.8799999999999s)]
*  opposed from the beginning. You know, everybody becomes in the know and on the right side of [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1699.68s)]
*  history after it's been proven that you're on the wrong side of history. And I, in a way, I think [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1705.84s)]
*  this is also going to happen here as well. And the reason that I say this is, for as much as we see [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1711.6s)]
*  and we hear this talk of ethnic cleansing, and every day if you turn on the Israeli news and [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1716.8799999999999s)]
*  watch it, you'll see people who are sort of rallying Israelis to say hit them harder, hit them faster, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1723.76s)]
*  hit them more, hit, hit, hit. And as you said, it's something like 60% of Israelis who are [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1729.52s)]
*  not hitting Gaza enough, only 2% in the last poll said it was too much. So you're really talking [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1736.56s)]
*  about 98% who either believe that it's enough or not enough in terms of what it is that Israel's [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1742.72s)]
*  doing. But despite that, there is inside Israel a recognition that they can't win. Why is it that [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1750.32s)]
*  they're recognizing that they can't win? First, if you look at the number of Israeli soldiers who [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1760.72s)]
*  are coming back in body bags, the number is high for Israelis. Again, it's not 20,000. We're talking [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1766.88s)]
*  180, something like that. But that's high for Israelis, especially when you compare it to the [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1774.72s)]
*  18 years of them occupying southern Lebanon from 18 to 20 years ago. And that's not a big difference. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1780.96s)]
*  Occupying southern Lebanon from 82 to 2000, it's more than double that. But more importantly than [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1788.96s)]
*  that, I don't think that they see that this government has another end game. And I think that [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1796.4s)]
*  increasingly, as we see that this government doesn't have an end goal, it's in Netanyahu's [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1807.5200000000002s)]
*  interest to prolong this war because he knows that the minute that the war is over, he is finished [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1814.08s)]
*  as prime minister. He already has corruption scandals against him. Israelis, even those who [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1820.24s)]
*  supported him are now very angry with him over October 7 and post October 7 in terms of handling [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1825.12s)]
*  of the families in the south and so on. And so for many Israelis, I don't think that they see that [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1831.52s)]
*  there is a clean way for them to come out of this. But more importantly than that, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1842.0s)]
*  is that Palestinians have shown the world strength, conviction, resilience, pride, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1849.84s)]
*  humanity, love, all things that Israel has not shown the world at all. And so, you know, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1860.16s)]
*  in part I say this because in order to survive living in this country, you have to remain [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1872.88s)]
*  optimistic. That's the only way you can survive living here in a country that seeks to ethnically [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1878.96s)]
*  cleanse you and talks about it every day. But on another level, this isn't just the question of [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1884.72s)]
*  being optimistic and hopeful. I truly believe deep down inside me that this isn't going to end well [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1891.76s)]
*  for Israel. And that in this not ending well for Israel, we're going to get to a place in space, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1899.76s)]
*  a 20 years time where people say I was always against the occupation, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1908.56s)]
*  when we know that they were never against the occupation. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1912.48s)]
*  I think that's a brilliant place to end and maybe provides more hope than I was expecting from the [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1917.9199999999998s)]
*  answer, I have to say when I asked that question. But I think that's a very profound thing to say [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1924.96s)]
*  and I think a lot of people I think are maybe arriving at similar conclusions. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1932.48s)]
*  Dan, that was a real pleasure. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And thank you. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1936.72s)]
*  So, you know, I live between Haifa and Ramallah. Haifa is a city in the north. And [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1946.72s)]
*  you see these cars all over the place and signs all over the place. You can't maybe walk [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1955.52s)]
*  50 meters without seeing a sign that says, together we will succeed. Or you can't, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1962.64s)]
*  when you're on the road for every car, there's probably three cars that say, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1969.44s)]
*  that have a bumper sticker that says finish them. And so I've asked people, well, what does finish [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1975.1200000000001s)]
*  them mean? What does together we will succeed mean? And can you believe that they don't have an [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1981.44s)]
*  answer? Like the most prevalent sign that you see here is together we will succeed. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1986.96s)]
*  And when I ask people, because I do, what does success look like? They actually don't have a [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=1993.6000000000001s)]
*  coherent answer. The only answer that they can come up with is the one that frightens me the most, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=2000.8s)]
*  which is, we're going to get rid of them. And when I say, what is them? You know, [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=2011.12s)]
*  what it finished them? What is the them? Some people will say Hamas. But I've also come to [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=2016.32s)]
*  realize that Hamas is code for Gaza. And Hamas or them is code for all Palestinians. And so when [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=2022.56s)]
*  you live in a place, like I live in a place, this place is completely and totally genocidal. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=2032.4s)]
*  And it's scary. It's scary. Yeah. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=2039.6000000000001s)]
*  I think that's something as well that the world needs to hear. So genocide and mentality that's [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=2045.6000000000001s)]
*  been allowed to take hold unchallenged with the direct complicity of Western governments. And I [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=2050.08s)]
*  might add as well, the Western, much of the Western media as well, and that dehumanization of the [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=2055.52s)]
*  Palestinian people runs not just through Israeli society, but so much of the Western media and the [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=2060.56s)]
*  Western elites. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZP1jXjRCsE&t=2065.36s)]
