# Is Gaza Being FORGOTTEN?: Live From Gaza, UNICEF's James Elder's Crucial Plea
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [September 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA)
*  Now, it's been almost exactly a year now since the Israeli onslaught against Gaza began, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=0.0s)]
*  one of the worst humanitarian catastrophes on earth. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=5.04s)]
*  The sort of violence we've seen unleashed some of the worst, obviously, of the 21st [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=8.16s)]
*  century. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=15.64s)]
*  And Gaza's pre-war 2.3 million population has endured mass death, the mass maiming, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=16.64s)]
*  the mass traumatizing, the mass displacement of almost every single person there. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  And when we say mass displacement, we mean repeated displacements, people forced across [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=29.02s)]
*  a tiny strip of land which is no bigger than East London, where explosives worth several [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=33.54s)]
*  times that of the Hiroshima bomb have been detonated. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=40.3s)]
*  Now, there's no better person to speak to about this than James Elder, who I've spoke [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=42.26s)]
*  to before, the global spokesperson for UNICEF, of course, United Nations Children's Charity, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=45.78s)]
*  Children's Arms. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=51.620000000000005s)]
*  He's live, I'm speaking to in Gaza right now, that's where he's been. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=53.86s)]
*  He's spent huge amounts of time in Gaza, it's always a privilege to speak to James, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=57.82s)]
*  one of the best communicators of what is one of the worst crises, disasters, human catastrophes [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=61.26s)]
*  of our age. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=68.06s)]
*  And we spoke to him several times before and it's always been very educational and obviously [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=69.06s)]
*  traumatic. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=73.94s)]
*  James, it's such a pleasure to speak to you, how are you doing? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=74.94s)]
*  Yeah, Owen, I'm okay, thanks. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=77.46000000000001s)]
*  Another strange, it's my fourth time back here and last night as bad as any night I can [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=79.1s)]
*  remember. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=83.66s)]
*  Tell me about that, because you're near Khan Unis now, aren't you? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=84.66s)]
*  Tell us where you are and why was it so bad? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=87.18s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=89.26s)]
*  I mean, you're never quite sure, but it was so bad just because of very, very heavy bombardments, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=90.26s)]
*  very close. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=95.9s)]
*  I don't have that military background, you can hear artillery now, but I don't have that [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=96.9s)]
*  military background. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=100.66000000000001s)]
*  But you start to learn how many hundreds of meters away some of these, whatever, 2,000 [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=101.66000000000001s)]
*  pound bombs or whatever they are, are based on how much you're building shakes, based [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=106.5s)]
*  on whether windows crack, always conscious of people very nearby, me sleeping in tents. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=110.26s)]
*  So once that happens, very tough to get back to sleep, then there's drones and your mind [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=115.30000000000001s)]
*  races, your mind obviously races to those people for whom this has been a reality for [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=120.30000000000001s)]
*  almost a year. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=125.38000000000001s)]
*  I mean, these continuous bombings, I mean, they have obviously left scars that has, as [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=126.66000000000001s)]
*  you rightly say, led to this insane death toll. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=132.58s)]
*  Forty children, girls and boys killed pretty much every day, on average, every single day, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=136.5s)]
*  40 girls and boys for a year. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=140.70000000000002s)]
*  But if there's a but, the scars run deeper than that just that physical destruction, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=143.46s)]
*  that annihilation, that apocalyptic destruction I see of neighborhoods, of homes and houses. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=149.66000000000003s)]
*  So there's a trauma. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=156.70000000000002s)]
*  I spoke to a child psychologist yesterday, it was a real privilege, but she spoke of [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=158.70000000000002s)]
*  her own sense. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=163.5s)]
*  She spoke and said, James, I'm constantly worried that I'm going to break down. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=164.5s)]
*  I need my energy for these children. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=167.38000000000002s)]
*  But she herself is. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=169.38000000000002s)]
*  So so it's the bombardments. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=170.46s)]
*  But then there is a level of psychological distress that I don't think for UNICEF in all [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=172.86s)]
*  the frontline places we work, an entire population of children are confronted by that. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=177.78s)]
*  So that's why those bombardments. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=183.18s)]
*  So obviously, they are so wildly unsafe. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=185.3s)]
*  I'm back in a hospital. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=187.94s)]
*  I'm back walking along with children with the burns on hospital floors with the missing [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=188.9s)]
*  limbs. It's just this overarching sense of of psychological trauma upon children that [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=193.62s)]
*  I don't think anyone has really seen before. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=199.94s)]
*  Not on this scale, not impacting pretty much every single boy and girl. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=202.9s)]
*  I mean, it's almost exactly a year this now. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=208.66s)]
*  And, you know, it's unique in so many horrific ways in that it's such a tiny street. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=210.54s)]
*  I don't think often those of us who aren't there often realize just how small Gaza is. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=215.85999999999999s)]
*  And now its population have been concentrated in a very in an area the size basically of [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=221.38s)]
*  an airport and the you know, to go through the repeated displacements. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=227.3s)]
*  So many have lost loved ones, the constant fear of death. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=233.06s)]
*  I mean, what is that psychological? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=237.26000000000002s)]
*  Because I think a lot of people think that just because it becomes normalized and children [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=238.98000000000002s)]
*  get used to it, they adapt. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=242.10000000000002s)]
*  But I mean, that that isn't the case, is it? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=244.22000000000003s)]
*  I mean, what is the kind of psychological impact and also the fact that there aren't [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=245.86s)]
*  the adults who are there to look after those children, they're traumatized. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=249.38000000000002s)]
*  So it's very difficult for them to look after their children in those circumstances. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=251.9s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely spot on that the ultimate frontline worker is a mom and a dad. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=255.38s)]
*  Those mom and dads are going through the same thing. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=259.58s)]
*  Those parents and I mean, a vast number of parents who did what you're told to do [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=262.21999999999997s)]
*  anywhere around the world, work really hard and over years or in many cases, decades, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=267.7s)]
*  build those homes, build your brick and mortar in a flash. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=271.94s)]
*  It was gone. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=275.42s)]
*  So those parents are finding it very, very hard to be that sign of strength. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=276.62s)]
*  And all at the same time, children have looked into their eyes. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=280.65999999999997s)]
*  Children have come to learn that mom and dad have lost the ability to to keep them [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=283.3s)]
*  safe here from that level of bombardment. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=286.94s)]
*  And at a point from disease, there is a normalization. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=288.82s)]
*  And it's a terrifying thing, Owen, because the idea of someone moves four or five times, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=293.02000000000004s)]
*  we say that in this sense, they move somewhere safe. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=298.26s)]
*  They never move somewhere safe each time they move. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=300.98s)]
*  As a young woman explained to me, every time they move is under bombardment. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=304.5s)]
*  You're grabbing what you can. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=307.90000000000003s)]
*  They lose a little bit of their psychological strength. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=309.38s)]
*  They definitely lose a little bit of their resources, a couple more winter clothes, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=312.1s)]
*  another book, something. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=315.98s)]
*  So they lose more and more in that. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=317.86s)]
*  And as you say, they crammed into these spaces. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=319.74s)]
*  And this yet again speaks to the way this war has been fought. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=322.74s)]
*  Eighty five percent of the Gaza Strip already, as you rightly say, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=327.70000000000005s)]
*  one of those densely populated places on the planet. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=331.38s)]
*  Eighty five percent of it is now under some form of an evacuation order. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=334.06s)]
*  So now you've got just over two million people crammed into 15 percent. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=339.14s)]
*  I mean, that it defies logic. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=343.09999999999997s)]
*  They are doing it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=345.5s)]
*  It speaks to again what they what life looks like in terms of water sanitation. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=346.82s)]
*  When the rains come, everyone's fearful of of those winter months. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=351.7s)]
*  We can speak to that. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=355.14s)]
*  But in terms of moving every time, they lose a little bit of a little bit. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=356.58s)]
*  As a young woman said to me, a little bit of their soul. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=363.26s)]
*  I had a fascinating conversation with someone earlier today, and she said, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=366.26s)]
*  James, it's not just, you know, we feel like we're losing our future. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=369.3s)]
*  We're losing part of our past. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=373.1s)]
*  Every time they every time they move, there's something [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=374.54s)]
*  some scar gets written into. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=377.26s)]
*  So it is uncharted territory. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=379.02s)]
*  But if you're forced to move four or five times with your family, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=381.46s)]
*  when you lived in a house, you lived in a home, you lived in a in an apartment, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=385.02s)]
*  you know, you had a decent a decent life within that, as so many have said. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=388.86s)]
*  So that's what's been being taken away from them. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=393.06s)]
*  And as UNICEF and many others warned from October, November, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=395.46s)]
*  if that level of bombardment is allowed to continue, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=399.7s)]
*  if the restrictions on aid are allowed to continue and both those things [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=402.82s)]
*  have happened, then you don't just start seeing these horrendous, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=406.53999999999996s)]
*  horrendous numbers of children killed from the sky. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=410.7s)]
*  You see disease on the ground. And we saw that polio. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=413.34s)]
*  I mean, there was reason to celebrate the polio campaign. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=415.82s)]
*  Yes. And I mean, for UNICEF, we brought in 1.6 million vaccines. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=419.46s)]
*  It's fantastic. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=422.85999999999996s)]
*  Brave Palestinians on the ground everywhere made sure that campaign rolled out. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=423.94s)]
*  But a polio campaign is not a success. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=429.02s)]
*  A polio campaign is a sign of a disaster. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=431.14s)]
*  It's a sign of a public health system that has been absolutely devastated. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=433.54s)]
*  There hasn't been polio here for a quarter of a century. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=437.1s)]
*  It's because Gazans view vaccines very, very highly. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=439.74s)]
*  But that was all stripped away from. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=443.46s)]
*  They've seen that public health care, that routine immunization hospitals [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=445.06s)]
*  devastated. That's why that polio campaign was needed. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=449.82s)]
*  And as winter approaches with restrictions on aid, Owen, ongoing, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=453.42s)]
*  we are going to see more disease for a population that's got nothing left. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=457.22s)]
*  In terms of those restrictions on aid you've discussed, ProPublica, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=462.22s)]
*  which is a US investigative outlet, has done a very important report. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=465.1s)]
*  The title is Israel Deliberately Blocked Humanitarian Aid to Gaza. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=470.02s)]
*  Two government bodies concluded, Anthony Blinken, Secretary of State, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=473.3s)]
*  rejected them. And that is US aid, which is the [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=477.18s)]
*  the sorry, the US Agency for International Development, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=481.26s)]
*  led by Samantha Power, the former US ambassador to the United Nations under Barack Obama. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=484.06s)]
*  And it concluded in this 17 page memo that Israel had [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=488.3s)]
*  sorry, they said that Israel had deliberately prevented aid from entering, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=494.98s)]
*  which included killing aid workers, raising agricultural structures, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=501.38s)]
*  bombing ambulance and hospitals, sitting on supply depots and routinely [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=504.21999999999997s)]
*  turning away trucks full of food and medicine. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=507.94s)]
*  That livesaving food was blocked at a stop about less than 30 miles across the Israeli [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=510.21999999999997s)]
*  across the border in an Israeli port, including enough flour to feed about a [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=514.58s)]
*  million and a half Palestinians for five months. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=518.94s)]
*  And that separately, the State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=521.9s)]
*  also determined Israel was deliberately blocking humanitarian aid. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=526.1s)]
*  Now, I'm not asking you to speak to the politics of that as a UN official, but [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=529.58s)]
*  what how do you I mean, just hearing that that two US [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=533.94s)]
*  administrative two official bodies of the US administration have concluded [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=537.46s)]
*  that this is a deliberate strategy. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=541.9s)]
*  What does that in terms of what you can speak to from the ground and what their assessments [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=544.3000000000001s)]
*  have said? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=548.14s)]
*  So from the from the earliest days of this of this war, of this war on [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=549.7s)]
*  children, we spoke about the need to get more aid in. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=554.7s)]
*  And this was not enough. This was what not a place that was a thousand kilometres or [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=558.5s)]
*  a thousand miles from from help there. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=562.18s)]
*  There is all the supplies people need. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=564.3399999999999s)]
*  Food, water, medicine is just across the border. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=567.14s)]
*  That wasn't happening. And that is a legal responsibility. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=569.9s)]
*  That's very clear. That is a legal responsibility of the occupying power of Israel. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=572.5s)]
*  And it wasn't happening for a whole range of reasons. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=577.8199999999999s)]
*  It wasn't happening because there were delays, because there were restrictions, because [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=580.18s)]
*  there were denials, because of the many convoys I go to for the north. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=583.9s)]
*  You'd sit with all the paperwork done. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=587.14s)]
*  You would sit at a military checkpoint for six or seven hours. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=589.3399999999999s)]
*  With the authorities knowing full well that you couldn't deliver aid during the night. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=592.3s)]
*  So at some point, you'd have to turn around. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=595.54s)]
*  It was a game being played. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=597.54s)]
*  And we in that in that sense were being played. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=599.26s)]
*  So everyone's best effort to get aid across the Gaza Strip. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=602.3s)]
*  All these things combined, each one may not look like a lot, but it's death by a thousand [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=606.14s)]
*  cuts. So month on month, month by month. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=610.9s)]
*  Oh, and we had from the secretary general's make it very clear. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=614.3399999999999s)]
*  These restrictions on aid, on medicines, on food, on water, are killing [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=617.54s)]
*  people. And that's still the case. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=622.26s)]
*  I sat with a woman today who talked about the most basic painkillers she can't get. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=624.46s)]
*  I sat with a doctor two days ago who spoke about antibiotics, antibiotics. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=628.5s)]
*  It hasn't got them in the hospital. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=633.98s)]
*  And I said, well, what do you do? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=635.34s)]
*  He said, well, you have to let infections take course. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=636.46s)]
*  You know, they don't have them. It's not like they have. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=639.66s)]
*  They don't have them. So those restrictions continue and those restrictions [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=642.26s)]
*  have been imposed upon, well, humanitarian agencies, but imposed [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=647.26s)]
*  upon the civilian population. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=651.98s)]
*  When I was here four months ago, there was such a level of discussion around this [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=654.14s)]
*  because famine was on the doorstep. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=659.14s)]
*  But it was continually told, you know, he said, she said, you can get as much in as [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=661.0600000000001s)]
*  they need. And the reality that we saw on the ground right now, it seems to be no [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=664.66s)]
*  longer a conversation. It's very refreshing that you bring it up and that [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=669.46s)]
*  that it's being talked about again, because very few people talk about the amount of [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=673.46s)]
*  aid coming in right now. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=677.18s)]
*  August was the worst month in terms of humanitarian aid, the quantity we were able [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=678.4599999999999s)]
*  to get in of any full month since this war began. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=683.38s)]
*  So it's actually getting worse. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=686.5s)]
*  I mean, I can and I'm not sure how you'd play it, but one thing I one thing I wanted [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=689.54s)]
*  to add, I think it's important to get a sense of all these displacements because [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=693.9s)]
*  you're so right. The normalization, I understand why people want to turn away and [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=697.4599999999999s)]
*  I can understand how they think someone's moved a few times and but now they're [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=702.18s)]
*  somewhere that say firstly, there is no safe. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=705.9s)]
*  There's absolutely not. They are fighter jets now bombardments all the time. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=708.54s)]
*  But one of one one anecdote and I have scores. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=712.98s)]
*  I met a little girl, eight year old girl, Karma, QA, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=717.4599999999999s)]
*  Emma Karma, and when her home was hit by, I think, a tank shell, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=721.5s)]
*  and she lost her leg. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=727.9399999999999s)]
*  Now, she shouldn't have lost her leg. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=729.54s)]
*  But the system had been a systematic devastation of hospitals. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=730.74s)]
*  She was unable to go to a hospital that had the services. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=733.54s)]
*  So she had to go to a maternity hospital. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=736.5799999999999s)]
*  And because they had no chance of they had no chance of basically getting her [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=738.5799999999999s)]
*  again, the the antibiotics she needed. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=744.0999999999999s)]
*  So to try and stop an infection, they amputated her leg. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=746.5s)]
*  Then the family had to move. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=749.62s)]
*  They were forced to walk for kilometers and kilometers with a child, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=751.3399999999999s)]
*  with a new fresh amputation. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=754.78s)]
*  They moved first to Rafa. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=756.66s)]
*  Then there was the invasion of Rafa. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=759.5799999999999s)]
*  Then they moved again to Derebala. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=760.8199999999999s)]
*  Then there was bombardments there and then I met them. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=762.38s)]
*  So they've moved four times. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=764.22s)]
*  And this is a girl with an amputation. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=765.9s)]
*  This is a girl with all the trauma of an amputation. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=767.58s)]
*  When a children has a limb amputated, they they don't want a doctor to look at it. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=769.98s)]
*  They don't want me to look at it. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=774.38s)]
*  They don't want their mum to look at it. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=775.78s)]
*  They are scarred. And this little girl. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=777.54s)]
*  And this case is not unique. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=779.82s)]
*  There are thousands of children like this with the wounds of war [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=781.54s)]
*  who are having to move, who are having to move time and again. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=784.9s)]
*  So the idea that somehow they could psychologically recover, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=787.7s)]
*  much less physically recover when they are constantly moving [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=791.02s)]
*  and ending up in unlivable tents. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=794.26s)]
*  That, again, is a situation being imposed upon people. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=796.7s)]
*  And when we say normalised, that, unfortunately, is a situation [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=799.5s)]
*  that people have deemed to be normal. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=803.66s)]
*  Yeah, you talk about normalisation, James. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=805.82s)]
*  I mean, isn't one of the issues it's been nearly a year of this now. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=807.1800000000001s)]
*  Cons atrocities, you know, the number of you mentioned children [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=811.14s)]
*  being killed every single day, other civilians, aid workers, for that matter. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=815.22s)]
*  And I mean, it has that become a challenge, just being able to just [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=819.74s)]
*  keep people engaged, keep people engaged with what is a humanitarian catastrophe, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=824.14s)]
*  because one of the dangers is we've seen some of the the live [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=829.66s)]
*  streaming of some of the worst atrocities of the 21st century. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=833.18s)]
*  And the danger is a lot of people in the West, they just move on [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=836.18s)]
*  and they don't remain engaged. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=839.66s)]
*  And that's pretty important for allowing these sorts of this sort of violence to continue. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=841.74s)]
*  Spot on, nail on the head, it's something I really struggle with. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=847.14s)]
*  I spend a lot of time trying to work out, you know, which [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=850.06s)]
*  what is the narrative that will break through? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=853.82s)]
*  I got a great friend in Liverpool who, you know, would say to me, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=857.18s)]
*  look, you've got to go and find that blonde haired kid. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=861.22s)]
*  He's like, it's terrible, that scenario. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=865.66s)]
*  But so I just don't know. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=867.14s)]
*  It's something that we all struggle with. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=869.98s)]
*  And yet you shouldn't, because every single story [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=872.22s)]
*  you hear here is of this immense level of residual that they've had, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=875.82s)]
*  the resistance, the resolve, the fortitude people have got. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=882.4200000000001s)]
*  But yes, a year of it somehow. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=886.7s)]
*  People, people, you know, they move on. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=889.62s)]
*  You were the one that started calling that phrase, you know, don't turn away. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=892.6600000000001s)]
*  People turn away. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=895.4200000000001s)]
*  And I understand why as well for some young people around the world, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=896.5s)]
*  where I'm always explaining to Garzons that, you know, you've got young people [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=899.3000000000001s)]
*  from Europe to South Africa, to Sydney, to parts of the states that [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=903.1s)]
*  that are absolutely outraged by this and that, you know, I'm talking about people [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=909.1800000000001s)]
*  in their 20s and that they are raising their voice and how absolutely [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=912.1800000000001s)]
*  disenchanted they feel at the level of hypocrisy they're feeling, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=916.86s)]
*  but that they care, that they care so greatly. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=919.66s)]
*  And I think it's important to to share that with Garzons as well. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=922.1800000000001s)]
*  That's that's the sort of flip side of this of this narrative. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=925.5s)]
*  But yeah, when I was first here in November, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=929.1s)]
*  I felt we called it exactly what it was. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=931.62s)]
*  I felt we were I was seeing absolutely indiscriminate attacks. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=934.1s)]
*  We were seeing the mass killing of children. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=937.46s)]
*  They were seeing clear breaches of international humanitarian law, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=939.5400000000001s)]
*  great restrictions on aid that were putting people to the brink. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=942.5s)]
*  And so it's very hard to know what else to say when it's just been more of that. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=945.5s)]
*  One of the things that would help enormously, not just in terms of telling a story [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=950.02s)]
*  to Western audiences, but also in terms of the constant challenge we have around, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=954.5400000000001s)]
*  you know, trying to share the truth, right? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=960.1400000000001s)]
*  The United Nations, I have nothing other than to show evidence [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=962.2600000000001s)]
*  and to tell people stories. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=965.34s)]
*  But seemingly that's often not enough. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=966.7800000000001s)]
*  And we're we're there's a he said she said with authorities, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=968.5400000000001s)]
*  foreign journalists, you know, obviously people should need to ask that question. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=971.94s)]
*  Why aren't international press allowed in here? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=975.22s)]
*  Why cannot Western press add to the very, very brave voices [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=977.46s)]
*  of Palestinian journalists on the ground for Western audiences? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=981.7s)]
*  Why are they not able to walk through the hospitals [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=985.2600000000001s)]
*  and see those children in tears with the amputations, with the burns? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=987.78s)]
*  Why can't they see the denials, the restrictions of aid [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=991.78s)]
*  that being held at checkpoints for six hours? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=994.58s)]
*  You know, that that should speak volumes to how this war is being fought. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=997.0600000000001s)]
*  I mean, you know, link to that. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1002.18s)]
*  If I was going to invent an unofficial slogan for UNICEF, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1005.26s)]
*  it would be a child's life as a child's life. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1008.5s)]
*  But that's not actually how it works in practice, is it? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1011.3s)]
*  Because there is this awful phrase, the hierarchy of death. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1014.5799999999999s)]
*  I think it actually emerged. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1018.02s)]
*  It was a journalist who coined it about the troubles, actually, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1019.2199999999999s)]
*  and about how lives were categorized and treated by media organizations [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1021.26s)]
*  based on who they happen to be. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1026.02s)]
*  British soldier at the top, for example, you know, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1027.86s)]
*  and it goes down and down and down, depending on isn't that the problem? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1029.5s)]
*  I mean, it's this dehumanization that you're constantly having to fight against, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1032.86s)]
*  that if the sorts of violence and atrocities being committed [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1036.3s)]
*  against Palestinian children were being committed against children [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1039.5s)]
*  who are seen as being like us, this would not be possible. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1042.18s)]
*  It just wouldn't. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1045.8200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, yes, I feel like in the same way [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1047.54s)]
*  that I spent so much time how to break through, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1051.1000000000001s)]
*  I have a great sense of bewilderment and and sadness and and anger [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1052.8200000000002s)]
*  at those who were unable to see that moral equivalence, who somehow deny [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1057.14s)]
*  or even was justify the killing of what reports are now 14, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1062.14s)]
*  15000 children killed who were able to deny that suffering, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1065.94s)]
*  able to deny that deny that truth. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1069.98s)]
*  Oh, and I, you know, 20, 20 years of doing this with UNICEF in [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1072.8600000000001s)]
*  in all kind of settings. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1077.7s)]
*  I can't recall another time in my career [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1079.74s)]
*  when I'm not just advocating for the health and safety of children, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1084.14s)]
*  but I'm advocating that that that these children in Gaza are children, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1087.6200000000001s)]
*  that they're humans. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1092.66s)]
*  I've never come across that before. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1094.06s)]
*  I mean, just finally, what would your appeal be? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1097.74s)]
*  It's nearly a year of this now. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1099.5s)]
*  You know, we've seen this mass slaughter. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1101.26s)]
*  We don't actually know how many. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1103.74s)]
*  I mean, it's underreported. That's the problem. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1104.94s)]
*  Those official figures, which have always been validated [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1106.78s)]
*  in previous conflicts, but they exclude those missing under rubble. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1109.06s)]
*  I mean, you know, there have been some pretty gruesome estimates, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1111.74s)]
*  I would say, by public health experts about the true death toll. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1114.78s)]
*  And some of those estimates are well over 100000 Palestinians having been killed. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1118.1s)]
*  That's excess deaths. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1122.5s)]
*  It's not just the violence, because we know in the history of this kind of warfare, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1123.54s)]
*  it's mostly other non direct violence that kills the most people in the end. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1127.42s)]
*  What I mean, what's your appeal to people about, you know, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1132.7s)]
*  and nearly a year on and the suffering and what, you know, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1135.46s)]
*  what's your general appeal, I guess, that one year on? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1140.26s)]
*  Yeah, I think I mean, I can understand the absolute frustration, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1143.66s)]
*  the sense of futility for people around the world that where's a ceasefire? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1148.26s)]
*  Well, I've been I was here on the 29th of March when [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1152.02s)]
*  when the Security Council voted and you felt that wave of hope. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1156.02s)]
*  You know, a mother who said to me tonight, I promise my child that they can go to sleep [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1160.78s)]
*  and they will wake up. I can promise that. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1164.9399999999998s)]
*  And all that hope was blown out. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1166.8999999999999s)]
*  So so clearly, clearly these decisions by these decision makers, by these leaders [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1168.3s)]
*  are are outside of our realms. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1172.8999999999999s)]
*  What I what I absolutely do believe is and I know, as I said, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1175.3799999999999s)]
*  I said all the time to Garzans, the people around the world, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1179.1799999999998s)]
*  whatever corner they're from, South America, South Africa, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1182.54s)]
*  you know, South of Spain, the way that they keep raising their voices [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1185.46s)]
*  on social media or in the streets around that sense that there has to be [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1189.46s)]
*  pauses, ceasefires, there has to be decency and dignity for the people of Palestine. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1194.46s)]
*  That still resonates. It's heard by people here. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1199.3799999999999s)]
*  And so people in Gaza need a couple of things. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1202.26s)]
*  They they need the bombs to fall to stop, which we don't have control over. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1204.46s)]
*  They need that aid to flow, but they need to know people still care. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1207.9s)]
*  They absolutely feel forgotten by leadership. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1211.14s)]
*  They don't feel forgotten by everyday people. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1213.9s)]
*  And that is a great form of sustenance when so much else is being denied from them. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1216.18s)]
*  And I think it's so important. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1222.0600000000002s)]
*  And, you know, as ever, I know lots of Palestinians from Gaza [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1223.1000000000001s)]
*  engage with my contacts. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1227.0600000000002s)]
*  Most of my direct messages now, my direct message requests on Instagram [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1228.38s)]
*  on Twitter are from Palestinians in Gaza, sharing their horrific experiences, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1232.8200000000002s)]
*  sharing that go fund me all the rest of it and and expert. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1239.26s)]
*  But the message always is so many of us haven't forgotten you. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1242.42s)]
*  We're never going to forget you and never going to give up. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1246.14s)]
*  And partly that's due to the work of people like James Elder ceaselessly [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1247.8200000000002s)]
*  using his platform and his huge vast experience to talk about the reality, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1252.42s)]
*  what's happening in Gaza and making sure the rest of us don't forget it. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1257.6200000000001s)]
*  So please do share this video. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1260.0600000000002s)]
*  Leave your thoughts, your comments to engage. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1261.42s)]
*  Make sure James's voice is heard as ever far and wide. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1263.1000000000001s)]
*  But James, as ever, thanks so much. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1266.74s)]
*  Always. Thanks, Owen. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6fIW3w6qnA&t=1269.6200000000001s)]
