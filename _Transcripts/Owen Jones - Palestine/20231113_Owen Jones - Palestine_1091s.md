# Ed Balls FLIPS When I Challenge Media Complicity In Gaza War Crimes
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [November 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFfvM2pda-o)
*  We're now over five weeks into a Western backed Israeli onslaught against Gaza, which has killed many, many thousands of innocent civilians.
*  We don't know how many anymore. It's not possible to count the dead.
*  The last estimate I saw last week, including those dead in the rubble, is upwards of 14,000.
*  Men, women and indeed thousands of children, apocalyptic scenes, one of the great crimes of our age.
*  And most of our political and media elites are actively supporting this. That's a fact.
*  Now, this is a truly unforgivable chapter.
*  I, for one, am never going to forgive it. And frankly, as Gaza is driven into the abyss, I've just pretty much had enough of this.
*  We've had weeks now of our government and its media allies trying to deflect from the moral obscenity that they are involved in,
*  which is, to repeat, the active support or denial of war crimes.
*  And they do that by trying to smear those opposed to this mass slaughter as the real, dangerous, hateful extremists
*  in an effort to turn the world upside down. The consequences of this deliberate strategy.
*  Well, we saw this weekend the whipping up of a far-right mob which stormed the Cenotaph and then went round London racially abusing peace protesters.
*  This is the context in which I went on Good Morning Britain today, presented by Susanna Reid, who I greatly respect.
*  I do love going on the show. They're a great team, by the way. So, I don't know, do I feel guilty when it all goes, at the end of the day, I have to do my job?
*  Anyway, Susanna Reid and Ed Balls, who's best known for failing to offer an alternative to George Osborne's ruinous slash and burn cuts,
*  ended up losing his seat, then ended up as George Osborne's business partner with an interlude involving some dancing on television.
*  A former trade union leader actually called Ed Balls when he said he'd give a headache to an aspirin. I couldn't possibly comment on that.
*  Anyway, here's how he responded to what I had to say.
*  There were some right-wing headbangers who got to the Cenotaph and they behaved incredibly badly,
*  but there were many, many people there chanting vicious, anti-Semitic comments and that shouldn't be allowed.
*  That was probably the biggest anti-Semitic march in Britain in decades.
*  Owen, you were there. You were there on the march on the Saturday. We've seen a number of chants.
*  We've seen banners which are anti-Semitic. Did you see them when you were marching?
*  No, I was marching, for example, with Jewish activists and it's a real insult against the thousands of Jewish activists who march with their yarmulkes,
*  for example, organised by Nahmod, by the Black Jewish Alliance, with placards demanding the linking of Palestinian and Jewish liberation.
*  And they were anti-Semitic. I saw them. I saw the anti-Semitic placards afterwards and not with anyone I marched or anyone I saw there.
*  There were 800,000 people marching, driven by opposition to the mass slaughter of thousands of innocent people, including many thousands of children.
*  And that was a cross-section of Muslims, Christians, Jewish people and non-believers.
*  But you don't think that we should call out violence and racism and extremism on both sides?
*  Of course, but you can't make an equation. This is what is dangerous.
*  I'm giving you the chance to call it out on both sides.
*  I've just condemned... So there were ten examples that I've now seen flagged by the Metropolitan Police and British Transport Police.
*  Well, there were ten flags and I've seen them. Ten examples, completely unacceptable, out of 800,000 people.
*  That's 0.00175% and I'm sure it's higher, though of course there'll be, on a march of that demonstration, 800,000 people.
*  I think it was 300,000. The police say it was 300,000.
*  The vast majority of people arrested were the far-right extremists who were whipped up by the government and the Daily Mail.
*  That's what happened. I have to say, being gaslit over this is one of the most astonishing things I've ever seen in my entire life.
*  One of the most astonishing things in my entire life.
*  We have a British government and much of the media backing the mass slaughter of innocent people.
*  We have at the moment babies suffocating to death in Gaza.
*  Mass slaughter of innocent people. Yes it is.
*  The government is saying, do not target civilians.
*  The government has refused to condemn Israel for war crimes. We have an Israeli government, for example, a minister the other day...
*  And the Israeli government say they don't set out to kill...
*  The Israeli government could not be more open in what they're doing.
*  One of their ministers on Saturday said that we are instituting a new Nakba.
*  The Nakba, for those who aren't aware, was a mass expulsion of 700,000 Palestinians in 1948.
*  The reason we're being gaslit here is for weeks...
*  What does gaslit mean by the way?
*  Gaslit means when your understanding of reality is turned upside down.
*  When you know with your own eyes what you can see and you're told it's the opposite.
*  And you criticised the Israeli government and that's perfectly legitimate.
*  What people are concerned about is marchers are waving swastikas.
*  They were waving swastikas.
*  They had the Star of David interlinked with the swastikas. Many, many of them.
*  Protesters wearing Hamas style headbands, chants from the river to the sea.
*  And in one recording someone is chanting, and I apologise to Jewish viewers
*  and also to those who will be offended because it is offensive,
*  a woman recorded saying, I find it hard to say it actually, death to all Jews.
*  And a man heard shouting, Hitler knew how to deal with these people.
*  And posters saying, Gaza, the new Auschwitz, what a disgraceful thing to say.
*  To be clear, what you just read out there is a hate crime.
*  It's an anti-Semitic hate crime.
*  And there were 10 of them, no, 10 flagged, I've gone through every single one.
*  Every hate crime has been flagged on the social media feeds of the Metropolitan Police
*  and the British Transport Police.
*  There were 800,000 people there.
*  There were 300,000.
*  There were Jewish, well, even if there were, that's not true,
*  but even if there were, it's a tiny proportion.
*  The difference is, we had, just quickly...
*  A tiny proportion, Owen, of hate crimes still equals hate crimes.
*  What we're saying here is 800,000 people should be tarred
*  because of a tiny handful of absolutely unacceptable people.
*  No, we're not saying that. We are saying that.
*  We're giving you the opportunity to condemn based on those.
*  Hold on, hold on.
*  Can I say something? Because, Owen, you've talked a lot.
*  Can I say the other thing?
*  You could condemn Hamas attacks on Israeli citizens.
*  Which I've done over and over again.
*  Can I just say something? This is another march, hang on, Ed,
*  this is another march where I have not seen any posters condemning Hamas
*  for what they've done in Gaza.
*  None. None. None.
*  I actually did see posters say, condemning Hamas,
*  and saying release the hostage.
*  So I think we just have to report this accurately.
*  NAMOD, for example, who are a Jewish peace organisation,
*  their placards include, release the hostages and ceasefire now.
*  They marched on that demonstration. Yes.
*  To be clear, as I said, for the last few weeks we have had
*  the Daily Mail and the government and other newspapers claiming
*  the Cenotaph was going to be defaced and attacked
*  by pro-Palestinian demonstrators.
*  What actually happened was a bunch of far-right lunatics
*  stormed the Cenotaph, whipped up a hate mob by Cyrilla Braverman,
*  by the government, and they were the vast majority of arrests.
*  And the difference between that, you keep calling them
*  counter-protest, stop calling them that.
*  They're far-right extremists.
*  They were there for one reason, hatred, OK?
*  The peace protesters were overwhelmingly there because,
*  funny enough, most people in this country don't like watching
*  little children having their heads ripped off by missiles.
*  And I am sick to death of a media industry in this country.
*  I know we're supposed to have this chatty format where we're just
*  here to be all pally and talk about the news, but we are now
*  watching one of the great...
*  Well, I don't know how often you've watched this program,
*  but it doesn't generally veer away from arguments about
*  very sensitive issues.
*  We are watching one of the great massacres of our time,
*  and those who are complicit in that massacre, a government
*  which arms and backs Israel...
*  And that's the media...
*  As it is, much of the media is...
*  Keir Starmer as well as...
*  Much of the media in the political establishment...
*  Keir Starmer?
*  Yes, absolutely.
*  Keir Starmer is complicit in a massacre?
*  Keir Starmer...
*  Is it a genocide?
*  Keir Starmer...
*  Look, many...
*  What's the matter with you?
*  Many genocidal experts and scholars have said it is.
*  Many UN officials have said it is.
*  That's not for me to...
*  So Keir Starmer is complicit in a genocide?
*  No.
*  You're trying to put words into my mouth.
*  No, no, I've got a few questions.
*  What Keir Starmer did is went on national radio and said that
*  he said that Israel had the right to cut off water and energy.
*  We are seeing now the consequences of what cutting off energy is.
*  We are seeing premature babies gasping for breath,
*  their first hours on earth,
*  dying amongst the killing field of thousands of people,
*  the dead bodies of Gaza being eaten by the starving dogs.
*  This is an apocalyptic scene.
*  I know you're cringing.
*  I don't like talking about the horrors of war either.
*  Why would you...
*  It's being sanitised so people aren't aware
*  of what's actually happening to innocent people.
*  Why is it wrong to cringe at the horror that's happening?
*  Yeah, but I know because it looks like I'm breaking some sort of etiquette
*  where we don't talk in the early morning about what war actually is.
*  Owen and I have argued about this every day, every day.
*  Sorry, Owen, this is the definition of gaslighting.
*  We are literally talking about the horror of war and facing after it.
*  You've appealed to this programme.
*  Watch it.
*  We have been showing pictures of Gaza children for the last three weeks.
*  It feels...
*  Don't come on and accuse us of things which are untrue.
*  I mean, you know, the gaslighter extreme,
*  Owen Jones appears on GMP's screen.
*  I know, I'm used to being interrogated.
*  I'm a cabinet minister, even though I'm just a journalist,
*  the Guardian, trying to make the point...
*  You're playing off making sense.
*  There are serious war crimes, collective punishment,
*  as the UN Secretary-General has said.
*  The bombing of hospitals, three nurses yesterday,
*  killed by the Israeli attacks.
*  A hospital surrounded with no energy,
*  whilst in northern Gaza there has been the obliteration,
*  more than two Hiroshima bombs, worth of bombs,
*  dropped on an area that's...
*  I'm saying most of the media...
*  Are you saying we are?
*  Ed, what is this? I'm not talking about you.
*  You were. You were talking about this programme.
*  I'm talking about the media in this country.
*  The media? We are part of the media?
*  Yes, you're right. Most of the media.
*  So you are talking about...
*  I'm talking about most newspapers in this country have openly supported...
*  You can answer questions.
*  You can answer questions, Owen.
*  Ed, what is this?
*  Answer the question.
*  What is this bizarre game you're trying to play?
*  I'm not playing a game.
*  Most newspapers in this country are supporting...
*  You made an accusation and I'm asking you whether you're accusing...
*  Are supporting what Israel is doing.
*  The entire political establishment is too.
*  Yes, absolutely.
*  They are whitewashing what Israel has done.
*  The Labour Party you support,
*  the Labour Party you support,
*  Keir Starmer is not supporting a ceasefire
*  because he does not believe that Hamas is committed to...
*  Not supporting a ceasefire means the continuation
*  of thousands of innocent people being brutally murdered.
*  And most people won't die because of the missiles,
*  they'll die because the healthcare system is collapsing.
*  Pregnant women giving birth without medicines,
*  children having their limbs amputated without anesthetics.
*  Operations come without anesthesia.
*  Yeah, it's terrific.
*  This is what the war that most newspapers
*  and most politicians support in this country means.
*  That's what it means.
*  The Prime Minister statement on Saturday,
*  I condemn the violent, wholly unacceptable scenes
*  we have seen today from the EDL,
*  that's the English Defence League,
*  and associated groups,
*  and Hamas sympathisers intending the national march for Palestine.
*  The despicable actions of a minority of people
*  undermine those who have chosen to express their views peacefully.
*  I mean, that sounds exactly like the statement you've just made.
*  No, he, Rishi Sunak, he douses the petrol
*  and he lights the match and then complains about the fire.
*  He demonised, like much of the political establishment,
*  those people in his country who don't like watching
*  innocent people being slaughtered en masse.
*  He demonised them as terrorist supporters and anti-Semites.
*  Well, he actually said they're a minority.
*  But he encouraged far-right protesters who,
*  funny enough, think exactly the same thing
*  about Palestinian demonstrators.
*  And a huge number of arrest-mongers.
*  Who went round London racially abusing Palestinian supporters,
*  including, for example, the mother of one of my friends.
*  We do not want racial abuse of anybody.
*  There was racism on both sides.
*  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
*  The difference between the far-right protestors,
*  that was organised based on hate.
*  And a large proportion of them were arrested on that basis.
*  And the anti-Semitism isn't based on hate.
*  That anti-Semitism is based on hate.
*  That's not why the vast majority of protesters were there.
*  And the difference is Palestinian protesters were directly racially abused.
*  You can see it on camera, the clips of people who went on the demonstration,
*  and coked up, drunk, far-right extremists.
*  No, but there were Jewish people, thousands on that protest,
*  and they were not racially abused.
*  There was a synagogue.
*  A synagogue was attacked.
*  The thing that's totally weird about Owen Jones' performance here
*  is he's absolutely taking all the heat off Suheila Braverman.
*  The truth is, she did say unacceptable things,
*  which Risi Sinak is not wanting to repeat.
*  It was Grant Shep's yesterday.
*  It wasn't the whole political and media establishment.
*  It was the Home Secretary and Andrew ignoring Owen for a moment.
*  Don't you think actually Suheila Braverman still has serious questions?
*  I said from the beginning I would not call it a hate march.
*  I've always said that.
*  I would not call it that.
*  There were people, and we saw it again on Saturday,
*  who were filled with hatred, and that is regrettable.
*  And I still think it would have been better if the organisers had called it off.
*  Can she credibly do the job now?
*  There's no... I hear that there could be a reshuffle today.
*  There'll be no reshuffle before... Would you move her?
*  She will... I suspect she will be moved, yeah.
*  But would you move her?
*  It's a very difficult job.
*  I'm not sure who would want that job.
*  She's going to be kept in that job until we get the results of the Rwanda scheme.
*  Just on the point about Suheila Braverman,
*  I'll ignore Ed's rudeness there,
*  but in terms of Suheila Braverman, the reason...
*  It sounds like you're both going to ignore each other.
*  Owen, go ahead.
*  I was saying you were letting off the hook.
*  I did say that, the ignoring Owen bit.
*  Let me just respond, Ed, if that's all right.
*  Suheila Braverman is the most egregious example.
*  She is somebody who herself engages in hateful rhetoric about migrants and refugees
*  and has the temerity to announce a hate march.
*  She helped whip up, had an instrumental role in that.
*  The point I'm making is...
*  But we're all part of that, aren't we?
*  The point I'm making is she's not going to be the full person
*  when so much of the government, including Rishi Sunak and the media,
*  have whipped up a storm about those protesting against the mass slaughter of innocent people.
*  Yes, she has to go, but the book does not just...
*  But don't you see, Owen, that if you say it's all the political media establishment,
*  including Keir Starmer, it's only Rishi Sunak,
*  you let Suheila Braverman off the hook.
*  Did Keir Starmer call for water and electricity?
*  Did he say Israel had the right to cut off to a civilian population?
*  Yes or no is the question, Ed.
*  Yes or no? Did he yes or no say Israel had the right to cut off water and electricity?
*  He said Israel has a right to the defendant's side.
*  No, no, no, he didn't say that. He was asked, do they have the right to cut off electricity?
*  As you know, Owen, I did a podcast three weeks ago which called him out and criticized him.
*  I don't listen to your podcast, Ed.
*  Well, well done. It's called Political Currency and you should.
*  I don't know what you're giggling with George Osborne about, you know, the architect of austerity.
*  I don't want to do that. There's better things to do with my life.
*  The thing I'm saying to you, I've got a problem with having to talk to you this morning.
*  I mean, yeah, we're all suffering, Ed.
*  There's no love lost here at all.
*  If you say it is Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak and the whole media establishment,
*  including me and Susanna, then you let the Home Secretary off the hook.
*  I didn't make it. I didn't talk about you two. I said I'm in the media too.
*  So how would that make it?
*  You can't use the words about the cosy loving that goes on.
*  You can't use ridiculous words like the media establishment.
*  I said the vast majority of the media is supporting what Israel is doing and refusing to call out war crimes.
*  That's a fact. You don't like it, it's a fact.
*  Can we put some of these points to the Shadow Health Secretary with Streeting who is waiting very patiently.
*  So intellectually second rate.
*  You're so childish. Grow up.
*  Can we not?
*  Grow up.
*  Can we not have a...
*  You're not professional. You're acting in an unprofessional way. You should grow up.
*  Well, there you go. I am going to say this.
*  I was talking about some of the most unimaginable horrors, unimaginable possible horrors, beyond actually our imagination.
*  I don't quite understand why Ed Balls thought it was appropriate to smirk through all of that,
*  no matter what he happens to think about me.
*  We're all entitled to have our personal grudges, but of all the subject matters,
*  I do think it's instructive to compare how Ed Balls deals with, say, George Osborne,
*  whose policies caused misery to millions of people and destabilised British politics.
*  The answer is he does a chummy podcast with him and how he deals with a socialist objecting to war crimes against kids.
*  Now, on the complicity of the political media establishing all this, I wasn't talking about Ed Balls.
*  He wanted to make it about himself.
*  But since he brought it up, let's listen to Ed Balls on this aforementioned very chummy podcast.
*  Keir Starmer's not even got to government yet.
*  It's too early for decay. He needs unity.
*  And he will want every Shadow Cabinet member to absolutely toe that line.
*  So I think if a Shadow Cabinet member now steps outside the ceasefire line,
*  in my view, very hard for his authority to be maintained unless they then leave the Shadow Cabinet.
*  OK, so he wants Labour to fire anyone who supports the ceasefire.
*  That is an end to Israel's current mass slaughter in Gaza.
*  Don't really think anything more needs to be added there.
*  But look, seriously, I know there's supposed to be this code of etiquette to be observed when doing this sort of broadcast.
*  I have been doing this now for 12 years.
*  It is my view that history will be so damning about those who refuse to speak out about what is a massacre,
*  whose final death toll in the human cost is, and I don't want to say this, but it's true,
*  is going to be bleaker that opponents of all of this can possibly imagine.
*  That's the truth.
*  Now, stating the humanity of the Palestinian people as they are massacred,
*  because that's what's been robbed of them, that's what makes this whole possible,
*  that is more important than this etiquette.
*  And I will carry on trying to do this as best I can, for as long as I'm not kicked off at EV screens anyway.

*  I'll speak to you in a bit.
