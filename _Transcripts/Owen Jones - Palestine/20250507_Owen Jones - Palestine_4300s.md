# This DEVASTATING Testimony Of Palestinian-Brit EXPOSES Israel's Reality - w. Kieran Andrieu
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM)
*  whatever I might have felt growing up with him about him not being around as all kids would, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=0.0s)]
*  I had a realization one day. That realization was that if you calculate my dad's life in terms of [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4.4s)]
*  years not spent under military occupation, he's a boy of six. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=12.96s)]
*  Now Netanyahu has announced that Israel is going to invade and seize the whole of Gaza and to force [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=19.44s)]
*  its surviving population into the south. That's better known as a concentration camp [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=27.76s)]
*  where the survivors will be left with a decision to leave or to die. This is the logical [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=33.2s)]
*  next step of what has always been a genocide. Israeli leaders and officials have not gone to [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=42.160000000000004s)]
*  any effort to hide their intentions from day one and yet of course our media and political elite [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=48.0s)]
*  have whitewashed, defended, legitimized, cheerleaded, obviously in the case of [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=54.16s)]
*  governments armed, one of the great most heinous crimes of our age. Now I'm really delighted to be [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=59.599999999999994s)]
*  joined by the brilliant Kieran Andrew who is a British-Palestinian political economist. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=66.32s)]
*  Someone I've been wanting to talk to you for a very long time actually, a very eloquent champion [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  of justice. He's gone on TV and argued with some pretty gruesome individuals I have to say. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=80.24s)]
*  I always say this before I start recording, it's always important to remember how angry me and [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=88.8s)]
*  many people watching who aren't of Palestinian heritage get. The emotional labor of having to [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=95.6s)]
*  just the last year and a half is pretty unimaginable. So I always appreciate when I ask [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=100.56s)]
*  people with Palestinian heritage to talk, it's an ask and so I'm really honored to be joined by you [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  Kieran, so great to speak to you. Thanks Helen, I really appreciate the opportunity to speak and [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=114.08000000000001s)]
*  thanks for asking me on. But before we talk about just the current horror, I just want to talk about [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=118.64s)]
*  just a bit of context setting because I mean the person is political and your family has lived [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  through the atrocities that Israel has committed against the Palestinian people. Your grandfather [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=131.36s)]
*  was in the nap, I understand, so just tell me a bit about that because it really [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=138.32000000000002s)]
*  it's fascinating, I'm sorry, right, but it fleshes out that kind of context of what the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=142.56s)]
*  Palestinian people have suffered for generations now. Yeah, thanks Helen. So I think that's right [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=149.28000000000003s)]
*  and I think that just briefly before I go into the specifics, you can trace Palestinian history [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=156.16000000000003s)]
*  very very closely through the lives of the generations of Palestinians who have lived [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=164.8s)]
*  under Israeli occupations since 1948. Now again you could sort of say something broadly like that [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  about any country, of course we're all part of our nation's story etc etc, but I think [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=176.8s)]
*  Palestinians have been forcibly reduced to political indeed colonial subjects and [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=182.8s)]
*  they are, we are, so much more than that but of course you know the political context is [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=191.36s)]
*  inescapable to a degree and I think that's why it's useful to kind of talk about family histories [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=197.68s)]
*  and heritage and so on. So let's get into it, well my grandfather, my father's father, so my dad is [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=204.4s)]
*  Palestinian, right, my mum's not, my dad's Palestinian, my dad's dad, a guy called Ahmed, was [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=212.48s)]
*  24 years old when the Nakba arrived in 1948, beginning of 1948 and there wasn't anything like [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  a kind of central organizing principle in Palestinian society sufficient that there would be [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=230.4s)]
*  a conscription or anything like that to try and resist the kind of paramilitaries that eventually [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=237.04000000000002s)]
*  went on to form the IDF and that's what we'll talk about later but the paramilitaries that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=244.8s)]
*  terrorized Palestinians, that led, presided over the ethnic cleansing of Palestine, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=249.76s)]
*  there wasn't anything like a kind of organizing structure sufficient that there was a kind of [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  conscription mechanism in place so everybody that resisted that was a volunteer. My grandfather, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=262.72s)]
*  as I say, was 24, he volunteered pretty much as soon as the call was made and he went and for, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=271.28000000000003s)]
*  and I think lasted a couple of months and somewhere I went, you know, loads and loads of [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=282.56s)]
*  expansive historical detail but eventually he was a couple of months in, shot in the head [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=287.52s)]
*  at distance by a member of the Palmaq, which Palmaq, which was the kind of military wing of the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=294.32s)]
*  Hagana, which again was one of the paramilitaries which went on to form a constituent part of the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=301.44s)]
*  IDF. So my grandfather was shot in the head, a 24-year-old guy, he was taken to a field hospital [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=307.12s)]
*  nearby, so essentially just a tent in the middle of a field outside of Yaffo and he was treated [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=317.52s)]
*  there by the Red Crescent. The resources that they had at their disposal were paltry and [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=324.24s)]
*  in order to patch up the wound, I mean, at this point anybody listening to this will be like, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=331.12s)]
*  well, he was shot in the head, he isn't dead already, I mean, he survived and part of the [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=335.84s)]
*  reason he survived was because the Red Crescent fought on their feet and they managed to stitch [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=341.36s)]
*  him up but the resources, as I say, were so poor that they had to stitch a piece of literal plastic [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=346.48s)]
*  under his skull, sorry, it's a bit gruesome, a bit of plastic under his skull and send him back and [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=352.15999999999997s)]
*  send him back and actually when he was in the field hospital, the palimahash turned up again [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=359.68s)]
*  to try and kill him and others in the beds in the field hospital. He escaped, he went to Jerusalem, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=367.6s)]
*  he survived the Nakba, he went on to have 13 children, wouldn't be my first choice, but went [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=375.84000000000003s)]
*  on to have 13 children and one of those was of course my dad. My dad said that his dad, who I [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=381.28s)]
*  never met by the way, he died in 1998, so he lived 50 years after the Nakba with a bullet wound in [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=391.03999999999996s)]
*  the head but after that incident my grandfather was never quite the same again and he was able [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=396.88s)]
*  to live relatively good life, went on to become a taxi driver in Jerusalem, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=408.08s)]
*  children, was a beloved family man etc etc but he wasn't quite the same again and actually [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=413.91999999999996s)]
*  gruesome detail, every time he breathed you could see the bit of plastics, they never managed to [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=421.03999999999996s)]
*  properly remove it from his head because it's too risky, caused brain damage etc, you could see it [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=426.15999999999997s)]
*  move every time he breathed for the rest of his life. That's my grandfather, his eldest son, my dad's [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=432.24s)]
*  eldest brother was part of that generation of Palestinians in the 70s that benefited from [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=441.2s)]
*  the kind of radicalism of Yasser Arafat and the PLO and Fatah in the 1960s, so again, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=452.16s)]
*  I don't know if I've, yeah but Arafat basically, the end of the Arafat story is a very depressing [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=460.4s)]
*  one, he falls prey to you know corruption and so on and the last kind of 10-15 years of Arafat's [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=465.76s)]
*  life he fell out with Edward Said, they'd previously been friends etc but in the 60s and 70s I think [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=472.24s)]
*  it's important to emphasize that Arafat was a very important symbol of resistance and you know some [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=477.2s)]
*  of the kind of substantive resistance that he led for the Palestinians was genuine resistance and [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=484.08s)]
*  genuinely impactful and it's in that context that my uncle joined the PLO and was involved with the [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=490.8s)]
*  PLO for around 10 years and then and again I don't know exactly what happened here, none of us does [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=500.32s)]
*  but one day he went missing, he was disappeared and he had quite a high profile and we knew that [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=508.0s)]
*  the Israeli government had a file on him and that they've been following him and so on and so on, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=514.5600000000001s)]
*  so one day he went missing, so we can say he was disappeared I think and of course you know he had [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=518.72s)]
*  children, outstanding questions for them which they'll live with for the rest of their lives, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=525.6s)]
*  for my family etc, very painful reality and then my generation, so my brother, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=530.1600000000001s)]
*  I'm the first of seven children but I have six siblings, they're my half siblings and they all [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=541.84s)]
*  live in East Jerusalem and the eldest of those is my brother who is a couple of years younger than me [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=548.48s)]
*  and he was first put into an Israeli, first incarcerated and put into the Israeli [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=556.24s)]
*  prison industrial complex when he was 12 years old. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=563.36s)]
*  He was imprisoned initially for throwing stones at tanks, so you know he grew up in East Jerusalem, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=567.76s)]
*  we'll talk about the apartheid traffic like nature of apartheid and so on in a bit I'm sure [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=576.64s)]
*  but if you're in East Jerusalem you're kind of the superior inferior, obviously [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=583.5999999999999s)]
*  in Gaza, Gazans have lived at the sharp end of everything even in the Palestinian context, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=591.2s)]
*  in the West Bank people have far fewer rights than my family have had in East Jerusalem, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=598.6400000000001s)]
*  right, they're Palestinian Muslims and they are absolutely second, third, fourth class citizens [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=603.9200000000001s)]
*  relative to Israelis but they have had more historic freedoms, more ability to travel than [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=609.5200000000001s)]
*  their counterparts in the West Bank and certainly in Gaza. My brother was I suppose [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=616.8s)]
*  inherently very political from a young age, actually he's kind of an exception in that sense [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=625.12s)]
*  to his generation in my family and all of this is a long way of saying that he felt, even though he [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=630.4799999999999s)]
*  had freedoms, he felt infuriated his friends in nearby villages didn't so he went and joined them [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=637.3599999999999s)]
*  and threw stones at tanks when he was 12 and in that context it's for that initial reason that [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=643.84s)]
*  he was first arrested and thrown into Israeli prison. Now I've never met him, I've never met [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=651.6800000000001s)]
*  him because he spent the rest of his life, he's now 33 years old and he spent the rest of his life [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=659.36s)]
*  in and out of Israeli prisons and sometimes and you know he's, so he's developed schizophrenia [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=667.84s)]
*  and they won't treat him, they won't do anything about it. He's, I don't know, I never talked about [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=676.64s)]
*  this with my dad and maybe I never will, I mean he might see this but we've never talked about it [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=682.8s)]
*  but we know, I mean you and I know and millions of people know what Israelis [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=689.12s)]
*  in prison do to Palestinian prisoners so yeah it's obviously a huge open wound and we don't [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=695.84s)]
*  know where it ends because he comes out for a short period of time, he goes back in, the Israelis find [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=704.1600000000001s)]
*  a reason to put him back in prison. I'll give you one example, he, where my dad lives in East [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=709.36s)]
*  Jerusalem there is a massive Israeli flag billowing from a pole above the building [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=717.12s)]
*  and in that building 99% of the residents are Palestinian, 98-99% of the residents are Palestinian. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=724.4s)]
*  The state of Israel, the IDF, put that flag up there so that when you drive into Jerusalem and [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=732.96s)]
*  you see you look to the east, you see this massive Israeli flag, you don't see any Palestinian flags [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=738.48s)]
*  even though it's a Palestinian neighborhood, even though it's internationally recognized as a [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=743.12s)]
*  Palestinian neighborhood and probably 97% of the residents are Palestinian but you, all you see is [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=747.6s)]
*  a giant Israeli flag like triumphantly billowing above the buildings and of course that's a kind of [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=753.36s)]
*  a sort of symbolic engineering is to give the impression that it's Israeli and it's to [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=761.2s)]
*  inculcate the Palestinians with the sense that it's Israeli and so on. So my brother [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=765.2s)]
*  one time came out of prison and within days of coming out of prison this thing had gone up [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=770.8000000000001s)]
*  while he was in prison and he said I'm going to remove it so he climbed onto the roof of the building [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=775.76s)]
*  and he climbed up the flagpole and he tried to remove the flag and they threatened to shoot him [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=781.2s)]
*  and then they took him and they put him back in prison so I don't think he's always, you know, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=785.9200000000001s)]
*  he's very damaged now, he's very damaged, I don't think he's always heroic but I think he often is [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=790.96s)]
*  and so that's my brother. One of my sisters was shot by a member of the Israeli police, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=796.48s)]
*  she's only 30 years old, 31 years old, she was shot in the middle of the night by an Israeli [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=805.76s)]
*  police officer when they were raiding my dad's house claiming to look for somebody that nobody, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=811.36s)]
*  none of them had ever heard of, we don't even know if they really existed, raiding the house and [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=818.8s)]
*  one of the officers broke my father's neck with a barrel of a machine gun [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=825.68s)]
*  while he was protesting, you know, of course someone bursts into your house in the middle [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=832.5600000000001s)]
*  of the night, you've got family there, you say what the fuck are you doing? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=836.72s)]
*  And he was remonstrating with them and one of them responded with that and my sister of course ran [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=840.1600000000001s)]
*  towards him to try and protect him and that was when she was shot. She's survived, she's [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=846.5600000000001s)]
*  runs her own business and so on and she doesn't like to dwell on things but it's just part of [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=855.2800000000001s)]
*  their day-to-day reality and it's part of the family story here and just to say this Owen, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=860.56s)]
*  what's remarkable about all of this, it's tempting to think that my family is uniquely cursed, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=870.0s)]
*  of course it is, it's almost comforting to think that my family is uniquely cursed and that other [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=875.8399999999999s)]
*  people aren't like that but what's really astonishing and actually really painful and disturbing [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=879.68s)]
*  is the knowledge that this is unremarkable for Palestinians, this is unremarkable, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=885.04s)]
*  there are so, I mean every Palestinian you could possibly speak to, whether they're like me, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=891.44s)]
*  relatively privileged members of the diaspora, whether they live in the West Bank, East Jerusalem, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=897.04s)]
*  of course Gaza's totally different level, I mean we don't even, they will all be able to tell you [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=901.2s)]
*  stories like this related to their own humble family trees, own families, etc etc. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=905.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean really gripping and a hideous example of the violence perpetrated by the Israeli state [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=915.2s)]
*  generation after generation and for those who don't know just listening to that, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=921.9200000000001s)]
*  an estimated 40% of Palestinian men in the West Bank have been arrested but, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=925.9200000000001s)]
*  and you mentioned obviously your 12 year old brother and again for those who don't know, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=931.12s)]
*  Israel is the only country on earth which systematically puts children through a military [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=935.84s)]
*  court system and Save the Children did a really gruesome report which was, I would know, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=939.12s)]
*  earlier on in 2023, months before 7th October, which described physical and sexual abuse [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=947.28s)]
*  perpetrated against Palestinian children who had been incarcerated in the Israeli [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=951.76s)]
*  prison system, just truly hideous barbarism. I mean today, because I'm going to ask you, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=956.8s)]
*  I'll ask you about the West Bank as well obviously, I mean and what's been happening there since [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=963.92s)]
*  not obviously before 7th October but the intensification of that since 7th October. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=968.7199999999999s)]
*  In terms of Gaza today, I mean I started by talking about the latest, I mean, plan is such a, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=974.0s)]
*  feels like a really clinical euphemism for what is genocide and different stages of genocide, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=981.76s)]
*  I mean that's the point, genocide is obviously a process, it's a dynamic and this is the stage [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=988.0s)]
*  we're at. What's your take on when you heard Netanyahu, what had been proposed yesterday [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=994.72s)]
*  in terms of what the plan is, what's your analysis I guess? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1005.36s)]
*  Well, I hate to say this but I was really surprised and that makes me sound like a kind [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1010.08s)]
*  of mixture of somebody who's always been predetermined in their view that this is [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1020.0s)]
*  going to happen and so on and also that somebody who's kind of fundamentally fatalistic about these [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1025.52s)]
*  things and that's not true. I've been hopeful for Palestine my whole life and I still am and we'll [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1033.52s)]
*  come onto that later but we're in a very, very dark moment, we're in a very dark night and [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1039.44s)]
*  for those of us who have been clear-eyed about the nature of the state of Israel and about the [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1047.44s)]
*  mission underpinning the nature of the state of Israel, it doesn't come as that much of a surprise. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1056.08s)]
*  I mean look, when, sorry to do the long historical thing but I think- [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1063.6s)]
*  No, it's important context, it's an important part of that context. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1069.6s)]
*  It's an important part of that context. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1072.48s)]
*  When in 1948, when Israel declared itself independent on the 15th of May 1948 and [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1074.08s)]
*  afterwards it continued to fight wars and so on with neighbors and Palestinians, it didn't stop [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1082.6399999999999s)]
*  at the borders of the Gaza Strip and it didn't stop at the borders of the West Bank and say, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1088.8799999999999s)]
*  okay lads, we've had our fun, this is our state, let them have this, this is theirs. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1094.24s)]
*  I know it sounds glib to say that but I think there's this sense that there's always been this [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1099.2800000000002s)]
*  respect even if there are settlements, there's this fundamental respect for a kind of future [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1102.8000000000002s)]
*  two-state solution, whatever. Actually, they were brought to a standstill, is all that happened and [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1110.3200000000002s)]
*  the only reason that those borders exist where they do is that they were the points where the Israeli [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1116.24s)]
*  proto-military, the militias and then later the IDF, they couldn't advance beyond those points [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1121.68s)]
*  because of the Arab armies and because of Palestinian resistance and so on. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1126.24s)]
*  That was always considered in Israeli society to be a failure and it was always considered to be [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1130.64s)]
*  an embarrassment and it's always considered to be something that exists on borrowed time, those [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1138.88s)]
*  territories being Palestinian and that they'll wake up to that sooner or later and it's just [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1148.56s)]
*  a question of when. So the hourglass has always been turned on its head in my mind. The only way [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1154.32s)]
*  that we were ever going to stop this kind of outcome was by bringing Israel to heel [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1160.3999999999999s)]
*  through the economy, through international solidarity, through Palestinian resistance, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1166.24s)]
*  etc. It was never going to be, I'm sorry to say this, I wish and for a long time actually [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1171.28s)]
*  when I was growing up, I really believed double wise, well I sort of believed double wise. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1176.72s)]
*  It was never going to be realistically by appealing to the sensibilities and the consciences [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1182.48s)]
*  of Israelis because not because Israelis, individual Israelis, are inherently evil [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1190.8799999999999s)]
*  or they're just people but because the originating mission of the state of Israel was [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1196.32s)]
*  so totally committed to the eradication or laterally the destruction of Palestinians [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1204.16s)]
*  but it was absolutely necessary to build a massive fear-based propaganda machine that [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1212.8799999999999s)]
*  inculcated generation after generation of Israelis into being obedient to those objectives. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1220.4s)]
*  And so it was never going to come from within Israeli society and Norman Finkelstein, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1227.84s)]
*  he's got a good line on this or at least he used to have it for a long time. He used to say [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1232.5600000000002s)]
*  it would be absurd to try and appeal to the kind of the better angels of the nature of [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1240.16s)]
*  people in the Confederate South, the deep South in the sort of Jim Crow years. It's fine to have [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1248.24s)]
*  those people be sort of white allies from those places on your side and of course there are, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1254.88s)]
*  there are a minority, a few are extremely small now unfortunately, but there are incredibly brave [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1261.36s)]
*  Israelis who march and join with Palestinians. There were some white South Africans but there's [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1266.9599999999998s)]
*  an overall yeah. Exactly, exactly and like there were some people, some of us in the deep South [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1276.56s)]
*  from Jim Crow years who opposed what was going on, who opposed Jim Crow, who opposed lynching, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1283.28s)]
*  the systematic basis of etc etc. But to design your strategy around appealing to those people, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1288.8s)]
*  mainlining you know your resources into the conscience of those people is manifestly absurd. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1296.8s)]
*  And so I've gone a bit of a tangent but I think basically this was always going to happen so long [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1305.68s)]
*  as Israel wasn't kept in check because it was always part of the design, it was always part of [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1313.84s)]
*  the plan. Now to speak very specifically about Gaza and what's happened in the past few days, I mean [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1319.92s)]
*  I'm sure we'll come back to this, I mean we could talk about this for days and days. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1327.36s)]
*  The thing I've noticed recently is people saying that they've ran out of vocabulary, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1330.96s)]
*  that they've literally ran out of words and I'm sure you felt that I feel it, I felt it, I feel [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1336.56s)]
*  it right now while I talk. We run out of words because there are no words that keep pace with [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1341.6s)]
*  the rate of and the rapidity of evil being perpetrated on Palestinians in Gaza, it's just [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1350.3999999999999s)]
*  beyond human comprehension. It's what complements that horror obviously is that the international [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1358.8799999999999s)]
*  community I think has shocked some of us who maybe thought that actually yes Israel will do [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1370.72s)]
*  these things, Israel is fundamentally barbarous because it's founded on a fundamentally barbarous [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1377.52s)]
*  mission. But the international community surely in 2025 will find ways to oppose this even if they're [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1382.48s)]
*  diplomatic ways, even if they're a kind of process where they navigate, exhaust every [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1395.2s)]
*  avenue first and then cut ties with Israel diplomatic, economic. Surely if you were to run [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1402.88s)]
*  one half of this which is to say what Israel's been doing in Gaza and hold back the other half [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1411.2s)]
*  which is to say the international community's reaction, most of us I think in 2023 prior to [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1416.88s)]
*  October 7 would have said no but look if they do that, that will be crossing the red line and yes [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1423.2s)]
*  the US will probably continue to back Israel, they'll continue to veto things at the Security [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1429.04s)]
*  Council and they will continue but there will have to be because international public opinion [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1432.4s)]
*  is a raid against Israel so decisively now and in favor of Palestinian justice and liberation and so [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1437.1200000000001s)]
*  but we would have been wrong, we would have been wrong and I think what we've seen in the [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1444.24s)]
*  international community is almost more dispiriting to me than what Israel's done [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1450.08s)]
*  but because I expected Israel to do this, I'm sorry to say it, I expected it, it was a slow motion [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1456.72s)]
*  confluent, it was a slow train coming and unfortunately it's arrived. What I couldn't [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1462.1599999999999s)]
*  have foreseen properly was the collective embodiment of total moral rot and moral failure [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1467.36s)]
*  that we have seen in the form of the international community and the international communities [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1479.6s)]
*  signal failure, utter failure to contain Israel and to even oppose what's going on, even if it's [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1486.3999999999999s)]
*  just rhetorical, oppose what's going on and you know Keir Starmer, David Lammy, they've been sort [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1495.04s)]
*  of playing this Janus-based trick haven't they where you know the only conclusion is that it's [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1501.2s)]
*  a government with chronic cognitive dissonance or something because on the one hand they'll say [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1506.72s)]
*  we urge x y and z, we urge restraint, while at the same time feeding the junkie, the war junkie with [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1513.28s)]
*  every narcotic it demands and making lots of money off of genocide and when I say collective moral [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1523.52s)]
*  rot about the international community's reaction, I was thinking about this, I've been thinking [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1530.64s)]
*  about this Owen and I might be wrong but I cannot think the only historical parallel I can think of [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1536.16s)]
*  I'll come to it in a second, even King Leopold is Belgian, even the Congo Free State, even King [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1545.2800000000002s)]
*  Leopold had to lie to the world about what he was doing, about the the the rape, about the plundering, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1551.6000000000001s)]
*  about mass murder machine that he built in the Congo Free State essentially to enrich himself [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1559.36s)]
*  privately in the early 20th century, even he lied to the whole world and when the world gradually [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1565.4399999999998s)]
*  found out, complicit though they were obviously in their own war crimes, there was international [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1573.36s)]
*  outrage and it came from civil society, it didn't come from government and the government had to [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1579.6s)]
*  respond to that, you think about, I'm sorry to go there but you think about Nazi Germany, I mean [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1584.4s)]
*  I've unfortunately I put Israel in the category with those states now, it's getting genocidal, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1589.92s)]
*  this is a genocidal state so, exactly you enter a milieu you know all on its own when you start to [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1595.76s)]
*  do things like that and so Nazi Germany you know what were we doing, I mean I'm not saying it was [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1602.64s)]
*  motivated by an attempt to stop the Holocaust, of course it wasn't but we were at war with Nazi [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1608.0800000000002s)]
*  Germany, you know when I say we I mean Britain, France, most of Europe was at war with the United [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1613.2s)]
*  States with Nazi Germany for all sorts of reasons but one of them was to stop the spread of fascism [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1618.8s)]
*  and that's what was going on with Nazi Germany, that's how Nazi Germany was responded to by the [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1625.2s)]
*  international community, as I say Belgium Free State had to hide it from the world, the only [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1629.68s)]
*  parallel I can think of in terms of collective moral rot is maybe the Irish famine and [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1634.32s)]
*  the way in which the British government openly openly suppressed supplies and actually made a [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1643.28s)]
*  virtue of it, said using Malfusian logic etc there's too many people there, some of them need to die. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1650.4s)]
*  I think there's a lot in that I think and as a reading structure case you're right, I mean [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1660.0s)]
*  you know there's a brilliant book called King Leopold's Ghost for those who haven't read it [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1664.72s)]
*  which goes through the horrors of what happened there and it was suppressed, they didn't have [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1668.32s)]
*  social media, they didn't have people with mobile phones on social media live streaming what happened [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1673.84s)]
*  to them and it was much easier therefore you know at the time you know the literacy was lower and [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1678.96s)]
*  you know what could be reported, what access travel was difficult, you know so what actually [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1685.6799999999998s)]
*  happened there I mean Jack Conrad wrote about in Heart of Darkness that was fictionalized based on [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1691.04s)]
*  the depravity but the point is this is a live stream genocide so there's just no excuse we [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1695.04s)]
*  could see from day one in real time what was happening which is quite unlike, it's not like [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1698.72s)]
*  we've seen most atrocities because most atrocities obviously people aren't just there with their [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1704.72s)]
*  mobile phones and they're unable to transport it but we've seen more than enough and it's such an [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1708.56s)]
*  important, that's what makes this so it is unique, I mean what is there as a comparison and there is [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1712.48s)]
*  documented crime, the most confessed crime as it's happened with, I mean that point just before I ask [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1718.32s)]
*  about the western states in terms of kind of that what's kind of inherent in the Israeli project I [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1725.44s)]
*  guess there's this quote here from Israeli politician, we'd all like to wake up one spring [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1732.5600000000002s)]
*  morning and find that seven million Palestinians who live between the sea and the river have simply [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1736.8000000000002s)]
*  disappeared, that's Yair Golan and who is the leader of the so-called progressive opposition [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1740.3200000000002s)]
*  to Benjamin Netanyahu the Democrats, I mean that's instructive, I mean isn't that a point that [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1746.5600000000002s)]
*  the kind of sliding scale there is everyone agrees like the Palestinian people are an [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1753.68s)]
*  existential issue or threat or an obstacle or a problem and the question is what is politically [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1760.4s)]
*  possible and permissible at any given time so you work backwards from that point, we'd like to get [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1768.0800000000002s)]
*  rid of them but there's a case of well can we, how can we do that, we can't get away with that [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1774.0s)]
*  and so there's a question of basically what you know Yair Golan would go well look it's [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1779.6s)]
*  not politically feasible, he's not doing a moral objection there, he's saying yes ideally we get [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1784.8799999999999s)]
*  rid of all of them but what is possible and so that's the point isn't it, because you've got [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1788.7199999999998s)]
*  people who've the kind of genocide in ISIS will say well if Israel wanted to commit genocide they [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1796.7199999999998s)]
*  could have killed everyone in one day, no genocide has ever happened in history, is the question is [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1800.7199999999998s)]
*  what is possible at any given moment and you work backwards from that point. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1805.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah and the, sorry to go back to the end of the last point but the examples we have now talked [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1810.7199999999998s)]
*  about Congo Free State is an example of that you know they don't, you don't just, I mean [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1817.52s)]
*  people seem to think, I mean genuinely some Zionists obviously are bad, most of them are bad faith, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1823.52s)]
*  some of them seem to think that a genocide is literally you drop the bomb and you wipe everyone [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1830.08s)]
*  out and that's the only thing that meets the criteria. Which has never happened. Which has [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1834.96s)]
*  never happened. Never happened, what? It's never happened so and as we said you know great tremendous [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1839.44s)]
*  lengths were gone to by King Leopold and other ghouls in history, purveyors of genocide, to cover [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1846.88s)]
*  up their crimes, to cover up their crimes and it's always been in the nature of the of the state of [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1856.88s)]
*  Israel to to cover up the crime. Actually there was a you know a giant apparatus that was built [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1864.24s)]
*  for that very purpose and it was called Hasbara in the Hebrew. Hasbara roughly translates as [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1873.36s)]
*  teaching or explaining and it is roughly synonymous with propaganda right but it's [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1880.56s)]
*  a very comprehensive, very sophisticated, well-oiled propaganda machine that encompasses, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1887.04s)]
*  it's propaganda very widely understood so it's not just you know comms or whatever public relations, [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1893.52s)]
*  it's also making sure that embassies around the world, that political leadership around the world [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1900.0s)]
*  is on side, it's lobbying as much as anything else. It's lobbying as well as the come to Tel Aviv, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1907.44s)]
*  we have the best clubs in the world, we have the best beaches etc etc both of those things so the [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1914.56s)]
*  sort of soft Hasbara, the hard Hasbara and you know that happened I mean 750 000 Palestinians were [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1919.2s)]
*  displaced and many thousands of palestinians, tens of thousands of Palestinians were killed and [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1927.6s)]
*  ever since you know I mean we can go through the episodes but there have been Israeli [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1934.48s)]
*  Palestinian history has been punctuated with many atrocities perpetrated by Israel right and through [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1940.8s)]
*  all of that the mission of Hasbara, the aim, the sole raison d'etre, the objective of Hasbara was to [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1946.72s)]
*  was to basically cover up the crime, was to kick mud over the body and to try and direct people's [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1954.56s)]
*  attention elsewhere and it was very very effective, it was very effective for a long time. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1962.24s)]
*  What started, it started to change and I was, this is an important point, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1969.2s)]
*  what changed it was Israel, you know what changed public opinion against turned it gradually and [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1975.04s)]
*  it's still an ongoing process turned it against Israel, it was Israel. That's not to say that [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1981.44s)]
*  Palestinian resistance hasn't been admirable you know there's the line from [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1987.04s)]
*  Cat on the Hoppin' Roof, what's the accomplishment of the Cat on the Hoppin' Roof? [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1995.04s)]
*  It's just staying up there, you know the fact it can stay up there is enough right, that's its [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=1999.12s)]
*  that's its challenge and that's its ambition and the fact that the Palestinians have stayed [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2004.24s)]
*  up there so to speak, that we stayed high up the agenda, that we've kept ourselves visible, [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2009.1999999999998s)]
*  that we haven't allowed ourselves to be swept into the Ashkan of history and [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2014.6399999999999s)]
*  you know turned into this inconvenient you know whatever figment of the past is a massive [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2018.8s)]
*  massive accomplishment and it was totally against the odds and Palestinians throughout the ages, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2025.68s)]
*  throughout the past 80 years deserve huge praise for that accomplishment alone. However, [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2031.92s)]
*  it's also true to say that nobody has been a better recruiter to pro-Palestine sentiment than [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2038.4s)]
*  the state of Israel itself. Oh and we could have had a Che Guevara, we could have had a Martin [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2045.28s)]
*  Luther King, we could have had a Nelson Mandela or a Malcolm X, nothing we could have done as [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2052.32s)]
*  Palestinians, none of those kind of figures in Palestinian form could have held a candle [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2060.64s)]
*  to the recruitment power of the state of Israel for pro-Palestine sentiment because [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2069.2s)]
*  as you have this kind of this gradual realization of the mission of the state of Israel which is to [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2076.32s)]
*  as I say displace all Palestinians as reflected in your quote just now, displace all Palestinians [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2082.16s)]
*  in their place create a homogenous, ethno-supremacist, Zionist state as you have [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2091.68s)]
*  a collision of that gradually coming into fruition as a mission, as a goal with the [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2099.2s)]
*  dawn of social media, the advent of social media and the kind of horizontalization of communications [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2105.68s)]
*  across societies and so on. As those two forces collide people just say you know [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2113.04s)]
*  Sabran Shatila killing of refugees in 82 gradually before social media of course but a different kind [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2119.28s)]
*  of you know the early dawn of a new kind of media, 2008-2009 so-called operation caste-led [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2124.2400000000002s)]
*  killing of over 1500 Palestinians, 70% of them children again in 2012, again in 2014, again now [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2134.5600000000004s)]
*  of course with a genocide. People look at that they say I don't like that shit, most people say [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2142.48s)]
*  I don't want to be associated with that and I certainly don't want to fund it, I certainly [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2148.4s)]
*  don't want to be my government that I in some cases helped elect, I don't want them to be backing it [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2153.28s)]
*  and so as that has happened gradually public opinion has naturally realized that Israeli Hezbollah [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2158.88s)]
*  is bullshit. I mean that's what's so interesting isn't it because there has been that huge shift [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2167.12s)]
*  and if you look at British public opinion 70% think Israel is committing war crimes, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2174.16s)]
*  a large majority support a total arms embargo on Israel, most want Benjamin Netanyahu arrested [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2180.72s)]
*  for war crimes and crimes against humanity, it was over 50% according to a Uyghur poll back in [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2188.3199999999997s)]
*  a few months ago and yet western states remain completely committed to defending [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2192.24s)]
*  the state of Israel as a commit genocide. I mean in Britain you saw what 8% of arms [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2203.2000000000003s)]
*  deals suspended which the government basically bent over backwards and apologized over and it [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2208.0s)]
*  was clear that it was only under a kind of legal compulsion basically. I mean how do you explain [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2212.7200000000003s)]
*  that dynamic, how do you explain even now when you have that shift, you know I mean labor lost [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2218.7200000000003s)]
*  you know two shadow cabinet ministers in large part because of Gaza because of that genocide [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2225.52s)]
*  so it's not like they've actually suffered some price. Why in the U.S. and Joe Biden, [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2231.84s)]
*  I mean Joe Biden maybe that's the clue in the 1980s he said in 1986 in Congress he said if [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2238.32s)]
*  Israel didn't exist the U.S. would have to invent it, it's the best X billion dollars we've ever [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2242.8s)]
*  spent and he's talking about it as a strategic point, he wasn't making a moral point about a [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2247.2000000000003s)]
*  Jewish homeland or something like that. I mean what is it though, I mean is it just do you think [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2251.36s)]
*  because of its strategic worth in the Middle East as the kind of sentinel of the West, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2256.56s)]
*  what is it? Well I think it's a couple of things, I think first of all Kyr Starmer's government so [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2260.24s)]
*  there's this kind of local cause and then there's a kind of broader cause, I'll start with a local [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2266.72s)]
*  one. In Kyr Starmer, in the case of the current government, in the government we have right now [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2272.24s)]
*  and of course the Tories, I'm not going to pretend the Tories are better on this, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2278.64s)]
*  in many cases they are worse at least in rhetoric or at least consistent with Starmer but in Starmer's [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2281.52s)]
*  case expecting Kyr Starmer to break with anything that the U.S. does, even Ukraine, even that whole [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2289.6s)]
*  thing was very carefully stage managed so that Kyr Starmer could have his kind of big Churchillian [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2297.2s)]
*  moment here and still be in full deference to Trump and you know the U.S. line on Ukraine, [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2303.36s)]
*  obviously clearly that was carefully choreographed. On Palestine expecting Kyr Starmer to break with [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2313.12s)]
*  the U.S. and the U.S.'s approach to Israel and to Palestine, you might as well, it's like waiting [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2319.68s)]
*  for Godot, you know it's not going to happen, it's not going to materialise. Kyr Starmer is [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2327.04s)]
*  fundamentally unimaginative, he is fundamentally, can I say this, he's fundamentally cupped [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2334.56s)]
*  by the United States, he's also somebody who, and that's just the nature of the government he's [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2342.08s)]
*  created and he's got people around him who are of the same mind as him, you know Morgan McSweeney, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2350.88s)]
*  I mean I don't know what Morgan McSweeney's politics are, I shared a taxi with him once [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2357.2s)]
*  many many years ago but we didn't really speak to each other, it was all some neighbour party thing [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2362.8s)]
*  and I don't know what his politics are but I can infer from the kind of the output we've had, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2367.6s)]
*  the policy output we've had, the kind of rhetoric we've had since 2021, that he is somebody who [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2373.8399999999997s)]
*  would take the Churchill line on this, Churchill famously said when somebody talked about the [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2379.92s)]
*  creation of the state of Israel and the displacement of Palestinians, he said who gives a shit about [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2385.68s)]
*  a bunch of, and then I won't say the word, but a racist word to describe people from the Middle East [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2391.04s)]
*  and I'm not saying that Morgan McSweeney would say that word but I think his general view is why [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2395.92s)]
*  would we break with the US-Israeli compact for a bunch of Palestinians, I mean it doesn't make any [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2400.0s)]
*  sense for him as far as he's concerned, that's the first thing, they're a deeply immoral group of [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2407.2s)]
*  people, the second thing is I think that because they're a deeply immoral group of people but [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2413.28s)]
*  deeply immoral group of people but they're also as I said fundamentally unimaginative [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2422.4s)]
*  and you often find this with Keir Starmer, he's like actually behind the public on a whole multitude [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2426.88s)]
*  of issues, right, you know whether it's nationalisation or whatever, various natural [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2432.96s)]
*  monopolies, exactly, they're always playing catch up and clearly what happened in 2020, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2439.6000000000004s)]
*  2021 was they said to themselves right we're the cleverest people in the room, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2449.84s)]
*  that bunch of trots tried to do this, it was too radical, too left-wing, let's be really [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2456.0800000000004s)]
*  really conservative and just assume that the country is really conservative on every single [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2462.8s)]
*  issue and they did it in like such a kind of plaster cast homogenous way, unimaginative, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2466.96s)]
*  unbispoiled, incapable of picking out nuance, incapable of doing mix and match in any kind of [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2476.32s)]
*  intelligence sophisticated way, they are stuck now and I think you see it on their faces increasingly, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2484.6400000000003s)]
*  I mean with reform winning and so on so you know, you can see that they put themselves into a [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2491.2000000000003s)]
*  straitjacket and every time they're outflanked to the left by reform or the greens or whoever it is, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2496.0s)]
*  Morgan McSweeney cuts off the, you know, they get rid of some public facing politician and [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2504.4s)]
*  McSweeney says I never wanted that in the first place, it was an aberration that whose origin is [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2510.7200000000003s)]
*  this person that we've now got rid of, right, I think that you could extend that to foreign policy, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2516.1600000000003s)]
*  so you know actually there's a wider point here which is that public opinion as I keep banging [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2521.52s)]
*  on about has shifted and I keep banging on about it by the way, I'll talk about it maybe in a bit [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2529.28s)]
*  because it's the only thing that gives us hope as people who care about Palestine but as public [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2534.0s)]
*  and as Palestinians but as public opinion has shifted, the dial has shifted toward a pro-Palestinian, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2539.52s)]
*  pro-justice position on it and against Israel, currently presently constituted, there is this [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2545.36s)]
*  attempt that there is this kind of sluggishness, there's this sluggishness of institutions to [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2553.68s)]
*  respond to it, you know politicians if they want to try and reflect, I don't think Palestine [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2558.72s)]
*  defines elections in this country still by the way, I don't agree with that, I don't think we're [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2563.6s)]
*  there yet but it might be four or five topics down the list in terms of things that people vote on [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2568.0s)]
*  or even six or seven or eight but I do think that when you do isolate that one particular topic, [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2575.2s)]
*  the majority of people are broadly at least discomforted by what they see coming out of [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2581.52s)]
*  Gaza at the least and many of them are much more strident in their pro-Palestinian positions, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2586.88s)]
*  so that's an electoral question but I think institutions have been sluggish to respond to [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2592.72s)]
*  that shift in public opinion, they haven't really, even if you look at it in a kind of strategic [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2597.2s)]
*  sense, they haven't really picked up on the fact that there are strategic gains there to be had [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2601.7599999999998s)]
*  by being a kind of consistently anti-imperialist, not necessarily openly anti-Zionist but [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2606.9599999999996s)]
*  critical of what Israel's doing and so on, that's the second thing but that's kind of like [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2615.2s)]
*  a something about institutional inertia, I think more than either of those things, [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2619.68s)]
*  I still think that there is a very powerful lobby that clusters around [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2627.68s)]
*  Israel and that basically is very carefully directed into places to make it very difficult [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2639.68s)]
*  for politicians to change their position on this kind of question, to keep up with the times, [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2648.88s)]
*  to react to what they're seeing, to react to what their constituents want, there is this kind of [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2655.12s)]
*  penumbra around the state of Israel that is very, and by the way before, I know that we've [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2660.6400000000003s)]
*  kind of moved on from this discourse now, many of them aren't Jewish, many of them aren't Jewish, [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2666.32s)]
*  you know, they're professionals, they're evangelical Christians, they have, even if they're not [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2672.08s)]
*  directly evangelical Christians, they certainly have their bases in evangelical Christian [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2678.48s)]
*  heartlands in the United States and so on, so this isn't a thing about, you know, [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2684.72s)]
*  Jewish conspiracy or anything shadowy like that, this is about an ideology, this is about protecting [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2690.96s)]
*  a nation state that's coming to genocide and this is about the arms industry and this is about [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2696.8s)]
*  business interests connected to genocide, the pro-hearing and so on, those are the constituent [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2702.7200000000003s)]
*  parts of that lobby and of course there is a strong, you know, ideological Zionist element there as [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2710.0800000000004s)]
*  well or ethno-Zionist, kind of ethno-supremacist element there too, but it's mottled, it's mixed [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2715.84s)]
*  and I think really, the first two explanations are interesting, a bit academic but interesting, [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2724.56s)]
*  this is the key, that there is still this kind of very, and actually I think Hasbara, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2730.96s)]
*  mentioned Hasbara, propaganda, that there's a relationship there that as global public opinion [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2738.0s)]
*  has shifted against what the state of Israel does and has been doing to the Palestinians for 80 years, [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2745.36s)]
*  and there's many who managed the Hasbara machine, the propaganda machine, as I say, it's broadly [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2751.3599999999997s)]
*  understood, have said we're not going to, we're going to shift resources, we're going to put [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2757.3599999999997s)]
*  resources that were previously in the kind of soft Hasbara category or basket into the hard [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2763.2799999999997s)]
*  Hasbara basket, in other words, move it away from tourism, move it away from trying to, you know, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2768.24s)]
*  messages in whatever and move it towards, so traditional comms PR, move it towards the harder, [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2773.52s)]
*  kind of, compelant stuff or the impellent stuff, so get our guys in the embassies, [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2780.72s)]
*  get our guys in the media spaces, get our guys in lobbying government and so on and so on. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2786.56s)]
*  One of the things I wanted to ask you about is about the media, I watched a clip which made a [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2794.64s)]
*  bit of an impact online, which was when you were debating Jake Wallace-Simon, who's a former editor [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2801.04s)]
*  of the Jewish Chronicle and I think it's fair to say a pretty militant apologist for Israel [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2805.6s)]
*  and the horrors actually, which have been inflicted obviously of the Palestinian people [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2811.8399999999997s)]
*  since 7 October. What, I just want to, just that kind of, I mean, obviously just how anti-Palestinian [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2817.8399999999997s)]
*  racism is so normalized, there's not actually any pretense in any meaningful way that Palestinian [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2825.8399999999997s)]
*  life has even a fraction of the worth of an Israeli life, or those deemed to be us, [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2831.36s)]
*  westerners, because Israelis basically are just subsumed into the us category, they're westerners, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2836.08s)]
*  they're us, Palestinians are them. And just how, I mean, the kind of narrative really, which has just [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2840.6400000000003s)]
*  been immune, like it's like titanium enforced, which is broadly along the lines of Israel is [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2849.76s)]
*  conducting a war or self-defense and we can have a debate about whether its response is proportionate [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2860.56s)]
*  or not. And we can agree to disagree on that. I mean, that's, you know, basically it's just kind of [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2865.2s)]
*  as every possible conceivable horror and crime is committed. And you do occasionally get, and I've [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2871.2s)]
*  noted this before, you do get occasional, you know, so-and-nuance, western media deconstructions of [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2877.12s)]
*  Israeli lives. So for example, recently on the paramedics butchered and left in a mass grave by [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2884.72s)]
*  the Israeli state, Sky needs to do deconstruction. The Washington Post have done one about, for [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2890.48s)]
*  example, the assault on Al-Shifa Hospital in November 23rd. CNN once did one about the flower [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2894.64s)]
*  massacre and so on. But the issue is you get these occasional good pieces of journalism, [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2900.3999999999996s)]
*  they're good pieces of journalism, but obviously, A, far too few of them, B, they're too late, [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2905.3599999999997s)]
*  they come after the event. And three, they're detached from the wider narrative, they're [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2912.88s)]
*  siloed. You don't then get a kind of like Russian authorities are treated by the western media, [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2918.56s)]
*  you don't defer to what they say is somehow credible, you just treat them as risable, [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2923.76s)]
*  basically. What do you think about that? Just the way across the board that western media approach [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2928.7200000000003s)]
*  has, it's just immune to anything that happens. But what does Israel have to do at this point? [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2934.32s)]
*  Yeah, totally. And I think the answer to that is, and this is the sad truth, there is nothing [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2941.12s)]
*  at present that they can do that will shift that discourse within the upper reaches of the [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2949.04s)]
*  from editors, from the really powerful guys that decide how the shows or the newspapers are going [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2956.48s)]
*  to lead. There's nothing Israel can do that will shift that right now. I mean, I'm firm in my [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2964.56s)]
*  belief that they could drop a nuclear bomb on Gaza, and there would be a course shock, and they would [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2970.8s)]
*  use it to fill column inches and make stories for days and days. But I still think broadly speaking, [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2978.8s)]
*  they would find a way to justify it at present. That doesn't mean it's always going to be like [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2984.8s)]
*  that. I mean, you're a journalist, you know, I'm sure that there are lots of journalists who want [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2989.36s)]
*  to report this properly, who are disgraced, but or is that not your experience? I think it's, [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=2997.6800000000003s)]
*  do you know what, this is something I think about actually a lot, because it's easy to just get [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3005.52s)]
*  angry at the those who still legitimize and cheerlead for Israel's doing like Dan Hodges. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3010.88s)]
*  At this point, I just think sociopathic. It's the people who are silent. And these are the people [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3018.0s)]
*  who they'll do some hand wringing. They'll hand wring about, oh, it's so, but they won't call out [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3024.6400000000003s)]
*  a crime for what it is. Like if it was a state which was hostile to the West, these are the [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3030.5600000000004s)]
*  same people who think they've been courageous when they tweet condemning Vladimir Putin, who is where [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3034.48s)]
*  there's a media consensus on that. Our countries are arming and backing Ukraine. I mean, it's just [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3039.6000000000004s)]
*  what are you doing? I'm not saying you shouldn't condemn what's happening in, you know, war crimes [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3044.88s)]
*  in Ukraine. The issue is you're not adding anything, you're not doing anything. Like what's [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3049.6800000000003s)]
*  the impact of that? There's nothing, you know, what are you trying to secure there? You know, [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3054.6400000000003s)]
*  like, oh, what an angry treat, Vladimir Putin's going to back down in the Kremlin. But on the issue [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3058.48s)]
*  of this is you do require a back bone because I get it, but you're a coward. I mean, at the end of [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3062.1600000000003s)]
*  the day, I mean, and that and every atrocity in history has always been made possible by those [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3066.48s)]
*  people. It's journalists. And I get sometimes it's like, how are journalists going to be going like, [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3073.36s)]
*  well, you know, you're saying what a lot of us think. Fucking say it then. You know, [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3077.92s)]
*  I just think that's the issue. It's just, you know, those people need to be condemned. They need to [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3081.84s)]
*  be shamed. And you're right, they do. You're right. People do want to report on it. And, and, but it's [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3087.2000000000003s)]
*  not just, you're right, there's an institutional issue. That's absolutely correct. I get that [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3092.08s)]
*  within their media outlets. And, you know, I've interviewed BBC, I did a report about the systemic [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3095.44s)]
*  issues in the BBC and I interviewed BBC journalists, 13 of them, who were whistleblowers and who told [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3101.12s)]
*  me the inside story of what's happening. And, you know, it in the BBC and they're fighting as best [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3106.96s)]
*  they can to report. So that's, you know, I do, that is happening, but it is people basically just [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3113.52s)]
*  don't want to touch it. Not in a meaningful way. And they're doing it because they fear, not by the [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3117.92s)]
*  way, rationally, that the impact on their career or they'll get, you know, somehow deplatformed or [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3123.3599999999997s)]
*  smeared online. Those are clear risks. If you speak about Palestine, there are definitely, [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3130.0s)]
*  there's the most intense assault on free speech since the 1950s, since McCarthyism. No question, [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3135.2s)]
*  but you don't get a bomb dropped on you along with your entire family, that Palestinian journalist. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3140.8s)]
*  And that's, that's why they're risable. Right. Exactly. And so what you see, I think, is then [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3144.32s)]
*  a kind of, a sort of cowardly middle. In other words, you've got people, you know, like yourself [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3151.2s)]
*  and the guys at Navara and various others. Of course, there are some, and there are some [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3161.28s)]
*  notable exceptions in the middle within institutions, but generally speaking, you've got you guys, [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3165.68s)]
*  and then you've got people at the very top, like Gary Lineker and Louis Farouk. Gary Lineker's not [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3171.68s)]
*  a journalist, obviously, but he was- He was a sports journalist, but not a news journalist. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3177.36s)]
*  It turns out he's got more journalistic integrity in his little finger than Amiraj does in his whole [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3182.7200000000003s)]
*  body. But anyway, you've got those guys at the very top, Louis Farouk, the Gary Linekers, who [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3189.1200000000003s)]
*  are really, really rich and they basically don't need to worry about money ever again. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3197.6800000000003s)]
*  The national institutions and their own rights. The national institutions, they've already made, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3203.7599999999998s)]
*  you know, tens of millions of, or millions and millions of quid. They're fine. So it's like, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3208.08s)]
*  come at me, bro, whatever. Yeah, exactly. What are you going to do? And you know, Gary Lineker's got [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3212.08s)]
*  his, his Goldhanger podcast thing going on, which is really making him shit loads of money. And you [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3216.72s)]
*  know- Lovely guy, Gary. Yeah, yeah, he is. He's a great guy. Lovely guy. He's a lovely guy. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3222.3199999999997s)]
*  Rest is history. It's, you know, a couple of libs, but I quite enjoy it. Well, he's also just done [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3227.8399999999997s)]
*  that. It's just because actually he's interesting because he is, there's like liberals, the worst [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3232.88s)]
*  thing, I mean, obviously I'm a socialist, but liberals, it is if you could, because you, [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3237.04s)]
*  if you were like a consistent liberalism, liberalism is on paper, you would speak out against [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3242.8s)]
*  the genocide. It was just like basic liberal principles, but you don't get, there's no, just [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3247.2000000000003s)]
*  the only ones you have basically are him, Jonathan Portes, for example, he's an economist who, [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3251.76s)]
*  um, he's kind of, you know, I suppose more towards the liberal end, but he's spoken out against [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3258.88s)]
*  genocide. Those are examples of you get actual liberals who, who aren't, you see what I mean? [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3262.96s)]
*  Yeah, they're actually, they're actually consistent with their professed principles. And this is, [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3268.0s)]
*  we can talk about that again in a minute in the context of the international community, because [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3272.96s)]
*  I'll come back to the original point, but I think liberals and the kia stammers of the world and all [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3277.7599999999998s)]
*  those guys, you know, their failure, their abject failure on this question of Gaza to protect Gaza, [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3283.44s)]
*  to rein Israel in et cetera, et cetera, committing war crimes and genocide [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3291.92s)]
*  will have catastrophic consequences for the so-called rules-based international system. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3297.2000000000003s)]
*  And it already is. And you know, it's always been very, very shaky and tenuous anyway, [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3303.92s)]
*  but it is, I think it's, this is signed its death warrant basically. And so all the liberals who [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3309.36s)]
*  claim they cared about and often wheel it out with Russia, with Ukraine and say, look, this is [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3316.0s)]
*  a disgrace because of that. Nobody, there'll be a laughter track. You know, people will help them [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3320.96s)]
*  figuratively speaking with rotten fruit and vegetables because they have completely and [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3328.6400000000003s)]
*  utterly slain their professed sacred cow in the form of international rules-based community and [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3333.68s)]
*  international legality and all the rest of it. All those edifices that were, as I say, shakily [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3343.04s)]
*  erected after World War II, they've often functioned in service of power and not in the [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3348.3999999999996s)]
*  service of those in the global south or those arrayed against power. But, you know, for better [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3353.04s)]
*  or for ill, they were there. And actually with the ICC, the ICC has tried to carry that flame. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3359.36s)]
*  It's tried to carry that torch. It's tried to do its fucking job. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3365.04s)]
*  It really has, yeah. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3368.6400000000003s)]
*  It's the alleged, the self-professed architects of international rules-based order that have [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3370.0s)]
*  completely chopped it down, retrenched it, shown themselves to be completely contemptuous [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3377.2000000000003s)]
*  of international law by allowing Netanyahu and members of his government to fly through the [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3385.04s)]
*  airspace, to land on their soil, et cetera. I mean, it's just, there's no going back on this now. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3391.36s)]
*  Nobody will ever take any of them seriously ever again on international law or the rules-based [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3397.04s)]
*  international system of norms and so on. That's just a separate point. But I think, to answer [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3403.12s)]
*  your question really directly, and I think you've actually helped me crystallize by answer to it [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3409.92s)]
*  why the media is this. There's three reasons. One is credentialism that journalists want access. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3414.32s)]
*  And they know the game. They know the court. And they know the court games very, very well. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3420.56s)]
*  And so, you know, they know that they can be a genuine gadfly, to use this Socratic term. They [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3426.56s)]
*  can genuinely oppose or ask questions. They don't even need to oppose. They can ask probing questions [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3433.76s)]
*  as journalists are supposed to do. They will be cut out, you know, and here, Star Wars government, [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3439.68s)]
*  I think, has showed itself to be quite spiteful, maybe even more than average on that front. So [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3445.3599999999997s)]
*  journalists, there's credentialism. Journalists want access and they know they won't get it if [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3451.2s)]
*  they start saying searching things about Israel. There's also the group thing, which I said sort of [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3455.2s)]
*  start, you know, Star Wars government was an embodiment and other governments in this country [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3462.16s)]
*  in the past and many governments and political system. But there's a media group thing as well. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3469.04s)]
*  I mean, I haven't spent that much time in television studios. Oh, and you will have spent [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3472.88s)]
*  infinitely more time. But you do when you speak to some journalists, some of them extremely storied [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3479.68s)]
*  and prestigious and educated in the small amounts of time that I've spent in those spaces. I have [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3487.7599999999998s)]
*  thought on occasion, these people are really, really unimaginative and really uninteresting, [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3497.36s)]
*  and they're really not interested in ideas or the truth. They are really hardwired almost [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3503.1200000000003s)]
*  to just know how to do the ABC of journalism, get the story out, make their [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3512.08s)]
*  the mothership happy, and then continue to gain access to the key players and then rinse and repeat, [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3519.1200000000003s)]
*  rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat. Right. And that's the secret of their success. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3525.44s)]
*  So there's that then obviously that fuses with the credentialism point, but it's group think, [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3530.2400000000002s)]
*  but that creates a certain way of thinking, right? It's not that they're just lying to themselves [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3536.32s)]
*  all the time. It's that why would they peer over their hedges? Why would they peer over their [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3541.92s)]
*  suburban hedges? Or show at the starvation camp? You know, it's never served them. So they don't [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3547.2000000000003s)]
*  even think to look. It's not that they're so it's those two things. And then I come back to the point [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3554.4s)]
*  about the kind of more external factor, the lobbying, you know, and you've talked about it. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3560.1600000000003s)]
*  That's why I say you get the Louis Farouz, the Gary Linekers, the people who really have made [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3564.0s)]
*  their lives work and who are minted. And as a result, they can't really there's nothing they [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3569.52s)]
*  can really do to them. You know, for tarnish their, you know, try to tarnish their reputations in a way [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3575.28s)]
*  that doesn't really work the way it did in 2018, 2017, 2019. It just doesn't work well anymore. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3580.8s)]
*  Again, because of that point about the whole world can see what Israel's doing. Absolutely. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3587.44s)]
*  And so you kind of you can just it's transparent that this this attempted to defame people or [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3592.7200000000003s)]
*  whatever, discredit people in the light of something so horrific. But the lobbying is still there for [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3598.88s)]
*  the middle. So you know, you guys, you guys are, you know, you I don't want to say you're at the [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3605.52s)]
*  but you guys on the left of it, you're not, you're not as touched by it. You don't give a shit. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3610.56s)]
*  You've already been dragged through the mother million times by these people, whatever. And then [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3615.04s)]
*  Louis Farouz, Gary Lineker, you know, whatever. But the guys in the middle, not only are they [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3619.44s)]
*  suffering from group thinking, are, you know, in service to credentialism, or in hock to them, [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3625.6s)]
*  but they're also subject to intense lobbying, I think. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3633.68s)]
*  I think there's a lot in that definitely 100%. And yeah, yeah. My mom always said, [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3637.7599999999998s)]
*  I guess what else if you're on the left is you if you picture stuff like this, my mom said, [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3644.56s)]
*  always said that I'm riding a lion. And one day the lion is going to throw me off and eat me. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3648.7999999999997s)]
*  So just kind of feel a bit faint. Just feel a bit fatalistic about it. Just finally, what Yeah, [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3654.08s)]
*  just funny in terms of just what, just anything you want to say, kind of thrown into this really, [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3660.64s)]
*  but what what hope do you have, as a British Palestinian looking at and having lived, you know, [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3666.3199999999997s)]
*  through your family as you've gone through through your family history, generation after generation, [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3674.24s)]
*  suffering violence in many different forms, perpetrated by the Israeli state. And as you say, [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3679.04s)]
*  that you're just that's one case study. And every Palestinian family can tell these horrible stories. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3684.96s)]
*  What hope do you have about how things could, how this could, how this could change how, [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3691.2s)]
*  you know, the Palestinian people can have liberation? Yeah. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3696.16s)]
*  That's a question I grapple with every day and think about every day. And I know we all are, [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3702.3199999999997s)]
*  by the way, I mean, any of us with half a conscience, we're all thinking about it. It's [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3708.4s)]
*  not just Palestinians. It's not just certainly not just me. I think that [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3712.32s)]
*  there's a couple of things and forgive me for for kind of subjecting myself to almost treating it [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3720.6400000000003s)]
*  like it's therapy or something. But no, do appreciate that. Oh, and thank you. Look, I mean, [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3730.2400000000002s)]
*  speaking very personally, and this is the thing about [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3737.52s)]
*  something like the Nakba, it creates such enormous seismic fallout across the generations, [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3743.7599999999998s)]
*  across even the centuries, which then means that, you know, the Palestinian experience is so [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3752.56s)]
*  fragmented, right, which is part of the logic that reproduces the state of Israel is that [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3759.44s)]
*  Palestinian experience is so fragmented. I wonder whether to even admit this, sometimes, [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3765.52s)]
*  especially in the past 18 months, the being Palestinian, [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3773.04s)]
*  even if you're a relatively privileged member of the diaspora, as I am, [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3781.7599999999998s)]
*  it's important to stress that I think over and over again. It feels a bit like being terminally [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3785.44s)]
*  ill. Now, I'm not I've never been terminally ill. I want to stress that's probably and [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3792.32s)]
*  it's probably a problematic analogy. But it's the closest thing that I can think of [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3797.84s)]
*  how I feel sometimes seeing what I see, hearing what I hear from my family, and just feeling [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3804.96s)]
*  like the sun is setting or something, you know, like seeing a horizon, a beautiful horizon, [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3811.2000000000003s)]
*  and seeing the sun setting and light fading. That's how it feels sometimes to me. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3817.2s)]
*  It also feels, by the way, like sometimes like I'm a member of one of the most beloved families [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3823.4399999999996s)]
*  in the world. And that's another thing that's really important to say that's really, really [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3829.6s)]
*  shifted, which is, you know, and you're part of your part of our and sorry to say you are, [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3833.8399999999997s)]
*  you're part of that. And obviously, many, many millions of others, you know, we know, [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3839.04s)]
*  when I was growing up, you would go to a Palestine demo in London, say tech 2002, [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3844.4s)]
*  when Ariel Sharon was flattening Jenin and Nameless, right, go to a Palestine demo, [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3850.32s)]
*  huge event. Now it would get not multiple coverage on basically media, but it would have huge social [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3856.96s)]
*  media coverage. We'd probably get hundreds of thousands. It was a real it wasn't Gaza levels, [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3862.0s)]
*  but it was a real destruction of two major Palestinian urban centers and many, many killed [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3866.4s)]
*  by a man who was a war criminal who, you know, was a fugitive from international law, died a [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3872.16s)]
*  fugitive from international law, and by the way, was instrumental, even though he was only 20 years [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3879.04s)]
*  old in killings, systematic executions in the Nakba. Anyway, we'd come to London, my mom and I, [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3884.8799999999997s)]
*  and you'd be lucky if you got two free, you'd be lucky if you got 1000 people at those demos. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3895.68s)]
*  We're only talking 2002. It's not very long ago. So to know that that has shifted to such a huge [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3902.08s)]
*  extent in my lifetime, in my short lifetime, so far is enormous. And it does make me feel like [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3910.0s)]
*  it balances the terminal ill fit terminally ill feeling with a feeling of being beloved, [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3917.7599999999998s)]
*  and a feeling of being part of a family that is very beloved and, you know, seen or whatever you [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3925.2s)]
*  want to say. So that's that's one thing to say. I I think we're gonna I think we're gonna win this [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3931.2799999999997s)]
*  eventually. I just do. And I don't know whether that's just because I'm I feel really despairing [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3940.08s)]
*  most days on and off. But ultimately, I think we're gonna win this. I'll give you an example. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3946.72s)]
*  I mean, just to give you some political science explanations. I think that there are too many [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3952.8799999999997s)]
*  pathologies in Israeli society, there are too many fundamental pathologies, there are too many [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3957.7599999999998s)]
*  fundamental antagonisms, that will just get worse and worse. And I think they that will that portends [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3964.64s)]
*  for decay of the state of Israel from within. And then of course, the task for all of us [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3973.44s)]
*  expediting the end of racist apartheid genocidal ethno state is to put as much pressure as possible [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3981.6s)]
*  in the economy. So for you through things like BDS, but also for direct action, and building [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3991.68s)]
*  international coalitions, continuing to find language over this is so important, because [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=3997.52s)]
*  as we said earlier, we're running out of vocabulary, we've run out of vocabulary, [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4002.88s)]
*  run out of language, it doesn't matter. We've got to dig deep, we're going to keep digging deep, [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4006.0s)]
*  find ways to express what we're seeing in front of us. I can't give up on that, even if we feel [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4010.6400000000003s)]
*  like we're repeating ourselves, even if we feel like we're living through the most horrific [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4016.0s)]
*  version of Groundhog Day, we have to find ways to express this. And I'm confident that we will, [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4019.84s)]
*  even if they're not fit to, you know, even if they're not to scale, even if they don't [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4028.32s)]
*  keep up with the pace of evil by half, I'm confident that we will continue to articulate [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4034.1600000000003s)]
*  it. And through articulation, we build international solidarity. So that's those [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4040.2400000000002s)]
*  are the political sciencey things. On a personal note, I will never forget, [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4044.7200000000003s)]
*  I, my relationship with my dad has always been one of distance. He I think, you know, he's a nice [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4053.6s)]
*  man, and I care about him a lot. And I know vice versa, we've never been that close. He I didn't [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4061.2799999999997s)]
*  grow up with him grew up in England. And two things about him quickly, because I should mention him, [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4065.8399999999997s)]
*  if I've got time, have I got time? Yeah, yeah, go for it. Go for it. Well, one thing was, whatever [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4073.44s)]
*  I might have felt growing up with him about him not being around, as all kids would, [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4079.6s)]
*  I had a realization one day. That realization was that if you calculate my dad's life, [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4083.6s)]
*  in terms of years not spent on the military occupation, he's a boy of six. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4091.28s)]
*  He was born in 1960, the tanks came in 67 into East Jerusalem. And even before that, he was [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4099.76s)]
*  encircled by expansionist iron estate. But if you calculate his life in terms of he's a boy of six, [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4105.52s)]
*  and I swear to you, after having that realization, I've never been able to feel anything like [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4112.4800000000005s)]
*  annoyance or resentment or anything towards him again. One day, a couple of years back, we were, [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4118.56s)]
*  we were in Jerusalem, and I think we were wandering around the neighborhood, [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4125.92s)]
*  there in East Jerusalem. And he said to me, I won't, I won't make it out. I won't see a free [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4130.400000000001s)]
*  Palestine, just so you're aware. I'm going to die before, before that happens. I will die under [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4140.0s)]
*  military occupation. I'm the Zionist rule, essentially. I'll die a second or third class [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4147.52s)]
*  citizen, and I won't see a free Palestine. Just so you know, that's, I'm resigned to that now. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4153.92s)]
*  But I'll tell you something. One day, they will be gone, and we will still be here. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4162.32s)]
*  And he didn't mean by they, Jews, he didn't mean all Jewish people. He meant people who don't want [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4170.16s)]
*  to share the land, who don't want to live with people who are different to them, who don't [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4176.4800000000005s)]
*  respect or have any regard for Palestine or Palestinian history or Palestinians [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4180.799999999999s)]
*  or Palestinian communities. That's what he meant. He didn't explain, I didn't ask him to explain, [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4185.92s)]
*  but I could see how deeply felt that was. And somewhere between the political science, [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4192.96s)]
*  the explanations and that faith, I think he might be right. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4201.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, it's a sobering place to end. But it's been such an honour, such a pleasure, honestly. I think [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4206.32s)]
*  we've covered so much and weaving the personal in is always so important, not least when speaking to [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4212.4s)]
*  people with Palestinian heritage, when we're talking about obviously what has been perpetrated [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4218.48s)]
*  against the Palestinian people by the Israeli state with the full support and complicity and [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4222.5599999999995s)]
*  facilitation of Western states. And it's been so educational. I've learned a lot. It's been [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4227.679999999999s)]
*  educational in every possible way. So for those watching, press like, leave comments, subscribe, [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4233.84s)]
*  but leave comments, engage. Obviously, that's what we want, share the video. But Ciaran, [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4242.72s)]
*  it's been such an honour. And thanks so, so much for that. Obviously, really, really appreciate it. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4248.639999999999s)]
*  Owen, thank you for having me on. I really appreciate the opportunity to speak about these [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4252.8s)]
*  things. And I do just want to say, I'm sorry to embarrass you, but I do just want to say thank [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4257.12s)]
*  you for the work that you've done as well over the years, especially latterly, but, you know, [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4262.88s)]
*  over many, many years. So it's much appreciated. Can't speak for all Palestinians, but I know that [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4268.64s)]
*  many feel the same way. That's very sweet of you. Yeah. And as I said before, it's the people who [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4273.12s)]
*  should be silent, who haven't spoken, actually be condemned more than those who've spoken actually [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4280.72s)]
*  be praised. But yeah, thank you. I appreciate it. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGjNl0mEmM&t=4285.44s)]
