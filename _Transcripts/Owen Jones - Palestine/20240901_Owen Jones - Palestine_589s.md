# Netanyahu Leaves Israeli Hostages For Death For Sake Of Genocidal War
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [September 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6M5jKUABChY)
*  Headlines are dominated by the news of six Israeli hostages being found killed in Gaza.
*  Now, according to the Israel Defense Force, the Israeli army, the hostages were killed by Hamas,
*  dropped to the head shortly before the IDF reached them. Hamas deny that and say they were
*  killed by Israeli military activity. Now, as I said from the beginning, taking hostages is a
*  serious war crime. If Hamas killed them, that's a more serious war crime still. Presumably that
*  would be to stop them being captured alive, if that's true. War crimes are war crimes,
*  regardless of situation and dynamic. We do know that in other cases, many of the Israeli hostages
*  have been killed by the Israeli state carpet mowing Gaza or indeed shooting dead hostages,
*  including those hostages who were waving white flags and yelling in Hebrew for help.
*  Israel has killed far more of its own hostages than it has rescued. Now, Benjamin Netanyahu,
*  the Israeli Prime Minister, has used this news to declare that Hamas doesn't want a deal.
*  Now, this from him is quite something. Even the Israeli military is blaming Benjamin Netanyahu
*  for the deaths of these hostages because of his refusal to agree to any of his deliberate
*  thwarting of a ceasefire deal which would free the Israeli hostages, and I would say,
*  I would note, the Palestinian hostages, I'll talk about them, and end the mass slaughter of
*  the Palestinian people. Three of the hostages, it should be noted, were on a list to be exchanged
*  in the later ceasefire deal, but Netanyahu refused to accept the deal. A general strike has now been
*  called in Israel to demand a hostage deal. Mohammed Shahada, a Palestinian analyst and the
*  chief of communications at Yoruba Med Monitor, a human rights NGO, I've interviewed him, brilliant
*  guy, he shares various Israeli headlines as examples. Reverse Netanyahu, reverse, military
*  pressure doesn't return abductees, it kills them, is one headline. Another is a dramatic change for
*  the worse and the abductees chances of survival. The state of Israel condemns them to death.
*  Another, the claim that only military pressure will bring back the abductees was never true.
*  It goes on. Now, more to the point, the Israeli cabinet descended, reportedly, into a shouting
*  match between the defence minister, Yoav Galan and Netanyahu. Bear in mind, the international
*  criminal court chief prosecutor has issued arrest warrants, requests for arrest warrants, for war
*  crimes and crimes against humanity for both. According to the media outlet Axios, Galan had
*  pushed for some sort of deal, declaring that the deal wasn't just about the release of the hostages,
*  but also a quote unquote strategic juncture for Israel. He reportedly said, if the Israeli
*  government chooses a path that leads to a deal, it could decrease regional tensions with Iran
*  and Hezbollah and allow Israel defence forces to regroup beyond we think it's strategy and shift
*  its focus from Gaza to other regional threats. He goes on, but if Israel chooses not to go for a
*  deal, it would leave the IDF bogged down in Gaza, while exacerbating tensions across the Middle East
*  that could lead to a regional war while the IDF's focus is elsewhere. So there you have it. What
*  you have there isn't a moral case, obviously being made by Yoav Galan, who was himself a war
*  criminal. This is real politik, a fear that the most extreme course will lead to strategic
*  catastrophe for Israel. Now, to be clear about what Netanyahu is proposing, he's demanding indefinite
*  control of the Philadelphia corridor on the Gaza Egypt corridor, policed by Israeli troops,
*  which is opposed not just by Hamas, but by Egypt as well. He's appointed a chief Gaza officer in
*  charge of, for example, food and fuel supply, in other words, a governor for the indefinite occupation
*  of Gaza by the Israeli state. Now, going back to Axios, this outlet claims that the official said
*  Galan then interjected and accused Netanyahu of forcing maps of Gaza on the IDF, despite the fact
*  that the military's position is it can mitigate the risk of withdrawing forces from the area in
*  order to reach a hostage deal. It then says that Netanyahu got mad, banged his hand on the table,
*  accused Galan of lying and announced he was bringing the maps to a cabinet on the spot,
*  according to prime minister's aides. He then says Galan responded with a sharp attack of his own,
*  as the prime minister you were authorized to bring to vote any decision you want,
*  including executing the hostages. Quite something. Essentially arguing that Netanyahu is responsible
*  for the deaths of the hostages to come. He then argued we have to choose between Philadelphia,
*  the Philadelphia corridor, which I'll come on to with the hostages, we can't have both.
*  If we vote, we might find out that either the hostages will die or we will have to backtrack
*  and release them. The Times of Israel headline is blunt, Netanyahu tells ministers he prioritizes
*  Philadelphia over hostages. Horrifying Galan. The ceasefire deal is nonsense in any case,
*  it means a temporary pause in fighting, release some of the Israeli hostages in exchange for
*  Palestinian hostages, which I'll explain, then resume the fighting, with Gaza divided into two,
*  civilians prevented from returning to their homes in the north, the border with Egypt taken
*  over by Israel, and then indefinite occupation for Israel to wage its genocide of war with
*  impossible war aims of destroying Hamas. And that point about the Philadelphia corridor,
*  I think is key, that Israel keeps indefinite control of the border with Egypt, just shows that
*  the designs here are for Gaza to fall under the indefinite occupation and eventually annexation
*  like the West Bank of Gaza. Now Israeli negotiator and author Gershon Baskin has written a tweet
*  yesterday morning which refers to his previous back channel negotiations with Hamas in 2006,
*  where he played an instrumental role in the release of Gilad Shalit, an Israeli
*  soldier who'd been taken hostage. He then adds, In May of this year, I managed to convince our
*  system to activate me again, I started sending messages and receiving answers officially and
*  directly, but after two weeks the system informed me to stop. In my estimation, Netanyahu found out
*  that I was operating a direct and secret channel that was very much active and he did not want such
*  a channel. About two weeks ago, the hostage family's forum asked me to try to conduct a
*  direct negotiation with Hamas on their behalf, that's what I did, and within two weeks I obtained
*  agreement to a three-week deal, the release of all 107 hostages, the end of the war, an Israeli
*  withdrawal from Gaza, and an agreed release of the names and numbers of Palestinian prisoners.
*  The entire Hamas leadership agrees to this outline, but Netanyahu does not want to end the war.
*  This is the situation today, Saturday, August 31st, 2024. It is abundantly clear that Netanyahu
*  has prevented a ceasefire deal, has no interest in war and wishes to wage a genocidal war to the end,
*  even if that means sacrificing all the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza.
*  Now the statement by Democratic nominee and Vice President of the United States Kamala Harris is
*  instructive. She says in a statement referring to the American Israeli hostage who has been found
*  dead, Hirsch Goldberg-Polin, Hamas is an evil terrorist organisation. With these murders,
*  Hamas has even more American blood on its hands. I strongly condemn Hamas's continued brutality,
*  and so must the entire world. From its massacre of 1,200 to sexual violence, taking of hostages
*  and these murders, Hamas' depravity is evident and horrifying. The threat Hamas poses to the people
*  of Israel and American citizens in Israel must be eliminated and Hamas cannot control Gaza.
*  The Palestinian people too have suffered under Hamas' rule for nearly two decades.
*  No mention at all of the mass atrocities committed by the Israeli state, the tens of thousands
*  killed. She mentions sexual violence as overwhelming evidence of sexual violence by
*  the Israeli military authorities against Palestinians. Torture, some of those depraved
*  war crimes imaginable that's possible to commit have been committed by the Israeli state with
*  US complicity and facilitation. And she mentions Americans being killed. I mean, we've had several
*  Americans killed during, I mean, going back to Rachel Corey, for example, the American activist
*  who was killed by the Israeli military. You know, an American was shot in the West Bank
*  the other week. We've had earlier this year a Palestinian American killed. We had the Palestinian
*  American Al Jazeera journalist, Shireen Abirakli, who was killed last year. I mean, we could go on.
*  We don't see her speaking in those terms about American citizens killed by Israel, do we?
*  But in practice, it means Harris is giving Israel carte blanche to wages for ever-genocidal war.
*  US government analysts themselves say there's no chance of defeating Hamas militarily. You
*  can't defeat an idea by military means. When you slaughter existing Hamas militants, the survivors
*  of Israel's genocide, including those whose relatives have been slaughtered, some of them
*  will simply fight in their place instead. Now, if you're an American voting Kamala Harris as the
*  lessor of two evils, and okay, I get the argument. I understand the argument, obviously. But just say
*  what you're doing there. Don't invent fantasies about what she believes about Gaza. It's very
*  clear. She doesn't represent some decisive rupture from the Biden policy of facilitating genocide.
*  Finally, look, of course, the lives of these Israeli hostages matter. Every civilian life,
*  irrespective of who they are, is of equal worth. Each of their deaths should be mourned and their
*  killings condemned. You should note, though, as you look at each media outlet and see the faces
*  staring back at you, that the humanity, the same humanity, is not afforded to the far, far
*  greater number of Palestinians who've been killed, including Palestinians held in captivity
*  in Israeli prisons, several of whom have been killed in captivity, almost certainly tortured
*  to death, including Palestinian doctors, those held without charge. And we know there are
*  thousands of Palestinians, including children, held without charge in hideous circumstances,
*  with overwhelming evidence showing torture, sexual violence, rape, utter depravity. These are
*  hostages too. Those Palestinians, let alone the tens of thousands slaughtered by the Israeli
*  state since last October, are not afforded humanity, the same humanity, by our media outlets,
*  by our politicians. The world is once again told in no uncertain terms that Palestinian life does
*  not matter. As we mourn all these deaths, let's be clear, the many thousands of Palestinians who are
*  now going to be killed on top of those who have already been slaughtered, as well as the Israeli
*  hostages, in the absence of a hostage deal, their lives now, I'm afraid, in imminent danger,
*  the blood of all of these people is on the hands of the Israeli state and their US facilitators.
