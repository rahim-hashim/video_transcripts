# Smear Campaign Against US Gaza Protests Taken Apart - w. Nara Milanich
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il_fLVVsKuo)
*  So international headlines have focused on protesters against the onslaught, of course,
*  in Gaza, not least protesters in the United States and actually the most high profile
*  being at Columbia University in New York. Now, there has been something of a frenzy,
*  I would say, over these protests, which have been presented in, well, the most negative
*  light possible, I would say, basically implications that these are anti-Semitic threats to the
*  safety of Jewish students in particular, as well as expressing all sorts of insavory views,
*  and therefore huge demands to have it shut down, police have been called. It has been
*  quite something, to say the least, and something from afar. It almost becomes hard even to
*  know exactly, you can't even build a picture in your head of exactly what's happening because
*  things have been so distorted. With that in mind, I'm really honoured to have a brilliant
*  guest with me, Nara Milanish, who is Professor of History at Barnard College at Columbia
*  University, who can actually, I would just say, be quite helpful right now to just have
*  some basic facts about what's actually going on. Wouldn't that be nice, Nara, just to talk
*  about the tree?
*  Thank you so much. Thank you for having me. You know, we all know about fake news, we've
*  been hearing about fake news for some time now, but watching this story unfold in the
*  media has been just a positively bizarre experience because we have on the one hand this extraordinarily
*  disturbing narrative about what's going on on our campus, and then we have the actual
*  reality if you go on campus and see what is happening. I was just there yesterday and
*  I can tell you that the encampment is peaceful and has been peaceful since its establishment.
*  So essentially the protest consists of a group of students who have essentially set up a
*  camp on one lawn on campus. They were initially told they couldn't have tents, now they have
*  tents. If you look at it, it looks like kind of a cross between, there are a lot of blankets
*  and tents and people hanging out, it looks like a cross between maybe a refugee camp
*  and a summer camp. The kids are blowing bubbles, they are braiding one another's hair, they're
*  singing. On Friday night they had Shabbat services along with Muslim prayer services,
*  so they're doing these kinds of interfaith activities. On Monday night they had a Seder
*  supper with students as well as some faculty who came. There are Mexican flags everywhere,
*  there's a contingent of Latinx students in the encampment. In short, it is peaceful.
*  It is political, certainly. The students are there because they are protesting for the
*  university to divest from its companies that do business in Israel, so I don't want to
*  suggest that they're just there having summer camp. But I do want to emphasize that it's
*  peaceful. We had classes moved online on Monday, but yesterday campus was open. I had class
*  on campus and I asked all of my students to come. It was the last day of class, of that
*  particular class, and I asked them to come because it seems to me that it was a small
*  act of resistance to show up to class and teach and learn and think and inquire because
*  those are actually the basic core functions of the university that are being challenged
*  by this moment.
*  So just a really key point there, because I'll ask in terms of what's actually happening,
*  the media portrayal, is that core demand there about divestment? And Columbia, like all the
*  such universities, has these huge endowment funds with huge amounts of assets, proportionately
*  not a huge amount linked to Israel, but the fact is there's lots of institutions that
*  do. And obviously there's this demand that all, given what's happening, the horrors inflicted
*  against Gaza, if everyone does that, that makes an impact. And it models itself, I suppose,
*  therefore on the struggle against apartheid in South Africa, so kind of similar models.
*  That's exactly right. And in fact, in some ways these, I'm not a historian of the university
*  and we'll have to see how this history gets written, but there are certain parallels with
*  the South African divestment movement of an earlier generation where there were also major
*  protests on campus. And in fact, Columbia has a long and kind of storied history of
*  protest. But I want to suggest that this is clearly about Gaza and Israel and there are
*  many people on campus who have very close and personal ties to the region and very strong
*  political opinions. But I want to suggest that what is happening right now is actually
*  not about the Middle East at all. What is happening on campus now has to do with the
*  American university and it has to do with US politics. And I think what we're seeing
*  is a full on attack on academic freedom and the basic values of the university. So there
*  is a story in the media right now about antisemitism and we can talk about antisemitism. Antisemitism
*  exists. It circulates in this city, in this country, in this world and there are most
*  definitely antisemitic opinions on campus. I have no doubt of that. There are also Islamophobic
*  opinions and lots of other things, right? But I want to suggest that this moment is
*  really about the weaponization of antisemitism on the part of political forces that are frankly
*  hostile to universities that are hostile to what universities stand for, free inquiry,
*  debate, discussion, research, the search for truth or something resembling truth, right?
*  And so it has been extraordinarily distressing to watch antisemitism and the well-being of
*  Jews being suddenly discovered by right-wing forces in this country that have been in the
*  country for decades and have discovered in this issue a kind of cudgel to divide people
*  on universities and turn each other, ourselves against one another, right? So we watched
*  a week ago now, but it feels like three years, when President Shafik of the University, of
*  Columbia University testified in four hours before Congress, a Congressional hearing
*  where for the quality of political debate in this country, we watched Congressional
*  representatives essentially attacking individual professors, making statements about what was
*  going on on campus, about pro-Hamas mobs. And at no time did we hear President Shafik
*  articulate a robust defense of what the university stands for, what we do, what students and
*  faculty are supposed to be doing on campus. We didn't hear any of that. We heard her sort
*  of capitulate to what was clearly a masterclass in political theater. That is what the Congressional
*  hearing was. It was about gotcha moments and viral moments that made the president look
*  bad. In fact, the Congressional hearing had a lot in common with what you see on social
*  media. So that's where we are. The kind of tenor and quality of political debate in our
*  Congress looks like what is going on on social media. And I want to be clear that the folks
*  who were questioning President Shafik about what is going on in campus and expressing
*  their extreme concern for the well-being of Jewish students and the scourge of anti-Semitism,
*  literally woke up the day before the hearing and discovered that anti-Semitism is a problem.
*  These are folks who are right wing, sometimes extreme right wing, people who flirt with
*  and rub shoulders with actual white nationalists who really are anti-Semites. And suddenly
*  they have discovered Jews on campus. So I want to be clear, and I want to be clear also
*  as someone who is Jewish myself, that they have discovered anti-Semitism and the well-being
*  of Jews as essentially an instrument for what I think is a very different political agenda.
*  And that political agenda is asserting interference in the university, in the autonomy of the
*  university, in the integrity of the university. And I think that there's a bigger end game
*  here, which is really, and we've seen this play out, everybody's talking about Columbia
*  right now and NYU now and a lot of the private universities, but this has been going on for
*  years in public universities around the country. For example, at the University of Florida,
*  I'm actually a native of Florida, the University of Florida has, and the kind of public university
*  system in Florida has experienced a kind of radical politicization on the part of Governor
*  DeSantis, who you may remember was a failed presidential candidate and has a kind of radical
*  agenda against wokeism and woke professors. So they've challenged the teaching of the
*  history of slavery. They have banned sociology classes from counting for core requirements
*  in the university in Florida. We have seen in other places challenges to research on
*  climate change and vaccine safety and patterns of voter suppression, so basic social science
*  research. So that is actually what is at stake here. It is about challenging the integrity
*  of research and teaching in entire fields from, again, climate change to the history
*  of slavery, which are uncomfortable or inconvenient for particular political groups in this country.
*  So there's a narrative that the universities have been taken over by, right now they're
*  saying pro-Hamas mobs, but it's woke mobs, right? And so I think that that is actually
*  what is happening here. Anti-Semitism is a particularly powerful weapon at this moment,
*  and it's a weapon that really, it's actually a brilliant political move, frankly, because
*  it clearly divides the campus, not because people are divided into anti-Semites and Jews,
*  but rather because as we know, this issue is so complex, and what is going on in the
*  Middle East is so complex, and it divides people along lines that don't follow necessarily
*  the kind of traditional political cleavages.
*  I think the point about the university there is so crucial, by the way, and it's interesting
*  actually just in terms of right-wing narratives about free speech and cancel culture and how
*  actually you can see what's actually going on and colliding with reality. But before
*  I ask you just more about that, I mean, just in terms of this question of, because this
*  is, you know, the message being broadcast the world is, at Columbia University, Jewish
*  students are no longer safe. They can't appear on campus, and they're threatened and menaced.
*  So I'm just interested what you would say to, I mean, as a Jewish faculty member, obviously,
*  I mean, what's your, when people say that, you know, this is now a hotbed of anti-Semitism,
*  and that's what this protest is, and encampment is really all about, and it's a threat to
*  Jewish safety.
*  Yeah, I wish they would come on campus and see, except for that the university has off
*  and on been allowing press even on campus. Campus is now sort of closed off, so, you
*  know, only affiliates with IDs can typically swipe in. They've let in press sometimes.
*  Sometimes they don't let press in, and that just sort of foments this narrative. I can
*  say as a Jewish faculty member, I'm happy to walk on campus, and I do it multiple times
*  a day. I would say also that Jewish students are many of those who are being arrested.
*  I mean, some of the student, you know, leaders of this movement are Jewish students. Many
*  of the students in the encampment are Jewish, are Jewish students, as you know, and again,
*  students from a variety of other groups. So this idea is just frankly not true.
*  Now, it is the case that I would say two things. First, there are protests happening outside
*  the university along the sidewalk, you know, along the kind of two avenues that demarcate
*  the main campus. And it's an interesting question. Why? Why has Columbia University become a
*  kind of center for people to gather in the city or maybe even the region who want to,
*  you know, express their opinion on either side of this issue? At the end of the day,
*  Columbia University has probably very little control over Middle East policy. If people
*  wanted to protest, maybe, I don't know, maybe they could go to the UN. The United Nations
*  is just down the way. Take the subway and go to the United Nations. So it is a really
*  interesting question why the university has become a center for these protests. And my
*  answer is that it's because the university has so grossly and grievously mishandled the
*  conflicts on campus, right? So that the university itself has become a center for protest.
*  So we have, to answer your question, these groups that have gathered kind of on the periphery
*  of campus, and frankly, some of them are probably, you know, bad actors, again, on both sides.
*  I've seen tensions, you know, kind of swell among protesters, but, you know, again, outside
*  of campus. By definition, if the folks are outside of campus, it means they are not campus
*  affiliates, right? They don't have IDs to get on campus. There are a lot of police and
*  riot gear out there as well. So, you know, the street is tense. And, you know, who are those people?
*  What is their agenda? That's anybody's guess, right? So I think that what we have seen is, you
*  know, statements and viral videos, the origin of which are not clear, but that may be coming
*  right from those outsiders. So when folks say they're not safe, and I've had, you know, I've
*  had students yesterday, I had maybe 12, a dozen of my 60 or so students chose to attend class,
*  not in person. Some of them wrote me and said, I don't feel safe. Those were students of all
*  different sort of backgrounds. Others said, I'm in the encampment right now, so can I attend
*  class on Zoom? Right? So I can understand why, you know, the kind of rhetoric or just the kind
*  of tension, the energy on the street and frankly, the massive presence of the NYPD makes some people
*  feel unsafe. And as some of my colleagues have pointed out, actually, you know, it's the Black
*  and Brown students who feel, you know, understandably least safe with this mass police presence. And in
*  fact, that's exactly the point. And let me just say, are there anti-Semites on campus? I am sure
*  there are. But the way to address bigotry at a university is not by sending in the NYPD and putting
*  100 of your students in zip ties. The way to address, you know, bigotry, and that's part of our job
*  at the university is to educate kids and to have serious conversations, not these ridiculous, you
*  know, sound, viral sound bites that they, you know, that we see on Twitter, but also, frankly,
*  apparently in the congressional hearings in the U.S. Congress, right? We want to have serious
*  debate and discussion. And that becomes impossible when, you know, you're ceding your campus to the
*  NYPD. That's no way to create spaces for serious discussion. So the policies that the university
*  has pursued has frankly made all of us less safe, right? Jewish students and others, it has inflamed
*  the situation. It has called on, you know, the NYPD. Every one of those guys shows up with firearms
*  on campus in huge numbers and riot gear. That doesn't make any of us safer. So the policies that the
*  university is pursuing are actually counterproductive. They make us less safe, and they shut down the
*  spaces that the university should be protecting and creating for us to have difficult conversations
*  about things like, what is the meaning of from the river to the sea? That's a really complicated
*  question. I would love to hear people who actually know something about the Middle East, not me, talk
*  about the meanings and the history of that phrase. But we can't have those kind of conversations when
*  we have people yelling at each other. And again, students being carted off in large numbers in zip
*  ties and put in, you know, the paddy wagons of the NYPD.
*  A nuance which I'm really interested in, and I find this kind of hard to answer, it's something
*  that's cropped up actually. For example, Samoza Maman, who's done this, took part of this brilliant
*  film called Israelism, which is about the kind of changing relationship between often younger Jewish
*  Americans and the question of Israel. So on the one hand, you've got what you talk about, the
*  weaponization of anti-Semitism. And we also have the fact that anti-Semitism exists, and frankly, is
*  on the rise across the world. I think there's no question about that at all. There's also an
*  phenomenon. So a Jewish friend of mine, Brazilian Jewish friend of mine, who grew up in, I would
*  say, a very, very pro-Israel household, went to university and for the first time was exposed to
*  pro-Palestinian sentiments. Now, I think just basically has the same views as me on the question
*  of Palestine. But he said he got a fight or flight response. He said he felt his heart beating fast,
*  and he felt scared just by being exposed to those sentiments. And the point he was making to me is
*  that was a real emotion. People here may go, well, this has kind of been made up in
*  fact, but that's not actually... And so in Israel, as you see Simone when she's younger talking about
*  being threatened by these protesters on campus, and she said she wasn't... It was like real emotion
*  actually happening. That doesn't mean it's grounded in an actual reality. But that doesn't... You've
*  got a difficult... It's a difficult one to navigate, isn't it? When people are talking, actually,
*  they mean what they say. The emotion is actually completely real. And at the same time, you have
*  people protesting against a horrendous onslaught, which is conclusions of people whose motive is
*  not to threaten Jewish people at all. What's the answer there? How do you talk... I mean,
*  it's quite complicated. Absolutely. I think you're absolutely right. And I think you actually said it
*  very, very nicely. I mean, I think we have to distinguish between actual real discomfort. And
*  we need to take that discomfort seriously, that students may feel when they encounter ideas that
*  are anathema to the ideas or radically different from, or seemingly hostile to the ideas with which
*  they grew up. We have to distinguish between discomfort, emotional discomfort, and actual
*  harm and harassment, actionable harassment. The question of where my right to express myself
*  ends and your right to be free of harassment begins is a really difficult question to navigate,
*  which is why we have to sit in a room and talk to each other. And the university needs to listen
*  to different groups about how we think about that issue. And we need teach-ins and seminars
*  devoted to talking about those things. And that hasn't happened this year. I think you're absolutely
*  right. Part of our job as faculty is to support students who feel deep discomfort with ideas
*  that they are being exposed to on this issue, but frankly, on all kinds of other issues as well.
*  This is not the only issue that causes emotional discomfort when a group of people from very
*  different backgrounds with very different views and very different life experiences
*  come together when they are 18 to 21 years old and come together for four years. The U.S.
*  University is a curious place. The vast majority of students at Columbia and Barnard live on campus.
*  You live in these dorms. It's this very intense, frankly weird experience that is quite distinct
*  from university in other parts of the world. And for many students, it's a positively transformative
*  experience. But transformation is also really difficult and uncomfortable. So I think we need
*  to take seriously what you say about the emotional experiences of people. Those are valid, right?
*  But we can't decide free speech policy on campuses based on the emotional responses
*  of a group of students, any group of students, right? And we have to be able to distinguish
*  between discomfort and harm. And I think that we are responsible in part, we at the university
*  and in the culture are in part responsible for the moment in which we find ourselves,
*  which are putting feelings at the center of a conversation, right? We talk a lot about
*  how people feel. We talk a lot about discomfort. We talk a lot about self-care. We talk a lot about
*  wellness. And all those things are important and good. But there's also a way that we have
*  almost weaponized feelings, right? Where they become a grounds for making policy for everyone,
*  right? We saw this in COVID at a moment when we spent a lot of time in New York City in our
*  apartments, right? The threat of COVID was real. And then at some point, we had vaccines and the
*  threat receded. And there were people who didn't want to reopen the schools because they felt
*  fear. The fear was valid. The emotional response was valid, but it didn't mean that the right
*  thing was to keep schools closed forever, right? That's really well put by the way. It was such a
*  great answer to that question. So I was very, very glad to hear it. Just finally, and I just
*  wanted to circle back just finally to conclude on the question of university freedoms. I saw this
*  tweet in response to someone posting a video of NYU faculty creating a ring around guards of
*  solidarity encampment to protect their students after the school threatened mass arrest. And
*  they tweeted this person, Caitlin Flanagan, dear NYPD, please, please, please arrest these faculty
*  members. And I just shared it because the point I said, I said, have you noticed how talk of
*  council culture and free speech on campus and there was no right to be not offended and ridicule
*  of safe spaces ended over the last six months or so. But it's interesting because the right
*  use those narratives, didn't they? But what we're seeing here is the real threat is actually coming
*  from them. Yeah, I think that's true. And, you know, we've seen lots of social media about,
*  you know, these woke faculty, these, you know, pro Palestine, anti-Semitic faculty.
*  And I want to suggest that many of, you know, my colleagues are divided on this issue, right?
*  I have many, many, you know, colleagues on both sides and many people who, you know, have private
*  beliefs and they don't want to express them. You know, I frankly am really hesitant to talk about
*  at least some of these issues because I am not an expert on the Middle East. But what I am an expert
*  on is I go to work every day at this campus and I see, you know, sort of the dynamics of how academic
*  freedom and freedom of expression and freedom to protest is being sort of hemmed in, right? And this
*  is a story not just about the last week. I mean, things have exploded on campus in the last week
*  and it's become an international story. But this has been happening since the fall, right? We have
*  been engaged in frankly a conflict with our administration about rules to hem in protest,
*  to hem in free expression on the part of students. So I want to be clear that what those faculty,
*  you know, I am sure some of those faculty members who are encircling the protesters at NYU are there
*  because of their beliefs about the conflict in Gaza. And others of them are there because of
*  their beliefs about the values of the university, right? So we had a rally on campus the other day
*  that was attended by hundreds of faculty members. And when I say that, it's kind of amazing because
*  we organized it in 24 hours and faculty really can't agree on much of anything, right? It's like
*  herding cats, but we had hundreds of people out there. And, you know, the basic message of this
*  rally was unsuspend our students, right? Do not send in the NYPD. Defend academic freedom. Defend
*  the values of the university. And the university is a space for inquiry and exchange and research.
*  So in short, what I think the role of faculty today on the university is, and perhaps those
*  faculty members on NYU, is by all means participate in this critical discussion about Gaza.
*  But our job is actually an even more basic one, and that is to defend the conditions that allow
*  us to have the debate in the first place. And it is those conditions that are being threatened.
*  And if we threaten the conditions and close down the conditions that allow for debate and expression
*  and protest to happen in the first place, and protest is a form of expression, right?
*  It's not just this issue that's going to be, that is a problem. It will be all the other issues coming
*  down the pike, right? We know that there will be other heated conversations coming down the pike.
*  So I feel that my job as a faculty member is really to try to speak out to defend basic
*  conditions that have been threatened this year by all kinds of new rules coming down from our
*  administration, ranging from rules about when and where you can protest between 2 and 6 p.m.,
*  with a 24-hour notice on this particular field, to rules that prohibit students now from hanging
*  anything on their dorm room doors, right? Can't have anything on your door. Why? Because it may
*  make other people feel isolated. That is the language of the university. That's a problem,
*  right? Students, again, should be learning how to discuss and debate with one another. So rather
*  than shutting down spaces for that, we should be opening them up. And that, I think, is really
*  the story of what's going on in the university today.
*  Jason Vale 08.30 Now, it's been such a pleasure. You've put this so well, so eloquently,
*  all these nuances. I can see why you're an excellent academic. So there we go. It's really,
*  I think, shown what, I think just the underlying point, the clarity of what a university is there,
*  what it's for, and the threats to it, which I think people should be very clear about,
*  and where those threats actually come from. Nara, thank you so, so much, honestly. It's been such
*  an honour. Do share, press like, subscribe. And thanks once again.
*  Nara Hussain 08.30 Thank you. Thank you so much.
