# Israel TRASHES Lebanon 'Ceasefire' And Promises War Crimes
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [December 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0)
*  Israel is openly promising to commit war crimes in Lebanon after it repeatedly violated a ceasefire [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=0.0s)]
*  which was already a total farce to begin with. The latest assault by Israel on southern Lebanon [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=6.32s)]
*  today has killed six Lebanese people. Now Israel Katz is the current defense minister after the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=12.32s)]
*  previous defense minister Yoav Galan, a wanted man by virtue of the international criminal [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  court's arrest warrant for war crimes and crimes against humanity, was sacked for being too moderate. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=22.96s)]
*  He's declared that if the fictional ceasefire as we'll discuss collapses then Israel will no [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=28.88s)]
*  longer differentiate between Lebanon and Hezbollah. He says if the ceasefire collapses there will be [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=33.6s)]
*  no more exemption to the state of Lebanon. We will enforce the agreement with maximum impact [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=39.839999999999996s)]
*  and zero tolerance. If until now we have differentiated between Lebanon and Hezbollah [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=44.64s)]
*  that will no longer be the case. Well to be clear it's a deceit to suggest they've been making this [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=49.04s)]
*  distinction already having committed multiple war crimes and engaged in the mass slaughter of [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=55.6s)]
*  innocent civilians. What they're talking about here is an even more murderous onslaught which [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=60.72s)]
*  will inevitably kill more civilians and indeed what they're doing here is saying either you take [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=64.8s)]
*  on fight Hezbollah i.e. either you have a violent civil war in Lebanon which Lebanon has already [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=73.28s)]
*  gone through or we will come in and we will massacre you. That's the subtext. It's not even [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=79.52s)]
*  a subtext. What the Israeli foreign minister is openly doing here is committing to war crimes. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  He's saying that mass death and destruction already unleashed by Israel will be escalated. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=90.88s)]
*  War crimes are already being committed by Israel in Lebanon so what he's saying in terms of an [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=95.6s)]
*  escalation is just overtly saying far more obscene war crimes. Now given there are about a million [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=100.39999999999999s)]
*  other public statements by Israeli leaders and officials committing to perpetrating war crimes [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=105.68s)]
*  and the media has failed to frame its coverage around those statements let's not expect them [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=110.56s)]
*  to start doing so now. It is the Israeli state which trashed a ceasefire deal with Lebanon [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=114.80000000000001s)]
*  which in any case was a farce from the start. Israel is now once again bombing southern Lebanon [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=119.76s)]
*  as I've said this is after a statement by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=125.04s)]
*  also a wanted man by the international criminal court who said Hezbollah fire at Mount Dove [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=129.52s)]
*  constitutes a severe violation of the ceasefire and Israel will respond forcefully. We are [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=134.4s)]
*  determined to continue enforcing the ceasefire and will respond to every Hezbollah violation [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=138.72s)]
*  minor and major. Well even CNN a news channel which has repeatedly I would say regurgitated [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=145.04000000000002s)]
*  Israeli propaganda makes clear that this Israeli claim is a nonsense. Let's just listen to this [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=150.56s)]
*  clip. I want to be very clear though Dana that there have been continuous violations since the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=155.12s)]
*  ceasefire took effect early Wednesday morning CNN spoke to a UN peacekeeping source who says [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  that Israel has violated that ceasefire about 100 times but there are many people on both sides of [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=167.84s)]
*  this border who are desperately hoping that this doesn't escalate further and that the ceasefire [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=174.88s)]
*  prevails Dana. Israel has violated as CNN puts it there the so-called ceasefire signed on the 27th [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=180.4s)]
*  of November that six days ago 100 times according to those observers as CNN reports. I say so [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=185.68s)]
*  called ceasefire because if one side violates it 100 times in a few days that's not a ceasefire is [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=192.8s)]
*  it? If you take the word seriously that is ceasefire ceasefire not to get pedantic over [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=197.68s)]
*  meanings or anything even the US has kicked off over this. According to the Times of Israel the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=205.04000000000002s)]
*  US Special Envoy Amos Hochstein reportedly sent a message urging Israel to uphold the agreement. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=211.04s)]
*  In particular he cited Israeli drone flights over Beirut. Hebrew media cited Israeli sources as [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=217.04s)]
*  saying. Now it should be noted actually this US Special Envoy himself is a veteran of the Israeli [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=223.44s)]
*  defense forces. Now what he's saying there reported in the Israeli media is meaningless of course [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  because they don't take any meaningful action against Israel as Israel knows. It's also reported [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=235.52s)]
*  in the Israeli media that the French state which is part of the US led monetary mechanism overseeing [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  the ceasefire agreement accused Israel specifically of 52 ceasefire violations. The absolute absurdity [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=247.20000000000002s)]
*  then of some of the headlines for example the Associated Press Israeli strikes hit southern [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=252.64000000000001s)]
*  Lebanon but tense ceasefire holds Orwellian use of language. Now the reason the ceasefire deal [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=257.52s)]
*  was such a travesty is in large part because the ceasefire deal gave space for Israel to attack at [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=263.68s)]
*  will Netanyahu had declared that when it was agreed Israel would in quotes maintain full freedom of [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=268.8s)]
*  military action in Lebanon with the United States full understanding with President Biden say the [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=274.64s)]
*  same saying if Hezbollah or anyone else breaks the deal and poses a direct threat to Israel [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=279.76s)]
*  that Israel retains the right to self-defense consistent with international law. Well we've [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=284.4s)]
*  seen what this means in practice Israel's interpretation of that means in practice being [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=288.56s)]
*  able to unleash mayhem at will and disregarding international law. Now Israel also sent recorded [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=292.56s)]
*  messages across Lebanon forbidding Lebanese civilians from returning to their homes in the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=297.44s)]
*  south. We've seen in the last 40 months how crimes against humanity have been repeatedly accompanied [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=302.08s)]
*  by crimes against English language. Israeli strikes hit southern Lebanon and tense ceasefire [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=307.44s)]
*  holds are not compatible statements yet when Hezbollah say they had fired a warning defensive [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=312.0s)]
*  response after such violations that was portrayed as an aggressive attack with the subsequent Israeli [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=316.64s)]
*  strikes instead portrayed as a response for example the BBC Israel strikes Lebanon as Hezbollah [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=321.28s)]
*  targets military post. Now according to the Lebanese authorities Israel has killed around [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=327.2s)]
*  4 000 people in Lebanon that itself is more than three times the number of Israelis killed [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=332.32s)]
*  on 7th of October they've begun replicating the same sorts of heinous crimes there as they committed [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=336.79999999999995s)]
*  in Gaza for example they have damaged nearly 10 percent of Lebanon's hospitals between the in just [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=341.76s)]
*  over a year up to 27th of October this year they killed at least 175 health workers in 82 incidents [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=349.59999999999997s)]
*  in Lebanon with explosive weapons including plane and drone strikes IEDs placed inside communications [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=355.84s)]
*  devices that's according to the NGO in security insight. Now in Gaza of course they've killed over [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=361.28s)]
*  a thousand doctors and nurses this normalization of the destruction of health care slaughtering [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=367.52s)]
*  medical staff destroying hospitals things you'd imagine we would previously agree are grave war [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=372.08s)]
*  crimes now you can see here an ambulance being destroyed by Israeli soldiers of the 7th brigade [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=376.16s)]
*  who posted it gleefully on their private social media accounts. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=381.92s)]
*  This was uncovered by Eunice Terawri a Palestinian journalist who does crucial work he's compiled [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=393.84000000000003s)]
*  countless other examples like Israeli soldiers joyously setting fire to Lebanese civilian homes [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=398.56s)]
*  Israeli soldiers dressing up in the clothes of women who they've displaced or maybe even maimed [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=403.84s)]
*  or killed turning the Yaren medical clinic in southern Lebanon into a military base [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=408.64s)]
*  the use of hospitals for military purposes in other words every accusation is a confession [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=414.79999999999995s)]
*  and then there is for example the relentless destruction of religious sites some of them [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=420.79999999999995s)]
*  ancient let's have a look at this [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=424.32s)]
*  this is the mausoleum of saint peter the apostle of christ in southern Lebanon [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=446.48s)]
*  2000 years old now destroyed by Israel it's worth noting that we sometimes hear the cheerleaders [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=449.76s)]
*  of Israel discuss how Christians are persecuted in the middle east only when they point the finger [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=454.56s)]
*  at Muslims though but Israel of course drove Palestinian Christians murderously so from their [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=459.36s)]
*  homes in the Nakba which accompanied the country's foundation and they have suffered persecution [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=464.15999999999997s)]
*  occupation all the rest since as well the fact is Israel has committed grave war crimes in Lebanon [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=468.4s)]
*  it is promised to commit even greater war crimes thanks to its US patrons it had a ceasefire [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=474.56s)]
*  rigged in its favor and then systematically broke that ceasefire much of the western media [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=479.44s)]
*  will tell you otherwise but this is the truth please like and subscribe do your thoughts your [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkT8XAeDV0&t=483.36s)]
