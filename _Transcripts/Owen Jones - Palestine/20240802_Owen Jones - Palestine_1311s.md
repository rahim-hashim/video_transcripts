Video Description: Even by the standards of the attempt to silence pro-Palestinian voices, this is wild.

The University of St. Andrews has stripped the elected Rector, Stella Maris, of her roles - because she spoke out against war crimes. You have to hear this to believe it.

This cannot be allowed to stand, or others will be silenced too.

# PURGED For Opposing Israelâ€™s War Crimes
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [August 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k)
*  Well, this is absolutely wild. It's scandalous and we need to take it very seriously. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=0.0s)]
*  The rector of St Andrews University, Stella Maris, the second black female rector there, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  has been dismissed from key roles. And the reason for this is an email she sent last November, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza and condemning Israel for its crimes. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=20.0s)]
*  Now this decision comes after what is described as an independent investigation which found she had [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=24.32s)]
*  made some St Andrews students fear for their safety and by her actions and her activities [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=29.44s)]
*  breached her responsibilities and legal obligations as a member of the court of St Andrews. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=34.08s)]
*  Quite the allegations. I would say exceptionally serious allegations. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=39.36s)]
*  It must have been quite the inflammatory email. Let's have a look shall we? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=43.36s)]
*  On the 21st of November, Maris, the rector, an elected position, very important to just note [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=46.72s)]
*  this, an elected unpaid position, said a vigil had been held at the university following weeks of [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  genocidal attacks by the Israeli government against Gaza. She added, we must continue to [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=58.64s)]
*  recognise and condemn acts that are internationally regarded as humanitarian and war crimes. These [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=63.36s)]
*  include practices such as apartheid, siege, illegal occupation, collective punishment, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=69.76s)]
*  which have been observed in the treatment of Palestinians. Also, very importantly, she said, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=73.68s)]
*  it is also crucial to acknowledge and denounce the actions by Hamas that qualify as war crimes, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=80.08s)]
*  notably the taking of hostages and deliberately targeting civilians, which I have and continue [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=86.32s)]
*  to do. In response, an open letter from certain students, alumni and their families was circulated [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=91.44s)]
*  asking her to retract her remarks or resign. It said, sadly your words were not unifying but [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=97.6s)]
*  divisive, not clarifying but misleading, not hopeful but damaging, and unfortunately will only [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=103.11999999999999s)]
*  bring division and hatred whilst reinforcing a certain narrative that drives violent anti-Semitism [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=107.91999999999999s)]
*  across the world. The next sentence, well all I can say is the absolute front of the people who [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=113.68s)]
*  signed this letter. It said, we are concerned that your letter does not demonstrate equal care for [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=118.4s)]
*  Palestinian and Israeli lives. Let's be clear, the real cry of those who have been demonised, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=122.72000000000001s)]
*  hounded, victimised, silenced since this horror began has been to treat Palestinians as though [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=129.76000000000002s)]
*  their life is of equal worth. How dare these people, how dare they accuse others of not [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=135.44s)]
*  demonstrating equal care for human life. The rector rightly condemned the war crimes committed [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=139.92s)]
*  on the 7th of October in which over 1,200 overwhelmingly Israeli, some foreign residents, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  citizens as well were killed, including over 800 civilians and 36 children. By the time she wrote [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=152.0s)]
*  those words, around 14,000 Palestinians had been killed, around 6,000 children had been killed, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=157.44s)]
*  with that overall death count likely even back then likely to be a significant underestimate [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=164.96s)]
*  because for example, excluded those classified as missing, including thousands buried under rubble, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=172.24s)]
*  those killed by indirect causes which tend to be the primary cause of death overall in war, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=176.96s)]
*  problems with underreporting deaths during an unprecedented all-out military assault. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  The point too is that the massacre she rightly condemned of Israeli civilians [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=187.84s)]
*  happened on 7th of October. The massacre of Palestinians was happening at the time [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=192.32s)]
*  she was writing and is happening every single day in Gaza. She was describing an ongoing massacre [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=197.04s)]
*  which unlike 7th of October was and is being directly facilitated, supported and armed [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=202.72s)]
*  by her government. We know the British government has still failed to end arms sales to Israel. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=208.23999999999998s)]
*  A massacre that was and indeed is possible to stop by virtue of being ongoing. Indeed since then [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=213.44s)]
*  likely many tens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed. I'm sorry to say this, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=219.2s)]
*  many more Palestinians to be killed yet to come. She rightly spoke of the ongoing massacre of [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=223.67999999999998s)]
*  Palestinians which remains within our power to do something about, whilst rightly condemning the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=228.95999999999998s)]
*  massacre of Israeli civilians which took place on 7th of October. Now the statement from the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=233.6s)]
*  court of the University of St Andrews discharged the rector, Stella Maris, from the role of [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=238.16s)]
*  president of court and as charity trustee. As I say, they state this independent investigation [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=242.88s)]
*  found the following, the rector was entitled to free speech but had exercised poor judgment in [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=248.72s)]
*  the manner in which she wrote to all students to give her personal opinions on the conflict, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=252.96s)]
*  specifically ignoring the possibility that her words from a position of leadership could [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=256.64s)]
*  encourage anti-Semitic behaviour by others. Reactions to the statement from the student [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=260.32s)]
*  body were divided, some students, especially some Jewish students, were very distressed and angry [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=264.24s)]
*  and feared for their safety, while other students felt validated and heard. The resident rector's [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=268.8s)]
*  subsequent actions on social media fell below the standards required of a court member, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=274.24s)]
*  and inflamed tensions it says. Now let's take on this point about how her statement could encourage [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=278.0s)]
*  anti-Semitic behaviour. Firstly, what is the factual objection to what she said? We're talking [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=284.16s)]
*  about facts here. She denounced acts committed, genocidal acts committed by the Israeli state, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=288.4s)]
*  and acts internationally regarded as humanitarian and war crimes. Now firstly there was a case at [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=297.12s)]
*  the International Court of Justice, the highest court on earth, lodged by South Africa alleging [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=303.92s)]
*  Israel has committed genocide. It has contravened the Genocide Convention of 1948. Now the court [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=307.84s)]
*  had two main options, it could dismiss the case, it did not do so, or to place Israel [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=316.64s)]
*  essentially on trial, accepting that South Africa had a plausible case that Israel has violated the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=321.12s)]
*  Genocide Convention of 1948, which the state of Israel passed into law two years later. The [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=327.84s)]
*  president of the International Court of Justice earlier this year declared, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=333.76s)]
*  all the indicators of genocidal activities are flashing red in Gaza. On top of that, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=337.6s)]
*  there are numerous lawyers, experts, scholars, specialists who believe that genocide [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=342.24s)]
*  is taking place. Take for example, Razi Gal, the Israeli-American associate professor of Holocaust [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=345.92s)]
*  and Genocide Studies, I've interviewed him twice. And the evidence for the position taken by a whole [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=351.52s)]
*  range of scholars, lawyers, experts, is based on the countless examples of genocidal statements [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=357.44s)]
*  of intent, which legally speaking Israel has to punish. That's just one, the five crimes [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=362.96s)]
*  under the Genocide Convention. One of them is public incitement of genocide. Also, they're legally [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=367.68s)]
*  obliged to punish those statements of intent and incitement because of the ICJ's provisional rulings [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=372.88s)]
*  earlier this year. Statements of intent, incitement made by Israeli ministers, politicians, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=380.64s)]
*  army officers in general, soldiers, media outlets, public figures, enough by this point to fill a [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=385.35999999999996s)]
*  book. Now plus the mass slaughter of tens of thousands of Palestinians and the total, almost [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=390.24s)]
*  unprecedented obliteration which Gaza has experienced. They've concluded based on all [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=396.8s)]
*  that this is genocide. Now for those dissenting, I'm afraid that what that means is you have to [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=401.44s)]
*  accept that believing genocide is taking place is a legitimate opinion, where there is a huge amount [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=406.08s)]
*  of evidence to support that position. Which for example, if you were in a university and a student [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=411.76s)]
*  or academic, you could present a very compelling and legitimate argument, for example, in an essay. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=416.24s)]
*  Now as for what she said about practices such as apartheid, siege, illegal occupation, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=422.32s)]
*  collective punishment, which have been observed in the treatment of Palestinians. The International [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=426.24s)]
*  Court of Justice, again the world's top court, has just issued a ruling which condemns Israel for [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=429.92s)]
*  a, its illegal occupation, and it was the damning, the most damning possible verdict about Israel's [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=436.0s)]
*  illegal occupation possible. The longest belligerent occupation in modern history should be noted. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=442.32s)]
*  It will also be damned Israel for being guilty of the crime of apartheid. That is the legal ruling [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=447.12s)]
*  of the top court on earth. That is how the top court on earth understands international law. Now [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=452.32s)]
*  as for condemning siege and collective punishment, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=457.76s)]
*  Court has submitted requests for arrest warrants for the prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=462.4s)]
*  and his defence minister, Yov Galan, for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. Those [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=467.92s)]
*  requests centre on what is described as the imposition of a total siege over Gaza, that this [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=472.72s)]
*  total siege was part of a common plan to use starvation as a method of war and other acts of [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=478.24s)]
*  violence against the civilian population. One of the reasons for doing so, it said, was to collectively [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=483.28000000000003s)]
*  punish the civilian population of Gaza, whom they perceived as a threat to Israel. That request was [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=489.04s)]
*  specifically backed up by a panel of top lawyers, and indeed there are an overwhelming number of [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=494.64s)]
*  legal specialists in this area who hold the view that Israel has committed a whole host of war [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=500.08s)]
*  crimes. And frankly at this point, if you don't believe that, you should be treated as a contemptible [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=504.47999999999996s)]
*  atrocity denier. Now some might say, well this independent report into this rector [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=508.88s)]
*  has been put together by a lawyer. So this is an independent report put together by a lawyer, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=515.52s)]
*  by someone called Moag Ross KC. And they might go, look, Owen, mate, she's a lawyer here, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=520.08s)]
*  who the hell are you? Where's your expertise? Who to believe this Scottish lawyer, or some gobby [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=525.36s)]
*  left-wing writer with an agenda? Well firstly, it's quite difficult to judge the legal prowess [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=530.5600000000001s)]
*  of Moag Ross, because there's not very much about her. I'm sure fascinating achievements on the [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=535.12s)]
*  internet, if you want to google, please do, help me out here. Let's see what she's done. Though I [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=540.8000000000001s)]
*  read she has served as a standing junior to Scottish ministers, became a KC in 2016, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=547.92s)]
*  has played a central role in responding to government attempts to reform the regulation [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=552.24s)]
*  of the legal profession in Scotland. Well I guess the question here is who to defer to on [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=556.24s)]
*  the question of Israel's war crimes? Moag Ross KC, who specialises in the legal regulation of the [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=562.0s)]
*  Scottish Bar, a fascinating topic, I'm sure, don't get me wrong. Or the world's top court, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=569.12s)]
*  top judges, and the International Court's chief prosecutor and his panel of top lawyers, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=574.88s)]
*  eminent legal scholars, as well as specialists, academics, other scholars all over the world. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=580.7199999999999s)]
*  It's a toughie, isn't it? It's a tough one. What do you think? Moag Ross KC, deep down. Now look, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=589.04s)]
*  Moag Ross KC, your go-to expert, do give her a call on the reform of the regulation of the [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=596.64s)]
*  Scottish legal profession. Now she might go, well that's unfair, come on now. My job wasn't to [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=601.92s)]
*  adjudicate on whether or not war crimes or genocide are being committed by Israel. Yes, I take your [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=609.4399999999999s)]
*  point. I know I'm just kind of inventing a conversation here with Moag Ross KC, but you know, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=613.36s)]
*  hypothetically, if that's what you're going to say, you're right, true. But the point here is [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=620.16s)]
*  actually about whether the rector, what she said, was a legitimate defensible and indeed [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=624.9599999999999s)]

*  specialists than Moag Ross KC, specialists on all things related to regulations governing Scottish [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=635.6800000000001s)]
*  lawyers, the point is these are, suck it up, legitimate views. Now the report by Moag Ross [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=642.96s)]
*  variously says there's a clear tension between false or criticism of the Israeli position, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=649.2s)]
*  including the use of the terms genocide and apartheid, and the rector's stated objective [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=653.2800000000001s)]
*  to emphasise that people must come together and that all forms of bigotry and hatred are to be [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=657.2s)]
*  condemned and that piece is the goal. What does this mean exactly? Would she have said the same [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=661.2s)]
*  about Russian war crimes in Ukraine? After all, the Russian state and its apologists have repeatedly [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=664.5600000000001s)]
*  accused their critics of Russophobia. The scale of the atrocities being committed by the Israeli [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=670.8000000000001s)]
*  state are such that there is a broad legal consensus that serious war crimes and crimes [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=677.36s)]
*  against humanity are being committed by the Israeli state. How is stating the truth about [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=681.84s)]
*  atrocities committed against civilians en masse and indeed calling for a ceasefire, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=685.52s)]
*  undermining, condemning all forms of bigotry and ensuring peace? In, I would say, the tradition of [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=690.3199999999999s)]
*  all that has been said since this horror began, talk about Orwellian, talk about turning the world [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=696.4s)]
*  upside down. What you need to do here, sorry KC, Moag Ross to suggest, you know, what you could have [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=701.84s)]
*  done with your job, is respect which will come onto a strict demarcation between what the state [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=710.72s)]
*  of Israel does and the Jewish community, including the Jewish community here in Britain and Jewish [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=717.76s)]
*  students at St Andrews. In the same way you would not say, I would hope, that critiquing the Russian [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=724.4s)]
*  state is risking whipping up or legitimising hatred against Russian people as a whole. Now, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=732.08s)]
*  the KC even said that calling for a ceasefire is controversial. According to whom? There's been the [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=740.72s)]
*  overwhelming consensus in British opinion all the way through this horror. I'd note in mid-October, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=745.2s)]
*  not long after 7th October, the polling showed over half the population said they definitely [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=749.9200000000001s)]
*  supported an immediate ceasefire. Another 16% or so said they probably did. Do you know how [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=756.5600000000001s)]
*  many people said three, do you know how many people said, well I just gave away there, do you know how many people [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=761.76s)]
*  said that they definitely oppose an immediate ceasefire in mid-October? 3%, which is similar, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=765.28s)]
*  it's about the same as the percentage of the population who believe the earth is flat. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=771.92s)]
*  Now, I would note, given St Andrews is a Scottish university, a ceasefire was the official position [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=779.68s)]
*  of the elected Scottish government in October, weeks before the Rector made this statement. How [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=785.68s)]
*  can this esteemed KC plausibly say that echoing the official position of her own government [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=790.96s)]
*  and the overwhelming view of Scottish and British public opinion is controversial? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=797.0400000000001s)]
*  No, what should be rightly deemed controversial, KC, is using overwhelming power, including the [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=801.2800000000001s)]
*  equivalent of several Hiroshima bombs in an area the size of East London, to incinerate tens of [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=808.96s)]
*  thousands of people, including cooking children and babies under rubble who are slowly suffocated [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=814.96s)]
*  and burned to death, one or the other or both, or, I don't know, supporting an onslaught which [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=821.2s)]
*  leads to newborn babies having their limbs amputated without anaesthetic, or, I don't know, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=827.6s)]
*  starving an entire population until they die as their internal organs are digested by their [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=833.36s)]
*  emaciated bodies, or, I don't know, the fact that the entire healthcare system has been obliterated, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=840.16s)]
*  imposing a daily death sentence on everyone from cancer patients to pregnant women. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=847.68s)]
*  Do you know what? I actually think, just in terms of the mass obliteration of Gaza, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=852.0s)]
*  the mass slaughter of tens of thousands of people, including some academics believe that already [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=857.28s)]
*  a large chunk of Gaza's population has been violently exterminated. Why isn't that the [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=863.4399999999999s)]
*  controversial view? Why is opposing that, when that's actually the overwhelming view of British [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=868.64s)]
*  public and Scottish public opinion, and indeed the Scottish government, why is that controversial? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=873.36s)]
*  The world turned on its head. Madness. Now, just to emphasise this, according to the latest poll [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=878.16s)]
*  by YouGov, 68% of Britons believe there should be an immediate ceasefire, with 13% the controversial [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=884.08s)]
*  view supporting Israel's continued onslaught, and even when she wrote this email, 59% spiked [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=889.6s)]
*  to ceasefire, and 19% supported a continued onslaught overall. Now, the same poll found 70% [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=895.12s)]
*  Israel has committed war crimes. 70% of the British public. I mean, there's a chunk who don't know. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=903.04s)]
*  The vast majority of the British public believe Israel has committed war crimes. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=913.84s)]
*  People who don't think that are farcically deluded and apologists for atrocities. I mean, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=917.52s)]
*  we should just be clear, they're the ones who should be answering questions. They're the ones [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=924.24s)]
*  who should be resigning. They're the ones who should be stripped of their jobs, if anyone should [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=929.12s)]
*  hear. People who actually support mass violence and who justify and deny war crimes. 54% of the [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=932.48s)]
*  population believe that the ICC should issue arrest warrants against Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=940.5600000000001s)]
*  Do you know how many percent, do you know what percentage of the British population oppose [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=945.28s)]
*  issuing an arrest warrant? Arresting Netanyahu? 15%. That is a fringe view. Let's just be clear. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=948.32s)]
*  That is a fringe opinion. Over half the population believe Netanyahu should be arrested [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=957.28s)]
*  by our police forces if he steps on UK soil. That's what you go says. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=962.08s)]
*  Now, this pie is truly outrageous. The KC draws a conclusion that there is room for an argument [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=966.08s)]
*  that the rector's statement might directly or indirectly encourage the expression of anti-Semitism [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=971.28s)]
*  by others simply because there is the possibility that people interpret and misinterpret language [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=977.04s)]
*  all the time. She further draws a conclusion that it was reasonable to think that Ms. Maris' [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=982.48s)]
*  statement was bound to contribute to an increase in anti-Semitic activity in St. Andrews. What, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=986.8s)]
*  excuse me, what is being argued here? Let's just be clear, is the trashing of the demarcation, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=992.56s)]
*  which should be a sacred demarcation, between the Israeli state, the war crimes committed by the [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=997.5999999999999s)]
*  Israeli state, and the Jewish people, including the Jewish people who live here. British Jewish [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1003.44s)]
*  people. Jewish Scots. Now look, the official position on anti-Semitism adopted by the British [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1011.6s)]
*  government amongst others, the IHRA definition, has proven deeply controversial because of two [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1018.08s)]
*  of the examples which many argue stifle free speech on the question of Israel and Palestine. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1022.72s)]
*  But there is the final example included in this definition is one everyone who opposes [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1027.76s)]
*  anti-Semitism should agree on. It says, holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1032.4s)]
*  the state of Israel is anti-Semitism. That is absolutely true. Absolutely incontrovertibly [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1037.52s)]
*  true. If you attack Jewish people for what the state of Israel is doing, then you are being [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1041.8400000000001s)]
*  anti-Semitic. And that by definition cuts both ways. The implication being made by this case [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1045.0400000000002s)]
*  is that criticising the state, the actions of the state of Israel, may threaten the safety and [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1050.5600000000002s)]
*  security of Jewish students. And to be clear, it is all of our responsibility to make sure that does [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1055.2s)]
*  not happen. How does the KC not see that she has made that harder by making a direct link [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1060.88s)]
*  between holding the Israeli state accountable for its war crimes and the security of Jewish students? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1066.16s)]
*  Now the report literally suggests that the statement, although is not itself anti-Semitic, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1072.3200000000002s)]
*  risks generating anti-Semitic sentiment. By that standard, what is she saying? You can't say [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1077.8400000000001s)]
*  anything about the state of Israel because nefarious racist actors will manipulate what you say. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1083.44s)]
*  Is that seriously where we are at? Where else does she want to go with that? If I condemn [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1088.24s)]
*  the Saudi dictatorship for beheading gay people and beheading dissidents, that could be taken up [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1095.1999999999998s)]
*  by Islamophobes. No question. They absolutely could run with that. But would you think that is [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1102.9599999999998s)]
*  a legitimate reason for saying that I shouldn't denounce the Saudi regime and its human rights [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1108.9599999999998s)]
*  abuses? Or would you say that the correct position is that you should absolutely condemn [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1112.64s)]
*  the heinous human rights abuses committed by the Saudi regime and stand unequivocally against [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1118.16s)]
*  Islamophobia and attempt to collectively blame Muslim people as a whole for what the Saudi [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1124.3200000000002s)]
*  dictatorship does in the name of Islam? Now strikingly, the KC said dismissal would not [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1128.88s)]
*  be a proportionate response. To be clear, the Rector has an unpaid role. She's there to be a [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1134.0800000000002s)]
*  voice for students. And it's her contention in line with what we know of the polling of public [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1138.0s)]
*  opinion that she reflects the view of an overwhelming majority of students. And in a statement, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1142.56s)]
*  she notes the legal rulings that I've cited. The university court dismissed her from her roles [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1147.2s)]
*  because while allowing her to keep her title because she refused to accept the conclusion [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1152.88s)]
*  of this investigation. Well, good, absolutely correct. I'm glad she did that. She should not [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1158.08s)]
*  back down. Actually, I didn't mean pretty angrily. She had. It would not only be ludicrous to back [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1161.28s)]
*  down, it would be dangerous because there is a deliberate attempt to stifle and silence voices [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1165.6s)]
*  speaking out against one of the worst horrors of our time. If she gave in, that would strengthen [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1169.1999999999998s)]
*  that attempt. The Rector also says the university gave me no opportunity to present my case or to [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1175.1999999999998s)]
*  have someone represent me in the discussions that led to this decision for reasons that only the [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1180.0s)]
*  court will be able to explain. The university has chosen to go further than the report written by [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1184.08s)]
*  Morag Ross, which I believe is biased, but which explicitly falls short of calling for the removal [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1188.56s)]
*  of my trusty status. Well, this is a total farce. Remember all those free speech warriors who said [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1193.76s)]
*  free speech threatened on campus? Remember them? Well, they've gone awfully quiet, haven't they? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1198.8s)]
*  I say quiet, often the ones leading this witch hunt. After trying to get answers from the [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1203.36s)]
*  University of St. Andrews, who seemed completely unprepared for the firestorm, which was rightly [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1207.44s)]
*  ignited by this outrageous decision dragging a young black woman through the mud for opposing [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1211.84s)]
*  war crimes and genocide and apartheid with the overwhelming evidence which she can cite to just [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1218.88s)]
*  fire position. Well, anyway, a university court spokesperson gave me this following statement. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1225.1200000000001s)]
*  The university course decision has no bearing on the Rector's freedom of speech, which has been [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1230.48s)]
*  acknowledged by the court at every stage. We have engaged extensively with Miss Maris in recent [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1233.92s)]
*  months, but were unfortunately unable to agree on fundamental issues of university and charity [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1238.8000000000002s)]
*  governance. It is important to stress that Miss Maris remains a Rector of University of St. London, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1243.2s)]
*  University of St. Andrews, until the end of her term in 2026 and we will continue to provide [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1248.72s)]
*  whatever assistance she requires to undertake that role. Well, I'll let you decide what to make of [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1252.48s)]
*  that given the arguments I have presented. There has long been an attempt to just drive from public [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1256.8799999999999s)]
*  life anyone who sympathises with the Palestinian people and since the 7th of October, rocket [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1262.48s)]
*  boosters have been placed under that campaign. Well, let's be clear, we are talking about one of [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNEVkmP367k&t=1267.4399999999998s)]
