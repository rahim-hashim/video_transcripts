# Israel Has Been DEFEATED. A Total Defeat - Israeli Newspaper's Shocking Admission
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhDQBti3YeM)
*  Saying what can't be said, Israel has been defeated. A total defeat. These are my words.
*  This is the headline of a piece in the Israeli newspaper, Haaretz, written by Israeli journalist
*  Chaim Levinson. Now the subheading is, the war's aims won't be achieved, the hostages
*  won't be returned through military pressure, security won't be restored, and Israel's
*  international ostracism won't end. Well, that's basic common sense, isn't it? And
*  the fact that in any way that's controversial shows what a total mess we're currently
*  in. Not just the role of Israel, but also Western elites and indeed much of the Western
*  media. This is a piece of crucial importance because its argument really is at the core
*  of what's actually happening right now. Not least, of course, the desperate attempts
*  by the Israeli state to incite a wider war with Iran. It also offers a very interesting
*  insight into Israeli psychology at the moment. Now, this journal starts by saying, we've
*  lost. Truth must be told. The inability to admit it encapsulates everything you need
*  to know about Israel's individual and mass psychology. There's a clear, sharp, predictable
*  reality that we should begin to fathom, to process, to understand, and to draw conclusions
*  from for the future. It's no fun to admit that we've lost, so we lie to ourselves.
*  Now, he goes on to blame the country being held hostage by the worst leadership in its
*  history, pointing out that every military undertaking is supposed to have a diplomatic
*  exit with the military action leading to a better diplomatic reality, but Israel has
*  no such diplomatic exit. Now, Benjamin Netanyahu in the piece is clearly chief villain. He's
*  denounced as a scoundrel of a leader with no capacity for leadership or decision making,
*  he does note the journalist that the Israeli electorate obviously put him in power. It
*  bemoans what could have been a short, powerful, aggressive, it suggests, eminently justified
*  campaign that goes on to quickly veto Hamas with, well, we'll talk about that, with a coalition
*  of countries then carrying out reconstruction with a new viable alternative to Hamas being created,
*  whatever that actually would mean in practical terms isn't made clear. He goes on to describe
*  what he clearly believes to be mass delusion, that with just a little more time and with a
*  little more effort, the hostages will be released, Hamas will surrender and Yaya
*  Sinwar, sorry, Yaya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas will be killed, summing up the mood as after all
*  were the good guys and good will triumph, throwing in the imminent implosion of the Iranian regime
*  as another example. He believes that there may never be a safe return to the northern border of
*  Israel, thanks to Hezbollah in Lebanon, that not all hostages will return either alive or dead,
*  the whereabouts of some will remain unknown, while every Iranian threat will make Israelis
*  tremble, Israel's standing has been dealt a beating, he says, with the world no longer seeing
*  Israel as a strong country, a wise people or powerful army. He even writes that Israel is
*  a shuttle, that is a small town with an air force, and that's on the condition that it's awakened in
*  time. He goes on to predict that an onslaught of Rafah is essentially a mirage or a bluff that
*  will never properly happen despite repeated promises, except maybe a limited excursion
*  passed off as something else, we'll see about that, I'm not so sure personally, but a few things
*  here. Now clearly the Israelis say it has suffered a colossal strategic defeat, no question about
*  that. If you had been told six months earlier that at this point in April, Israel would still be
*  fighting in Gaza, that it would not have retrieved huge numbers of the hostages who had been seized,
*  that Hamas had not in any meaningful sense been defeated even close, you'd have rightly concluded
*  that clearly things were going to go disastrously wrong on the terms set by Israel. Now firstly in
*  terms of the hostages, and again let's be clear, and I've always been clear, that taking hostages
*  is a grave war crime for which there is no defects. Now the Israeli state has killed more hostages
*  than it's rescued, it's believed 253 hostages in total were taken on the 7th of October, overwhelmingly
*  Israeli but some foreign citizens. We don't actually know how many hostages the IDF has killed,
*  we know it's killed at least three directly, it has been fired upon, they were waving white flags,
*  screaming in Hebrew, clearly unarmed and indeed underlining that Palestinian civilians have no
*  chance whatsoever. Of the remaining hostages, 34 are believed to have been killed. Now we don't
*  know the circumstances of how each of those hostages were killed, but I would note for example
*  that when Yossi Sharibi, one of the hostages, was reported back in January to being killed in an IDF
*  strike, it was widely denounced as a false claim by Hamas that Hamas had actually must have killed
*  him, but when attention moved on a few weeks later the IDF stated they'd probably killed him in an
*  airstrike. That's classic Israeli state by the way, you just kind of muddy the waters, deflects,
*  and then when attention's moved on the truth comes out and you hope no one notices. Now Gaza has been
*  carpet bombed, tens of thousands of Palestinians are believed to have suffered hideous violent
*  deaths as a consequence, excluding those killed for example because of a lack of the basics of life,
*  because of the Israeli siege as well as the destruction of the healthcare system.
*  So statistically speaking it is obviously inevitable that some hostages will have been
*  killed by Israeli ammunition. Now in terms of hostages safely returned to their loved ones
*  in Israel, four were released by Hamas unilaterally while 105 were released because of a ceasefire and
*  a prisoner exchange deal. So clearly the hostages were never going to be rescued by military means,
*  that was always a lie and continues to be a lie. It needed a ceasefire and negotiation
*  and that meant releasing those described by the courageous Israeli journalist who also writes for
*  Haaretz Gideon Levy as Israel's own hostages, then being released as well. Huge numbers of Palestinians
*  held without charge including kids and before the 7th of October the charity Save the Children
*  reported the physical and sexual abuse of child detainees by the Israeli military authorities.
*  Conditions for these prisoners are so catastrophic that having been chained up for so long some have
*  had their limbs amputated. Save the Children again have reported that since this horror all began
*  kids have been detained without cause, suffering hideous violent beatings, no medical care,
*  prevented from speaking to parents. Last December is just one example, the 14 year old Palestinian
*  boy Salim was released after months of detention after being arrested for throwing stones at an
*  illegal settlement. By mid-March well over 7,000 Palestinians have been arrested in the West Bank
*  alone with over 3,000 held without charge with huge and overwhelming evidence of torture,
*  ill-treatment. In many cases families not even being told about the whereabouts of their loved
*  ones. Sounds a lot like hostage taking doesn't it? Now in terms of Hamas being undefeated,
*  well you cannot defeat an idea. As the Guardian reports this week, and Hamas remains in de facto
*  control over swathes of Gaza including where much of Gaza's population is concentrated.
*  Few of its top leaders have been harmed, much of its tunnel network is intact. It does add the
*  organisation's ability to effectively govern is much reduced, its military stores are depleted
*  and thousands of fighters are dead. But even Israel's estimates are only a third of Hamas's
*  pre-war 30,000 to 40,000 having been killed. Hamas claim much lower, we don't know the truth.
*  What we do know is that the Haaretz again debunked Israel's claims of 9,000 Hamas militants being
*  killed since it all began on the grounds that Israel counted the killing of anyone who crosses
*  an invisible line as being a Hamas terrorist which they do after the event. That in practice means
*  huge and unknown numbers of civilians. Now it needs as the Guardian adds,
*  independent confirmation of either claim is not possible but many analysts say the emphasis on
*  the killed count revealed a failure among Israeli strategists to understand the nature of the enemy.
*  The very straightforward problem here is you just, again I keep saying it, you can't kill an idea.
*  The Palestinian people like any other people on earth are never going to accept being occupied
*  by hostile power. It's not going to happen. They'll never accept their land being stolen
*  and settled on, colonised by hostile power. It's never going to happen and they're never going to
*  accept being butchered and maimed by a foreign power. It is what it is. Now the latest polling
*  of Palestinians across Gaza and the West Bank suggests Hamas will win 60% of the vote compared
*  to 28% for Fatah which rules in the West Bank presently. Bear in mind Hamas won 45% of the vote
*  in the last 2006 legislative elections. This is totally predictable. Hamas has obviously been
*  strengthened amongst the population which has suffered a genocidal war. Clearly they were never
*  going to militarily defeat Hamas. It's just a lie from the beginning and they're not completely
*  stupid. They surely knew this which is why you enter from genocidal territory. That's the truth.
*  That's why the Israeli state clearly just wants to rid Gaza of the Palestinian people
*  and that must by necessity mean genocidal behaviour because people don't want to leave their homes
*  now in terms of killing Hamas militants as though that's a static number obviously a number of
*  those who've watched their loved ones being blown apart by Israeli weapons are going to take up arms
*  they're going to want to fight for the rest of their lives in some cases. The naivety in this
*  article is the argument there could ever have been some form of military victory that there was an
*  other form of military victory that was possible. What's happened instead is public opinion in the
*  states which Israel depends on has dramatically shifted against it. In the United States where
*  criticism of Israel frankly for a long time is practically regarded as beyond the pale,
*  polling now shows that 55 percent disapprove of the Israeli military onslaught with just 36
*  approving. More Americans than not believe genocide has been committed by Israel. In the UK
*  a poll two months ago found 61 percent of voters have an unfavourable view of Israel with 20 percent
*  having a favourable view. That's the lowest level ever recorded in terms of being favourable for
*  Israel ever. Now I doubt things have improved since mid-February DU. This matters because
*  something's got to give. Voters are increasingly going to turn against the unequivocal support
*  their governments have given to Israel. Now at the same time it talks about the lack of security
*  for Israel this article. Well again, I mean that won't change. That won't change for the basic
*  underlying problem which is the suffering of the Palestinian people. I can't want to that. Look,
*  I mean the problem with the article is it suggests this is basically on Netanyahu.
*  Are you sure Bouguiman to have to be sure? This is inevitably where the logic of settler
*  colonialism and the underlying dehumanisation it requires takes you. The polling of Jewish
*  Israeli voters, I separate that out because polling of Palestinian citizens of Israel make
*  up about a fifth of the population, yields very different results, but that polling shows huge
*  numbers. Don't you think the Israeli military have even gone far enough and 60 percent oppose
*  any humanitarian aid to Gaza at all? You can't pin that all on Netanyahu. That obviously means
*  in practice, if you end all humanitarian aid, that just means killing everyone with starvation.
*  The article also doesn't engage with the fact they will never be peace until the oppression
*  of Palestinians end, the occupation ends, the deprivation of their rights and national
*  determination ends. That will always be the root cause of continued violence. So this idea of
*  when would security, we'll never get security back, well no. And we do need a lasting peace
*  in which the land is shared with the basis of equality and justice by Palestinians and Israeli
*  citizens. Whatever end form that takes, it's something I'm entirely pragmatic on, it's not
*  for me to dictate it, is it really? It's up to the peoples there to decide it together,
*  but not on the basis of the Palestinian people having no actual proper say. That oppression has
*  to end. And what that form takes, a confederation is one idea, I mean it could be two states,
*  the danger of two states is you end up basically with bantu stands like you had in South Africa,
*  so-called homeland setup for the black population, which were just hideously deprived of the ability
*  to exist as obviously in any reasonable sense a nation state. A confederation is one way to
*  square the circle, but again it's not for me. British colonials sitting around drawing up the
*  maps of the world in their living rooms is one of the many reasons why the mess went in globally.
*  But you know, there will never ever be security without peace, that's the truth. Where I do agree
*  with the article is the Israeli state has suffered a catastrophic defeat, which is why it's
*  manufactured a confrontation with Iran by bombing the consulate in Damascus and setting off a chain
*  of events which threatens a massive regional or indeed global war. So we're all at risk now because
*  of the calamity that Israel has brought upon itself. That has to be resisted because the
*  potential consequences are too catastrophic to even contemplate.
