# Israel's Nasrallah Assassination - More Horror Beckons w/. Palestinian Analyst Mouin Rabbani
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [September 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4)
*  Now we've seen the hideous escalation by the Israeli state, obviously in Lebanon, the mass [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=0.0s)]
*  slaughter of literally countless Lebanese civilians. We have absolutely no idea how many have been [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=5.84s)]
*  just kept murdered, slaughtered in the latest violence unleashed by the Israeli state in Beirut, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=12.16s)]
*  but also elsewhere. That's obviously on top of the vast numbers of Palestinians who've been [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  butchered now for what is almost exactly a year since this genocidal onslaught began. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=23.36s)]
*  The focus is of course on the killing of Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah. What we're [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=29.12s)]
*  going to talk about today, we've got the best possible person to speak to about this, Muin [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=36.24s)]
*  Rabini. Many of you will know, we chatted with Muin, I think a few back in earlier this year, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=39.68s)]
*  it's happened since. The brilliant co-editor of Jadaliyah, a Middle East analyst, a Palestinian [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=45.6s)]
*  Dutch analyst, and one of the best analysts you'll find. I know many journalists who actually [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=52.88s)]
*  want an informed take on this will, whenever something happens, go straight to check out [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=60.56s)]
*  Muin's brilliant Twitter threads often, which go into great detail about the latest developments. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=64.56s)]
*  How are you doing in these difficult times? Firstly, great to see you. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=69.84s)]
*  Oh, and it's good to be with you and thanks for inviting me. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=73.04s)]
*  I just want to start actually with what isn't being focused on at the moment in the headlines [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=77.04s)]
*  of the BBC, various Western newspapers, and that is the countless deaths, the killings, sorry, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=82.64s)]
*  they didn't just die and fall over, did they? The dropping of bonds on entire apartment blocks [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=90.4s)]
*  full of huge numbers of Lebanese civilians. Just your thoughts on that and the way that's [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=97.76s)]
*  being discussed or not discussed, portrayed in the analysis that we can see of the latest developments. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=103.6s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think it's a very pertinent question. According to Israeli reports, 85 tons [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=109.2s)]
*  of high explosives were dropped within the space of seconds on Beirut yesterday, the Lebanese [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=117.36s)]
*  capital, on one city block, essentially in order to assassinate one man and those who were with him. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=126.48s)]
*  And in the 24 hours since, there were, I believe, between 30 and 50 additional massive air raids [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=137.52s)]
*  on Beirut, its southern suburbs, not even taking into account further massive air raids on [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=146.56s)]
*  on Tire, on the Beka Valley, on other areas of Lebanon. I don't have the exact figures, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=154.88000000000002s)]
*  but it's probably a safe assumption that in the past 24 hours, Israel has dropped more high [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=160.72s)]
*  explosives on Beirut than it did during the entirety of the 1982 invasion of Lebanon, or arguably even [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=168.08s)]
*  the 2006 assault on Lebanon. Now, what's interesting in the coverage of this, of course, is that [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=176.64s)]
*  Hezbollah is held responsible for having its central command headquarters in the Lebanese capital [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=185.2s)]
*  Beirut. And this is then used as a pretext to claim that Hezbollah is using the civilian [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=191.92s)]
*  population as human shields, and therefore bears responsibility for the massive casualty toll that [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=200.56s)]
*  was produced yesterday. I think something like six or seven apartment buildings containing dozens [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=208.23999999999998s)]
*  of homes were leveled to the ground. Well, yes, Hezbollah has established its headquarters [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=213.6s)]
*  in Beirut, but my response to that would be, is there really any instance in history where [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=222.95999999999998s)]
*  a movement or a state or a state within the state or however you want to describe it, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  establishes its headquarters on an isolated hilltop away from its core constituency or the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=237.04s)]
*  center of its political weight? I mean, is Israel's Ministry of Defense in the heart of Tel Aviv or in [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=245.51999999999998s)]
*  Cyprus? Is Britain's Ministry of Defense and its entire security headquarters, is it based in London [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=251.76s)]
*  or on some field with nothing but sheep and whales? I mean, this is, you know, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=261.28s)]
*  this is how militaries have behaved historically. And to then twist this around and saying, well, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=269.12s)]
*  they're deliberately placing it in the heart of civilian areas in order to use a civilian [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=275.52s)]
*  population as human shield is a bit rich. There are compelling reasons why every military organization [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=281.28s)]
*  places its headquarters at the center, let's say, of its political structure. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=291.28s)]
*  I mean, the IDF's headquarters in Tel Aviv surrounded people, note by shopping malls and [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=299.84s)]
*  apartment blocks. Yes, and if I may interrupt, I would argue again here, you know, whether it's [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=304.88s)]
*  the Israelis or Hezbollah or Hamas in Gaza or, you know, any other states around the globe, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=311.44s)]
*  this isn't a deliberate strategy to use the civilian population as human shields. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=318.32s)]
*  This is how states and organizations operate. You know, they have nerve centers, they have [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=325.68s)]
*  capital cities, they place their most important institutions within those geographical areas. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=333.12s)]
*  It's almost a law of nature. In 1982, you mentioned the Israeli invasion back in 1982. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=341.6s)]
*  And back then, the right-wing Republican President Ronald Reagan got on the phone to the then Israeli [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=351.20000000000005s)]
*  Prime Minister Menachem Begin to protest against what he called a Holocaust and demanded the [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=358.8s)]
*  cessation of those attacks, which actually, I mean, obviously, Israel continued to commit [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=364.8s)]
*  terrible atrocities in Lebanon, but in that particular instance, they called off those [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=370.56s)]
*  specific attacks. You also got the massacre of Shabla Shatiyah and up to three and a half thousand [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=375.52s)]
*  Lebanese and Palestinians were butchered in the most, some of the most heinous, imaginable violence [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=381.12s)]
*  depravity, which Ariel Sharon, the Defense Minister, was later found culpable of. It was [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=386.56s)]
*  committed by his allies, of course, by an Israeli commission. Huge numbers of Israelis at the time [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=392.96s)]
*  took to the streets. I suppose what I'm talking about is it's just this degradation of the worth [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=398.0s)]
*  of Arab life. I mean, we have a Democratic President Joe Biden, I mean, somehow he's barely [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=403.92s)]
*  functioning, but I mean, in the here and now, if you compare to 1982, we're seeing actually worse [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=409.76s)]
*  violence, worse atrocities, more mass slaughter. And yet the way that's portrayed in the media and [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=415.84s)]
*  the response of our political leaders, well, there's quite a contrast, actually, I would say. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=422.56s)]
*  Yes, and it's an interesting anecdote for more than one reason. As you mentioned, in 1982, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=428.0s)]
*  the US President at the time, Ronald Reagan, called Menachem Begin, the Israeli Prime Minister, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=436.32s)]
*  and protested about after seeing, you know, according to the conventional narration of this [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=442.88s)]
*  incident, after seeing pictures of dismembered, badly burned Palestinian children in Beirut, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=449.52s)]
*  he called Begin and told him this Holocaust has to end now. Begin, of course, vociferously protested, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=456.64s)]
*  we're the only victims here and so on. But then within 24 hours, the bombing stopped. But this was [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=463.59999999999997s)]
*  not the result of Reagan suddenly discovering a conscience upon seeing all those images of [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=471.2s)]
*  Palestinian civilian victims of Israel's terror bombing. What actually happened is that the Saudi [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=479.2s)]
*  Crown Prince at the time, Prince Fahd, called Reagan and basically told him that the Arab states [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=485.76s)]
*  were coming under increasing pressure because of their alliance with the United States and needed [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=494.0s)]
*  to see some form of intervention by Washington. And it was in that context that Reagan felt he [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=500.4s)]
*  had to act. And of course, the important difference between 1982 and 2023-2024 is the [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=508.48s)]
*  complete absence of the Arab states. They have played the role of impotent spectators. They have [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=517.76s)]
*  not even withdrawn ambassadors. Those who have diplomatic relations with Israel have not [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=527.84s)]
*  reconsidered their ties with Israel's extreme right-wing government and so on. And so I think [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=533.2s)]
*  when you want to compare then and now, we have to look not only at what Washington did, but also [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=541.0400000000001s)]
*  why it acted. And that, I think, is an important distinction. Your second point, I think, is [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=548.5600000000001s)]
*  entirely correct. We were just talking about the terror bombing of Beirut yesterday, which comes [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=554.5600000000001s)]
*  on top of a year of genocidal violence, a genocidal campaign by Israel in the Gaza Strip, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=562.16s)]
*  and levels of violence against the population of the West Bank that we haven't seen since the [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=570.24s)]
*  second Intifada. And I think the important point here is that it has been completely normalized. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=577.28s)]
*  We wake up to this day in and day out for an entire year now. And you look at Western leaders, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=584.0799999999999s)]
*  Western media, and so on, and it's all placed within the framework of Israel defending itself, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=592.9599999999999s)]
*  Israel's right to defend itself. So there may be an excess here or there, but ultimately, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=600.4s)]
*  it's all legitimate and justified because it is taking place not within the framework of Israel [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=606.96s)]
*  being a supremacist apartheid state that is engaging in genocide and aggression in order to [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=614.96s)]
*  consolidate its permanent control over those under its subjugation, but rather it is Israel [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=622.4s)]
*  being illegitimately attacked for irrational reasons by radical terrorists [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=629.76s)]
*  and therefore engaging in a legitimate campaign of self-defense. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=636.0s)]
*  Jason Vale Let's just talk about the significance of the [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=639.92s)]
*  killing of Hassan Nasrallah, who was, of course, the Secretary General of Hezbollah and has been [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=645.04s)]
*  since 1992 when his predecessor, Abbas al-Masari, was killed, assassinated by the Israeli state. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=649.44s)]
*  I think in that question with those details kind of helps answer the question really, doesn't it? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=659.6s)]
*  But I think what is the significance of, I mean, this is undoubtedly, I mean, on top of the [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=665.7600000000001s)]
*  pager attacks, which should be rightly seen as a form of terrorism themselves, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=672.0s)]
*  clearly a big blow to Hezbollah. But how significant is it in the longer term? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=676.88s)]
*  How much does it change the dynamics? What are your thoughts? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=682.7199999999999s)]
*  Abbas al-Masari It's a massive blow. And I think even though, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=684.88s)]
*  I think it would be fair to say that Nasrallah always expected to die this way, that it has [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=690.88s)]
*  happened. And it's happened at this particular historical juncture is extraordinarily significant. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=699.36s)]
*  And again, this is not, as you suggested, this is not an assassination that has taken place in [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=706.3199999999999s)]
*  isolation from what we've seen in the past month. I mean, since late July until now, late September, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=713.68s)]
*  Israel has effectively decapitated Hezbollah, has managed to assassinate most of its most [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=723.76s)]
*  senior military and political leaders. It has essentially quite successfully paralyzed [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=731.92s)]
*  the organization. It's therefore an absolutely massive blow to the organization that will take [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=740.16s)]
*  considerable time for it to recover from. Having said that, Hezbollah is not a small militia. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=746.4s)]
*  It's a very deeply entrenched and sophisticated organization that has been decades in the making. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=755.04s)]
*  And I think one reason that this series of assassinations culminating in the killing of [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=762.0799999999999s)]
*  its general secretary, one reason it's so significant is because part of Hezbollah's aura [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=770.0s)]
*  in recent years has been its counterintelligence capabilities. And compared to similar movements [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=776.64s)]
*  in the region, it's the perception that it was somehow very effective at preventing Israeli [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=784.8s)]
*  espionage and Israeli infiltration and so on. And so that doubles, let's say the significance of [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=791.52s)]
*  these latest blows. But Hezbollah was decades in the making. It would take years of much more [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=799.36s)]
*  intensive efforts to dismantle it. And I think we need to look at this in several contexts. First is [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=806.56s)]
*  Israel's determination to de-link Lebanon from Gaza. And what it is seeking to do is to punish [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=815.12s)]
*  and weaken Hezbollah to the extent that it capitulates and renounces its support for the [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=825.12s)]
*  Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, renounces what it calls its support front. And I think that these [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=831.2s)]
*  assassinations will make that more difficult rather than more easy to achieve. The second [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=837.44s)]
*  is that I think Israel, well, let me put it this way. If you accept that on the 7th of October of [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=844.08s)]
*  last year, Hamas launched its offensive into southern Israel in order to irrevocably shatter [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=851.68s)]
*  the status quo. Israel's campaign since then has been not to restore the status quo that existed on [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=858.3199999999999s)]
*  the 6th of October, but rather to fundamentally transform the strategic equation in the Middle [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=867.52s)]
*  East. And part of that is not only de-linking Lebanon from Gaza, but dealing a mortal blow [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=873.36s)]
*  to Hezbollah as an organization so that it is no longer a significant military factor [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=882.08s)]
*  in the Middle East. And beyond that, to also find a way to administer a very significant blow [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=887.36s)]
*  against Iran. And I think for Israel, the road to Tehran leads through the southern suburbs of [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=895.52s)]
*  Beirut. And what it is hoping to do here is not just to hit Hezbollah, but to find a way to [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=902.88s)]
*  provoke the direct involvement of Iran into this conflict in a manner that can also produce a [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=910.3199999999999s)]
*  direct military confrontation between the United States and Iran. Whether this will succeed or not [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=918.4s)]
*  is difficult to say, but getting back to Hezbollah, I think its command has been either eliminated [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=925.84s)]
*  or paralyzed, but it has a very deep bench. And I suspect it will fairly quickly be able to [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=934.56s)]
*  regenerate the leadership. It will be a new generation of leadership. And as Ali Hashem, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=942.0s)]
*  the correspondent of Al Jazeera, based in Lebanon, who knows the organization quite well, has pointed [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=948.32s)]
*  out, Nasrallah was known as a strategic thinker, as someone who was playing the long game. And he [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=954.0s)]
*  may well now be replaced by a generation that is more fixated on revenge for the losses that it has [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=961.84s)]
*  suffered in the past several months. And I'd also like to, you know, in terms of Nasrallah himself, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=970.96s)]
*  he was, of course, an iconic, charismatic figure who had kind of a deep personal bond, if you will, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=979.0400000000001s)]
*  with his constituents, the type of historical leader that's going to be very difficult [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=987.12s)]
*  to replace. One could compare him, for example, to Jamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, or Yasser Arafat's [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=994.48s)]
*  role within the Palestinian movement. And here I would point out that the loss of Nasr was a [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1001.36s)]
*  devastating loss to Egypt, obviously, when it happened in 1970. And he was replaced by Anwar [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1009.6s)]
*  Arsadat, who Kissinger, for once rightly, denounced as a clown. But even this didn't prevent [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1017.6s)]
*  Egypt from three years later successfully crossing the Suez Canal. So yes, assassinations are painful, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1026.32s)]
*  but the idea that these tactical successes can be transformed into strategic developments, I think, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1033.52s)]
*  will prove to be a mistaken assumption. And in fact, we could see the precedent, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1046.16s)]
*  of course, mission accomplished style, triumphalism in Iraq, Afghanistan, in Libya. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1050.0s)]
*  And also, I suppose, I mean, in the case of Hezbollah, I mean, you know, you got to begin [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1054.48s)]
*  with based on the subjugation of the Palestinian people, the birth of the PLO, the invasion of [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1059.44s)]
*  Lebanon, then Hezbollah then, of course, emerges from that. But at that point, Hezbollah, a lot [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1063.3600000000001s)]
*  of people in the West often don't realize it has this base within Lebanese society, it's in the [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1070.0s)]
*  government, it's in a coalition government, it has two ministries. And so it's this idea, again, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1075.6s)]
*  that you just cut off the top or the key kind of top leadership of an organization, as if that will [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1080.08s)]
*  then lead to its destruction. And actually, as you suggest, history suggests more radical elements [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1087.84s)]
*  often end up coming to the top. Well, and let's take another example, Islamic Jihad, Palestinian [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1092.56s)]
*  Islamic Jihad, it was a fairly small movement that was also led by a charismatic leader, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1100.64s)]
*  Fatih Shkaki. He was assassinated in Malta in 1995. And Israel, for years, held up Shkaki's [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1106.72s)]
*  assassination as kind of a model of how one can effectively eliminate an organization by assassinating [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1117.76s)]
*  its leader. Well, guess what? Islamic Jihad not only participated prominently in the [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1125.52s)]
*  Palestinian offensive of 7th of October last year, but is still fighting today in the Gaza Strip, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1133.36s)]
*  and is today, I would argue, a much more powerful movement than it was when Shkaki was assassinated. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1140.8s)]
*  So yes, assassinations obviously have an impact, and they can present very serious setbacks to the [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1147.28s)]
*  organizations that suffer these losses. But I think in the larger framework of things, they tend to be [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1157.12s)]
*  tactical losses rather than presenting strategic transformations. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1167.36s)]
*  Before I ask about your thoughts on Iran, in terms of what's been happening [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1173.1200000000001s)]
*  as regards Hezbollah and Israel, again, bizarrely actually the BBC did an analysis and they found [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1177.68s)]
*  80% of the armed exchanges came from Israel rather than the other way around. But again, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1184.72s)]
*  the way this is, what's your thoughts, just the reality versus the way a lot of this has been [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1194.8000000000002s)]
*  portrayed, I guess, by much of the Western media in particular over the last part of this [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1199.2s)]
*  horror show, I suppose, in the last year? Well, of course, it is Hezbollah that initiated what [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1204.96s)]
*  it calls its support front on the 8th of October. And it did so with a very clear and explicit [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1210.72s)]
*  objective of supporting the Palestinians and exercising pressure on Israel to end its genocidal [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1218.8s)]
*  campaign against the Gaza Strip. This is often being presented as Hezbollah initiated an [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1226.72s)]
*  unprovoked armed conflict with Israel. Well, at some level, that's correct. But I find a little [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1234.08s)]
*  curious that people who are entirely justifiably have for 75 years, entirely justifiably decried [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1240.72s)]
*  the way the world abandoned the Jews of Europe in the 1930s and then during the Holocaust, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1252.64s)]
*  are in the same breath condemning Hezbollah, condemning the Houthi movement in Yemen, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1259.5200000000002s)]
*  and condemning others for taking active measures to support Palestinians when they are being [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1266.64s)]
*  subjected to a genocidal campaign by Israel. You can't have it both ways, I would argue. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1274.48s)]
*  I would certainly agree with those who say that the European powers had every opportunity to [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1282.56s)]
*  prevent the Holocaust by actively confronting Hitler during his rise to power. But if you want [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1290.48s)]
*  to quite justifiably condemn that, I don't think you can also condemn those who have taken the [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1301.12s)]
*  choice to stand by the Palestinians when they are themselves being subjected to genocide. The other [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1307.84s)]
*  point, of course, as you pointed out, is the vast disparity of violence. I mean, if you look at kind [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1314.1599999999999s)]
*  of mainstream media reporting, you would think that Israel is being subjected to a 24-7 [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1322.0s)]
*  assault from Lebanon with all kinds of bombs and missiles and artillery and whatnot, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1332.8s)]
*  and Israelis are basically helplessly huddling in their bomb shelters. Well, the reality is that [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1338.24s)]
*  Israel's levels of attacks on Lebanon has been exponentially higher. And although it is correct [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1346.72s)]
*  that the first shots in this particular round were fired by Hezbollah on October 8th of last year, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1358.1599999999999s)]
*  every step up the escalation ladder has on the whole been at Israel rather than Hezbollah's [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1365.6799999999998s)]
*  initiative. And it has been, according to many analysts, Hezbollah rather than Israel that has [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1371.04s)]
*  operated with relative restraint, something we may no longer see as a result of developments [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1377.2s)]
*  yesterday. Because what has now happened is that rather than taking another few steps up the [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1383.52s)]
*  escalation ladder, Israel has basically detonated the ladder itself with high explosives. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1389.2s)]
*  Will Barron Before I ask you about Gaza, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1395.44s)]
*  just on Iran, what's your thoughts there in terms of what this means there? Because obviously, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1398.8s)]
*  this is a big strategic defeat for Iran as well. Iran is talking about sending troops [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1405.84s)]
*  to Lebanon, particularly perhaps the borders of Syria, the Golan Heights. What's your thoughts [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1413.36s)]
*  on where this could lead and whether or not the view of the Israeli state is they want this [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1419.2s)]
*  escalation, they will keep escalating it. It's not actually in the interests of the US state, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1425.28s)]
*  of US power, to have a massive regional escalation. But they know that they can call the bluff of an [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1431.6000000000001s)]
*  administration, which frankly doesn't really seem to have a functioning president at the helm, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1438.4s)]
*  who in any case is ideologically one of the most pro-Israel presidents imaginable. What's [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1442.88s)]
*  your thoughts on where this leads? Dr. Ali [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1446.64s)]
*  I think it's a very good question. Hassan Nasrallah was particularly after the assassination of [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1448.64s)]
*  Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. Nasrallah was [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1457.1200000000001s)]
*  a very personification of the axis of resistance. And his assassination, therefore, as you know, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1461.68s)]
*  represents a significant loss to Iran. I should add that there's a lot of misunderstanding about [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1468.64s)]
*  the axis of resistance. It is a coalition and not a formal alliance. And its various members [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1478.16s)]
*  have different relationships with Iran. I've suggested that we should, in this context, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1486.64s)]
*  look at Iran as more the Germany of the European Union rather than the Soviet Union of the Warsaw [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1494.08s)]
*  Pact. In other words, it has various levels of interest, of influence over different members of [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1500.72s)]
*  this coalition in different periods of time, rather than being a pure center-proxy relationship. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1508.8799999999999s)]
*  As far as Iran itself, if you consider that Iran believes Israel is dead set on a direct [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1517.68s)]
*  confrontation with it, and if it also looks at the prospect of Trump returning to the White House, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1527.52s)]
*  the same president who unilaterally renounced the 2015 nuclear agreement, I wouldn't at all be [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1534.32s)]
*  surprised if Iran now makes an accelerated push to cross the nuclear threshold, the kind of North [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1542.0s)]
*  Korean strategy to regime survival, if you will. It's possible that another lesson it draws from [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1549.76s)]
*  what has happened in Lebanon is that many people were suggesting that Hezbollah lost the initiative [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1557.6s)]
*  by not itself unilaterally attacking Israel in full force after October 7th. I don't think that [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1567.04s)]
*  was an option for a number of reasons. Hezbollah wasn't prepared to do so. Hezbollah had multiple [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1576.3999999999999s)]
*  considerations, domestic and regional, in devising its strategy. But nevertheless, for those who [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1582.8799999999999s)]
*  believe that Hezbollah's current dilemmas and difficulties and losses are a result of it not [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1591.1200000000001s)]
*  having taken the initiative, they may well now in Tehran be arguing that Iran should avoid getting [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1600.3200000000002s)]
*  stuck in the same conundrum and therefore should take the initiative. The difference, of course, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1608.5600000000002s)]
*  is that Iran is a state. Iran has vital strategic, economic and other assets that [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1613.9199999999998s)]
*  can be much more easily targeted by Israel than, for example, Hezbollah could. And this tension [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1621.1999999999998s)]
*  between the strategy of strategic patience, which Iran has been exercising, and the constant [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1631.12s)]
*  Israeli provocations against Iran during the past years are now coming to a head. And Iran is faced, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1638.16s)]
*  I think, with a fundamental choice about how it wants to move forward, particularly where it is [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1646.48s)]
*  seeking to portray itself in the region as the state that stands up to Israel and is constantly [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1653.1200000000001s)]
*  criticizing and belittling others for not doing the same. Well, it's going one way or the other. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1661.6000000000001s)]
*  It's going to have to put its money where its mouth is. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1666.88s)]
*  Mason Friess – On Gaza. So we've had now nearly a year of this genocide of campaign by Israel. And [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1669.2s)]
*  it's not surprising, it's an interesting revelation, and it's linked as well to what's [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1677.1200000000001s)]
*  been going on in terms of the International Criminal Court. ProPublica, a US investigative [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1681.2800000000002s)]

*  agency led by Samantha Power, Barack Obama's former ambassador to the United Nations, made [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1692.56s)]
*  clear, as well as the refugee department, I think of the State Department, that Israel was [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1697.6799999999998s)]
*  deliberately preventing aid from getting into Gaza. And anyone who, you know, it's just, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1703.52s)]
*  obviously it's frustrating that we have to, we know that's happening. That's obvious. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1708.8799999999999s)]
*  There's been a siege of Gaza which has led to a famine and all the other dire consequences of that [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1712.8s)]
*  siege. But the fact is, the US law means that it cannot provide military assistance to states [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1718.32s)]
*  which prevent US backed humanitarian aid from entering. Anthony Blinken was told about these [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1726.0s)]
*  assessments and clearly refused to act on them. And there's also further revelations, I think, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1731.12s)]
*  in The Atlantic, which is a kind of very centrist, pro-Israel publication led by, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1736.8799999999999s)]
*  edited by a former IDF soldier. A prison guard. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1741.9199999999998s)]
*  Mason Friess – A prison guard, sorry, an IDF prison guard, you're quite right. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1744.96s)]
*  Which is that Netanyahu apparently said to, admitted that there was a siege, I don't know, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1748.72s)]
*  to Biden or Blinken, and blamed it on his coalition partners saying they won't even let an aspirin in. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1755.84s)]
*  But that's a confession from the Israeli state that there is that siege. What, in terms of, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1760.8799999999999s)]
*  because the ICC's, the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor's request for arrest [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1764.56s)]
*  warrants is actually primarily based on the siege. It hasn't gone further into those other charges [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1768.8799999999999s)]
*  based on the fact, partly, there isn't the, you need to be on the ground, in theory, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1774.24s)]
*  to accumulate evidence, whether you believe that or not. That's, they haven't gone [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1778.48s)]
*  as far as they should have gone. What's your thoughts about that, these revelations and what [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1782.16s)]
*  they mean? David Schiff – Well, can I just start by saying that another Israeli objective regarding [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1785.68s)]
*  Lebanon is reflected precisely in this discussion that we're having. It's only now that we're [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1792.56s)]
*  turning our attention to the Gaza Strip. And I'm sure there are numerous other conversations [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1798.8s)]
*  and interviews taking place around the world where the focus is very much on Lebanon and has been [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1804.96s)]
*  for the past week. And kind of the root of all evil, if you will, Israel's genocide, a [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1813.28s)]
*  long slot on the Gaza Strip is either not mentioned at all, or, you know, in our case, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1819.12s)]
*  because we have the time and interest to explore these things coming in well into the conversation. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1825.28s)]
*  But this is an absolutely crucial issue you're raising. Not only has Israel's medieval siege [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1832.4s)]
*  on the Gaza Strip been an absolutely horrendous violation of international law and the laws of [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1839.28s)]
*  war, constituting a series of war crimes and crimes against humanity. But it is also, as you know, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1845.8400000000001s)]
*  a violation of US domestic legislation, which states very clearly that the United States cannot [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1852.48s)]
*  provide military aid to a state which is obstructing the delivery of humanitarian aid by [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1859.76s)]
*  the United States. And as these documents make clear, this is exactly what the Biden administration [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1867.76s)]
*  and particularly Secretary of State Antony Blinken was being told by his bureaucracy. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1874.6399999999999s)]
*  And he then turned around and certified that Israel was in fact behaving in accordance with [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1883.6s)]
*  international law or not violating US law. And therefore, billions, therefore, he could sign off [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1891.2s)]
*  on billions more of weapons deliveries to Israel. And I think this tells us several things. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1899.2s)]
*  One is that this administration is ideologically invested in Israel to a degree that we have never [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1908.16s)]
*  before seen, even by US standards. You mentioned Reagan, we can even mention Trump. You know, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1918.0800000000002s)]
*  there's a tradition that when every US administration president leaves the White House, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1925.84s)]
*  he's lauded in Israel as a most pro-Israeli president that Israel has ever had. That's [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1931.84s)]
*  certainly going to be the case with Biden. But I think the next president will have a lot of [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1938.8799999999999s)]
*  difficulty exceeding that threshold and being described as even more pro-Israeli than Joe Biden. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1944.6399999999999s)]
*  So it shows how absolutely determined the United States is to ensure that Israel gets everything [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1951.2s)]
*  it needs. Second, it shows that as far as Washington is concerned, there will be absolutely no [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1960.24s)]
*  restraints whatsoever on Israel. Israel has a carte blanche from Washington to behave as it [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1967.04s)]
*  pleases, violating not only international law, but also US domestic legislation. And there will be [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1975.36s)]
*  absolutely no consequences of any sort for Israel from doing so. And this, thirdly, of course, this [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1981.84s)]
*  shows the total contempt for Palestinian Arab life more generally, that I think is a hallmark of [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=1991.1999999999998s)]
*  the generation of US political leaders which these administration officials, and Biden in particular, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2000.72s)]
*  represent. And again, I think one more element is that as so often, it's the bureaucracy and the [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2009.44s)]
*  civil servants that get things right, but it also shows that their political influence, their ability [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2017.6s)]
*  to affect decision-making is slim to none when it comes to politicians and leaders and decision-makers [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2026.32s)]
*  who are dead set upon a certain course of action. Just because it's a year on, I just want to [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2034.6399999999999s)]
*  address some, just focusing on guys, and you're absolutely right, it's so important that we focus [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2042.56s)]
*  on that as the root of all the evil we're discussing here. Just obviously notwithstanding [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2047.6s)]
*  the fact we just, the onslaught, this particular onslaught in Beirut yesterday. I mean, with the [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2053.76s)]
*  International Criminal Court, it's now been, it's four months, four months since the request was [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2060.2400000000002s)]
*  issued by the Chief Prosecutor, Karim Khan, for those arrest warrants against Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2067.92s)]
*  and his defence minister, Yoav Galan, for both crimes, so war crimes and crimes against humanity. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2072.88s)]
*  And for those who aren't familiar with the process or have forgotten, there's now the [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2078.7200000000003s)]
*  pre-trial chamber judges, the three judges who have to approve those requests. I guess, I mean, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2083.44s)]
*  I don't know if it gets, in a way, it's pointless to talk about. I mean, it's just your thoughts. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2088.96s)]
*  We know there's a history of Israel intimidating the predecessor of Karim Khan, the Chief Prosecutor. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2093.84s)]
*  And the United States. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2101.92s)]
*  And the United States, very important point. And we know that's happened since, in terms of what [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2103.28s)]
*  the US has said, we know there's been pressure, and Karim Khan has publicly alluded to the pressure [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2106.8s)]
*  on him. What's your thoughts on what's going on with the foot dragging? And do you think, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2111.28s)]
*  what are your thoughts? What could lie behind it? [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2115.76s)]
*  Well, I think everything you've said is correct. But it's also my view that the ICC prosecutor, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2118.48s)]
*  Karim Khan, is playing a fairly nefarious role in all of this. You know, he's been dragging his feet [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2125.0400000000004s)]
*  on the ICC investigation of the situation in Palestine from the moment he was appointed in [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2132.4s)]
*  2021 until developments in the last year left him with no choice. And then in May, he did something [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2138.16s)]
*  which was quite extraordinary, which was that rather than present his application for arrest [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2146.4s)]
*  warrants, confidentially to the pretrial chamber, the panel of three judges that decide on whether [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2153.84s)]
*  or not to issue those arrest warrants, he announced them publicly before the pretrial chamber had an [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2164.64s)]
*  opportunity to take a decision on his application. And in doing so, opened, created the opportunity [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2172.08s)]
*  for first the British government, then the German government, and then a slew of others to submit [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2180.24s)]
*  briefs to the ICC, either for or against these arrest warrants on various grounds. And what it [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2187.04s)]
*  has done is created an opportunity of several months now. And I suppose this will go on for [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2194.24s)]
*  several more months, during which the ICC refrains from taking a decision, almost praying that there's [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2202.4s)]
*  some development that will allow it not to take a decision. So I don't think [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2211.76s)]
*  the office of the ICC prosecutor has been innocent in all this. It's quite clear that as far as Khan [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2220.96s)]
*  is concerned, he needs this case like he needs a hole in the head and is doing everything possible [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2227.5200000000004s)]
*  to hide behind process, to seek to prevent this coming to a conclusion. So, you know, in the case [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2233.84s)]
*  of Putin, I think it took two weeks or two months, I'm not exactly sure, for the pretrial chamber to [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2243.92s)]
*  come to a determination. And there was no public announcement or fanfare before that chamber had [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2253.2000000000003s)]
*  decided. So here the gap between, here the public announcement that the panel of judges was being [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2260.64s)]
*  asked to issue a determination on the applications for arrest warrants created this mess we're [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2267.2799999999997s)]
*  currently in. That was standing, do you think, I mean, we have seen this year, Israeli impunity, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2272.72s)]
*  which just seems, I mean, unassailable for so long, crumble. And we saw that with the International [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2279.04s)]
*  Criminal Court of Justice, the world's highest court, and their sweeping judgment on Israel's [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2284.72s)]
*  occupation and colonisation and theft of Palestinian land, which was far more sweeping than a lot of [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2291.3599999999997s)]
*  people, I think, anticipated. I think it was very much at the better end, basically, or the highest [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2298.48s)]
*  possible expectations were basically met, I would say. I don't know if you think that's reason. What [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2305.6s)]
*  do you think about that? Because what, you know, summarise what they said, but also what you think [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2309.9199999999996s)]
*  the significance of that was, it's an advisory opinion based on the UN General Assembly, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2314.0s)]
*  this is before seven years ago now, not that many years ago, asking for the highest court, the ICJ, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2319.6s)]
*  to make its advisory opinion. So it was only going to be advisory in that sense, but what's [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2326.88s)]
*  your thoughts on what it represents? Well, I think it's extraordinarily significant, and I fully [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2332.0s)]
*  concur with you that the advisory opinion exceeded the expectations of those who were [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2336.72s)]
*  seeking it. You know, formally it is an advisory opinion, but it's a ruling, and it's called an [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2344.48s)]
*  advisory opinion because that's the description given to any ruling requested from this court [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2351.28s)]
*  by the General Assembly. And what this effectively means is that the international community [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2358.96s)]
*  asked the world's highest court to issue a ruling on the status of Israeli rule in the [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2365.44s)]
*  occupied Palestinian territories. And the ruling was that Israel's very presence in those territories [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2372.0s)]
*  is illegal and unlawful and illegitimate, that UN member states are under a positive obligation, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2379.6s)]
*  not only to bring this to an end, but also to ensure that any of their dealings with Israel [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2389.36s)]
*  in no way contribute to the continuation of occupation. And I should add, you know, [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2398.24s)]
*  this ruling can effectively apply just as much to the occupied Syrian Golan Heights. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2404.3199999999997s)]
*  And what it effectively means is that this three decades long charade that we have been [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2411.2s)]
*  experiencing, known as the Oslo Accords, where Palestinian rights have to constantly be negotiated [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2417.52s)]
*  under US supervision and are constantly subject to an Israeli veto, that has all been rendered [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2425.2s)]
*  irrelevant because the court quite clearly said that Palestinians have inalienable rights, [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2432.56s)]
*  that these rights are not subject to negotiations, and that therefore Israel is under an obligation [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2439.7599999999998s)]
*  to withdraw to the 1967 boundaries with or without an agreement, with or without [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2446.3999999999996s)]
*  a diplomatic charade. And I think just as importantly, the UN General Assembly recently [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2452.4s)]
*  adopted a resolution in response to this ruling, where it not only reaffirmed its main points, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2458.7200000000003s)]
*  but also stated quite explicitly what is expected of UN member states in order to transform this [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2469.0400000000004s)]
*  ruling into a reality. Of course, there's an important point to be made here, which is that [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2476.4s)]
*  this is not a national court that can kind of throw handcuffs on a criminal and throw him in prison. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2483.6s)]
*  Neither the International Court of Justice nor the UN General Assembly have enforcement mechanisms [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2490.4s)]
*  for such rulings. But nevertheless, I think politically, it is an extraordinarily important [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2497.36s)]
*  and significant development. Before I ask my final question, I did want to ask you about this, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2504.64s)]
*  given it's been a year on now of this, some of the worst atrocities committed in the 21st century, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2510.24s)]
*  live streamed on a daily basis. A reminder, unfortunately, not that the history of our [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2515.12s)]
*  species needs it, of the capacity for depravity which exists in terms of human violence. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2521.52s)]
*  And it's this, I've talked about, I call it genocide or mania, the radicalisation of [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2528.24s)]
*  Israeli society, where obviously there's already huge embedded structural racism, which you get if [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2538.88s)]
*  you're in the, that's what happens with colonisation, that's what happens with occupation. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2545.92s)]
*  You have to, if you're subjugating entire people, you have to strip them of their humanity. That's [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2550.3199999999997s)]
*  the history of colonialism. It's the British Empire, all the other European empires and all [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2556.64s)]
*  the hideous violence which they perpetrated, which they justified based on the inferiority [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2562.48s)]
*  of those that they were subjugating. But it is a case study, a disturbing case study, a warning [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2567.92s)]
*  from history of what can happen. And there are courageous Israelis, I interview them on this [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2572.7999999999997s)]
*  channel and I'll keep doing so. And they're courageous because they're so isolated. And if [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2578.3199999999997s)]
*  you look at the polling of Israeli society, it's gruesome. If you take out the Palestinian [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2582.96s)]
*  citizens of Israel, about half, the Israeli Jews are, Jewish Israelis are evenly divided whether [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2588.96s)]
*  not enough firepower has been used in Gaza or just the right amount. 60% consistently oppose [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2596.32s)]
*  all humanitarian aid entering Gaza, which would mean if anyone thought about it for more than three [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2602.56s)]
*  seconds, everyone dying in Gaza. And we can see the discussions on television where people talk [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2606.96s)]
*  about killing children because they'll end up being terrorists anyway. Where you see the way [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2613.68s)]
*  that soldiers post their genocidal sentiments where the brace position we all have to do when [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2620.0s)]
*  we click on the Israeli tree and we click on the translate from Hebrew and then just see the [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2627.84s)]
*  just some hideous depraved genocidal screed. Is it a politician? Is it a soldier? Is it a journalist? [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2633.44s)]
*  Is it an ordinary citizen? I mean, what does this tell us? This genocidal mania which grips [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2640.4s)]
*  Israeli society where genocidal sentiments are pervasive, widespread, legitimized from top to bottom? [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2648.32s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's a very important question. I believe it's Teyana Butu who has characterized [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2657.12s)]
*  Israel as having become a genocidal society. Of course, as you yourself mentioned, there are [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2665.2s)]
*  dissidents, there are courageous voices, very beleaguered ones, I should add. But if we look [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2671.6s)]
*  at it at a societal level, I think it's indeed fair and accurate to [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2678.72s)]
*  characterize Israel in 2024 as a genocidal society. Quite different than, for example, [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2684.4s)]
*  France during the Algerian War, the United States during the Vietnam War. There are parallels, [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2692.96s)]
*  historically. Let's not get into those now. But I think we were speaking earlier about the 1982 [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2700.4s)]
*  Israeli invasion of Lebanon. Well, that created and strengthened what was known as the Israeli [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2710.8s)]
*  peace movement. Then you had mass demonstrations opposed to the war and opposed to the Israeli [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2721.92s)]
*  government's role in the Sabra Shatila massacre. In 2024, we also have demonstrations, even riots, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2731.92s)]
*  not against the war and genocide, but pro-rape, defending the right of Israeli soldiers to gang [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2738.88s)]
*  rape Palestinian prisoners. I don't know if there's any parallel to that. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2747.44s)]
*  Israelis are really living in an alternate reality. I think they're getting a very different [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2755.92s)]
*  version of reality than the rest of us are. And in the way reality is presented to them is [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2763.2000000000003s)]
*  they're the real victims here. It's not the victims of genocide who were being wronged. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2774.96s)]
*  They're the real victims here. And as I think also Dejan Abutu put it, from their perspective, [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2781.6800000000003s)]
*  nothing justifies October 7th, but October 7th justifies everything. So it's impossible [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2789.6800000000003s)]
*  to argue with this kind of, as you put it so accurately, genocidal mania. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2799.04s)]
*  Just my final question. The US election now is just over a month away. It's not that far. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2807.04s)]
*  Now the 28th of September is on the 4th of November. Where do you see this heading based on [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2811.9199999999996s)]
*  there are two different scenarios, obviously. Donald Trump gets elected, or Kamala Harris? [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2818.7999999999997s)]
*  And what's your thoughts about that? That's the question. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2823.76s)]
*  Well, just a final point on my previous question, because I think it's relevant to what you just [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2829.52s)]
*  asked. I mean, we can't look at Israel and Israeli society in isolation. One thing we've learned [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2834.16s)]
*  during the past year is its extraordinary dependence on the West and the US in particular. And I think [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2840.64s)]
*  it's kind of this vicious cycle where the West's insistence on Israeli impunity [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2848.16s)]
*  pushes Israeli society ever further to the right. So it's very organically related. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2856.88s)]
*  Regarding the impact of the US election, I think it's difficult to say. What I will say is that [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2864.08s)]
*  I believe the Biden administration, and particularly Biden personally, has been a uniquely [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2872.48s)]
*  pro-Israeli figure in US presidential history. And I think that either Harris or Trump [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2880.0s)]
*  will represent, let's say, a return to the traditional US policy of unconditional support [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2890.48s)]
*  for Israel, as opposed to this hysterical devotion to anything and everything Israel does [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2898.64s)]
*  that Biden represents. And I think that the Israeli government, and Netanyahu in particular, [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2907.68s)]
*  although he does have a clear preference for Trump over Harris, also recognizes that the remaining [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2913.6s)]
*  months of the Biden administration represent a unique opportunity, a once in a lifetime opportunity [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2921.76s)]
*  for Israel to fundamentally transform the strategic equation in the Middle East with [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2929.76s)]
*  unconditional and unrestrained US support. Because I think Israel also understands that, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2936.8s)]
*  rhetorically speaking, Trump may be much more pro-Israeli, but he's also much more unpredictable [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2943.5200000000004s)]
*  with Trump. You never know what he's going to do tomorrow morning. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2951.28s)]
*  Harris, I think, will represent a much more traditional policy of, on the one hand, [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2956.1600000000003s)]
*  unconditional support for Israel, on the other hand, also a willingness at the extremes to [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2963.28s)]
*  place certain restraints upon Israel that have been entirely absent during the past year from [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2969.84s)]
*  the Biden administration. Well, we're soon going to find out, aren't we? It's not that long to go. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2976.08s)]
*  Reani, it's been such an honor to speak to you. Honestly, the huge level of knowledge, [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2982.64s)]
*  insight, wisdom, moral clarity that you always display, I think, more than evident today. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2987.7599999999998s)]
*  I think everyone listening or watching, if not come across our brilliant guest before, I think you [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2993.84s)]
*  can see why he's such a crucial voice in all of this. So do share this video, press like and [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=2997.92s)]
*  subscribe, do leave your comments, your thoughts, do engage. Thank you so much, Reani, honestly. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=3003.6s)]
*  Thank you very much, Owen. It was a real pleasure being on your program and is also [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=3008.96s)]
*  a sign of my respect and appreciation for everything you've done on behalf of justice [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=3016.3199999999997s)]
*  for the Palestinian people during the past year. That's very kind of you, but what's the point of [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=3023.92s)]
*  having a platform unless people use it like this? It's those who are silent, who should be damned, [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=3028.64s)]
*  I think, rather than those who speak out, praised. But it means a lot coming from you. Thanks so much. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrK9OXkMDu4&t=3033.6s)]
