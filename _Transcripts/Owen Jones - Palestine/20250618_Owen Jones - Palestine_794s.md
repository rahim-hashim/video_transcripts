# Iran: It's The SAME BULLSH*T Again
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88)
*  As Donald Trump paves the way for direct US entry into the war on Iran, it is worth taking a moment [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=0.0s)]
*  to absorb our descent into dystopia. Let's not pretend there was a golden age behind us, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=5.92s)]
*  this was always a will defined by injustice, but goodness me, our current decline is precipitous. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=11.28s)]
*  You may have read or watched dystopian fiction in years gone by and wondered how such nightmareish [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=18.16s)]
*  futures could ever come into being, and now here we are with a far-right authoritarian running the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=23.84s)]
*  world's only superpower, allied to a genocidal state. And this far-right authoritarian casually [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=28.72s)]
*  posts on the internet orders to the Iranian people, everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=35.04s)]
*  in some sort of digital resurrection of the Mongol invasions. A promise to unleash mass destruction [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=41.44s)]
*  against one of the world's major cities with a population of 10 million, with anyone remaining, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=47.92s)]
*  however old, however young, however infirm, however ill, however vulnerable, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=52.72s)]
*  does a legitimate target in practice in total defiance of any international laws and norms. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=57.2s)]
*  As justification, Trump declares, simply stated, Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon, I said it over [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  and over again. The justification for Israel's entirely unprovoked and baseless attack on Iran [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=68.0s)]
*  is that it is on the verge of acquiring a nuclear weapon. An article in the intercept 10 years ago [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=74.16s)]
*  noted that Benjamin Netanyahu warned that an Iranian nuclear bomb was imminent in 1992, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=79.04s)]
*  1985, 2002, 2009, and 2012. Guess what? He's talking bullshit. Let's listen to Tulsi Gabbard, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=84.88s)]
*  who is Donald Trump's director of national intelligence, testifying just three months ago. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=93.84s)]
*  The IC continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon, and Supreme Leader [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=99.28s)]
*  Khamenei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended in 2003. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=104.0s)]
*  The IC continues to monitor closely if Tehran decides to reauthorize its nuclear weapons program. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=109.67999999999999s)]
*  Well, that seems quite decisive, doesn't it? Let's hear a rather sage warning from the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  very same Tulsi Gabbard back in May 2019. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  Indeed, even according to CNN, itself often a slavish defender of disastrous US foreign policy, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=139.04s)]
*  US intelligence assessments suggest that Iran was years, is years away from any nuclear bomb. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=146.32s)]
*  We've heard this nonsense of course before. This is Netanyahu in 2002, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=153.2s)]
*  begging US politicians to invade Iraq. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=157.44s)]
*  And I think that people sitting right next door in Iran, young people, and many others will say, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=168.96s)]
*  the time of such regimes, of such just bots is gone. There was a new age, something new is happening. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  Well, he got his wish and who could have missed those positive reverberations. We should therefore [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  note the insanity of the G7, that is the group of the supposedly advanced economies issuing a [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=185.6s)]
*  statement declaring that Israel has the right to defend itself, as though Israel is the victim here. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=190.16s)]
*  Israel launched the illegal and unprovoked attack. You cannot, as per the UN charter, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=196.4s)]
*  launch a war with the justification of an alleged future threat. That is illegal. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=200.95999999999998s)]
*  The same G7 statement declared, Iran is the principal source of regional instability and terror. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=206.4s)]
*  Israel's leader is literally a wanted man, with an arrest warrant against him issued by the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=211.76s)]
*  International Criminal Court for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Israel has wiped Gaza from [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=215.92s)]
*  the face of the earth as it commits genocide. It not only de facto annexes the West Bank, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=221.28s)]
*  it illegally occupies and colonises it. It has subjected it to relentless pogroms. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=226.48s)]
*  It invades and occupies Syria on a whim with barely any coverage, as well as striking its [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=232.24s)]
*  neighbour with multiple missile strikes, without Western states even blinking. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=238.32s)]
*  Its government ministers openly discussed forging a greater Israel, with Netanyahu's [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=242.72s)]
*  finance minister calling for his nation's borders to expand to Damascus. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=247.76s)]
*  The principal source of regional instability and terror in the Middle East is Israel, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=252.56s)]
*  and it isn't even close. But here's what's going on. The cheerleaders of Israel depend on [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=259.44s)]
*  both turning reality on its head, as well as erasing our all too recent history. Erasing that history [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=265.03999999999996s)]
*  is particularly important when it comes to demonising opponents of Western slaughters. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=270.4s)]
*  Let's take Andrew Neil, formerly the BBC's flagship interviewer who went on to found [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=276.72s)]
*  GB News before fleeing his Frankenstein's monster in disgust, claiming it left him close [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=281.12s)]
*  to a nervous breakdown. He responded to Kenny McCaskill, a former Scottish National [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=285.92s)]
*  Party member of parliament, who wrote about the possibility of the UK military being potentially [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=289.76s)]
*  used to defend Israel. He said, not on my name, selling arms, collusion and complicities bad [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  enough, this would be openly participating in Israeli aggression when peace is required. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=299.04s)]
*  Andrew Neil responded, prominent Scottish politicians supporting separation from the UK, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=303.68s)]
*  including the SNP, are siding with a medieval theocratic dictatorship, fighting for its very [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=308.32s)]
*  existence. Who would have thunk it? But of course, just as opponents of the Iraq war were smeared as [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=315.28000000000003s)]
*  stooges of Saddam Hussein, and opponents of the Afghan war were smeared as stooges of the Taliban, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=320.96000000000004s)]
*  and opponents of the Libyan war were smeared as stooges of Colonel Gaddafi, now anyone who [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=326.56s)]
*  opposes dropping bombs on the heads of terrified civilians in Iran must of course be stooges of [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=331.04s)]
*  the Islamic Republic. Here, I'm afraid, is a reminder of a catastrophic failure. In every single [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=335.6s)]
*  one of those cases, those of us who were smeared were vindicated. I say vindicated, but it is a [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=340.8s)]
*  gruesome word to use in the circumstances because we were vindicated in the worst possible way. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=346.64000000000004s)]
*  We predicted catastrophe and catastrophe came in every single case, yet the cheerleaders of [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=352.24s)]
*  these catastrophes suffered no consequences, zero zilch to their reputations. They continued [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=356.56s)]
*  to be treated as statesmen or sage commentators, respectable, moderate, mainstream. That meant they [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=361.36s)]
*  could walk from crime scene to crime scene, baying for yet more violence as though nothing had even [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=366.32s)]
*  happened. Their reputation is still intact. It's even worse than that. Not only did those of us [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=372.16s)]
*  who opposed these total catastrophes not get any credit, not get treated as people who were [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=377.36s)]
*  tragically vindicated, and thus as people who are worth listening to in these circumstances, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=382.08s)]
*  if anything, we were treated as even more dangerous and extreme than before. What are the [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=386.56s)]
*  consequences of this? According to a study by Brown University, over four and a half million people [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=391.68s)]
*  were killed by the post 9-11 wars. 38 million people were displaced. Then there's the maiming, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=396.96s)]
*  the trauma we could go on. That's the price paid by our failure to make the architects of these [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=402.08s)]
*  catastrophes pay for what they did. In September 2002, six months before the Iraq war, Andrew Neal [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=406.4s)]
*  penned a column and in my word, it is instructive. It was headed, Peace Party seems strangely [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=412.32s)]
*  oblivious to the lessons of September 11. In the article, he lauded US President George W. Bush [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=417.2s)]
*  and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair for their calm and consistent speeches, in which, in support of [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=422.88s)]
*  launching an invasion of Iraq, they argued convincingly that doing nothing is a far greater [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=427.04s)]
*  threat to our peace and security than risking intervention now. Bush's speech to the UN was [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=431.04s)]
*  masterful, he declared, and muted the complaints of those who would prefer to do nothing. He [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=435.36s)]
*  ridiculed the critics of the Afghan war, which he presented as a total success, and indeed ridiculed [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=441.04s)]
*  the idea that thousands more Osama bin Laden's, as predicted following the invasion of Afghanistan, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=445.36s)]
*  have somehow failed to materialise. This was of course before the Iraq war he cheered on turned [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=450.48s)]
*  that country into a playground, not just for al-Qaeda, who ended up more powerful than ever [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=456.0s)]
*  before, but for a terrorist network even more extreme than bin Laden, ISIS, as well as the [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=459.76s)]
*  Taliban retaking Afghanistan more powerful than ever. He declared Afghanistan had resurrected a [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=465.52000000000004s)]
*  healthy new fear that strengthened the US. He said Saddam Hussein's henchmen were trawling the [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=470.96s)]
*  world's shadier arms dealers so they could build more weapons of mass destruction. He couldn't [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=475.35999999999996s)]
*  have been clearer, he said Baghdad suburbs were now dotted with secret installations often posing, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=480.56s)]
*  of course, as hospitals or schools, developing missile fuel bodies and guidance systems, chemical [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=484.56s)]
*  and biological warheads, and most sinister of all, he said, a renewed attempt to develop nuclear [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=490.4s)]
*  weapons. He browbeat opponents of the coming invasion, declaring, so what is it that the [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=495.03999999999996s)]
*  peace party does not understand? Saddam already has substantial stocks of chemical and biological [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=500.32s)]
*  weapons, and added he has embarked once more on a nuclear weapons programme. He even declared [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=506.32s)]
*  that there was only one response to the doubters, one on earth is the case for waiting. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=512.4s)]
*  And yet, everything he predicted, everything he predicted was total and utter garbage, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=517.4399999999999s)]
*  totally discredited. There were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, yet listen to the [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=525.92s)]
*  pomposity with which this man spoke, his belief that the proponents of peace were not just wrong, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=530.64s)]
*  but humiliatingly wrong. Oh, get this, get this, he even said of opponents of war, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=537.12s)]
*  it is unclear how many more times they have to be wrong before we are released from the obligation [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=542.0s)]
*  to take them too seriously. He deserves to have those words forced down his neck for the rest of [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=548.0799999999999s)]
*  his life. How is it possible that this man can be so outrageously wrong on Iraq or on Afghanistan, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=553.84s)]
*  on something so serious, literally using his platform to allocate for violence? That's what [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=561.36s)]
*  he's doing, which did indeed unleash, by the way, blood and chaos on an unimaginable scale, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=566.64s)]
*  and still be able to publicly prance around demanding yet another blood bath, while still [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=572.0s)]
*  demonising opponents of war as the de facto stooges of a foreign dictatorship. It is a criminal [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=576.4s)]
*  offence to publicly incite violence in Britain, indeed to support organisations such as Hamas [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=582.32s)]
*  on the grounds of the violence that they've perpetrated, and yet you can literally freely [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=587.12s)]
*  advocate what is in practice mass violence with repeatedly calamitous consequences, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=591.2s)]
*  with millions of deaths, by the way, as that Brown University study underlines, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=596.0s)]
*  and there's not even a social penalty, an absurdity, and one that condemns us to never-ending horror. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=600.08s)]
*  Here's another thing, Netanyahu, he was wanted for war crimes, declared that unlike Israel, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=605.84s)]
*  the Iranian regime targets civilians. This is a state which has butchered tens of thousands [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=610.88s)]
*  of Palestinians in Gaza, possibly hundreds of thousands, we don't even know, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=615.04s)]
*  and killed far more Iranian civilians and vice versa, yet 24 Israelis killed by Iranian attacks [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=618.88s)]
*  is apparently evidence that Tehran's regime is uniquely evil. In one single massacre last night, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=624.16s)]
*  dozens of Palestinians were massacred, way over twice that number. They were massacred as they [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=630.8s)]
*  desperately looked for food. They were fired on by tanks. It is said that it resembles a horror film, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=638.88s)]
*  and that's just one of those massacres. They've massacred hundreds of Palestinians looking for [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=648.32s)]
*  food. They're clearly doing it as a sport, and they're doing it because they know they can get [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=654.64s)]
*  away with anything, that Western governments and Western media outlets will let them get away [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo-kTr_bz88&t=660.24s)]
