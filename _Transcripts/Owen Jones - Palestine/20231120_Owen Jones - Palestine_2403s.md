Video Description: Raz Segal - an Israeli associate professor of Holocaust and genocide studies at Stockton University in the US - is someone you need to listen to. When he uses the term 'genocide', it is not done lightly - it is with precision. Here he sets out the case that the Israeli state is committing an ongoing genocide in Gaza - and questions of intent, incitement, prevention and accountability.

# Gaza 'Textbook Case of GENOCIDE' - Holocaust Scholar
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [November 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0)
*  Now, you are a scholar in questions of genocide. And you've been writing about genocide in the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=0.0s)]
*  context of Gaza. You wrote a piece in The Guardian actually about this a few weeks ago, which had a [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=9.6s)]
*  very bad faith response to it, largely erasing the fact that you yourself Israeli and Jewish. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=17.28s)]
*  Can you just start by explaining, because a lot of people would say as horrible as maybe we might [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=22.64s)]
*  think what's happening in Gaza is, genocide is an inappropriate term, and it's hyperbolic to use that [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=29.04s)]
*  term. So what do we mean by genocide? And why would it we talk about in the context of Gaza? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=37.2s)]
*  Sure. Well, thank you, Owen, for having me on your show. I think that there's a number of things to [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  understand here. First is that it's important to know that in international law, there is actually [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=50.64s)]
*  no hierarchy. So it's not that genocide is actually worse than crimes against humanity or war crimes. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=56.88s)]
*  It's just a different kind of crime that does have a higher threshold. And we'll get to this in a [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=65.04s)]
*  minute. But there is the image in popular imagination that there is actually some kind of a hierarchy [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=72.16s)]
*  is not the case in international law. So that's the first thing to note about this. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=81.36s)]
*  Now genocide, according to the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=86.32s)]
*  Genocide from December 1948, requires two main things. One is intent, and we're talking about [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=90.72s)]
*  special intent. And that's the high threshold that I was referring to. And the intent in the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=98.32s)]
*  language of the convention means intent to destroy a group, and that's a national, ethnic, religious, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=106.24s)]
*  or racial group, as such. Now as such is very important because it means that members of the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=111.6s)]
*  group need to be targeted as members of the group, not just as individuals. So the intent is very [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=118.16s)]
*  important. It's usually very, very difficult to prove intent. And that's why we have very few [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  cases recognized as genocide since World War II, or the war under genocide. But we can think about [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=130.56s)]
*  all the wars and mass violence in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s, and only the Srebrenica [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=136.88s)]
*  massacre is recognized as genocide. In any case, we have very few cases of genocide because it's [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=142.32s)]
*  very difficult usually to show intent to destroy. And that's what differentiates actually genocide [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  from, for example, war crimes or crimes against humanity. And then once you establish intent, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=153.28s)]
*  you also need to show the dynamics of violence on the ground, that they are actually [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=160.72s)]
*  genocidal in the sense that they fall into one or more of the five acts of genocide listed in the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=166.24s)]
*  convention, which is killing members of the group, causing serious bodily or mental harm, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=172.48s)]
*  creating conditions calculated to bring about the destruction of the group, and then there's also [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=178.0s)]
*  preventing birth within the group or forcibly transferring children from one group to the other. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=183.28s)]
*  Now, the case of Israel's attack on Gaza is actually very unique. It's actually exceptional, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=188.64s)]
*  I think, in a number of ways, but it's unique in the sense of discussing it as what I think it is [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=197.51999999999998s)]
*  that is genocide because the intent is so clearly articulated, right? And it's articulated throughout [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=204.55999999999997s)]
*  Israeli media and society and politics now, and anyone who follows Hebrew language sources [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=214.24s)]
*  is exposed to shocking, shocking language by members of parliament, by journalists, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=220.48000000000002s)]
*  on social media, in public spaces, calling to annihilate Gaza, to destroy Gaza, to flatten Gaza, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=226.16000000000003s)]
*  to kill everyone, so on and so forth. But it's articulated since the 7th of October, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=232.72s)]
*  actually, by people with what's called an international law command authority, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=238.64s)]
*  right, or command responsibility. That is state leaders, members of the war cabinet, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=244.64s)]
*  and senior army officers. And here we have dozens, dozens of pieces of evidence so far [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=251.04s)]
*  of people with command authority, and we can, you know, we can name a few key examples in a second [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=259.44s)]
*  but I want to just emphasize also that the issue of intent here, there's two additional things that [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=268.48s)]
*  are important to note. One is that it also comes in the Israeli case with a lot of dehumanizing [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=275.84s)]
*  language, right, and we'll refer to that. So there is intent to destroy, but the intent to destroy [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=282.8s)]
*  here is also accompanied with explicit dehumanizing language. And then there is a language that [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=289.04s)]
*  actually should get us to think about historical cases of genocide. I'm referring specifically to, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=297.35999999999996s)]
*  for example, ideas about deporting all the Palestinians in Gaza to the desert, right, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=304.47999999999996s)]
*  because we know that deserts actually have been used in genocides historically in the 20th century, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=313.11999999999995s)]
*  specifically as weapons of genocide. And I'm thinking specifically about the Armenian genocide, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=318.47999999999996s)]
*  but also the destruction of the Herero and Nama in German Southwest Africa in the early 20th century [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=323.28s)]
*  and other cases. So we can come back, we can come back to that. But let me just break down for a [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=329.2s)]
*  minute these issues of intent and the dynamics of violence. So intent here, I think we all remember [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=335.11999999999995s)]
*  Israeli President Herzog early on referring to, quote, all the nation there, that is all the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=342.71999999999997s)]
*  people, all the Palestinians in Gaza are responsible for the Hamas attacks. So taking a whole [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=349.92s)]
*  population, 2.3 million people, half of whom, by the way, are under the age of 18, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=357.44s)]
*  right, and basically portraying them as enemy targets, right, as legitimate enemy targets. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=362.16s)]
*  Now that's a clear genocidal language, right, and again we've seen it, for example, in the Armenian [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=369.52000000000004s)]
*  genocide where the Ottoman authorities decided the whole Armenian population of the empire are [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=374.64s)]
*  actually Russian agents in the frame of World War I and the Caucasus front with Russia. So we have [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=381.44s)]
*  this kind of intent. Then we have Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu who early on promised to turn [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=389.76s)]
*  Gaza into, quote, rubble, which indeed Israel did, right. It's also important to see that [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=396.64s)]
*  Israeli authorities and the Israeli army did what they said they'll do, right. But then on the 29th [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=402.15999999999997s)]
*  of October as Israel was starting its ground invasion, Netanyahu invoked the biblical story [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=408.64s)]
*  of Amalek, which is a story about total destruction, total, that's the key here, right, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=416.71999999999997s)]
*  where the Israelites are ordered to destroy all of Amalek. He then doubled down on this a few days [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=424.4s)]
*  later in a special letter to Israeli soldiers and officers in the army, and again invoking the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=431.92s)]
*  biblical story of Amalek. So we have a clear basically message from the head of the state, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=442.08s)]
*  right, about the need to destroy a population that as the president portrayed them are all [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=450.88s)]
*  actually enemies. And we've seen this again and again, the portrayal of all Palestinians in Gaza [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=458.08s)]
*  as enemies. Now we also, as I said, we have dehumanizing language. Israel Defense Minister [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=464.71999999999997s)]
*  Yoav Galant, as we know on the 9th of October, proclaimed the total siege, right, policy cutting [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=471.44s)]
*  off food, water, fuel, medical supplies to Gaza and describing Palestinians in Gaza as, quote, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=477.76s)]
*  human animals. We also have Israeli state leaders and senior army officers and politicians [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=484.48s)]
*  describing Palestinians in Gaza as Nazis and basically placing the Hamas attack on 7th of [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=491.84000000000003s)]
*  October in the frame of the Holocaust, right. Now US President Biden did this as well and actually [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=499.6s)]
*  senior politicians in Europe have also done this and reinforcing this demonizing and dehumanizing [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=507.6s)]
*  language of portraying Palestinians as Nazis. Now it's important to say, and the Hamas attack on [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=515.4399999999999s)]
*  7th of October was an act of horrendous mass murder. It's without a doubt a case of war crime, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=523.84s)]
*  and there are also crimes against humanity when you think about acts of torture, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=530.16s)]
*  hostage taking, which is actually an ongoing crime, right, but it's not a crime related to [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=533.68s)]
*  the Holocaust in any way. And it's important to stress this idea of blurring completely different [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=539.8399999999999s)]
*  context, right, of powerless Jews during World War II facing one of the most powerful states and [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=547.4399999999999s)]
*  armies, Nazi Germany and its allies. And here we have a very powerful state, Israel, with a powerful [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=553.68s)]
*  army, a nuclear power backed by all the western countries, and we have Palestinians who are for [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=561.92s)]
*  decades under Israeli settler colonial rule, Israel military occupation, siege, decades of documented [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=568.4s)]
*  crimes against them, very, very different context. None of this takes away from the horrific nature [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=577.92s)]
*  of the Hamas attack on 7th of October, but the portrayal of the Hamas and then by [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=583.5999999999999s)]
*  extension Palestinians, and in some cases it's just explicit, all Palestinians are Nazis, and again, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=589.04s)]
*  this is something that is reproduced also by politicians in the US and the European Union, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=594.88s)]
*  that's a dehumanizing element that also then, of course, if you're fighting Nazis, as former [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=602.0799999999999s)]
*  Israel Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said in his tantrum on Sky News on 12th of October, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=608.9599999999999s)]
*  we're fighting Nazis, then there are no law applies, right, everything is permissible, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=613.52s)]
*  right, and of course the legitimate aim of destroying everyone and everything in Gaza, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=618.3199999999999s)]
*  it becomes clear that is indeed genocidal. Now the dynamics of violence on the ground, so when [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=625.76s)]
*  we take all the elements of intent, the language, a dehumanizing language, portraying Palestinians [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=632.56s)]
*  as a whole as enemies, human animals, think about the discourse of human shields, which is [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=640.32s)]
*  incredibly important to note here that Palestinians are humanized only when they appear as, quote, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=647.2800000000001s)]
*  human shields, right, which is of course incredibly dehumanizing. When you take all of this together [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=653.44s)]
*  with the dynamics of violence, now what we see on the ground is very clear. Israel has killed so far [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=663.2800000000001s)]
*  more than 12,000 Palestinians, more than 5,000 of them children, about a thousand babies, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=669.28s)]
*  injuring more than 30,000 Palestinians. We have more than half of all the buildings in Gaza [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=678.16s)]
*  have been destroyed, agricultural land has been bombed and destroyed, the North in particular is, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=684.8s)]
*  there's very little left of it, I think. There's documented use of white phosphorus [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=691.52s)]
*  bombs by Human Rights Watch. Israel has dropped in general more than 20,000 tons of explosives on [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=698.48s)]
*  Gaza in a bit more than a month. That's at least one and a half Hiroshima bombs as we know. So any [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=705.2s)]
*  kind of claim that Israel is targeting specifically Hamas militants or Hamas military installations, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=713.04s)]
*  right, if you think about the levels of violence and destruction and the weapons used, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=720.64s)]
*  that's an absurd claim of course, right, and it confirms actually what Israeli army spokesman [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=727.6s)]
*  Daniel Agari said early on that the goal is actually destruction and not accuracy in his own [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=733.6s)]
*  words, right. So, but the key here I think is not just, again, it's enough to show that the levels [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=738.4s)]
*  of killing once we have intent is indigenous style killing and the numbers actually are not the key [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=746.08s)]
*  issue here, right, but when you think about the total siege proclamation, right, the cutting off [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=752.24s)]
*  of water, food, fuel, medical supplies, together with a forced displacement of more than a million [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=758.72s)]
*  and a half Palestinians of the 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza so far, right, especially [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=766.0s)]
*  because Israel has ordered the evacuation of Palestinians from the north to the south, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=772.48s)]
*  that now in the last six weeks have created actually in the language of the convention, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=777.12s)]
*  conditions calculated to bring about the destruction of the group, why? Because indeed [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=782.5600000000001s)]
*  the siege has created what it was meant to create, that is we now face starvation conditions in Gaza, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=787.84s)]
*  right, Palestinians they were facing starvation surviving on less than two pieces of bread a day, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=793.52s)]
*  three liters of water a day, now the World Health Organization recommends at least 100 liters of [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=799.12s)]
*  water a day for everything, cooking, washing, drinking, of course, Palestinians are now [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=805.12s)]
*  surviving on three liters of water a day, medical supplies have run out, fuel is running out, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=809.2s)]
*  we know that hospitals have been bombed, they have no medical supplies and fuel to [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=814.96s)]
*  do what hospitals needed to save lives and treat people certainly in a time of war, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=823.36s)]
*  so we have now unbelievable overcrowding conditions that are ripe for the outbreak of infectious [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=830.0s)]
*  diseases, so indeed conditions calculated to bring about the destruction of the group in the language [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=838.48s)]
*  of the UN Convention, so we have both the intent and the dynamics of violence on the ground and [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=845.84s)]
*  and again because the intent is expressed so explicitly, so directly in such unashamed [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=854.0799999999999s)]
*  ways and it's continued to be expressed in this way, then I do think that what we're seeing in [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=862.64s)]
*  front of our eyes is a textual case of genocide. I mean just on that, the Iraq border count, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=868.56s)]
*  which is a very credible project which has looked at the numbers of civilians who died after the [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=876.64s)]
*  invasion of Iraq through various forms of violence, often actually people suggest they're [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=881.6s)]
*  significantly underestimating because they're using publicly available data, but they analyse the data [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=886.48s)]
*  from the Gaza Health Ministry which is often criticised because it's run by Hamas but in [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=892.72s)]
*  previous conflicts their final death tolls have been validated by Israel and the United Nations [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=897.0400000000001s)]
*  and they analyse the publicly released names, ages and IDs which are actually Israeli approved [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=902.16s)]
*  identification numbers as well and they concluded that few of the victims can be competence because [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=907.36s)]
*  they looked at the modest excess of adult males killed but they pointed out that was a modest [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=912.24s)]
*  access and it could be explained by the greater exposure to risk, for example in rescue efforts [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=918.24s)]
*  and lots of people have criticised the kind of women and childrening of focusing on, because [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=923.04s)]
*  innocent men have been killed as well, but the fact that 70% of the dead are women and children [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=927.6s)]
*  underlies that this cannot be anything other than overwhelmingly a mass death amongst the civilian [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=932.48s)]
*  population, I suppose. Yeah, I mean absolutely, also to I think consider here that we're talking [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=937.92s)]
*  about, as I said, more than 12,000 Palestinians killed so far and more than 5,000 of our children, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=948.3199999999999s)]
*  that itself tells us, you know, almost half of them, our children of course, half of the population [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=954.64s)]
*  in Gaza are children, but also when we put this, you know, in perspective we have to understand, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=961.84s)]
*  for example, in terms of relative numbers, right, not in, I mean total numbers itself is quite [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=969.12s)]
*  shocking, we're talking about six months, but in relative numbers if you take Russia's invasion of [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=974.32s)]
*  Ukraine, for example, and you take the higher figures even, okay, you put the figures in the [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=981.0400000000001s)]
*  tens of thousands, right, of Ukrainians killed by the Russian bombings and the Russian invasion, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=985.92s)]
*  the numbers in Gaza would mean that we would have about 300,000 Ukrainians killed, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=993.8399999999999s)]
*  of course in almost two years, and here we're talking about six weeks, right. Now none of this [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1001.12s)]
*  is to minimise Russia's invasion and bombing of Ukraine, actually quite to the contrary, right, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1005.4399999999999s)]
*  if US President Biden in April of 2022, two months into the Russian's invasion of Ukraine, said [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1013.76s)]
*  that what he's seeing, and it was his personal opinion, not the position of the US government, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1023.68s)]
*  but still he said that he thinks that the Russian violence in Ukraine is genocide, right, and he [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1028.16s)]
*  said we'll let the international lawyers debate and discuss, right, but it sure seems like that to [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1034.4s)]
*  me, that's a quote of Biden. Well if you look at Israel's attack on Gaza now, and as you said [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1039.36s)]
*  in terms of the numbers, right, and we think about them in relatively to the population, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1045.84s)]
*  and again remind everyone we're talking about the population under 16-year-old siege, it's a [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1052.24s)]
*  population in a territory under Israeli military occupation, recognised internationally as a [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1058.6399999999999s)]
*  military occupied territory, and the levels of destruction and violence, right, together with [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1065.3600000000001s)]
*  the annihilatory language and intent to destroy, right, then if Biden saw Russian's attack on [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1073.1200000000001s)]
*  Ukraine as genocide, right, then we can definitely, right, it sure seems that way, right, in Israel's [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1079.3600000000001s)]
*  attack on Gaza, and again this does not at all minimise the Russian violence in Ukraine, if [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1086.08s)]
*  anything it highlights it even more. Yeah, and when I put this to Piers Morgan last week when I [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1092.16s)]
*  discussed this issue on his show, he put it to me that there was a big difference, because in the [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1099.68s)]
*  case of Israel there had been Hamas murdering around a thousand innocent Israeli civilians, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1105.8400000000001s)]
*  and I mean we could park, I suppose, starting the clock on 7th of October, but in the case of [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1113.3600000000001s)]
*  Ukraine, Russia had just unjustifiably invaded, but I suppose, I'll put that to you, because I [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1120.16s)]
*  think maybe the answer is a bit obvious to people, but I'll just put that to you, that's why he, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1125.92s)]
*  because he said what Russia was doing in Ukraine was genocide, but what Israel is doing in Gaza [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1129.44s)]
*  isn't, because the cause of each violence is different. Yeah, well I mean this, I think this [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1133.3600000000001s)]
*  goes to the heart of the, of the, another misconception, right, I mean a lot of people [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1140.96s)]
*  don't understand what the meaning of genocide is in international law, and really why should they? [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1145.52s)]
*  So it's important to explain that, but there's another misconception that Israel's attack on [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1150.3200000000002s)]
*  Gaza now is a legitimate, is legitimate because it's a response to the Hamas mass murder on 7th [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1155.3600000000001s)]
*  of October, and it's their right to self-defense, right? Well according to international law, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1164.16s)]
*  Israel does not actually have a right to self-defense in occupied territory, right? No, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1170.4s)]
*  that right according to international law doesn't exist. That's important to mention this. Now, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1176.32s)]
*  does Israel have a right and actually a duty and a responsibility to repel the attack against it? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1182.72s)]
*  Absolutely, absolutely, right, but to respond in a genocidal assault, right, against Gaza, as it has [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1187.76s)]
*  since 7th of October, no, and it doesn't, not even the right to self-defense as we know it between, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1196.0s)]
*  between states because Gaza is occupied territory, right? So that's one thing. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1202.16s)]
*  Which people don't realize, under international law, Gaza remains under occupation, has done [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1207.0400000000002s)]
*  despite the Israeli army withdrawing in 2005. Absolutely, because Israel controls, the border [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1210.8000000000002s)]
*  controls what goes in and out for 16 years now. This is the longest siege, by the way, in modern [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1215.92s)]
*  history, which was already in itself a clear violation of international and humanitarian law, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1220.8000000000002s)]
*  right, with repeated attacks against the population over the 16 year siege period, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1226.88s)]
*  which has now been upgraded, right, to the total siege policy. So very actually indeed a very [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1232.5600000000002s)]
*  different situation than the Russian-Ukraine war, right, but not a difference that would suggest [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1238.48s)]
*  that Russia's attack is genocide, whereas Israel's attack is legitimate self-defense, not at all, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1244.88s)]
*  actually, right, in that sense. But again, it doesn't, this does not minimize, right, the, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1250.32s)]
*  the horrendous levels of violence of the unprovoked Russian attack on Ukraine. It just means that the, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1256.6399999999999s)]
*  the idea that we have two states here, that is Russia and Ukraine, and here a state attacking a [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1262.3999999999999s)]
*  territory that it occupies for decades and has laid a siege on for 16 years, yes, we can definitely [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1268.96s)]
*  talk about a genocidal assault here, even though we had indeed a horrendous attack by Hamas on 7th [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1276.16s)]
*  of October, that does not mean that Israel's response cannot be genocidal. In terms of intent [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1283.2s)]
*  and incitement, I just want to just check something in terms of maybe where lines are blurred. So [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1289.0400000000002s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister, if he invokes Amalek in the Bible, which calls for the killing [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1293.1200000000001s)]
*  of men, women and children a livestock intent, the deputy speaker of the Knessets, the Israeli [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1298.0s)]
*  parliament, all the preoccupation with whether or not there is internet in Gaza showing that we've [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1304.08s)]
*  learned nothing, we are too humane, burn Gaza now or less, that would be incitement, wouldn't it, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1307.28s)]
*  because he's not a, he's a senior politician, but he's not in government. I was just wondering then [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1311.12s)]
*  where these would fall, because you've got former senior military figures, but they're not in the [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1315.9199999999998s)]
*  Israeli military, but maybe they're indicative of Israeli military thinking. So the former top [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1320.0s)]
*  attorney general of the military said, if you want to destroy Hamas, then you have to destroy Gaza, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1324.0s)]
*  because everything in Gaza, almost every building there is a stronghold for Hamas. Whilst another [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1328.4s)]
*  general, former general, the former head of the Israeli National Security Council, Major General [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1333.92s)]
*  Giora Ireland said that Israel should not shy away from the spread of epidemics and humanitarian [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1337.92s)]
*  disasters and occupy Gaza to reach victory faster. So where does all that fall basically? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1342.4s)]
*  Yeah, so there's, I mean, we have to understand that incitement is a separate crime under the [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1347.0400000000002s)]
*  UN Genocide Convention. So when we talk about intent and the dynamics of violence, that's [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1351.44s)]
*  Article 2 of the convention. And when we talk about incitement, we're talking about crime under [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1356.32s)]
*  Article 3. It's a separate crime. And it also means, by the way, that people could be held [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1362.1599999999999s)]
*  responsible to incitement, even if genocide doesn't follow, right? But certainly if genocide does [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1367.6s)]
*  follow, and especially, especially when incitement happens during the dynamics of violence, as we've [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1374.08s)]
*  seen, you've mentioned Major General Giora Ireland, who was the former head of the Israel National [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1380.24s)]
*  Security Council yesterday in a thoroughly genocidal piece in the large Israeli daily, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1384.48s)]
*  Eti Otochonot, right? Where again, basically reproducing this idea that all the people in Gaza [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1390.56s)]
*  are legitimate enemies, right? Again, half of them are under the age of 18. I want to remind everyone. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1396.24s)]
*  And also something that I think has been overlooked in Ireland's article yesterday, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1402.8s)]
*  again referring to the Palestinians in Gaza as Nazis, basically, right? [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1408.8s)]
*  Comparing the situation to Nazi Germany at the end of World War II. So indeed, these kinds of [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1414.1599999999999s)]
*  articles, when we have from the 7th of October, Israeli members of parliament who are calling [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1423.44s)]
*  basically for a second Nakba, quote unquote, and here we're talking about, of course, the Nakba is [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1429.6s)]
*  the destruction of Palestinian society in the 1948 war and the creation of the state of Israel, the [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1433.92s)]
*  mass deportations of 750,000 Palestinians and the destruction of hundreds of their villages. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1440.16s)]
*  And now we're seeing again, explicit calls for a second Nakba, which is indeed taking place in [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1446.48s)]
*  front of our eyes in Gaza, right? The mass, the forced displacement of more than a million and [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1453.04s)]
*  a half Palestinians from north to south Gaza. And now, by the way, Israel, important to say, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1458.3200000000002s)]
*  is also bombing the southern part of Gaza, where it told Palestinians to move for their safety, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1463.28s)]
*  right? So no place is safe in Gaza. But we're also seeing from day one, from the 7th of October, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1469.36s)]
*  Israeli journalists, senior Israeli journalists, TV anchors, and articles on TV calling to flatten [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1476.96s)]
*  Gaza, to turn Gaza into, quote, a slaughterhouse, to kill everyone in Gaza, calling for a million [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1486.0s)]
*  bodies, quote, unquote, and so on and so forth. Many, many, again, dozens of these pieces of [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1494.48s)]
*  evidence. And these are shamelessly, right, on social media, again, on TV and newspaper articles, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1499.68s)]
*  and they're ongoing, right? They're still six weeks into and we still see these proclamations. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1505.76s)]
*  These are not intended to destroy because they're not people with command authority, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1511.6s)]
*  but they definitely fall under incitement. And I want to remind everyone that in the, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1515.36s)]
*  we're on the genocide, in the post-war trials, post-genocide trials, journalists stood trial [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1519.28s)]
*  in the media case for incitement to genocide as the genocide was going on there in the case of [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1528.1599999999999s)]
*  radio and newspapers. So we definitely see this, and this adds to this annihilatory atmosphere, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1534.0s)]
*  basically. And again, it's anyone who follows Hebrew language sources, the Israeli public spaces [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1542.32s)]
*  and social media and media are just filled with annihilatory and destructive language. It's really, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1551.2s)]
*  really shocking. Finally, just in terms of accountability. So really, an example that [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1557.12s)]
*  always hung over my childhood was Bosnia as a particularly obscene, I suppose, case study in [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1562.8799999999999s)]
*  atrocities of modern times. And it's estimated that around 40,000 civilians were killed in between [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1569.52s)]
*  1992 and 1995 in Bosnia. The majority of people who actually died are soldiers. It was about [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1574.72s)]
*  over 100,000 in total died. 60% or so were soldiers. The rest were civilians. Nearly 70% [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1580.48s)]
*  were Bosniak Muslims. Over 7,000 Serb civilians were killed as well. I suppose you could argue [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1586.4s)]
*  the equivalent there would be with Israeli civilians. It's not exactly the same, obviously, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1593.04s)]
*  but in terms of the Bosnian Serb civilians suffered great atrocities. The first big massacre [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1597.12s)]
*  in the Bosnian War was actually of Serb civilians. But the point, I mean, firstly, Bosnia's pre-war [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1604.08s)]
*  population was twice that of Gaza. So after six weeks, the proportion of dead Palestinians is [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1610.3999999999999s)]
*  actually similar to that of Bosniaks after three years, which is pretty astonishing. And I say that [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1615.36s)]
*  partly the death toll, we don't know exactly. The Euro-Mediterranean human rights monitor chaired by [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1621.76s)]
*  Professor Richard Falk, Princeton, who's a former UN special rapporteur on Palestine, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1627.12s)]
*  suggests that the death toll in Gaza is nearer to over 16,000. But there was accountability in Bosnia [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1631.9199999999998s)]
*  as a point of making. You had actually a death toll, which is actually comparable over a much [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1638.0s)]
*  bigger space of time. You also there had Bosnian Serb civilians suffered as well, but we rightly [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1643.12s)]
*  see Bosnian Serb nationalist armies as the main aggressive instigator of what we would describe [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1651.4399999999998s)]
*  as genocide. But I suppose the difference is there was accountability there, and no one can rationally, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1656.08s)]
*  or people would look at Israel and go, this is a key Western state and ally. These atrocities [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1662.0s)]
*  were essentially being justified and rationalized by the West, who were ignoring blatant rhetoric, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1666.24s)]
*  intent, and incitement, not even commenting on it. They occasionally say Israel needs to abide by [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1671.6s)]
*  international law, but by never pointing out transgressions, that's a complete platitude, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1676.96s)]
*  that means nothing. What do you think of possible ever accountability in the way that Bosnia there [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1680.24s)]
*  was accountability? Yeah, so it's a very important question. There's also something [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1684.08s)]
*  to be said about prevention when we talk about genocide, but we might comment on that a bit later. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1690.32s)]
*  But in terms of accountability, so there is an issue that needs to be understood that Israel has [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1695.6799999999998s)]
*  impunity in the international legal system, right? I mean, it's clear because we have decades of [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1703.1999999999998s)]
*  violations of international law, war crimes, crimes against humanity. The mere fact of the [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1708.8799999999999s)]
*  the military occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip that has [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1714.56s)]
*  extended now for decades and decades and decades, so it's not temporary, according to international [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1719.1999999999998s)]
*  law, right? And the settlement project, of course, right? All these are violations of international law. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1724.24s)]
*  Israel has impunity, the repeated attacks on Gaza, the impunity that Israel enjoys is actually [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1731.6s)]
*  baked into the international legal system from the very beginning. What do I mean? The international [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1737.52s)]
*  legal system emerged really after World War II with the Holocaust clearly as a major context, [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1742.48s)]
*  and with the Holocaust, with the idea that the Holocaust, this or the other, as a unique event, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1749.6s)]
*  as exceptional, right? Now, this was very important because it meant that Jews actually are [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1756.16s)]
*  unique or exceptional people. Now, that's not very surprising when we think about Western, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1763.3600000000001s)]
*  the Judeo-Christian Western world, where Jews indeed play a foundational role, and the Nazis [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1768.88s)]
*  thought that Jews actually played a foundational role in this world that they wanted to destroy in [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1773.6000000000001s)]
*  order to create a Nazi world. So the international legal system came and, you know, turned this [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1777.92s)]
*  Nazi portrayal on its head, and now Jews again play a positive foundational role in the Western [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1783.5200000000002s)]
*  world, and that's why the Holocaust after the 1990s and the end of the Cold War becomes this [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1788.5600000000002s)]
*  marker of Western identity, because the Holocaust is unique, because Jews as a people are unique, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1793.04s)]
*  and therefore Israel as a self-proclaimed Jewish state is also unique or exceptional, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1799.44s)]
*  and that's really the basis of its impunity. The idea from the very beginning that Israel could [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1804.3999999999999s)]
*  commit really any crime under international law, but, you know, certainly genocide, even though we [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1808.96s)]
*  don't have this hierarchy in international law, right, became really unspeakable, unimaginable, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1815.12s)]
*  right. Now, because of what we're seeing now, because of the explicit intent, because of the [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1822.24s)]
*  level of incitement, because of this annihilatory language in Israeli society and politics and media, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1829.44s)]
*  because of the dynamics of violence that we're all witnessing, right, 45 days, and we're all witnessing [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1835.68s)]
*  this mass slaughter, right, the invasion of hospitals, starvation policies, mass killing, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1842.08s)]
*  horrific destruction, right, I mean Gazanah looks worse than Ukrainian cities under Russian [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1849.6s)]
*  boggling and invasion, right. Because of all this, the system, the system of international law that [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1855.12s)]
*  is based on Israel impunity in many ways is now shaking, right, and we're seeing it in various [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1861.9199999999998s)]
*  ways, we're seeing it in referrals to the ICC, we're seeing it in the way that the ICC prosecutor [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1867.52s)]
*  himself is talking about what's going on very, very, you know, very cautiously and keeping it all [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1872.96s)]
*  still within the frame of war crimes for now, right, but it's looking more and more likely, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1880.48s)]
*  right, that if the ICC moves forward, as I think it should, by the way, in investigating and issuing [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1886.72s)]
*  arrest warrants and ideally putting on trial Hamas people who planned and perpetrated the massacre [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1892.96s)]
*  on 7th of October, it's looking more and more likely that the ICC will have no choice, right, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1900.56s)]
*  and the prosecutor will have no choice but to actually put also to issue arrest warrants and [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1906.48s)]
*  accelerate the investigation, the ongoing investigation on the situation in Palestine since [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1911.76s)]
*  2021 and issue arrest warrants and ideally put Israelis on trial as well, even if only for war [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1916.1599999999999s)]
*  crimes and perhaps crimes against humanity, right, but this will be an unprecedented [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1924.64s)]
*  issue, right, that Israel's might face the international legal system in this way, so, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1929.92s)]
*  you know, it's, I do hope this will happen, it seems with every passing day more and more likely, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1935.6000000000001s)]
*  so yes, there is a chance that something like this could happen, of course, thinking within [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1947.44s)]
*  the perspective of genocide here is even more important because I do think that we have to [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1952.24s)]
*  adhere to the facts and to the truth and what we are seeing in front of our eyes is an unfolding [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1957.2s)]
*  genocide and so if Israel is in due indeed face the international legal system here and the, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1962.48s)]
*  you know, arrest warrants and investigation in the ICC, it should also include the crime of genocide. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1968.24s)]
*  Just finally then, prevention, because that is actually important to note, because that if, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1974.8s)]
*  when you said before, for example, this is a textbook case of genocide, I suppose, and this [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1978.24s)]
*  again is about interpretation and how our words are understood, because many would say, might go, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1982.32s)]
*  well that's fatalistic because obviously the vast majority of Palestinians have not been killed, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1986.88s)]
*  Piers Morgan's response to me actually, I should have added, was it's not genocide because they [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1991.52s)]
*  haven't killed everyone, obviously that hasn't ever happened actually in any genocide, even though [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=1995.36s)]
*  there are different scales of killing obviously, but that is this, that should this be described [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2000.96s)]
*  as the risk of a genocide or, and therefore that helps kind of language of prevention, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2007.76s)]
*  we're talking about this could happen rather than is happening, or is it correct to say this is a [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2014.24s)]
*  genocide even though the logical conclusion of that genocide can still be prevented, does that [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2018.56s)]
*  make sense? Yeah, no, so you're talking about two different things, one is how to stop, you know, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2023.2s)]
*  what we're seeing in Gaza is a genocidal assault, as I explained, right, so the question of how it [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2028.24s)]
*  stops, which is a very complex question in itself, right, even though it seems like we should all [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2033.76s)]
*  stand behind the idea of a ceasefire and saving lives, right, but stopping a genocide, and you [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2041.36s)]
*  know, again, states have a responsibility according to the genocide convention, according to article [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2048.32s)]
*  one, to intervene to stop an unfolding genocide, and that's why, by the way, the Center for [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2054.72s)]
*  Constitutional Rights has filed a lawsuit last week against US President Biden and [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2060.32s)]
*  State Secretary Blinken and Defense Secretary Austin for complicity with Israel genocide, but also [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2068.0800000000004s)]
*  calling on them to adhere to the responsibility, you know, not to contribute to stopping the [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2077.2000000000003s)]
*  genocide and not to providing further arms and diplomatic cover to Israel as it perpetrates [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2082.2400000000002s)]
*  genocide, so stopping a genocide is one thing, it's important to say that genocide is always [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2089.2s)]
*  a process, right, and we can think about the longer term process of Israeli mass violence [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2096.0s)]
*  against Palestinians since the 1948 Nakba until today, but we can also think about the genocidal [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2100.72s)]
*  assault on Gaza since 7th of October as a process, so it never happens, you know, that everyone is [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2106.24s)]
*  killed immediately, right, in this kind of a way, right, and indeed the Nazi assault on Jews, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2113.04s)]
*  if we think about this paradigmatic case, right, was a long, took years, it took the Nazis years [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2121.44s)]
*  until they came to the final solution of the Jewish question, and actually in the spring of 1942, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2127.44s)]
*  so very late in the war, right, the final version of the final solution of the Jewish question, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2132.96s)]
*  that is to murder every Jew within German reach, right, so these are processes, these are not [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2137.92s)]
*  an event, so this comment about why Israel has not killed all the people in Gaza so far in six weeks, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2144.32s)]
*  right, which has killed a lot of people in Gaza in six weeks, and as you said, we also know that [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2150.96s)]
*  there are thousands and thousands of people buried under the rubble, so we actually don't know [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2156.08s)]
*  the exact numbers right so far, so that's one thing to say, prevention then, which is the other [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2160.32s)]
*  element of this, is referring to Palestinians in the West Bank under Israeli occupation and East [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2166.88s)]
*  Jerusalem under Israeli occupation, and then also Israeli Palestinians, the Palestinian citizens of [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2172.48s)]
*  Israel, almost two million people, and this is where prevention kicks in, because if we think [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2177.28s)]
*  about the idea that all Palestinians in Gaza are enemies, right, and if we think about [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2183.04s)]
*  the annihilatory language in Israeli politics and society and media now, right, and if we think about [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2190.56s)]
*  the fact that Palestinian citizens of Israel have been actually portrayed as enemies, potential [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2196.48s)]
*  enemies, since the very beginning, so the 156,000 Palestinians who survived the Nakbaan remained [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2201.6s)]
*  within what became Israel, right, in 1948, were immediately put under military rule until 1966, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2207.6s)]
*  so immediately considered actually potential enemies, right, but also if we just think about [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2215.04s)]
*  the recent history, 2018, the Israeli Jewish nation state law, which actually portrayed [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2221.28s)]
*  all Palestinian citizens of the state, right, as second-class citizens, right, so we have a lot of [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2227.6800000000003s)]
*  indications historically, but also now with the annihilatory language, that Palestinian citizens [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2234.2400000000002s)]
*  of Israel, and there's of course hundreds of people arrested, we know that the settler minister [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2241.92s)]
*  of national security, Itamar Ben-Gil, has issued thousands of weapons to people in Israel, also the [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2247.52s)]
*  West Bank, and we have set up hundreds of self-defense units in Israel, so Palestinian citizens of Israel [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2254.5600000000004s)]
*  are very right now to be very fearful of what awaits them in this atmosphere, of all Palestinians [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2262.1600000000003s)]
*  in Gaza are enemies, because this extends, right, to all Palestinians under Israeli rule. In the West [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2269.28s)]
*  Bank, we have an intensification since 7th of October of an already quite intense ethnic cleansing [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2274.64s)]
*  campaign in Area C, which is 60% of the occupied West Bank, again with hundreds of arrests with [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2280.08s)]
*  actually more than 15 whole communities of Palestinians in the West Bank uprooted, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2287.12s)]
*  enforceably displaced since 7th of October, hundreds of Palestinians have been killed in [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2292.0s)]
*  the West Bank since 7th of October, and then hundreds in 2023 before 7th of October, right, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2296.8799999999997s)]
*  so of course the escalation of violence against Palestinians under Israel occupation, but the [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2302.56s)]
*  annihilatory language, the ongoing genocide in Gaza now in the history of looking at Palestinians [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2308.7999999999997s)]
*  under Israeli control everywhere as basically enemies, right, this means that we should be [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2314.7999999999997s)]
*  paying attention from the perspective of prevention at the West Bank and East Jerusalem and Palestinians [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2320.24s)]
*  in Israel, and this is not receiving anywhere near the attention that it should, it's certainly [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2327.12s)]
*  within the frame of prevention when we think about the genocidal assault in Gaza, and with every [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2332.32s)]
*  passing day there is more and more to be concerned about what awaits to Palestinians in other areas [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2339.6800000000003s)]
*  under Israeli occupation and rule. Raz, firstly thank you so much for that, that was meticulous, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2345.92s)]
*  and I think it's so important to go into the details of this just because I think the argument [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2352.88s)]
*  is so compelling and overwhelming that the detail makes it very difficult to pick apart, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2358.96s)]
*  and though I'm sure there will be those obviously who are apologists for the horror currently [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2365.04s)]
*  being unleashed against Gaza who will seek to do that, but it's such an overwhelming case, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2371.28s)]
*  and I think people can see it was it's grounded not in emotion but in very solid [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2376.08s)]
*  and compelling evidence, so I can't thank you enough Raz for being able to just go through all [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2382.96s)]
*  of this in such detail and provide this overwhelming but chilling case. Thank you so much. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2387.68s)]
*  Thanks so much and thanks for watching and listening, do press like and subscribe [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeEnjULHe0&t=2396.24s)]
