# Trump Gaza Threat Is MUCH WORSE Than It's Being Described w/. Heidi Matthews
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8)
*  Donald Trump's threat to forcibly deport the entire surviving population of Gaza has been [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=0.0s)]
*  widely discussed, although often in quite disturbing ways. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=9.4s)]
*  A lot of the Western media reporting has been using clinical, euphemistic terms like [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=14.24s)]
*  proposal, for example, as though this is like a business proposal for discussion rather [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=22.16s)]
*  than a heinous criminal act. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=28.36s)]
*  But it has been often discussed, including by those of us who oppose as well as genocide [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=30.48s)]
*  in terms of being ethnic cleansing. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=38.88s)]
*  Now, this is really important, this discussion with Heidi Matthews, who I've interviewed [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=41.36s)]
*  before and I often look to on issues to do with international law. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=45.28s)]
*  She's an assistant professor of law at Osgoode Hall Law School at York University and [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  someone who's just been giving exceptional legal commentary all the way through this [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=56.36s)]
*  particular horror and has raised very important, I think, critiques of using the term [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=61.56s)]
*  ethnic cleansing in this context and why we should be talking about genocide. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=67.88s)]
*  Obviously, we have many of us been using genocide full stop, but this act should be [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=73.16s)]
*  described as an act of genocide. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=77.6s)]
*  Hey, Heidi, great to see you. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=79.76s)]
*  First of all, thanks for joining us from Snowy, Toronto. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=80.76s)]
*  I know you've been snowed in essentially over there. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=85.08000000000001s)]
*  Three days now at the airport hotel. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=87.80000000000001s)]
*  Oh, that is miserable. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=90.08000000000001s)]
*  That really is. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=91.76s)]
*  Yeah, I've been not that long, but it's not it's no life. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=93.44000000000001s)]
*  Let's just start with, OK, Donald Trump's plan. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  Why is it a genocidal act? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  Why do you think we shouldn't be using the term ethnic cleansing? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=103.88000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so there's a few key points here that I want to make sure that we desegregate. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  So so one on the point of ethnic cleansing. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=112.4s)]
*  At the most basic level, you know, I'm coming to this conflict analytically [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=116.04s)]
*  from the lens of international law. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=120.84s)]
*  And ethnic cleansing is not a category [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=122.92s)]
*  that's used analytically in international law. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=126.88000000000001s)]
*  So it's simply not a category. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=129.68s)]
*  It does come up [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=131.72s)]
*  most pointedly and probably only, I think, in terms of the jurisprudence [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=135.36s)]
*  with respect to the genocide in Bosnia. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=140.12s)]
*  So it does so, though, as a way of kind of explaining. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=144.2s)]
*  And I'm talking about the International Court of Justice here [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  had a seminal judgment in 2007 and then another one [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=152.56s)]
*  in 2015 respecting Croatia. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=156.64s)]
*  It does so as a way of arguing against a conclusion of genocide [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=160.11999999999998s)]
*  in the sense that the idea of ethnic cleansing, so of [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  clearing a territory of a particular ethnic group [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=169.96s)]
*  for the court was evidence not of special genocidal intent, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=175.88s)]
*  which is the intent to destroy in whole or in part a protected population. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=180.84s)]
*  Right. But rather was evidence of the intent simply to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=185.68s)]
*  displace or move the people off the land, which is not to say that that action is legal. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=190.08s)]
*  It can constitute a host of crimes, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=194.52s)]
*  including the crime against humanity of forced displacement. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=197.28s)]
*  But it was evidence for the court of a different kind of intention [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=200.84s)]
*  as opposed to a genocidal intention. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=204.12s)]
*  So that's the first kind of red flag. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=206.04s)]
*  Just very quickly, the second [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=208.64s)]
*  problematic aspect with respect to ethnic cleansing [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=211.6s)]
*  is the language itself. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=215.32s)]
*  So it harkens back to really these Nazi ideas around ethnicity [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=216.92s)]
*  and essentialism and the idea that, you know, territories need to be cleansed [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=221.4s)]
*  of an aspect that is, what, dirty or contaminating or something like that. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=226.12s)]
*  So I think the language itself is fairly heinous and we should remove it from our vocabulary. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=230.44s)]
*  And related to that, with respect to the genocide question, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=235.96s)]
*  the ICJ in its various orders with respect to South Africa's case [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=240.0s)]
*  against Israel, right, claiming genocide, has found [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=245.52s)]
*  that the Palestinians living in Gaza are protected as a national group. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=249.96s)]
*  They may also be protected as an ethnic group under the Genocide Convention. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=254.44s)]
*  But for the purposes of self-determination and statehood, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=258.52s)]
*  I think it's really essential that we focus on the nationality [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=262.08s)]
*  component as opposed to the ethnicity component here. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=265.48s)]
*  I mean, do you think part of this is a misnomer, misunderstanding of genocide, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=269.52s)]
*  which exists, why it exists. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=272.76s)]
*  And a lot of people understand genocide to be [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=274.4s)]
*  the physical extermination of every last member of a particular ethnic group. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=278.08s)]
*  That's how people often understand it. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=282.52s)]
*  But that's not actually the specific qualified genocide, is it? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=284.44s)]
*  No, not at all. So actually, far from it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=289.79999999999995s)]
*  I could make it seems like I'm making an entire career [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=294.32s)]
*  out of making this point in various contexts. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=296.56s)]
*  I've done so, you know, with respect to Canada. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=298.23999999999995s)]
*  So, you know, Canada is participating, has participated [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=300.56s)]
*  and continues to participate in an ongoing settler colonial [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=305.23999999999995s)]
*  genocidal project against various indigenous peoples and nations here. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  It's an argument I've been making for a long time, and that's supported by various [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=312.68s)]
*  scholars and activists and national inquiries. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=316.32s)]
*  And certainly has nothing to do with the complete extermination of a people. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=320.08s)]
*  Right. And so so with respect to, you know, every other instance, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=324.12s)]
*  including Israel, Palestine, the same law is going to apply. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=329.0s)]
*  Just to be a little dogmatic about it [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=332.15999999999997s)]
*  in terms of the actual just getting the actual law on the table. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=336.12s)]
*  The Genocide Convention is the relevant convention. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=339.64s)]
*  The law of genocide, as it appears in that convention, is reproduced [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=342.76s)]
*  in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=346.88s)]
*  All states parties to the ICC have also implemented that law [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=350.40000000000003s)]
*  as part of their domestic legislation. Right. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=355.32s)]
*  So it's going to be the law of the UK, Canada, other countries [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=357.04s)]
*  that are parties to the court. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=359.52s)]
*  So genocide means any of five [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=361.8s)]
*  underlying criminal acts as they're referred to [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=365.88s)]
*  when committed with a specific intent. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=369.88s)]
*  Sometimes that's called special intent. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=373.2s)]
*  Sometimes the Latin dolus specialis is used. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=375.71999999999997s)]
*  Sometimes we just refer to that as genocidal intent. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=379.23999999999995s)]
*  It all means the same thing. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=381.88s)]
*  And that intent is about the destruction in whole or in part [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=383.64s)]
*  of a national, ethnical, racial or religious group as such. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=387.91999999999996s)]
*  So a couple of important things there. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=392.15999999999997s)]
*  Destruction is not limited to the concept of physical destruction, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=395.24s)]
*  but also encapsulates the idea of biological destruction. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=399.36s)]
*  We can talk more about that, but that refers at its most basic level [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=404.64s)]
*  to the capacity of a protected group to regenerate itself over time [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=408.8s)]
*  in order and otherwise to continue to exist as a group [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=412.76s)]
*  and not just a series of human beings or whatever. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=415.8s)]
*  And then the other part is the in whole or in part. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=420.2s)]
*  So the important thing here is whether a part, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=423.4s)]
*  a substantial part of the group is affected. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=427.76s)]
*  And so there's nothing like a requirement of, you know, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=430.08s)]
*  total elimination or destruction. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=432.4s)]
*  So, I mean, what's important here to emphasize is the attempt to [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=436.03999999999996s)]
*  present this in humanitarian gaps, voluntary migration. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=442.23999999999995s)]
*  You know, that's how this has been promoted. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=446.96s)]
*  And though in Trump's plan that inherently, I mean, well, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=450.28s)]
*  I mean, he's actually trying to pretend that, oh, of course, the Palestinian people. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=454.24s)]
*  I mean, obviously he would, you know, if you're tempting, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=456.96s)]
*  it's obviously the vast majority of the Palestinian people [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=460.59999999999997s)]
*  would remain in their homeland. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=462.36s)]
*  And even he if he thought about, you know, if he was pushed, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=464.4s)]
*  that it could not clearly concede every last Palestinian is completely [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=467.15999999999997s)]
*  hypothetical, universal would all want to leave. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=470.64s)]
*  That's just not a tenable argument. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=472.71999999999997s)]
*  So, but that point there about Volodya, I mean, is the fact [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=475.4s)]
*  the reason it's not voluntary migration is because the meat. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=479.56s)]
*  I mean, you mentioned that biological. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=484.15999999999997s)]
*  I mean, 83 percent of all plant life in Gaza has been destroyed. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=485.44s)]
*  It's forensic architecture. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=488.32s)]
*  Fine food, you know, agriculture, food production, that kind of thing. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=489.35999999999996s)]
*  Hospitals have been destroyed. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=492.76s)]
*  Obviously, most homes, 93 percent or so of homes have been damaged or destroyed. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=494.08s)]
*  So it's not voluntary. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=498.15999999999997s)]
*  That's by that's that's that's coercive. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=499.2s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=503.64s)]
*  And, you know, on a number of levels. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=504.56s)]
*  So number one, the this, you know, in quotation marks, plan is being put forward [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=506.24s)]
*  not by the Palestinian people living in Gaza, right, who have the right [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=511.64s)]
*  to determine for themselves what their future will look like [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=515.84s)]
*  politically, culturally and otherwise. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=518.6800000000001s)]
*  OK, so it's being put forward by Trump and now by Netanyahu. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=520.8s)]
*  Right. So the leader of the occupying power, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=526.28s)]
*  Gaza is still remains occupied to the extent that Israel maintains [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=529.0s)]
*  effective control over it, which to a large degree it does. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=533.88s)]
*  Right. And so this idea of voluntary or humanitarian [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=538.32s)]
*  ism in this context is, you know, odious for a number of reasons. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=542.76s)]
*  And I'd also just point out, if you actually look at the Rome Statute of the ICC [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=546.64s)]
*  and the definition of forced displacement as a crime against humanity, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=551.76s)]
*  it makes very, very clear that forced doesn't just mean physical force, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=555.48s)]
*  but the application of any kind of coercive circumstances, really. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=560.2s)]
*  So, you know, even if nobody intervened to, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=564.0s)]
*  to, you know, implement Trump's so-called plan, I think [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=567.6s)]
*  were the borders to Gaza to be open, obviously, many people would leave [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=571.6800000000001s)]
*  simply on the basis that their lives have been made impossible in the space. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=576.08s)]
*  And that alone would constitute coercion. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=581.08s)]
*  So we're all, you know, we've gone way, way, way beyond any discussion [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=584.0s)]
*  of consent or voluntariness in this space. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=587.5600000000001s)]
*  I mean, the mechanics of what he's talking about in practice [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=590.6s)]
*  as well would involve, we've already seen, obviously, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=595.6800000000001s)]
*  we don't know how many people have been killed both directly through violence, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=599.12s)]
*  but also indirectly through the destruction of the means of life in Gaza. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=601.9200000000001s)]
*  But the mechanics in practice of, we don't know how many. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=608.44s)]
*  I mean, he keeps, it's alarming. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=611.0400000000001s)]
*  He keeps saying about 1.7, 1.8 million people in Gaza. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=612.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. When the pre-war population is up to 2.3, maybe 2.4 million. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=615.2s)]
*  So, I mean, that itself is deeply alarming [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=618.52s)]
*  because it suggests that he thinks hundreds of thousands of people [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=621.6s)]
*  implicitly may be killed if that's the figures he's been given [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=624.36s)]
*  by the US intelligence services. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=626.72s)]
*  But in any case, the mechanics itself would have to be, you would. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=628.2s)]
*  Some, you're right. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=632.4s)]
*  I mean, there's lots of people, Palestinians in Gaza, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=633.32s)]
*  who didn't go fund these in order to leave to get help, you know, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=635.36s)]
*  hospital treatment abroad, that kind of thing. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=639.08s)]
*  But you would have to violently, you would have to use huge amounts of force. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=641.2s)]
*  And the Israeli army, obviously, there's the presumption [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=646.3599999999999s)]
*  they will break the ceasefire and renew their murderous attrition [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=650.52s)]
*  and then to wipe out what remains to then make Trump's [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=654.12s)]
*  the plan seem even more, you know, impossible to argue against. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=658.8s)]
*  But I mean, that's the point, isn't it? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=663.64s)]
*  You can't, with a forcible displacement, would have to involve [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=664.8s)]
*  various acts of violence, would have to accompany it. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=668.4s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, most of the population has already been forcibly displaced [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=672.0s)]
*  inside of Gaza. Right. So so so I think as again, as I said before, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=675.72s)]
*  that ship has sailed a long time. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=679.6800000000001s)]
*  Exactly. That ship has sailed a long time ago. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=681.32s)]
*  But just for the purposes of addressing, you know, this particular conversation. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=683.72s)]
*  Yeah, you're absolutely right. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=688.0400000000001s)]
*  I mean, you can imagine, I guess, a number of ways, I think clearly. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=689.0s)]
*  It's a horrible thing to imagine, but there would be, you know, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=693.28s)]
*  I think a number of different methods, let's say, deployed to make [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=696.0400000000001s)]
*  this kind of plan a reality. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=700.24s)]
*  Some of them might look more forceful than others. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=701.8000000000001s)]
*  You know, in the context of the the the war in the former Yugoslavia, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=705.16s)]
*  you had people being driven to the borders by, you know, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=708.84s)]
*  Serb army officials and this kind of thing. Right. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=712.48s)]
*  It's still forcible displacement, even though it was packaged under [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=714.8000000000001s)]
*  sometimes under more humanitarian conditions. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=718.6800000000001s)]
*  But I mean, just think back to 1947, 48 and the original Nakba. Right. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=721.36s)]
*  So 750,000 people are being leave. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=725.28s)]
*  What was that mandate Palestine? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=729.04s)]
*  And they leave under a variety of conditions. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=731.08s)]
*  You can look to the history to understand this. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=733.6s)]
*  There's obviously debate about the extent to which [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=735.32s)]
*  violent force was used or not in certain circumstances. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=738.24s)]
*  That displacement did happen, you know, quite [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=741.2s)]
*  obviously at the end of a gun. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=745.84s)]
*  But in other circumstances, people were were in fear. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=748.08s)]
*  Their homes have been destroyed, you know, whatever. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=752.2s)]
*  There's all of that still constitutes forced displacement. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=754.16s)]
*  Just links to this, the language that Donald Trump has used [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=759.0s)]
*  in order to make the case for his criminal threat, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=762.16s)]
*  which is, I mean, he said amongst other things that Gaza is a demolition site. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=767.4s)]
*  He keeps saying that. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=771.3199999999999s)]
*  But he's also said Gaza is he said is hell. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=772.8s)]
*  He said it's not habitable. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=776.88s)]
*  And he said a civilization has been wiped out. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=778.64s)]
*  Now, many might then look at article two of the genocide convention. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=781.88s)]
*  See deliberately inflicting on the group. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=786.8s)]
*  You mentioned this conditions of life calculated [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=788.52s)]
*  to bring about its physical destruction in whole and part [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=790.6s)]
*  conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=793.6800000000001s)]
*  Gaza is not habitable. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=797.76s)]
*  A civilization has been wiped out. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=799.48s)]
*  If you're South Africa's legal team at the International Court of Justice, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=802.0s)]
*  would you not use those particular comments by Donald Trump [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=806.12s)]
*  to make to strengthen the case that Israel has obviously committed genocide in Gaza? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=811.44s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=818.48s)]
*  And then, you know, kind of the subsequent endorsement of of the whole, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=819.16s)]
*  again, quote unquote, planned by Netanyahu and other members of the government. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=823.1999999999999s)]
*  I mean, I yeah, I think that's a clear sort of [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=826.3199999999999s)]
*  it's much worse in a way. Right. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=831.3199999999999s)]
*  So so genocide, again, doesn't require the total destruction of a civilization. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=832.88s)]
*  Like that, that's a that's a lot of destruction, you know, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=837.48s)]
*  and it's a district, a destruction that's not just about a protected group as such. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=839.88s)]
*  It's about like the entirety of their cultural existence. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=844.6s)]
*  Right. And political. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=849.0400000000001s)]
*  So that's that statement actually goes way beyond what would be required. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=850.16s)]
*  Lex Lata, right. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=855.76s)]
*  By the the the law of genocide, to be clear about that. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=857.28s)]
*  But also, I want to be clear, too, about the fact that the International [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=860.44s)]
*  Criminal Court, right. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=866.2s)]
*  So the chamber of the court that confirmed [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=867.28s)]
*  or rather that issued the arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Galand [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=871.44s)]
*  has already determined, right, that there are reasonable grounds [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=875.8000000000001s)]
*  to believe that those two individuals have intentionally created [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=880.2800000000001s)]
*  conditions of life calculated to bring about the destruction [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=885.48s)]
*  of part of the civilian population. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=888.4000000000001s)]
*  And it is done so by pursuing a policy of starvation as a method of warfare. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=890.6400000000001s)]
*  Right. So that's actually a finding that's that's already been made [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=895.6400000000001s)]
*  at the level of reasonable grounds to believe as a standard of proof. Right. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=899.56s)]
*  So this is, you know, so much of this argument is has already [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=904.92s)]
*  even judicially been determined to a large degree. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=908.2399999999999s)]
*  So, you know, if we're not all on kind of serious notice [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=910.88s)]
*  or notice of an incredibly serious risk that yet another genocidal act [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=916.2399999999999s)]
*  is at least has been put on the table, right, and could be carried out. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=921.52s)]
*  Then, I mean, I don't know what universe we're all inhabiting. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=925.56s)]
*  It just goes pro publica. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=929.48s)]
*  The U.S. investigative media outlet found last April [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=930.72s)]
*  that two government U.S. government agencies, the State Department's Refugee Agency [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=936.0s)]
*  and USAID had concluded Israel was deliberately preventing aid [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=941.04s)]
*  from entering into Gaza. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=944.6800000000001s)]
*  So, again, it's a finding, not just it's literally a finding of the U.S. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=946.2s)]
*  government's agency, which then legally obliged the U.S. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=950.44s)]
*  to cease supplying arms to Israel, and they defied their own laws. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=953.6s)]
*  And even if they cease fire, the required levels have not reached [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=957.28s)]
*  what they were agreed to. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=960.2s)]
*  Well, they were violating the terms of the ceasefire by refusing to allow them in. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=961.68s)]
*  I would equate to actually, interestingly enough, not from a ruling party, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=965.36s)]
*  not a ruling politician in Israel, not a member of Likud, not Ben Gevire. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=969.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm going to quote Yair Golan, who is the leader of the so-called Zionist left. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=975.56s)]
*  And he said on the podcast of Haaretz, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=982.16s)]
*  the supposedly kind of Israeli progressive newspaper, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=985.0s)]
*  we'd all like to wake up one spring morning and find that seven million [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=988.2800000000001s)]
*  Palestinians who live between the sea and the river have simply disappeared. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=992.36s)]
*  That's what he said. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=995.96s)]
*  And the reason I'm saying that is, again, often exploiting [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=997.12s)]
*  people's ignorance of genocide. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1001.1600000000001s)]
*  You've got this mantra of if Israel wanted to commit genocide, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1002.48s)]
*  they could have killed every Palestinian on the 8th of October, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1007.08s)]
*  as if any genocide in history that's ever happened. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1009.12s)]
*  We've already covered all that. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1011.36s)]
*  But the point I'm making by bringing up what Yair Golan has set [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1012.84s)]
*  is quite interesting in terms of the mechanics of this genocide [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1016.4s)]
*  and any genocide in that the Israeli state starts [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1020.1600000000001s)]
*  from the basis that it desires the Palestinian people to not be there. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1025.16s)]
*  But it works backwards from that point. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1030.96s)]
*  But it works within the particular constraints of the time, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1034.88s)]
*  military constraints, international pressure such as exists [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1039.96s)]
*  and diplomatic pressure within the Middle East. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1045.16s)]
*  Do you see what I mean? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1048.68s)]
*  That's basically what he's getting out there, actually, isn't it? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1049.4s)]
*  He's saying, well, ideally, we'd get rid of all of them, but we can't do that. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1051.5200000000002s)]
*  And all Israeli politicians are in that zone. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1054.3600000000001s)]
*  The Israeli state is in the zone. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1057.0s)]
*  But they can only put that, you know, there's constraints [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1058.4s)]
*  which then diminish or increase in a given time. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1062.5600000000002s)]
*  And Trump's expanded that possibility, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1066.48s)]
*  which is why we're talking about in this case, for example, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1068.6s)]
*  the forcible removal of the surviving population Gaza. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1071.4399999999998s)]
*  You know, and I think so, I would say like the forceful [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1076.6s)]
*  movement and then maybe something like the total assimilation of the rest [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1079.36s)]
*  or something like this, you know what I mean? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1082.6799999999998s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, I think we're just talking about the range of [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1083.6799999999998s)]
*  of what's what's sayable in the space politically. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1087.3999999999999s)]
*  You know, international law will have a lot to do with that [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1091.08s)]
*  in terms of conditioning the discourse discourses that seem more or less possible. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1093.6399999999999s)]
*  And we're in a, you know, sadly, in a universe where [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1098.44s)]
*  talk of of genocide, rightly or wrongly, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1102.8s)]
*  sorry, ethnic cleansing, rightly, wrongly and quite rightly, I think, genocide, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1106.44s)]
*  other crimes against humanity and war crimes that are equally as heinous [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1109.3200000000002s)]
*  in the sense that we shouldn't think about these crimes [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1113.3200000000002s)]
*  and in some kind of like hierarchy of heinousness or atrocity. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1115.48s)]
*  Those categories don't seem to hold any, not any. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1120.24s)]
*  They seem to hold very little persuasive force [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1124.92s)]
*  with respect to the American government and Israeli government at the moment. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1127.32s)]
*  And even, you know, these other sort of more more middle powers [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1132.6s)]
*  who ordinarily take international law very, very seriously. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1137.72s)]
*  And and today seem to do so less and less. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1141.48s)]
*  And I will say this is not even just something that's [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1145.04s)]
*  this is not unique to the Israel-Palestine situation. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1148.04s)]
*  So we recently saw, you know, the far right Italian government send back [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1151.48s)]
*  and accused war criminal to Libya, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1156.2s)]
*  you know, in in spite of the fact that there was an open ICC arrest warrant [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1160.68s)]
*  for this individual. Why? Because Italy works quite closely [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1165.3600000000001s)]
*  with the government in Libya and this particular individual to facilitate [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1169.28s)]
*  the suppression of migration from from Libya to Italy and other parts [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1172.8s)]
*  of southern Europe. Right. So so in other words, the political [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1176.96s)]
*  interests just aren't aligning [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1181.4s)]
*  with these categories that we've developed since, frankly, the Holocaust [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1185.16s)]
*  to understand, you know, really what the brightest of red lines [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1190.4s)]
*  are when it comes to human behavior. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1194.88s)]
*  The other thing that got linked to that, that I want to just ask you about, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1198.64s)]
*  the other thing I want to talk to you about was [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1202.1200000000001s)]
*  if this happens, that's just I mean, this is a grim thing to discuss. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1204.8400000000001s)]
*  But Donald Trump, at the moment, master of all he surveys within [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1208.6000000000001s)]
*  the American context. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1213.24s)]
*  If Gaza is emptied [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1216.96s)]
*  violently of its surviving population, I'm asking just legally speaking, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1221.2s)]
*  because at the moment, obviously, you've got the kind of, you know, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1226.1200000000001s)]
*  the the attempt to, you know, the the U.S. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1229.88s)]
*  sanctioning the International Criminal Court, including its chief prosecutor [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1232.6s)]
*  and staff and various member states, the ICC refusing to enforce [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1235.44s)]
*  the arrest warrants. That's one thing undermining the legal architecture [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1240.16s)]
*  international of the international order. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1243.8400000000001s)]
*  But if this happens, I mean, we're talking about such a naked, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1246.2s)]
*  shameless crime. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1250.92s)]
*  What does that mean for any semblance of a kind of international [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1253.8400000000001s)]
*  order, a legal order? [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1258.96s)]
*  I mean, you kind of get to the point where you think it just doesn't survive that. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1260.5600000000002s)]
*  It's too heinous, too shameless a crime. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1265.8000000000002s)]
*  You know, U.S. then buys up a desolate land to turn it into a giant casino. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1269.52s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, no, it's the bleakest of bleak horizons, really. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1275.28s)]
*  You know, I think partly we would want to see [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1280.76s)]
*  what the reaction would be from other states if [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1284.4s)]
*  an attempt was actually made to to do this in one form or another. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1289.2s)]
*  Right. Even even let's imagine a form which doesn't try to rid Gaza of everybody, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1293.44s)]
*  but just most of them are sent some other kind of iteration rate of this idea. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1299.0s)]
*  You know, states in the West, right, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1303.68s)]
*  including Canada and the United Kingdom very prominently [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1308.52s)]
*  have have been, you know, put forward and supported, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1312.84s)]
*  you know, about 25 years ago, this idea of the responsibility to protect, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1317.08s)]
*  which oddly was actually endorsed in the intervention in Libya. Right. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1320.84s)]
*  We see the disaster that's that's that's befallen us from that. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1324.88s)]
*  But it's a legal it's a quasi legal doctrine. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1328.76s)]
*  It's also mostly a political doctrine that that would basically give cover of, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1331.04s)]
*  if not law, at least a sense of morality to states to intervene [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1335.72s)]
*  in a situation where the state that's responsible for individuals, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1341.04s)]
*  whether they're citizens or in this case, an occupied people, right, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1345.32s)]
*  is unwilling or unable to protect them. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1348.72s)]
*  And in this case, actually, you know, quite willing to inflict [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1350.72s)]
*  genocide and other crimes upon them would militarily intervene [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1355.0s)]
*  to stop or challenge that behavior. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1358.24s)]
*  And so, you know, there's a question about whether whether the Arab states [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1359.88s)]
*  would do that or whether other states would do that. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1363.08s)]
*  And I think if we if we have a situation where there is no resist [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1366.96s)]
*  resistance from other nations [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1370.16s)]
*  on the basis of something like the responsibility to protect. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1374.04s)]
*  Right. Then I think you're quite right. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1377.56s)]
*  There is no, you know, the guardrails have totally come down as it were. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1379.28s)]
*  And I think we would be in a very, very different moment. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1385.36s)]
*  I mean, that's funny. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1388.68s)]
*  That's, you know, in the moment, I keep talking about the need [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1389.52s)]
*  to hammer away at the idea that however farfetched or utopian [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1393.24s)]
*  it might seem that Western politicians one day will have to face [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1397.92s)]
*  legal accountability and be hauled up into the courts is that if this is normalized, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1401.76s)]
*  then we have a descent into violent barbarism, where you have great powers, which [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1406.36s)]
*  can behave like gangsters as they did, obviously, in the past. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1413.1200000000001s)]
*  They obviously, you know, divided the world up and into spoils [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1416.64s)]
*  and enslaved its people and people's and stole their resources. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1420.72s)]
*  But I mean, if you just end up with a situation where it's completely legitimate [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1425.0s)]
*  to just commit genocide in front of the whole world and, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1428.3600000000001s)]
*  you know, and then steal their land [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1434.08s)]
*  that then sets up, there's no. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1438.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's the law. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1440.56s)]
*  I don't know, law of the jungle. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1441.8s)]
*  I don't know what the expression is, but it's just it's just violent mayhem. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1442.72s)]
*  Well, you'd be you'd be certainly in a universe where the [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1446.68s)]
*  you know, the categories that we currently operate with just don't apply. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1450.52s)]
*  And so, you know, there are folks who many of them [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1453.88s)]
*  who say that Israel actually does have a claim, a sovereign [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1457.28s)]
*  a sovereignty based claim to the West Bank. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1460.92s)]
*  I am the Gaza Strip. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1464.68s)]
*  I mean, that's not rooted in international law. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1465.68s)]
*  That's rooted in some kind of other, you know, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1467.88s)]
*  natural rights or biblical or religious or whatever kind of argument. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1471.44s)]
*  And so then we would be in that space, right, where those kinds of arguments [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1475.64s)]
*  are the ones that we're having. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1479.0s)]
*  But we're no longer actually using [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1480.16s)]
*  either the language or the institutions that, again, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1483.3200000000002s)]
*  frankly, were built predominantly by the United States, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1486.6000000000001s)]
*  you know, with allied support in the wake of the Holocaust [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1490.48s)]
*  in the end of World War Two. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1493.48s)]
*  And of course, yeah, if if Gaza, if this happens to Gaza, then [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1495.48s)]
*  we already see the West Bank, a mass escalation. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1498.8000000000002s)]
*  Forty thousand Palestinians have been ethnically cloned [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1500.92s)]
*  to the West Bank in the last few weeks with very little media attention [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1503.44s)]
*  and a violent series of violent pogroms taking place there. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1506.8s)]
*  But you can see that if Gaza, this happens to Gaza, this happens to the West Bank as well. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1509.0s)]
*  Well, grim, but very important discussion to have, because I think [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1514.1200000000001s)]
*  a lot of people, well, people are confused partly because there's no [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1519.72s)]
*  leadership, you know, as in the media failing to put things in the actual [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1524.0s)]
*  proper legal context. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1528.96s)]
*  So I mean, this is, you know, so just with this [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1530.8s)]
*  heinous crime is that, you know, people who oppose it are forced to [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1533.9199999999998s)]
*  scramble around to needs to get to the actual picture, because [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1538.72s)]
*  that's what the media should be doing. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1542.8799999999999s)]
*  Should be doing this. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1544.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. And I would say, too, like this argument, like the idea that [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1545.6399999999999s)]
*  and I think this is a really important point to make the idea that [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1550.2s)]
*  forced displacement of this kind [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1553.6399999999999s)]
*  constitutes not only an act of genocide itself, but also evidence of [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1556.52s)]
*  genocide in the broader context of the assault on Gaza. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1560.96s)]
*  That interpretation of the law of genocide is exactly the interpretation [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1564.8799999999999s)]
*  that was put forth two years ago by a set of interveners [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1569.2s)]
*  in the Gambia's genocide case against Myanmar at the ICJ. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1573.68s)]
*  And who were those states? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1579.12s)]
*  Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1580.84s)]
*  Right. They all got together. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1585.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And I mean, this is publicly available. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1587.04s)]
*  They all got together to intervene, to say that there are circumstances [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1589.28s)]
*  where forced displacement could be. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1595.48s)]
*  This is the language from the intervention could be such that it becomes evident [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1598.04s)]
*  that it will or is calculated to bring about the death and physical destruction [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1601.72s)]
*  of members of the group, even if such displacement did not bring about [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1606.0s)]
*  the death of adults, for example. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1609.8s)]
*  So it's looking to specifically at the differential impact [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1611.8799999999999s)]
*  of these of these crimes on children and women as well. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1615.76s)]
*  And so these states have taken [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1619.56s)]
*  very strident positions on the law of genocide, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1623.8s)]
*  which if they were applied to the facts before us in the case of Gaza, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1627.28s)]
*  would without really any real question in terms of the application of the law [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1632.8s)]
*  lead to the conclusion of genocide already. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1638.08s)]
*  But certainly that any kind of additional massive [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1640.36s)]
*  forced displacement would be an act of genocide, again, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1643.4399999999998s)]
*  as well as evidence of the specific and genocidal intent. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1645.8799999999999s)]
*  So the US's own allies just have already accepted [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1649.8s)]
*  because of their intervention in the Myanmar case that what Donald Trump [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1654.52s)]
*  is actually discussing is a genocidal act. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1657.8799999999999s)]
*  That's quite a yes, very important piece of information, actually. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1659.6399999999999s)]
*  Glad that we got to finish with that. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1663.0s)]
*  It was really, really important that kind of precedent as well. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1665.6s)]
*  And it's important here we're discussing, you know, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1668.8799999999999s)]
*  the many different forms of genocidal acts. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1672.08s)]
*  There's not just one type of genocidal acts in an overall genocide. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1674.4399999999998s)]
*  Heidi, it's always a pleasure to talk to you. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1679.56s)]
*  That was really clear. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1680.9199999999998s)]
*  It's, you know, throughout this, there's been legal scholars [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1683.3999999999999s)]
*  who've really shone and stood up and educated people about what was happening. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1687.72s)]
*  You've been very much in the forefront of that. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1692.76s)]
*  So we're hugely appreciative because so many of us look to your work. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1694.1999999999998s)]
*  So please do share this video, everyone. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1697.6s)]
*  Press like, subscribe, leave your comments. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1699.0s)]
*  Good for the algorithm. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1700.52s)]
*  All people listen to Heidi. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1701.1599999999999s)]
*  That's the point. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1702.6399999999999s)]
*  But Heidi, thank you so much. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1704.56s)]
*  Thanks so much, Owen. Have a good evening. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1706.8s)]
*  You as well. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZN6mHhT9n8&t=1708.56s)]
