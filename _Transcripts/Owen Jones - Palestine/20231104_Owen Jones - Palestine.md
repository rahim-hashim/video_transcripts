# A Risk Of 'EXTERMINATION' In Gaza UN Rapporteur Francesca Albanese's Horrifying Warning
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [November 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vTeIYRpEX0)
*  Hello, hello, hello, and I'm really delighted today to be joined by Francesca Albanese. Many of you
*  will have seen her on the news discussing the horrific situation now enveloping Gaza. She's
*  the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories, has been for
*  the last 16 months, and it's now a month or so since this current horror show began around
*  approaching 10,000 Palestinians have now been killed, vastly more injured. Much of the Gaza
*  Strip devastated by bombs collectively amounting to the power of one and a half times the Hiroshima
*  bomb in an area the size of East London. Francesca, I really appreciate you joining us.
*  Firstly, can we just start with, you know, you have, as the United Nations, so much information
*  on the ground. Can you tell us what is the situation currently in Gaza?
*  Thank you very much Owen. I've said since the very beginning, and it doesn't change
*  in terms of qualification, it changed in terms of gravity and intensity. I've said that what I've
*  seen unfolding in Gaza since the very first week of, I mean after the 7th of October,
*  it's a catastrophe of epic proportions and I've qualified it. It's a humanitarian and political
*  catastrophe, but I also think it's a legal catastrophe because this is where international
*  law is clamorously failing everyone, both the Palestinians, but also the Israelis, because
*  both people deserve peace and what's happening right now, what's unfolding in Israel and the
*  occupied Palestinian territory, and unfortunately I'm afraid the region is absolutely not conducive
*  to peace and stability. What are you saying when you're talking about illegal? So let's talk about
*  that, war crimes. What are the war crimes being committed? So war crimes we often hear bandaged
*  around, but that's actually an illegally precise term. So what do we mean by war crimes?
*  War crimes are violations of the laws of war. So any violation of the Geneva Convention
*  can constitute a war crime. Now there are certain war crimes that are more egregious than others
*  and also entail individual liability. And if we start from the 7th of October, but there is
*  a context which is also punctuated by profound illegality and we can talk about that. But if we
*  start analyzing the situation as of the 7th of October, there is not the inch of a doubt
*  that what Hamas has done, the way it has carried out the attacks on Israel, going beyond military
*  objectives, attacking civilians, killing, injuring, maiming, taking hostages, these are all war crimes,
*  no question about that. At the same time, the response that Israel has given also entails
*  profound illegality. And there are two different issues that we should consider.
*  On the one hand, has the response that Israel has given, can the response that Israel has given
*  be considered lawful? And if so, is the response as it has unfolded being legal?
*  So the first question is, did Israel have the right to self-defense? Of course, common sense,
*  who would say no? Israel has the right to protect itself, to defend itself in colloquial terms,
*  yes, we all agree. But Israel has invoked the right of self-defense under the UN Charter,
*  under Article 51 of the UN Charter, which has a very precise and specific meaning.
*  And it's the right to legitimately use force, military force, in other words,
*  it's the right to wage a war. Did Israel have that right? No. For a number of reasons, but
*  particularly because the threat doesn't emanate from a state as such. And by the way,
*  the doctrine and international law concerning the law of self-defense is that the threat or
*  the attack should emanate from a state, not an armed group within a state. However, even if
*  even if there was such a threat emanating from the state, this is an entity that Israel occupies.
*  Israel is the occupying power in the Gaza Strip, in the West Bank, in East Jerusalem. So it cannot
*  act against one part of the territory as if it was a hostile entity, as it does, and then
*  waging war against it. It has happened five times before, and it was all wrong. So this is the general
*  concept. But even if there was the right of self-defense, it should have been used
*  to repel the attack, because this is what protection means. It should have given an answer
*  into a response in terms of law enforcement. And instead, it does wage the war, which has also
*  violated basic principles of distinction. Civilians cannot be targeted, cannot be indiscriminately
*  targeted. The principle of proportionality, each military action must be justified by a specific
*  military necessity. And then we can also analyze what does it mean in practice, Owen, but also the
*  principle of precaution. You take all measures to avoid harm to the civilian population or damage to
*  civilian objects and especially protected objects like hospitals and schools. Well, since the 7th
*  of October, we have witnessed the carpet bombing of a 360 square kilometer piece of land,
*  highly crowded, because 2.2 million people live there. Half of them are children. And there has
*  been total confusion. These people had nowhere to go, and there has been heavy bombing from north
*  to south with evacuation order amidst bombing and the tightening of the blockade. There was already
*  an unlawful blockade. There has been so for 16 years. And during this period, Israel has further
*  tightened the blockade, preventing medicines, food, water, and other essential supplies like fuel
*  from entering. This is so very serious. So yes, these are war crimes. And to an extent,
*  some of these crimes might also amount to crimes against humanity when there is the intention
*  to harm. For example, intentional starvation is a crime against humanity or intentional extermination,
*  killing 400, I mean, accepting, risking to kill 400 people in Jabalia camp because there is one
*  military commander. It's pretty serious. It can be extermination. Again, I'm telling you what are the
*  legal categories. Of course, there should be a proper investigation. So we have had heinous
*  crimes on the one hand and heinous crimes of abysmal proportion on the other hand, in a context where,
*  frankly, the response should have been another one because the multilateral system has failed.
*  So international law has failed to prevent crimes. And the multilateral system has failed too because
*  the UN has been completely put aside. I mean, if there was, for example, a hypothetical war
*  crime tribunal, in an ideal world there would be. There, of course, for example, Israel hasn't signed
*  up to the International Criminal Court. But just, for example, imagine there was. What I find striking
*  about this is this is all, there's very, you wouldn't need to go through secret documents
*  because of the rhetoric of Israeli leaders is so blatant. So when Benjamin Netanyahu quotes a
*  biblical passage about Amalek, which calls for the murder of all men, women, children, and animals,
*  when you get calls to turn Gaza into a city of tents with no buildings remaining,
*  when the defense minister says we will eliminate everything that we're fighting human animals,
*  where multiple leading politicians have spoken in overtly hideous ways. And I've read about
*  Rwanda and the rhetoric that was deployed, including in media outlets. I mean, it's all,
*  it's not, they're not subtle. There's no subtlety here, is there?
*  No, I mean, I see where you're heading to. And you know, there are, I mean, there have been many
*  experts, including myself with a number of other special rapporteurs, who have raised
*  the alarm on the risk of genocide, because surely the intent is declared, is explicit in the sense
*  that there have been statements calling for the full erasure of Gaza, equating the Palestinians
*  to animals, equating all Palestinians with Hamas, and they continue. I mean, it's from political
*  leaders, members of governments, parliamentarians in Israel, military commanders. But I wouldn't say,
*  and again, I do think very much that there is this, there is this risk of genocide in Gaza.
*  At the same time, I would say, I do not think we can really look just at the words, because even
*  Hamas puts, I mean, says horrible things and talks about destruction. Hamas leaders have been on
*  record for days saying that they call for the whole destruction of Israel. So what are we facing
*  here? Two entities calling for the destruction of each other. So there are other two elements
*  that fit into, that come into the text, the text. One is reality, the reality on the ground. So there
*  are words and then what's happening on the ground and also the capacity. And this is what worries
*  me Owen. The fact that the reality, the ongoing reality is that on the 7th of October, Hamas has
*  carried out a heinous attack on Israeli civilians, terrorizing many more of those who have
*  perished or taken hostages. The whole country is shaken and beyond, because I think this has
*  sent shockwaves across the Jewish community worldwide. I understand the trauma, really,
*  I do, because I keep on saying, these people, we need to understand these people have been persecuted
*  for centuries and the reason we need to recognize the pain of the other right now. I mean,
*  no question about it. At the same time, as of the 7th of October, the losses have been suffered by
*  the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. So the reality has been that as of the 7th
*  of October, over 9,000 Palestinians have been killed. 70% are reportedly women and children,
*  3,500 children have been killed, hospitals, houses, entire residential buildings, markets,
*  bakeries. You know, it's very critical. And again, you look at the, if you have the power
*  to turn off electricity, water, access to food and medicines, fuel, you create a reality that can
*  lead to death of children in incubators, women who, I mean, and the wounded, there are over 20,000
*  wounded and there are people under the rubble. And also the third element is the capacity.
*  Does Israel have the capacity to, I mean, even escalate the horrific acts? Militarily, it does.
*  And the critical thing is that international community, instead of coming down, acting to
*  de-escalate, no, it's fostering. It's fostering the spirits. It's giving even more weapons to
*  Israel, which is shocking because again, as I said, the situation was already horrific enough
*  before the 7th of October and there were already responsibilities of what my predecessor has called
*  the enablers, Western States in particular, who have let Israel's impunity and lack of compliance
*  with international law festering. So instead of calling again for a multilateral response,
*  you know, we ensure a protective presence. We ensure that the UN
*  monitoring the Gaza Strip helps demilitarize the Hamas. This could have been a legitimate
*  military target, but not eradicating Hamas as if it was not. Hamas is a political reality. How do
*  you eradicate it? A political reality that has been supported by Israel until a few months ago.
*  I mean, it's just interesting that point about capacity because we often see those who oppose
*  the ceasefire, you know, they'll find quite gleefully some blood curdling statement by
*  a Hamas official to justify in terms of what they would do to Israel. And as we both say,
*  what happened on the 7th of October were atrocities, war crimes committed by Hamas
*  against Israeli civilians. The point is, Israel is a military superpower with a massive, huge
*  capacity to destroy the other. Hamas doesn't have the capacity to destroy Israel. That is a
*  fictional abstraction, notwithstanding the atrocity that was committed. And the destruction of Gaza
*  is a reality. So what we're talking about there is an actual reality ongoing. And I just think,
*  you know, I grew up with Bosnia, often cited as a particular horror. And the Bosnian Serbs suffered
*  atrocities committed against them. One of the first big massacres in the Bosnian War was of Bosnian
*  civilians who often suffered horrendous women and children being tortured before they were killed.
*  That didn't justify what the Bosnian Serb leaders did. No one would ever claim it did. But the
*  Bosnian War, 40,000 civilians died in three years. There were many other soldiers who died.
*  But Bosnia had a population, a pre-war population, twice that of Gaza. It just seems underlying this
*  is the idea that Palestinian life, there's just a general almost, it should just be stated,
*  it's not considered to have any real worth compared to as Israeli life rightly is,
*  considered to have a worth. Yeah, I mean, I would add to this, the fact that in three weeks,
*  as many people as have died in Gaza, I mean, sorry, the number of people who have died who
*  have been killed in Gaza are equal to the number of people who have died who have been killed
*  in the Ukraine-Russia war in 19 months. And if I recall correctly, this is also the same number
*  of people which has been killed in two years in Myanmar. So, and more than the people who were
*  killed in Srebrenica, the numbers are, I mean, and again, yeah, I agree with you, the numbers don't
*  register in certain audiences. I mean, I find myself talking to Western media and they just
*  blink. When you say 3,500 children, I have a punch in my stomach, but even 25 children, frankly,
*  when I was quoting how many Israeli children had been killed, one dead child is one too many.
*  3,500 and you see no empathy whatsoever. No, the stories of these people do not come across. And
*  again, it's not about the Palestinians. This is the Palestinian situation epitomizes the indifference
*  than the West cultivates toward the rest, toward the global South. I mean, it's not different from
*  other words. And I find it tragic because in this case, we have the, let's say, the main actor,
*  the main power which subjugates the Palestinians consider itself a Western country and is strongly
*  protected by Western countries. Before I finally ask you about that, I just wanted to ask about
*  the West Bank because obviously our attention has been so much focused on Gaza given the scale of
*  the humanitarian calamity of increasingly of a biblical proportions. The West Bank, which has
*  a bigger population than Gaza, it's not ruled by Hamas. What's going on in the West Bank at the
*  moment? Yeah, there are a few interesting things. And then I would like to talk about what has been
*  my assessment from the very beginning, beyond war crimes, genocides, the risk of genocides,
*  et cetera. I do think we should understand the design, the plan behind what is happening,
*  because there is a continuity between what's going on in the Gaza Strip and in the West Bank.
*  In the West Bank, as of the 7th of October, violence, the situation was already very violent
*  because 460 Palestinians had been killed and 60 Israelis had been killed in the entire occupied
*  Palestinian territory since I became a mandate holder. So in 16 months, 460 is a huge number.
*  Many of them had been killed at the end of soldiers and violent armed settlers. So it's very bad
*  already. But what has happened as of the 7th of October is that settler escalation has gone up.
*  Various Israeli ministers have armed the settlers and individuals, dealing with the Arabs.
*  Basically, this is the message, as you deem necessary. And there have been 120 people
*  killed. 30 of them are children. And the scenes of violence, I mean, entire communities,
*  herder communities and bedroom communities have been forced to flee so that they have
*  moved. They have been forcibly displaced by the highly coercive environment in the West Bank.
*  But also, there have been very disturbing images that have come out from the West Bank,
*  scenes of soldiers amassing men. And yeah, I don't know the age group, but some seem to be younger,
*  stripping them naked, subjecting them to very distressing, humiliating
*  practices. Really, when I saw these scenes that have been confirmed by Israeli organizations,
*  and I'm not sure because there are two graphics. It's not up to me, but it's really serious. It's
*  warrants an investigation because these have reminded me since of Abu Ghraib, that kind of
*  cruelty, that kind of sadism. And there are many cases of soldiers humiliating, beating,
*  and subjugating the Palestinians. They are defenseless. And this is the second element.
*  In some Western countries, including myself, I mean, now there is this rhetoric that the Israelis
*  are fighting Hamas, but there is no Hamas military presence. I mean, there has been a revival of
*  armed resistance because this is what an oppression generates. And frankly, resistance under international
*  law is not resistance to an oppressive regime, to apartheid. It's not illegal. Of course, it needs to
*  follow, to be legal. It needs to also follow certain rules of international law, not targeting
*  civilians. But frankly, an armed group fighting the army is not per se illegal. So the rhetoric
*  right now is that there are Hamas fighters, and Israelis in illegal colonies have to be given
*  weapons to defend themselves, which is false. The colonies have always been there illegally,
*  and the only way to protect them should be removing them. So this is the reality. And yeah,
*  as you say, I agree with you, there is not much attention to this.
*  Certainly nowhere near enough attention as there should be. Just finally, then, I mean, you've
*  touched upon this a lot throughout. But we often hear from Western leaders things, I guess, often,
*  apparently platitudinous references to things like a rules-based world order, international law. We
*  heard that a lot after Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, which was correctly widely condemned,
*  including the atrocities associated with it. What does this tell us about the approach of
*  Western governments, which call themselves the democratic world, the free world, and so on,
*  in terms of their attitude towards human rights, the rules of law, the rule of law, rules-based
*  order, and international law in general? I have a criticism on how international law
*  has been used vis-a-vis Palestine in general, because in my first report, I criticized the
*  sectorial approach, meaning many diplomats and even international organizations, until the discourse
*  on apartheid started to gain traction, have focused on specific aspects of illegality,
*  or violation of women rights, or violation of children rights, by missing the overall picture,
*  which is the legality of the occupation, which has served as a vehicle to colonize the land.
*  And of course, it has translated into apartheid by default. The design of, like, the animus,
*  the soul of Israel's occupation is settler colonial. Take the land and displace the people.
*  So there is an element of ethnic cleansing that is there. It's always been there. It's part of
*  the history of the Palestinian people as of 1947 in critical terms, but the roots, of course,
*  are even more profound. So there has been an ambiguity and there have been double standards.
*  Vis-a-vis the Palestinians for a long time. But of course, when the Russia-Ukraine war started,
*  that became really in full display. And to the point that even now, there are certain
*  milieux where you find Hamas equated to Putin and Ukraine to Israel. So even Zelensky came out saying,
*  oh, yeah, Israel has the right to defend itself from the terrorists as we defend ourselves from
*  the Russian terrorists. Excuse me. No, it's the other way around in the sense that
*  Palestine, the Palestinian people are occupied. I've been occupied for 56 years, but even in that
*  small portion of land that remains and where international consensus is that there should be
*  their enjoyment of the right of self-determination in the form of an independent state.
*  This has gone completely lost. Now, there are two interesting things that I would like to point out
*  from what you said. Rule-based order. This is the mantra of the US administration, which means
*  nothing because the order is international law or rule of law-based order, because rules without
*  any qualification, everything and the rules of engagement have departed from the principles of
*  legality that are enshrined in the international system that has, let's say, developed as of the
*  Second World War. So yes, those rules, international law-based rules exist. They are violated
*  on a number of occasions, but particularly in the case of Israel-Palestine.
*  And double standards only tarnish the strength of this body of law,
*  making it less effective in preventing and in remedies crimes.
*  Francesca, I really appreciate you joining us and talking about actually quite complicated
*  issues in ways that's very accessible. For those who don't know, of course,
*  Francesca is an international lawyer. So all of this is very much grounded in legal expertise,
*  which is very helpful because, to be honest, let alone forget morality, just basic legal
*  concepts have been shunned by Western governments, but also much of the British media when discussing
*  what's actually taking place in Gaza and the West Bank. So it is important to talk about morality,
*  but also we need to give the legal footing as well. Your work is invaluable. I can't imagine
*  how difficult and pressured it must be, but it's so important we have your voice. And I think
*  history will be damning for some, to say the least, but I think the voices such as yourself,
*  as we see this atrocity unfold, I think the vindication will not, unfortunately, be a pleasant
*  one. But it's so important we have your voice. But thank you, Francesca, so much. If you're
*  watching, obviously, if you're watching the video or listening, press like and subscribe.
*  And thanks, Francesca.
