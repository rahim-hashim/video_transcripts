# This Will Kill More Palestinians Than Bombs, Missiles And Bullets
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8Yzj1GdVRk)
*  Israel has, and I quote, perpetrated a concerted policy to destroy Gaza's healthcare system
*  as part of a broader assault on Gaza, committing war crimes and the crimes against humanity
*  of extermination.
*  That's according to a new United Nations Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory.
*  It notes that according to the World Health Organization, between the 7th of October,
*  and the 30th of July 2024 this year, Israel carried out nearly 500 attacks on healthcare
*  facilities in Gaza.
*  A total of 747 people were killed directly in those attacks on healthcare facilities
*  and 969, nearly a thousand, were injured.
*  110 facilities were affected.
*  They note that 78% of the attacks in the first few months were carried out through military
*  force while 35% involved obstruction of access, 9% militarised search and detention operations.
*  The attacks were, in the words of this commission, widespread and systematic, starting in the
*  north of Gaza in the final months of 2023, later shifting to the centre of Gaza, December
*  and January this year, then to the south, January to March this year, other areas April
*  to June.
*  They involved airstrikes against hospitals, causing considerable damage and multiple casualties
*  the commission notes.
*  The surrounding and besieging of hospital premises, goods and medical equipment being
*  prevented from being allowed into the medical facilities as well as preventing the exit
*  and entry of civilians.
*  Evacuation orders were issued but safe evacuations prevented, hospitals raided, hospital staff
*  and patients arrested, humanitarian agencies had their access obstructed.
*  Within the first few months, 7th October to 23rd June this year, it reported 500 medical
*  staff were killed.
*  Doctors, nurses, paramedics.
*  The Palestine Red Crescent additionally reported 19 of its staff of volunteers were killed.
*  Many others have been detained and attacked.
*  I quote, medical personnel stated that they believed they had been intentionally targeted.
*  The report details how hundreds of medical personnel, including three hospital directors,
*  the head of an orthopaedic department, alongside patients and journalists were arrested by
*  Israel security services forces in Shefa, Nazareth and Orda hospitals.
*  They report how at least two senior medical personnel died in Israeli detention, while
*  128 health workers remain in Israeli detention and the reports overwhelmingly paint a picture
*  of utter barbarism in that detention.
*  As of mid July, 113 ambulances have been attacked, with at least 61 being damaged.
*  The UN commission documents direct attacks on medical convoys operated by the Red Cross,
*  the UN, the Red Crescent and NGOs.
*  They note 20 of the 36 hospitals in Gaza are now completely non-functional, with just 16
*  partially operating with severe overcrowding and a bed capacity of just 1,490.
*  Let me quote this because it's crucial.
*  The attacks on and destruction of hospitals and the scale of traumatic injuries across
*  the Gaza Strip have overwhelmed the remaining medical facilities, leading to a collapse
*  of the healthcare system.
*  The siege of Gaza, which has caused into alia a lack of fuel and electricity, has severely
*  affected the functioning of medical facilities and reduced the availability of life-saving
*  equipment, medical supplies and medications.
*  This has resulted in deprioritising patients with chronic illnesses, leading to avoidable
*  complications and death.
*  Companies have suffered from insufficient potable water and sanitation, damaged or limited
*  communication systems, understaffing and a lack of public health services.
*  This really can't be emphasised enough.
*  Imagine the healthcare system in a rich country that wasn't at war, was suddenly destroyed
*  in this fashion.
*  That would impose mass death sentences on huge numbers of people.
*  The destruction of a healthcare system in an overcrowded and already besieged and impoverished
*  tiny strip of land which has been subjected to bombs and missiles with the explosive power
*  of five Hiroshima atomic bombs overrun by an invading army, its population displaced multiple
*  times subjected to a siege of the basic essentials of life, including food and yes, medicine.
*  The destruction of a healthcare system in those circumstances over such a long period of time.
*  Think of the consequences.
*  Think of the death sentences every single day that imposes on Palestinians.
*  I mean, other than the 100,000 Palestinians who've been injured by direct violence, think
*  of cancer patients, think of those with heart conditions or respiratory conditions or diabetes
*  or dementia, think of pregnant women, think of newborn babies, we could go on.
*  There's a major reason why the biggest killer of Palestinians in Gaza, when all this is
*  ended, when I mean, it's almost impossible to imagine that, isn't it?
*  But it will be known as excess deaths.
*  That will be how you calculate those killed in total.
*  It won't be the biggest killer will not be direct violence, the bombs, the missiles,
*  the bullets, the artillery.
*  It will be because of factors like the destruction of healthcare in these apocalyptic conditions.
*  Now, the Israeli state keeps imposing evacuation orders on hospitals, but as the commission
*  notes, the orders were not feasible, not issued in a coordinated fashion or could not be implemented
*  in a safe manner.
*  They gave hospital administrations little time, just a few hours in some cases to evacuate
*  hundreds of patients.
*  These security forces did not assist, they know, in the safe evacuation of patients.
*  The examples they cite of the deliberate targeting of hospitals with sniper fire, the victims
*  including the commission notes, medical staff and a pregnant woman who was killed.
*  Medical staff and pregnant women killed by sniper.
*  Sniper fire from the IDF.
*  They talk of masquerades in hospitals, of patients dying because of lack of oxygen after
*  fuel and electricity was cut off.
*  The report notes that Israel claims 85% of major medical facilities in Gaza were used
*  by Hamas for terror operations, but they note the evidence was not provided by the Israeli state.
*  In its conclusion, the report says that the offensive in Gaza since 7th October has resulted
*  in the destruction of the already weak healthcare system in the Gaza Strip with detrimental
*  long-term effects on the civilian population's right to health and life.
*  That's a crucial point here.
*  The resilience of the healthcare system was already weak because of Israel's siege of
*  Gaza over so many years, the longest siege in modern history.
*  Crucially they say this.
*  The commission finds that Israel has implemented a concerted policy to destroy the healthcare
*  system of Gaza.
*  Israeli security forces have deliberately killed, wounded, arrested, detained, mistreated
*  and tortured medical personnel and targeted medical vehicles, constituting the war crime
*  of willful killing and mistreatment and the crime against humanity of extermination.
*  There it is in black and white.
*  One of the worst possible war crimes.
*  Intentionally destroying the healthcare system of the people you have trapped and besieged
*  during one of the most intense military bombardments in history.
*  And therefore this constitutes, as they note, the crime against humanity of extermination.
*  They note this is in concert with preventing fuel and food and water and medicines and
*  medical supplies getting in because of siege and that these actions were not taken as the
*  Israeli state claims to defeat Hamas and turn the hostages, the official war aims, which
*  Israel has failed to meet.
*  But quote unquote is collective punishment against the Palestinians in Gaza.
*  By attacking these hospitals, the commission finds Israeli security forces failed to adhere
*  to the principles of precaution, distinction and proportionality, constituting the war
*  crimes of willful killing and attacks against protected objects and that in the attacks
*  on Shefa and Nasr'a hospitals, Israeli security forces considered the hospital premises and
*  all surrounding areas as targetable without distinction and thus violated the principle
*  of distinction.
*  In Israel's claims that hospitals are used for military purposes by Hamas without offering
*  evidence, it is worth noting the commission says with regard to Israeli security forces
*  seizing the Turkish hospital for military purposes and establishing a military post
*  therein, such actions were not required by the imperative of military necessity and thus
*  amount to the war crime of seizing protected property.
*  It's important to note too that they find Israel engaged in the deliberate destruction
*  of sexual and reproductive healthcare facilities, which constitutes violent harm in particular
*  against pregnant and postpartum and lactating women and that has caused immediate physical
*  and mental harm and suffering to women and girls and will have irreversible long term
*  effects on the mental health and physical reproductive and fertility prospects of the
*  Palestinian people as a group.
*  It's clear reading all of this, just one element that we're focusing on, the onslaught
*  against the healthcare system, that this is genocide and that was obviously a very long
*  time ago.
*  And on that note, let's listen to two doctors, Tanya Haj Hassan and Thea Ahmed, who served
*  in Gaza as they take on how CNN framed this onslaught.
*  ... is coming under attack and you mentioned actually at the beginning about these evacuation
*  orders.
*  These evacuation orders are for three hospitals in the north, Kamal Adwan Hospital, Indonesian
*  Hospital and El Awda Hospital.
*  Why are hospitals still coming under evacuation orders?
*  Why are we still hearing about hospitals coming under attack and healthcare workers
*  being killed?
*  I want to just mention Dr. Khaled Dasir, a colleague of mine who I worked with at Nasir
*  Hospital, brilliant young surgeon.
*  When the Israeli military surrounded the hospital, he refused to leave his patients.
*  He stood by his patients and tried to keep them alive as water, electricity and supplies
*  were cut off.
*  He was subsequently abducted and for six months he languished in Israeli dungeons until he
*  was released two days ago.
*  Do you know what Dr. Khaled Dasir did?
*  He went right back to Nasir Hospital and started working with patients again.
*  I mean, if it wasn't for these Palestinian healthcare workers, we'd be in a much more
*  grim situation.
*  And the final thing I'll say is, you know, 700 kids in Gaza, 700 infants never saw their
*  first birthday in Gaza over the last year.
*  200 of them born and killed in conflict.
*  200 of them born and killed in this assault.
*  I mean, the situation is so dire.
*  We need a ceasefire.
*  We need it right now.
*  And Dr. Hashasan, speaking of the evacuation orders in the north and now in the south
*  that we've seen today, one resident of northern Gaza who was just this weekend had to flee
*  once again told the Associated Press this, and I think it was pretty jarring telling
*  and striking, said this, since October 7 to the present day, this is the 12th time that
*  I and my children, eight individuals, have been homeless and thrown into the streets
*  and do not know where to go.
*  Where do you think it does, what do you think is going to happen with this humanitarian
*  crisis with the additional factor of Gaza's about to enter the winter, which often brings
*  heavy rain to the region?
*  Kate, in all honesty, a humanitarian crisis is what you deal with when you have a hurricane,
*  what you deal with when you have an earthquake, you have an insult and a humanitarian response.
*  This is my career.
*  This is what I do for a living.
*  Every single person who does this for a living will tell you the same thing.
*  This is different.
*  This is not a humanitarian crisis.
*  Kate, and I'm going to say it very clearly for your viewers to hear, this is genocide.
*  When 70% of the population that are killed are women and children, when the population
*  is starved of food, of water, of medicine, when you have attacks, repeated attacks on
*  all the hospitals, the clinics, the aid distribution sites, the humanitarian aid agencies that
*  try to help, more UN workers have been killed in Gaza than in UN's history.
*  When you have over 900 families that have been exterminated, that have been taken off
*  of the civil registry, killed, when you have over 17,000 children that have lost one or
*  both parents, when you have bakeries, aid distribution sites, churches, mosques, schools,
*  and in the last three days, in the last 24 hours, in fact, a hospital today that was
*  bombed, as you just reported, the hospital where I personally was working, and I can
*  tell you, they are working every second of every day to try and sustain life when Israel's
*  strategy and evidence on the ground suggests that they're doing the exact opposite.
*  They were targeted today.
*  There was a rehabilitation hospital, rehabilitation center that was targeted in the last 24 hours,
*  and there was an orphanage that was targeted earlier this week.
*  These are the types of places that are being targeted.
*  So it's really hard to hear it over and over and over again, framed in the way that it's
*  being framed in the media, which frankly, Kate, is very misleading.
*  It is very misleading.
*  365 days of this, death tolls that are so far outdated, we have no idea how many people
*  are killed, but I am genuinely afraid about what we're going to find out when the dust
*  settles.
*  History books will be written on this, and countries will have to reckon, media agencies
*  will have to reckon with their major role in the genocide of an entire population and
*  in the destruction of humanitarian law.
*  This crime is so huge and obscene, it is easy to find it just overwhelming that the vast
*  majority of our political and media elites still cannot call this crime out for what
*  it is.
*  Well, what do you even say?
*  Every day, some of the worst possible crimes it's possible to commit, all live streamed
*  in front of us, directly facilitated by our own governments.
*  There are many reasons, many reasons we have to bear witness, and one of them is this.
*  No one must be allowed to say, I did not know what was really happening.
*  You did.
*  There was no excuses.
*  No genocide has been so documented in real time, and that's why those who are complicit
*  must never be allowed to get away with what they have done.

*  I'll speak to you soon.
