# Israel Is ETHNICALLY CLEANSING Northern Gaza - In Full, Shameless Public View
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAoWWOdogoM)
*  No one can say that they didn't know. Not our politicians, not our media outlets.
*  What we are currently witnessing, as I keep saying, is one of the great crimes of our age,
*  and we are learning a brutal lesson in real time. How are grave crimes, crimes defined by
*  utter depravity, which are willingly not only confessed to by their perpetrators,
*  but boasted about, where the victims are completely dehumanised, how are these grave
*  crimes made possible? No crime in history has been so documented as it happened. No crime in
*  history has been so confessed to over and over again, from top to bottom of the society responsible.
*  This is a lesson which should not have been taught, and certainly not at the expense
*  of the Palestinian people as they suffer genocide. In the past few days, Israel has been committing
*  perhaps its worst crimes since this genocide began. We do not know the true extent of these
*  crimes in northern Gaza, because Israel has cut off all communication there. What footage we do
*  have is reminiscent of some of the worst crimes committed in the history of our species. I can't
*  post most of this footage, YouTube would age restrict it immediately, and frankly many of
*  you will understandly find it too difficult to watch. I don't want to watch it either,
*  but unfortunately we have to record these crimes to make it clear what happened, otherwise there
*  will never be accountability. Much of the evidence comes from Jabalia, a refugee camp in the north.
*  One is footage of Jabalia Prep School. It shows men with their heads partly blown off.
*  It shows the bloody corpses of women and of little children. In other evidence, you can see
*  seven children. They were killed after they were targeted by Israeli artillery. They were trying to
*  get water for their families in Jabalia when they were slaughtered. Meanwhile, the Israeli army has
*  set fire to the Alpu, Kuwait and Hamad schools in Jabalia, which were serving as UN shelters
*  for desperate, traumatised, hungry Palestinians. In another, Palestinians, including the young,
*  are shown having been forced to undress and wear plastic suits where they will be taken to camps
*  in Israel where we all have access to some of the most hideous reports of torture, rape, gang rape,
*  including detainees being tortured to death. Meanwhile, Israeli television boastfully shows
*  Palestinians forced to leave Jabalia, a sea of human misery under threat of violence and death.
*  Can use the Israeli national broadcaster broadcast the following footage,
*  captioned with documentation. Garzans leave Jabalia.
*  Garzans leave Jabalia indeed, as though they're just voluntarily just getting out of there,
*  rather than facing a murderous Israeli rampage. As Mohamed Shahada, a brilliant Palestinian
*  analyst writes, working on a long paper that touches on what's left of Gaza for the day after
*  Israel literally destroyed all universities, factories, shops, companies, government offices,
*  courts, mosques and the vast majority of schools, hospitals, banks, homes. No possibility for
*  organised human life. Meanwhile, the western media whitewashes these crimes. Let's talk about this.
*  Because what we're seeing here is the erasure of the humanity of the victims by most of the
*  western media. That's what we're talking about. So let's humanise one. This is Maa Sahin, who was in
*  Jabalia camp.
*  She says that, hello, I'm Maa Sahin from Gaza. I will try to stay alive. Here's the last video
*  she posted. With the apocalyptic sound of war behind her, she depicted an image inspired by
*  Shaban al-Dalu, the young Palestinian man who burnt to death in hospital the day before his
*  20th birthday. It shows a burning Palestinian with we are burning, inscribed above it.
*  She was killed three days ago in an Israeli airstrike.
*  It's difficult to put into words, isn't it? She there depicts the horror of a young Palestinian
*  burning to death, a fate which almost certainly befell her very shortly afterwards.
*  Now, we can glean some of the atrocities being committed in Gaza through the western media,
*  but on some quite astonishing framing deployed. It's disturbing to talk about this.
*  One headline on CNN reads as follows, he got out of Gaza, but Gaza did not get out of him.
*  Israeli soldiers returning from war struggled with trauma and suicide.
*  Now, the original Editors Know at the start reads, Editors Know the story contains details of suicide
*  that some readers may find upsetting. The story expects us to focus our feelings of empathy on
*  this soldier. It reads a 40-year-old father of four, Elirene Misery, deployed to Gaza after the
*  deadly Hamas-led attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023. The Israeli military reservist returned a
*  different person, traumatized by what he had witnessed in the war against Hamas and the Strip,
*  his family told CNN. Six months after he was first censored, he was struggling with post-traumatic
*  stress disorder back at home. Before he was due to redeploy, he took his own life. He got out of
*  Gaza, but Gaza did not get out of him, and he died after it because of the post-traumatic, his mother,
*  Jenny Misery says. Now, I relish no one's suicide. As I always say, never let the evil of this world
*  rot away your humanity. Never relish death. When you read on, some rather important context emerges.
*  His mother says he saw a lot of people die, maybe he even killed someone, but we don't teach our
*  children to do things like this, so when he did this, something like this, maybe it was a shock
*  for him. Guy Zakin, Misery's friend and co-driver of the bulldozer, provided further insight into
*  their experience in Gaza, says CNN. We saw very, very, very difficult things, Zakin told CNN,
*  things that are difficult to accept. The former soldier has spoken publicly about the psychological
*  trauma endured by Israeli troops in Gaza. In a testimony to the Knesset, Israel's parliament,
*  in June, Zakin said that on many occasions, soldiers had to run over terrorists, dead and alive,
*  in the hundreds. Everything squirts out, he added. Zakin says he can no longer eat meat,
*  as it reminds him of the gruesome scenes he witnessed from his bulldozer in Gaza,
*  and struggles to sleep at night, the sound of explosions ringing in his head.
*  Goodness me. So we've gleaned here that Israeli soldiers were ordered to run over those described
*  as terrorists, dead or alive, in the hundreds. Now we know already that there is an all-expansive
*  definition of terrorist used by the Israeli state and its soldiers, but in any case, running over
*  living, breathing human beings as they are alive is a truly depraved war crime, and this says
*  hundreds. And for that matter, running over the bodies of dead people is also a crime,
*  it's the desecration of corpses. This article focuses on the mental suffering of Israeli soldiers.
*  Look, I believe in humane practices in all cases, and I believe these Israeli soldiers should
*  receive the appropriate support for the traumas they've suffered while perpetrating some of the
*  worst war crimes of our age in prison behind bars, as part of the process of forcing a genocidal
*  society to confront what it has done. Now the editor's note, which originally only said details
*  about suicide might upset some readers, admitting the, I don't know, the bit about running over
*  hundreds of human beings, Palestinians of course, until their insides squirt out,
*  was amended to include violence too. CNN shamed their into having to treat Palestinians
*  as actual human beings. Now yesterday, the ruling Likud party organised a conference in support
*  of ethnically cleansing Gaza and colonising it. Here, the far-right national security minister,
*  Itamir Ben-Ghavir, jubilantly addressed the crowd.
*  Now as the Israeli newspaper Haaretz and others have noted, the ethnic cleansing and colonisation
*  of Gaza by Israeli settlers is clearly where this is all heading. They're erasing Gaza to the ground,
*  killing as many Palestinians as they can get away with, so they can in time violently drive out every
*  last surviving Palestinian, erasing Palestinian Gaza from the face of the earth before they finish
*  strangling Palestinian West Bank out of existence too. If you want to understand the mentality here,
*  Sky News interviewed a young Israeli woman at this conference, wearing glasses, a cutesy scarf,
*  she looks, though I say, rather sweet. Now, she, according to Sky News, on that note,
*  she is friendly, open, eloquent and utterly sure of herself. When asked why she wants to live in
*  Gaza, she says because it's our homeland, it says in the Torah that this is our home, this is our land
*  and we have every right to live there. When asked what should happen to the Palestinians who already
*  live in Gaza, Sky says she didn't miss a beat in her response. We should kill them, every last one
*  of them, and if the government won't do that then we should just kick them out. This is our land
*  and we deserve it. This is genocidal mania. No one can say they didn't know, not our politicians
*  and not our media outlets. Indeed, despite the terrible coverage, despite the moral bankruptcy
*  of our leaders, people know what's happening. In Britain, the polling show that 70% believe Israel
*  has committed war crimes, just 8% disagree. That is 1% less than the number of Britons who believe
*  they have directly communicated with the dead. By a large margin, Britain support an arms embargo
*  on Israel and the arrest of its leader Benjamin Netanyahu. There is no excuse for not knowing.
*  This is one of the worst crimes of our age and it is happening every single day with western arms
*  and support and the complicity of our media. We have to keep talking about that because they have
*  to be held to account. There has to be a reckoning. They can't be allowed to get away with it. Not a
*  crime this big. If so, then total moral collapse beckons and that moral collapse will have
*  devastating consequences for generations to come. Please like and subscribe,
