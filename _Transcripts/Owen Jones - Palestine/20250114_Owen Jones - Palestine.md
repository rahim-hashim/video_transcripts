# Palestinian Journalist DESTROYS Western Media's Complicity In Genocide His Devastating Speech
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4)
*  They will never be forgiven. By they, I mean the Western governments who have armed and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=0.0s)]
*  facilitated Israel's genocide for 465 days as I speak, knowing full well the horrors [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=4.64s)]
*  being inflicted every single day. By they, I mean the Western media outlets who have [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=11.48s)]
*  legitimised Israel's war crimes, who have failed to frame their courage around the explicitly [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  and repeatedly stated genocidal intent of Israeli leaders and officials who have airbrushed [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=21.76s)]
*  atrocities, failed to hold their governments to account for their criminal complicity and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=27.64s)]
*  failed to even show a modicum of solidarity for the Palestinian journalists who have suffered [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  the biggest slaughter of media workers in the history of human civilisation as they [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=37.8s)]
*  risked their lives every single day to bring the world the depraved, hideous truth of what [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=42.96s)]
*  Israel is doing to the Palestinian people. Which brings me to this devastating speech. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  It is a speech by the Palestinian journalist Abu Bakr Ahmed, who is from Deir al-Bala in [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=56.64s)]
*  Gaza. He is only 22 years old and he has already done more important work than countless Western [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=62.28s)]
*  journalists combined will ever do in their whole careers. And he has done so while risking [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=68.2s)]
*  his life every single day, every single hour, every single minute. It's a press conference [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=73.16s)]
*  and it's addressed to the Western media. Please listen and listen carefully. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=80.4s)]
*  These are not my words, but the words of every single one here, standing here after 459 days [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=87.24s)]
*  of the most well-documented and first-life-esteem genocide in history. For these days, we've [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  been reporting tirelessly, extensively and thoroughly on this genocide. It's indeed a [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=107.68s)]
*  genocide against us, which we've been documenting in makeshift, tinted camps and workplaces. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=116.0s)]
*  They are really the places we've taken shelter as shelter since day one. You've seen us shedding [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=124.76s)]
*  tears over our loved ones, colleagues, friends and family members. You've seen us killed in [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=133.28s)]
*  every possible way. We've been immolated, incinerated, dismembered and disemboweled, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=142.56s)]
*  and recently we've been freezing to death. What more ways should you be seeing our skeleton so [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=151.92s)]
*  you can move and act and stop the hell inflected upon us? There are no words to describe what [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=161.96s)]
*  we've been going through, because you've seen our bodies, how they've become fragile, skinny [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=171.24s)]
*  and fatigued. But we never stopped. We never stopped to tell you the truth, to narrate our stories [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=179.24s)]
*  and to tell you that we are being genocided, to move your dead consciences, to help a population [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=189.32000000000002s)]
*  that has seen every sort of torture and tasted every type of death. Today we're all standing here [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=199.0s)]
*  after Israel's impunity against us, and we don't know how many journalists should be killed so you [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  can really act and stop Israel's impunity against us. Our message is very clear. We are journalists, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=218.44s)]
*  and we are Palestinian journalists. We have been let down by the international community, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=228.52s)]
*  particularly the international media organizations. We haven't seen any sort of support, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=235.16s)]
*  a single word of support. Even the press vests we're wearing right now, Marcus is a target. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=241.32000000000002s)]
*  They do not protect us at all. But yes, because we are Palestinians, maybe if we were Ukrainians or [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=248.60000000000002s)]
*  of any other citizenship with blonde hair and blue eyes, the word would rage and rant for us. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=258.12s)]
*  But because we are Palestinians, we have only one right, which is to die and be maimed. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=266.76s)]
*  Finally, we are just documenting a genocide against us. It's enough after almost a year and a half. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=274.6s)]
*  We want you to stand foot by foot with us because we are like any other journalists, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=284.52s)]
*  reporters and media workers all across the globe, no matter the origin, the color or the race. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=292.76s)]
*  Journalism is not a crime. We are not a target. This is a speech which should trigger an [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=303.08s)]
*  overwhelming sense of shame amongst Western journalists, but it won't because the vast [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=312.03999999999996s)]
*  majority of them won't even listen to it. For many of them, courage is defined by saying and writing [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=316.28s)]
*  terrible things about marginalized minorities and the rags they work for, and then getting [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=322.2s)]
*  criticized about it by teenagers and social media, where they then claim to be the victims [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=326.28s)]
*  who are suffering the trauma, the horror of being scrutinized by members of the public [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=331.32s)]
*  for making life that little bit harder for people whose lives are already too hard. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=336.28s)]
*  These Western journalists like to think of themselves as noble truth-tellers speaking [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=340.68s)]
*  out without fear or favor, and there are some of those that are courageous journalists here in the [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=345.0s)]
*  West. That's without question. There were just too few, not least in positions of prominence [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=349.24s)]
*  and influence. Well, Israel's genocide has certainly exposed the vast majority of the Western media for [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=354.92s)]
*  who they are. They knew, they knew from the beginning that Israeli leaders and officials [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=361.08s)]
*  repeatedly declared that civilians in Gaza were human animals, that they would illegally cut off [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=366.6s)]
*  all the essentials of life to them, like food and water and energy, that they believed all civilians [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=373.08s)]
*  in Gaza had collective guilt that there was no such thing as civilians who were not aware, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=378.68s)]
*  not involved, as Israel's president put it. As they bragged they would flatten Gaza, that as one [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=383.24s)]
*  Israeli minister put it after the first few weeks, the north of the Gaza Strip, simply a pleasure for [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=389.08s)]
*  the eyes as they boasted about the destruction there, the total destruction. They know Israeli [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=394.36s)]
*  ministers boasted they were doing another Nakba, that is a repeat of the murderous ethnic cleansing [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=400.52s)]
*  of Palestinians by Israel in 1948. They may not have heard any every single statement. They may [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=405.32s)]
*  not have heard that Israel's defence minister Yoav Gallat declared at the start variously that [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=410.28s)]
*  he had lifted every restriction and every restraint on Israeli soldiers, but my goodness did they hear [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=413.96s)]
*  enough. They saw with their own eyes the ever more apocalyptic footage from Gaza as its buildings [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=418.84s)]
*  were so comprehensively destroyed that it now has a completely different colour and texture when [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=425.4s)]
*  looked at from space. They may not have used a tape measure to work out just how small Gaza is, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=429.8s)]
*  which is no bigger than East London, but they knew, they knew it is a tiny territory and they [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=434.6s)]
*  may not have known that several times the explosive power of Hiroshima was detonated there by the [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=439.56s)]
*  Israeli military, but they knew it was a vast amount. They knew that thousands upon thousands [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=444.76000000000005s)]
*  of civilians were being slaughtered, that included entire bloodlines wiped from the face of the earth [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=450.28000000000003s)]
*  over and over again, that so many of the slaughtered were children and babies, but they showed more [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=455.32000000000005s)]
*  outrage over the false claims of Israeli babies being beheaded on 7th October than they did about [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=461.48s)]
*  literally hundreds of Palestinian newborns being incinerated by explosives, crushed to death under [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=466.52000000000004s)]
*  destroyed buildings and literally suffocated to death in besieged and attacked hospitals [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=471.88s)]
*  as they were ripped away from their ventilators. They may not have known the name of practically [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=477.08000000000004s)]
*  any slaughtered Palestinian child, but even they must have heard about Hind Rajab, a five-year-old [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=482.84000000000003s)]
*  little girl with a beautiful smile whose family, her aunt, uncle and four other cousins tried to [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=488.36s)]
*  flee their home for safety, most of them killed, leaving just her and 15-year-old cousin Leigh-Anne [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=493.16s)]
*  alive. Leigh-Anne desperately ringing the Palestine red crescent, pleading for help before you hear [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=498.12s)]
*  her slaughtered on that call by a tank, an ambulance sent to save little Hind, now on the phone, terrified [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=503.08000000000004s)]
*  in a car full of the bloodied corpses of her family as she begged for help, as she pleaded, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=510.28000000000003s)]
*  she was terrified of the dark. The paramedics sent to save her who coordinated their journey [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=515.08s)]
*  with the Israeli defence forces who were then blown up by the Israeli army, barely anything [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=519.64s)]
*  remaining of their corpses and then days later the decomposing bodies of Hind and her family [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=523.8000000000001s)]
*  were discovered. They may not have known that every single aid agency as well as two government [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=528.84s)]
*  departments concluded over and over and over again many months ago that Israel was deliberately [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=534.6s)]
*  starving the Palestinian people as was promised by Israeli leaders from the beginning but they [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=540.52s)]
*  certainly knew enough. They may have tried to avoid hearing the endless stories of Israeli [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=544.92s)]
*  soldiers torturing and raping Palestinians including to death but even some of them must [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=550.04s)]
*  have heard about a riot in support of the right to rape Palestinian detainees on the streets of [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=554.92s)]
*  Tel Aviv attended by Israeli ministers this summer. Did they really think, did they really think, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=559.56s)]
*  that there was some legitimate moral or military end which justified unleashing this level of [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=565.88s)]
*  death, destruction, carnage, suffering, killing so many more times the number of Israelis killed on [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=570.2s)]
*  the 7th of October day after day after day after day for 465 days. They knew enough, they knew enough [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=575.48s)]
*  and yet many of them carried on justifying this barbarism. They knew enough and yet many of them [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=583.4000000000001s)]
*  refused to speak out apart from empty hand-wringing and platitudes. Let's be generous, let's be [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=587.72s)]
*  generous. Maybe some of them were scared, I know some of them are scared. Maybe they feared being [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=592.9200000000001s)]
*  smeared as racists or terrorist supporters because they happen to object to the mass slaughter of [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=596.92s)]
*  innocent people. Maybe they feared their careers would be menaced, that they'd be de-platformed. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=601.8s)]
*  None of these, none of them irrational fears but I'll tell you this, none of these fears are worth [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=606.12s)]
*  even a thousandth or a millionth of the fears of Palestinian journalists spending every day fearing [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=611.24s)]
*  that this may not only be their last day but the last day of every single person they love. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=617.56s)]
*  Cowardice, cowardice not least in an age of genocide is complicity. If you have a platform, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=622.6800000000001s)]
*  if you have influence and if you have power. They knew, they knew enough and they helped drown the [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=629.48s)]
*  Palestinian in blood, that blood of course spilled by western weapons because if the western media [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=636.6s)]
*  actually did its job and made clear the gravity of this crime then it would have been stopped a long [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=644.2s)]
*  time ago. Well I'll tell you this, I'll tell you this, it wasn't just the politicians, it wasn't [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=649.48s)]
*  just the politicians and the executioners of the Rwandan genocide who ended up in the dock, it was [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=653.88s)]
*  the journalists who were complicit in that genocide as well. We must not let them get away with this. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=658.36s)]
*  No crime in history was so confessed to, so publicly, so proudly, so repeatedly. No crime [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=664.2s)]
*  in history was so documented as it actually happened. There is no excuses, there is nowhere [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=669.96s)]
*  to hide and everyone who has their fingerprints over the crime scene must be held to account. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=675.64s)]
*  And yet with noble exceptions as the Palestinian people who actually did the work knowing that at [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=680.12s)]
*  any moment, any moment they could be exterminated alongside their entire families, these same [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=686.1999999999999s)]
*  western journalists couldn't even bring themselves to type or mutter a word of solidarity with their [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=691.24s)]
*  colleagues. They don't think Palestinians are humans. That's not hyperbole, it's a statement [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=695.4s)]
*  of the obvious because nobody, not a single person who really thinks Palestinians are of equal worth [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=701.32s)]
*  would ever tolerate what has been inflicted upon them in what is a genocide. Hell, if you thought [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=707.0s)]
*  Palestinians were worth a fraction of the worth of the people you consider your own, you wouldn't [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=713.6400000000001s)]
*  tolerate this. What did they think was happening when so many genocide and Holocaust scholars came [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwAE8jif_v4&t=721.08s)]
