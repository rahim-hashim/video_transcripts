# LIVE Tories In PANIC Over Support For Palestine
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [November 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnV3XMA3Jr4)
*  Hello and hello hello. Sorry, let me just adjust my camera there. So I'm staring right
*  down the barrel to speak to all. Hello, welcome to the show. Well, okay, we've now had over
*  a month of absolutely horrendous bloodshed, a terrible atrocity currently be committed
*  against the people of Gaza. Well over 10,000 people have now been killed. That is likely
*  to be an underestimate. I say that because there's been an attempt to downplay the figures,
*  including led by President Joe Biden, on the grounds that the health ministry is run by
*  Hamas. In previous outbreaks of violence, those final death tolls have been validated
*  by both Israel and the United Nations. In any case, the identification numbers, names
*  and ages of those killed have been released. But actually, it's likely to be an underestimate
*  because I'm sorry to say this, but many of those killed are lying under rubble and they've
*  been lying under rubble for quite a while. And therefore, Uromed monitors based in Geneva,
*  Uromeda Human Rights monitors believe the death toll is now well over 13,000. The IDF
*  have actually been boasting and saying it's around 20,000 that was quoted in the Israeli press.
*  In any case, a truly horrendous massacre is currently taking place in which vast numbers
*  of innocent people are being killed. And they've been killed every single day and they have been
*  killed with the active support of the British government, the British opposition and most of
*  the British media. It is one of the most grotesque sites of my lifetime. It is important, as I've
*  been doing, to elevate the voices we need to be hearing. And I hope you've been seeing many of
*  the interviews I've been doing, whether that be with Palestinian voices, of course, Israeli peace
*  activists, including a refusenik soldier, someone who was imprisoned for refusing to serve in the
*  army because of her courageous objection to the occupation. And here, Jewish peace activists,
*  British Palestinian, American Palestinian activists. So it's important we hear those
*  voices because they're being dehumanized, particularly Palestinian voices, I should say.
*  And the dehumanization, the racist dehumanization of the Palestinians is not even subtle. Let's be
*  it. It's not subtle. There is no attempt to pretend that Palestinian life has any equal worth
*  whatsoever. I interviewed a Palestinian journalist this week, some of you may have seen,
*  23 members of his family killed by the Israeli army. I don't even know how it's humanly possible
*  to grieve for 23 loved ones at the same time. I don't know how the brain has the capacity
*  to grieve for 23 people who are in your family at the same time. Just don't know how that's possible.
*  Those are the sorts of horrors which are now being suffered by Palestinians every single day.
*  And that is happening on the basis of serious, multiple, egregious violations of international
*  law of the norms, the legal norms, which govern warfare. As many of you have seen, I interviewed
*  the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territories,
*  Francesca Albanese, and she went through in great detail why these are war crimes. And indeed,
*  we have multiple experts warning of the threat of genocide. You have to listen to genocide scholars,
*  UN Special Rapporteurs, and journalists who have gone through genocides,
*  legal scholars when they warn of genocide. You don't just push that side.
*  This is a catastrophe of a sort which, well, it's difficult to put into words. And as I keep saying,
*  the Israeli government and Israeli officials aren't being subtle. They're being very clear
*  about their intentions when they quote genocidal passages from the Bible, when they call for the
*  Gaza to be reduced to a city of tents, when they say they're fighting human animals, they're going
*  to eliminate everything, when they talk about ethnically cleansing the Gaza Strip entirely,
*  annexing its land, not subtle. If you were going to have a war crimes tribunal, you wouldn't have
*  to sift through secret documents. You'd literally just have to listen to what they're saying.
*  I say all this because there is an attempt in Britain, they cynical, they blatant, and,
*  as I say, not subtle attempt to shift the moral outrage away from those who support this massacre,
*  who feel morally exposed. Turns out lots of people, regardless of political persuasions,
*  don't take that kindly to watching innocent children being blown apart by missiles on a daily
*  basis. They're trying to say the real outrageous extremists are those opposed to war crimes,
*  opposed to slaughtering children, opposed to wiping an entire area off the face of the map,
*  and the moderates are the people who support violating international law
*  and raining hellfire down innocent children. That's why they're trying to
*  ban the protests. This idea that suddenly on Armistice Day, we can't argue for an armistice.
*  Apparently on Armistice Day, we all remember, of course, when Armistice Day previously fell on
*  Saturday, we were not allowed to do anything. When actually what happens is you have a team
*  in silence and then life carries on as normal. Anyway, that's enough of me. I've left my guests
*  waiting far too long. If you're watching live, do press like and subscribe. Do you keep showing
*  the road of Patreon.com or social media as ever. Do you super chat so I can see people doing
*  and I will get through those as best as I can. I'll go back to them very shortly.
*  Let me bring in the brilliant Joon Pang from Liberty, who is obviously a, everyone will know
*  about Liberty, human rights organization, and you know the law when it comes to protests, for example.
*  Thank you, Joon, by the way, for joining us. No worries at all. Thanks so much for having me.
*  Can I just quickly put a very quick, this is 39 seconds from ITV, I think, on Monday,
*  which just basically sets out Svela Bravaman's position, the government's position,
*  and the Metropolitan Police warning protesters or trying to tell voters not to have a protest on
*  Saturday. Let's just hear from that. In my mind, there's only one way to describe those marches.
*  They are hate marches. What the police have made clear is that they are concerned that there's a
*  large number of bad actors who are deliberately operating beneath the criminal threshold.
*  Today, senior Scotland Yard officers met with organizers of Saturday's planned protest
*  and told them they were worried about breakaway groups intent on fuelling disorder. However,
*  the campaigners declined to postpone the demo. In a direct message to the organizers tonight,
*  police said, please, we ask you to urgently reconsider. It is not appropriate to hold any
*  protests in London this weekend. So, Joon, just on that, that was on Monday, and actually,
*  the Metropolitan Police has so far declined to ban the protest. They did basically a statement
*  saying we don't want you to do the protest. They haven't banned them and they don't believe they
*  have the legal position to do so. Can you just tell me what you just think, first of all, about
*  the government's pressure on the Metropolitan Police, including Soraya Labravim and the Home
*  Secretary's rhetoric about the protest and what you think about that context?
*  Thank you so much, Owen, and thank you again for having me on. I think that the Home Secretary and
*  indeed the Prime Minister's statements regarding Saturday's protest are incredibly dangerous and
*  really should send a chill down everyone's spine who cares about civil liberties in this country.
*  You have a situation here where the police have said that they don't have the necessary
*  intelligence to kind of to mean that a ban is actually necessary,
*  and but continually we have seen the government pile on the pressure, it seems, on the police to
*  try and stop this march from happening. And I think that, you know, not only does this impinge
*  on the operational independence of the police, and I think we're seeing this tension play out
*  even in the last 24 hours, but more broadly in the context of the government clamping down on
*  freedom of expression, introducing anti-protest laws, this is something that should really worry
*  us all. Just in terms of this attempt to ban a protest, because it's on Armistice Day, even
*  though the protest is one minute and 45 minutes after the two minutes time has begun, it ends,
*  begins and ends, that it doesn't go anywhere near the armistice, sorry, anywhere near the cenotaph,
*  that it starts two miles away then ends further away. I mean, it's just that they're trying to
*  produce a basis which is about kind of the potential for something for which there is no
*  evidence, the idea that this would be an attempt to attack war memorials, and that's why it needs to
*  be shut down or violate the two minute silence when it doesn't. I mean, what do you just think,
*  just in terms of the legal position of, I mean, the legal footing of what they're trying to do here?
*  I think it's an incredibly, I mean, it seems tenuous and it would seem wildly disproportionate
*  to ban the march on the basis that, you know, obviously the police have said that they'll
*  continue assessing the situation, but as it stands, banning a protest in these circumstances would be
*  incredibly disproportionate. And of course, the protest organizers themselves have said repeatedly
*  that, as you say, they're going nowhere near the cenotaph, they're marching a few hours afterwards,
*  they've agreed a route that, you know, they've publicized on their social media that again goes
*  nowhere near the cenotaph. And so it's really, I think, difficult to see how a ban would be
*  proportionate in these circumstances where the organizers have done, it seems, everything they
*  can to ensure that it goes smoothly. And the police, of course, have a duty to facilitate
*  the right to protest, and a ban should only be the last possible resort, at least, you know,
*  according to the law. So, I mean, if we think about the precedence for banning protests,
*  because that has happened, and that's been the case, for example, with various far-right
*  demonstrations, which has specifically often gone through, so for example, the English Defense
*  League seeking to march through a predominantly Muslim community. So you have had bans of protests
*  before in very specific circumstances. Yes, that's true and absolutely right. And it is true that
*  these powers, Section 13 of the Public Order Act 1986, have been used before.
*  But in our knowledge, and in our view at Liberty, we don't think these powers have been used on a
*  protest of this scale before. And I think it's also worth noting that, yes, there are precedents for
*  the use of the Section 13 power, but I think a more kind of recent example of an illustration
*  of what might actually happen is actually the Sarah Everard vigil, which the Met banned
*  two years ago. And now we know that, well, at the time, we believed that it was, you know,
*  unlawful and not in line with human rights, and the court has since vindicated that. But I think
*  the shocking scenes of what happened afterwards shows what happens when
*  the police take a really heavy-handed approach to protest that doesn't respect
*  fundamental rights. And, you know, we were incredibly concerned, and to be honest, still are,
*  that if eventually a ban does happen, that we could see similar scenes of really violent
*  police activity. And we really hope that this will not happen.
*  I mean, indeed on that, David Bras, who asked, well, Cruella Bravo in there,
*  is an authoritarian, no form of empathy, what are the chances of deploying the police anyway
*  against the protest? Orgrieve, and for those who don't know what that refers to, the Battle of
*  Orgrieve was a notorious incident during the miners' strike in which miners were attacked
*  viciously by the police. In an atmosphere, it must be said, when striking miners were widely demonised
*  by both politicians and the media, so a climate, a context existed, and we're seeing today how those
*  who protest in support of Palestinians are being demonised. I mean, what do you think? Do you think
*  this could lay the foundations or an attempt to deter, because I'm worried about saying all this,
*  I don't want to deter people from turning up, and I worry that's part of what they're doing here.
*  I mean, you know, I think you really need to consider the fact that
*  in previous weeks, I guess throughout the last month, the Home Secretary has made statements
*  effectively encouraging the police to abuse and overextend in the exercise of their powers,
*  to the extent that the Met actually had to issue a kind of correction or statement to say that, for
*  example, no flying a Palestinian flag or it's not in and of itself a criminal offence. And of course,
*  there already have been arrests at previous protests, and I think what is really concerning,
*  though, in light of the circumstances and the government pressure on the police throughout the
*  last week, is that the protest may be policed incredibly heavily, and so it's really vital that
*  people know their rights, but also know fundamentally that they do have the right to protest,
*  and their rights have not changed in the last week.
*  I mean, on that, the other thing I just want to ask is, we are hearing about far-right extremists
*  who are seeking to mobilize their supporters. I would say that the government and the media have
*  played a very dangerous game in whipping up hatred against those who protest against the police,
*  hatred against those who protest against what's happening to the Palestinian people.
*  A lot of the far-right activists are echoing, frankly, a lot of what the government is saying
*  about Palestinian protesters, and they've been given, basically, they're being legitimized.
*  But then they'll end up saying that because far-right activists are mobilizing, that they're
*  going to ban the protest on the basis of disorder. So they whip up far-right extremists who then
*  mobilize people, and then they say, well, the danger of clashes means we'll ban the protest.
*  What do you think? Is that a possible scenario?
*  I think that it's obviously a really delicate situation. I think that
*  the Home Secretary's statements have been, in our view, incredibly inflammatory
*  in terms of calling, for example, the protests of the last few weeks hate marches.
*  And what government should be doing at this point is leading clearly and responsibly
*  and not trying to stoke up further division, which is what we fear that it has already done
*  in its statements, but that a ban would definitely inflame should it actually happen.
*  And we really hope that it won't.
*  G, thank you so much for going through that. Just, I think, very carefully, just explaining
*  the legal position and also what the context, the broader context, what the government's been doing.
*  Liberty do such fantastic work. Every time I write any article about the attack on the right to
*  protest and the attack on our freedoms, which has been taking place over the last few years,
*  often by people who claim that the threat to free speech comes from the left when actually we have
*  a government clamping down on our basic hard-won rights. So thank you, June. Honestly, I really,
*  really appreciate it as ever. So thank you so much for joining us. Great stuff. We have, by the way,
*  shortly joining us, Dr. Hosni Durafi-Malbini, who is an NHS anaesthetist, but also a former
*  Labour councillor who resigned. I want to talk to her as well because Imran Hussein,
*  the former Shia Lai Minister for the New Deal for Working People, has resigned from the Labour front
*  bench in protest at the refusal of the Labour leadership to support a ceasefire. I hope that
*  he is the first of many other front benches to resign. I know of other front benches who
*  obviously are angry about the current position and I hope that they will show courage and
*  leadership in the same way Imran Hussein has and come out and resign. Just in terms of other
*  secret chats, this is an important point here. FSM is the dog. Don't forget the BBC flipping the
*  coverage. What FSM is the dog is referend to there is the Battle of Algrieve again,
*  when miners were attacked on horseback by the police. This is an instructive example,
*  which we should always be mindful of. The police were the aggressors. They charged on horseback
*  against the miners and they nearly, they could have killed those miners. People quite rightly
*  draw a link between Algrieve and Hillsborough in that the way the police were allowed to behave
*  in South Yorkshire against the Algrieve, against striking miners Algrieve, the demonisation of
*  working class people, miners, and then that provided a context for them to be attacked.
*  The BBC coverage made it look like the miners attacked the police because they put the footage
*  in a different order. Just beware, that's how the media behave. I wrote about that at length in
*  the establishment a few years ago. That is one example of how the media and the police work in
*  tandem often when it comes to demonising protesters. There's lots of other very disturbing
*  examples of that as well. David Brassard, my expectation for Biden and Starmor were always
*  pretty low but wow, they're bad. I keep saying that Joe Biden nearly came across, could nearly
*  eat out the least bad US president since World War II. Which actually if you go through those
*  presidents, you know, because you know, the slaughter of Southeast Asia by democratic presidents who
*  began all that for example in the 1960s but nonetheless, yeah, well he's not going to win
*  that position is he? Thank you for speaking for the Palestinians, for the world leaders speaking,
*  we appreciate you. Well what I'm just going to do before we bring in our next guest, I'm just
*  going to give you an example, just this is actually really important. This is a brilliant
*  nurse, an American nurse who was in Gaza who was interviewed on CNN. Let's just listen to what
*  she said because we really do need to hear these voices. Would you go back to Gaza? In a heartbeat,
*  in an absolute heartbeat. My heart is in Gaza, it will stay in Gaza. The Palestinian people that I
*  worked with, both our national staff in the office as well as my staff at Indonesia Hospital were
*  some of the most incredible people I've ever met in my life. When everything went off and we got
*  the notice to move south of Wadi Gaza, I was texting my nurses at Indonesia Hospital and I said,
*  we lost a nurse weekend one. He was killed when the ambulance outside the hospital was blown up.
*  And I was texting them when we got the evacuation orders and I said, did any of you move south? Did
*  any of you get out? Are any of you coming down this way? And the only answer I got was,
*  this is our community, this is our family, these are our friends. If they're going to kill us,
*  we're going to die saving as many people as we can. And I said, if I can ever have an ounce of
*  the heart that you have, I will die a happy person. They were incredible.
*  That my doctors and nurses didn't leave out of loyalty to their community. And I know that there
*  is an idea being pushed right now that anyone that stayed behind is going to be considered some
*  kind of a threat. And I want to remind people that the people that stayed behind are heroes.
*  The people that stayed behind are, they know they're going to die and they're choosing to
*  stay behind anyway. You're talking about doctors, nurses in the hospital?
*  I wake up every morning and I send out a text message and I ask, are you alive?
*  And every night before I go to sleep, I send another message and says, are you alive?
*  Well, Kelly, thank you so much for your time.
*  Thank you.
*  Just an example, just, I mean, the reason that's so important is just the deliberate and systematic
*  attempt to dehumanize the Palestinian people in Gaza. And this is a precondition, it's always a
*  precondition for the mass slaughter of the sort that we're currently seeing. You know, I would
*  refer people and this is not hyperbolic, a journalist who covered the Rwandan genocide made this point
*  about the demonization there, which took place by media outlets.
*  How people would dehumanize was a precondition for what happened. I want to give you
*  something else as well. This is a press conference held by Palestinian children begging to live.
*  Since the 7th of October, we face extermination, killing, bombing falling over our heads.
*  All of this in front of the world. They lie to the world that they kill the parties, but they
*  kill the people of Gaza. Their dreams and their future.
*  Kids of Gaza run out of death once and once. We come to Al-Shifa hospital to keep us from
*  bombing. We suddenly run out of death more. After bombing the hospital, the occupation
*  is starving us. We don't find water, food and we drink from unusable water.
*  We come now to shout and invite you to protect us. We want to live, we want peace,
*  we want to judge the killers of children. We want medicine, food and education.
*  And we want to live as the other children live.
*  Now, well over 4,000 children have been killed. According to the estimates of EuroMed Human Rights
*  monitors, the independent human rights organization based in Geneva, it's likely that around 5,500
*  children in Gaza have now been killed since this began. That's because the official estimates do
*  not include those children who are now lying dead beneath rubble and whose bodies cannot be
*  retrieved in a tiny strip of land no bigger than East London where those sorts of
*  attempts to retrieve bodies are logistically very difficult and resource and time consuming
*  given everything that they are currently up against. So I just think it's again important to,
*  you know, these are children, these are children like any other children, like children who
*  many of you have parents or grandparents or have nephews and nieces like I do, little kids,
*  very similar wherever they are, who are being killed in the most horrendous way possible and
*  who are being maimed, who are losing their parents, their siblings, their loved ones,
*  who are being traumatized, who don't have access to clean water, who are being amputated without
*  anesthetic and that goes as well for mothers who are giving birth without anything other than the
*  comfort of the brave courageous doctors and nurses in Gaza who, many of whom have been killed as they
*  try their best to save lives. I just want to give something hopeful as well because I know we're
*  just waiting a lot of the guests. I just want to give, you know, there is within, this is in
*  Israel proper rather than the areas there under illegal occupation, in a Haifa,
*  standing together which brings together Israeli Jews and Palestinian citizens of Israel
*  and this is a peace movement that brings these communities together. I just want to show you
*  because I've interviewed Alan Lee, if you look up Alan Lee Green's interview with me,
*  you'll see because we do always have to talk about hope here and the only hope that exists
*  is a peaceful settlement which provides security for Jews and Palestinians
*  alike and this peace movement is absolutely key to that possible future so let's just listen.
*  We just had an amazing event tonight with hundreds of Jewish and Arab Palestinian citizens
*  coming together and speaking in a very direct way about an Israeli-Palestinian peace,
*  about Jewish-Arab partnership, about resisting killing innocent children and people in Gaza
*  and this is the only way, the only way to create a different reality here. It's the only way to
*  create a reality where we're not going from one world to the other, from one violent escalation
*  to another violent escalation. We say to our government, stop leading us into more death,
*  start talking to us about life. The only way to achieve safety and security is by ending the
*  occupation of millions of people in Palestine and yes we need to deal with Hamas but we shouldn't
*  threaten Hamas and whenever we kill more innocent children it strengthens the extremists like Hamas
*  so please dear Israeli government let us go in the different direction. Our way is the only
*  way for peace, the only way for life. Just on that I think it's just such a really important point
*  there at the end made there which is that account insurgency programs of this type are
*  horrific in their consequences but they also fail on their own terms that's what historic,
*  that's what history shows because there isn't a military solution to what is a political issue.
*  Hamas was strengthened in the first place for two main reasons firstly the secular
*  Palestinian liberation movements, Palestinian liberation organisation which gave up the
*  armed struggle in the early 90s and it was nothing to show for it and that obviously they were
*  brutally undermined by Israel who allowed them to have this diminished power which they have in the
*  West Bank where they have they're allowed the most absurdly low powers because the West Bank
*  is under occupation, Israeli occupation and the desperation of the Palestinian people only grew
*  as well as the fact that as Haaretz, the Israeli newspaper has underlined
*  Benjamin Netanyahu encouraged and nurtured and supported Hamas on the basis it would divide
*  the Palestinian movement because there could never be an independent Palestine if you had divided rule
*  where you have Fatah, the secular movement in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza where they're opponents
*  and therefore you have permanent division and you know that is obviously a very important context
*  but the point is about these so-called counter-insurgency programs is what they do and what they're doing is
*  brutalising people, you leave huge numbers of people traumatised and furious and they watch their
*  loved ones brutally slayed, they hold their dead children in their arms and they do not end up
*  concluding that submission to the state of Israel is something they will ever wish to do
*  instead they feel they want often I think revenge is the wrong word but
*  they obviously are far less likely or amenable to any idea of any sense of peace with Israel, of course
*  they wouldn't, would you? Of course you wouldn't, I mean that's why these counter-insurgency programs
*  fail and I am sick to death of having to listen to people who brought us for example Afghanistan
*  where we had a counter-insurgency program for two decades which ended with the Taliban stronger than
*  ever acting as though they know what the hell they're talking about because there isn't the
*  basis for this or what they did for example Al-Qaeda in Iraq not in the same context,
*  you know Al-Qaeda in Iraq is not the same as a decades long occupation and brutalisation
*  at the hands of one particular or other state but Al-Qaeda were put down by a so-called
*  counter-insurgency program in the noughties, do you know what happened? ISIS came along,
*  they were even worse, people thought you couldn't get any worse than Al-Qaeda, oops that was
*  unfortunate, Al-Qaeda thought ISIS were too extreme, we ended up with ISIS and huge numbers of people died
*  in the aftermath, that's what happens and when they say Hamas is ISIS, lack of imagination on their
*  part to say the least, now just quickly we did have Hosni joining a councillor and we were just
*  checking because they haven't appeared. What I am about to say, the reason we might have to wrap
*  up earlier because she hasn't arrived is I've got to go on Skydives at 7 on Sophie Ridges' program,
*  the last time I was on Sophie Ridges' program I was on with Margaret Hodge at the beginning
*  or towards the beginning of this nightmare, I'm sure some of you watched that particular incident
*  unfold, this time I'm on with Liam Fox who is a Conservative MP, before we probably do have a wrap
*  up, before I do, I do want to say something about Saturday, they are trying to deter people from
*  turning up, we need to be very clear about what's going on here, firstly they're trying to
*  claim that the real moral disgrace is, I think Hosni is about to join us quickly by the way so
*  we'll have a few minutes with Hosni, the real moral disgrace are those who support
*  or oppose a brutal massacre and what they're trying to do is they know that the British
*  government is complicit in what's happening, we arm and back Israel and if Britain ends up
*  being forced to shift its position like Spain and Ireland then that will encourage other governments
*  to do the same, it's very very very important that we are not frightened from going to this
*  protest, we don't fear that we're being stigmatised, we have the majority of public opinion on our side,
*  the polling is very clear, a large majority want to ceasefire and a large majority do not support
*  the horrors being unleashed against the Palestinian people in Gaza, doesn't mean people were not
*  horrified by what Hamas did on the southern of October, they just do not believe that the response
*  to that is to kill at least 10 times more people and counting bearing in mind that the current death
*  toll will only be a fraction of the final death toll as things stand unless there is a dramatic
*  shift in course, so it's so important that we all march together that we rebut the lies, this is a
*  march which begins at 12.45 nowhere near the two minute silence, it's marching nowhere near the
*  Cenotaph, it's marching from Hyde Park to the US embassy, it will have a large Jewish contingent,
*  there was a Jewish bloc which is meeting at a specific location, I've written a piece for the
*  Guardian by the way, if you go to the Guardian opinion website I've written a piece just going
*  through all this, this nonsense about Armistice Day as though you know it's disrespectful to the
*  dead, do you know what's disrespectful to the dead? Because using the dead, so I think of for
*  example my great- you know like lots of Brits I lost relatives in both wars, my great-great-uncle
*  was killed at the age of 19 mowed down on the sob, my great-grandfather
*  was killed, sorry died in the Royal Navy in 1942 in World War II and is buried as well in
*  Commonwealth graves, my grandfather survived his boat being bombed twice in the Atlantic by the
*  Nazis, he was part of the military navy with second worst attrition after the RAF which kept
*  the country from being starved to death by the Nazis during World War II, he survived 10 days
*  in an open boat, again one of my great-uncles has got a medal for his heroism, it's no disrespect
*  to those people to demand an armistice on Armistice Day or to remember all those who
*  are being killed in war and to stop other people from suffering the horrors of war and actually
*  what's really disrespectful is this, they're not doing this because it's Armistice Day, Armistice
*  Day when it falls on a Saturday people have always just got on with their lives, they've always gone
*  to the pub, people- what will happen on Armistice Day just so everyone knows, the pubs will be full
*  of people getting pissed, there'll be a few fights, normally is, clubs, nightclubs across the country,
*  football games, they have football matches all the way through Saturday,
*  went look through the fixtures, multiple football games going on, again the vast majority will be
*  peaceful football fans, there'll be some trouble, there'll be some idiots, there always is when you
*  get a large crowd, you wouldn't ban football matches on that basis would you? Of course you
*  wouldn't, so life continues as normal but they've suddenly plucked out of their arses the idea that
*  Armistice Day you can't have a protest in support of peace which is just a nonsense and what they're
*  doing is this, they just want to ban the protest because they don't like the message, they don't
*  like what it's arguing for so they're thinking aha we can use Armistice Day as an excuse, so what
*  they're doing is disrespecting the dead, they're disrespecting the dead soldiers, they're using
*  them as political props, they're hiding behind the dead in order to try and damage a movement,
*  arguing for peace and for the end of mass slaughter of children, it is so obvious and transparent,
*  they're the disrespectful ones and they're the ones who should be morally disgraced but I think
*  I'm gonna have to wrap up just because I do have to go and do Sky News, Hosni was going to join
*  us and said she's going to join us but I just don't think we have time unfortunately but I will try
*  and interview Hosni another time instead, please like and subscribe, got loads of interviews in the
*  coming every day, we've got videos every day, got loads of interviews coming up and so do hold on
*  for those including Palestinians, including we've got an Israeli soldier who was in Gaza in 2014
*  who opposes the war and will speak through what's going, just quickly as well,
*  Tad's can't well it's telling how the poppy has become a symbol of British nationalism with a knife,
*  football players in the UK, how did he not wear it, absurd and here we go David Bratter, how do you
*  think his labour would respond to large social movements and protests when a government would be
*  more willing to listen or would be something like the Tories or worse? Well I suppose that's the
*  question people have to ask because at the moment the Labour are under a lot more pressure than the
*  Tories, let me just think because Hosni is actually here, hey Hosni how you doing, how are you?
*  I'm sorry it's just been a bit hectic. I can imagine, don't worry I totally understand,
*  I totally understand you're extremely busy and you know given the context, not surprising,
*  I'll have to be quick but that's fine, I just wanted to speak to you quickly because I've got
*  to rush off as well to argue with a conservative on television for whatever I did in a past life,
*  not good, just again so everyone's clear, Hosni has two hats and Hosni is a former now Labour
*  Councillor and sorry where were you based again Hosni, I knew this by just now, you're one of the
*  great Oxford Councillors and I've interviewed of course one of your colleagues who also resigned,
*  and you're also a NHS anaesthetist is that right? That's right, I'm an NHS anaesthetist, yeah.
*  I just want to ask you just quickly a few questions before I go, so firstly just I'll be
*  interested just your take now we've got the first shadow minister resigning in around Hussain up in
*  Greater Manchester, so what's your take on that resignation? I mean I'm not surprised he's resigned,
*  I am not surprised that people with good conscience are speaking out and are resigning
*  because what is unfolding before us it's absolutely horrific, some of the messages I got today this
*  morning when I opened my phone before work it's actually kind of hard to repeat, you know any
*  doctor from Gaza messaged us to say that he that that morning that day he had seen three of his
*  colleagues dead, one was a pregnant colleague arrived dead, another colleague who'd been killed
*  whilst at work, a third colleague had been beheaded by an Israeli shell, I mean it's actually
*  difficult to like read these things and then carry on with your normal work I'll be honest with you
*  because it's just absolutely horrific and I don't want to you know obviously we know all the words
*  that have been repeated by the UN and various organisations but it's just absolutely horrific.
*  By the way it is difficult to hear that but it is important to say I think increasingly I mean I've
*  you've kind of toyed with what you said because you don't want to traumatise people but the level
*  of dehumanisation is so important people do need to know the reality of what's actually happening,
*  what this massacre actually means in practical terms. I mean I'm just interested in that in
*  terms of you know because obviously you've resigned from labour and there's a political consensus the
*  Conservatives and Labour have lined up behind this horror show and it just strikes me you know the
*  dehumanisation of Palestinians and that this is I think one of the most shocking episodes I've seen
*  just that element there's not even a pretence they have equal their lives matter. No I mean it's just
*  too many examples to name really from like died and killed you know from the use of language to
*  the way we're not allowed to even use the words of you know UN I've just I was just on the Vanessa
*  Feltz show and I was and I said the word genocide as according to the UN and human rights organisations
*  and she didn't she got very angry and allowed me to speak after that so this is you know this is
*  absolutely unbelievable the level of dehumanisation that we're facing but the stories are real and
*  they are touching so many people you know there's another colleague of ours who's a doctor who came
*  to Oxford and he was killed with 42 members of his family so Dr May said I was killed with 42
*  members of his family including his his sisters his parents you know whole families wiped out
*  and I again I can hardly bring myself to bring you this next bit but to tell you this next bit
*  but his brothers who were looking for their dead bodies under the rubble for 48 hours were then hit
*  by a different Israeli airstrike by a different Israeli airstrike and were killed I mean it's
*  actually hard to believe that this is all happening live on our on our tv you know on our on our media
*  basically and that's why everyone needs to do everything they can write through representatives
*  you know come to come to the demos any peaceful means you know bds you need to think about what
*  you're doing to support to make your voices heard because this cannot be on our conscience
*  and well it is on our conscience but we need to make sure that our voices heard are heard within
*  this disgusting warmongering disgusting warmongering and a pause and that word the pause it just makes
*  no sense I actually because I'm a medic I spend a lot of time with normal people who are not in the
*  labour bubbles and in the kind of you know in they don't spend that much time with other political
*  thinkers or whatever and they it's not a word that makes any sense to them they often say that
*  about politicians humanitarian pause makes no sense so the doctors and the health care workers
*  in Gaza are telling us so you're going to feed and nourish us for a bit and then bomb and maim us
*  again it's absolutely unbelievable and labor would do well to actually stand by the words they talk
*  about and they espouse they talk about equality but where is that equality that they talk of
*  it's absolutely disgusting I can see someone in the comments that I just saw you and Vanessa
*  show shocked about how she spoke to you when you mentioned gentle I just you know and just just
*  finally there is this deliberate attempt at the moment to demonize protesters who stand with the
*  Palestinian people during what is a horrendous atrocity of historic proportions and an attempt
*  to say the real as I keep saying the morally disgraceful people aren't the people who support
*  massacring innocent children and other innocent civilians it's not just children of course who
*  and women who are being sorted in Gaza and that the real extremists supposed to oppose murder and
*  the moderates the people who support the mass murder and but they're trying to I think you know
*  obviously they want to shut down the protest but they're trying to find people not going so what
*  would you say people are looking all this and they're like well actually I'm just scared I'm
*  really angry I'm upset I find this traumatizing but I'm scared to go what would you say honestly
*  like just find a friend who is going just get in touch with someone you know who's going I know
*  people of all faiths and no faiths you know I've been there with my young children to the to the
*  protests you know I know lots of people going so please just get in touch with a virtual person
*  or a real person you know in real life who's going and just go along with them there is nothing
*  scary it's absolutely I think this is actually just demonization of protests it's actually
*  really horrifying it really shows the depths that we are prepared to go to to prevent people's
*  democratic voices being heard and preventing us from having a real voice in our political
*  spheres and in our social spheres and actually that is a reason in itself to go if you really
*  believe in our hard fought for rights to be able to to participate in a democracy then you need
*  to go there on Saturday to make your voices heard please also follow Gaza medic voices if you know
*  of any healthcare workers please please get them to follow Gaza medic voices and please get them to
*  sign the urgent petition we have launched to calling for a ceasefire coming from healthcare
*  workers because so many healthcare workers about around 200 have been killed so far so many more
*  injured and that is actually obviously essential to people's well-being it's not just a suffering
*  and death to their families but the fact that it's essentially the people that do the caring for that
*  are also being killed amen so important to say and I've been so lucky to have so many of you from
*  Gaza medic voices each week now during this whole horror and I'll be sharing that petition just so
*  people are aware it's so important amazing work that you will do thank you so much for joining us
*  Hosni and really really appreciate I know things are really busy at the moment and but I'm glad
*  you were just able to join us and to share to share all of that but I will um I'll speak to you
*  but but lots of love take care solidarity thanks so much again cheers great great stuff there okay
*  so I bet I do better like it because I have to get to the studios now and just so people
*  aware I'll be there at seven at seven till eight with Liam Fox and I'll be doing Jeremy Vine or
*  the channel five shows with Alexis Conran so the Alexis Conran show tomorrow at let me work it out
*  I think it's 12 12 30 12 30 on channel five onwards and I'll be talking about this and
*  and after the process I've been good morning Britain on Monday morning so I'm sure we'll be
*  talking a lot from 6 30 a.m. about protests but otherwise I've got lots of videos and interviews
*  coming up and keep using your voices everyone it's really important this this is as important as it
*  gets and and however horrible this is we do have public opinion on our side we just need to build
*  that and I just think as the atrocities and horrors become ever clearer to people um you know we will
*  inflict a we must inflict a political price on those who are responsible for this for those who
*  in politics and the media have become accomplices to mass murder on an industrial scale they didn't
*  face accountability over the horrors of Iraq and Libya and Afghanistan they walk from crime scene
*  to crime scene soaked in blood asking for yet more blood and every single time they deliver
*  catastrophe catastrophe catastrophe and suddenly they want us to believe this time will be different
*  as they mow down innocent men women and children and wipe Gaza off the face of the earth and they
*  think that will provide peace and justice it won't and it will not do anything other than set the
*  scene for even more horrors not just now but for generations to come so it's important that we fight
*  this okay and press like and subscribe to share the video and it's great to get those voices out
*  as I say I'll be back with videos all the way pretty much every day and and yes
