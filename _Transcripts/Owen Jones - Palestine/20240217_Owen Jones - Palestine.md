# Shocking Evidence Israel Plots Mass Expulsion of Palestinians
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [February 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9j7V7-tEbo)
*  From the very start it has been very clear what was going to happen to Gaza and its people.
*  The reason for this is that the Israeli authorities just went ahead and said it.
*  From the very start there was no subtlety, no need to read between the lines, no need to
*  resort to tinfoil hack conspiracy theories. They said what they were going to do and they did it.
*  They said we will eliminate everything and that they had released all the restraints on the Israeli
*  army. These are both quotes from the Israeli defense minister and they made clear over and
*  over again that they held the entire population of Gaza to be collectively guilty. That's what
*  the Israeli president for example said as well as you wanted hell you will get hell as the Israeli
*  army coordinator of the Occupy Territory said or for example invoking the biblical story of Amalek
*  which calls for the killing of all men women children and livestock as Benjamin Netanyahu
*  referred to. Now we also know that the government is jam-packed full of people who want to ethnically
*  cleanse Gaza because they keep saying so and indeed 11 Israeli cabinet ministers attended a
*  conference at the end of January committed to the Israeli resettlement of Gaza and the so-called
*  voluntary migration of the Palestinian population. Not subtle. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*  himself back in December was according to Israeli newspaper Haim pushing for plans for pushing for
*  the so-called voluntary migration of Gaza's population adding our problem is the countries
*  that are willing to absorb them and we are working on it. Now you might wonder why this was not more
*  widely reported on and why the western media has failed over and over and over again to report the
*  stated intentions of Israeli leaders and your questions there have pretty solid foundations.
*  So we're just clear so we're clear about the depraved lie that is so-called voluntary migration.
*  I know people are aware probably I hope of how war criminals throughout history use euphemisms like
*  re-education camp or enhanced interrogation technique that means torture by the way.
*  What voluntary migration really means is making Gaza completely inhospitable like 70% of Gaza's
*  homes being severely damaged or destroyed that is as is with more damage for inevitably come or
*  destroying the health care system or access to food or or fresh water we could go on and then
*  saying well look they can't survive there anymore can they so as a humanitarian gesture I guess
*  they'll all have to leave. Now there is the obvious precedent of Palestinians being forced
*  to leave their homes and never being allowed to return like the Nakba the so-called catastrophe
*  in 1948 that's when Israel was founded when 750,000 Palestinians or so were driven from their homes
*  that was accompanied with 15,000 or so violent deaths or the perhaps 300,000 more driven from
*  their homes in 1967 and so on. Now Gaza's own population are painfully aware of all this
*  it is their reality the vast majority of Gaza's population are the families of those driven from
*  their homes in the Nakba. Now in all of these occasions the Palestinians driven from the homes
*  were never allowed back something of course they are all too painfully aware of so when
*  Avi Dicta an Israeli minister who belongs to Netanyahu's Likud party says we're rolling out
*  Nakba 2023 well again quite literally we only have to listen to what they're saying.
*  Now Egypt's regime it's an unpleasant regime by the way another unpleasant western backs regime
*  but that's for another time its dictator El Sisi has repeatedly warned about the ethnic cleansing
*  of the Palestinian people back in October he said we reject the displacement of Palestinians from
*  their land and liquidating the Palestinian cause is extremely dangerous what is happening now in
*  Gaza is an attempt to push citizens to seek refuge and migrate to Egypt he also made an important
*  point that the Israeli onslaught was not an act against Hamas but rather to push the population
*  to leave if the Palestinians should be displaced why not transfer them to the Negev until the end
*  of the war Negev desert to be clear is in Israel itself so if Palestinians were temporarily housed
*  there they would clearly be far more likely to return home because clearly Israel's got no
*  intention of keeping them within its official borders. Now Egypt has itself threatened to
*  withdraw from the 1978 peace treaty with Israel which regional geopolitics depends
*  if a ground invasion against Ra'far where of course much of the Gaza population now is
*  and if that takes place now all of this context is important when discussing some new disturbing
*  developments the Sinai foundation for human rights group is a monitoring group the Sinai
*  desert for those who don't know is in Egypt it's right next to Gaza over the Ra'far crossing indeed
*  Ra'far as a city historically straddles the border between Gaza and Sinai and that got separated when
*  Israel was forced to withdraw from the Sinai desert previously which had occupied in 1967 along with
*  Gaza and the west bank now the Sinai foundation has found workers using heavy machinery erecting
*  concrete barriers and security towers around a strip of land on the Egyptian side of the Ra'far
*  crossing which you'll have heard of that's of course the crucial entry point for humanitarian
*  aid and so on into Gaza now the own view is that this is an effort to establish an isolated area
*  surrounded by walls on the border with the Gaza strip with the aim of receiving refugees in the
*  event of a mass exodus from Gaza now we know of course that most of Gaza's population were
*  driven south under threat of violence from the Israeli state the majority of its pre-war 2.2
*  million people or so are now in Ra'far which had a pre-war population of just 280 000 now i've been
*  talking to the brilliant journalist Hamza M. Saeed who is the co-host of the brilliant
*  Trojan Horse Affair podcast for serial and the New York Times which I highly recommend he's
*  rightly been trying to draw more attention about the prospect of Israel driving the Palestinian
*  people of Gaza into the Sinai desert so they're permanently ethnically cleansed a new Nakba and
*  must emphasize what has happened is already much bloodier much more violent than the 1948 Nakba
*  now he rightly refers to document which was leaked back in October an Israeli official document
*  which I covered on this channel it was leaked to the Israeli Palestinian media outlets 972
*  and local core it was from the Ministry of Intelligence and it recommended the forcible
*  and permanent transfer of Gaza's entire Palestinian population to Egypt's Sinai desert the document
*  was drawn up on the 13th of October so right near the start of all this it's 10 pages long
*  the document offered a number of suggestions but the preferred option it put forward was mass
*  ethnic cleansing it said evacuate the civilian population to Sinai establish tent cities and
*  then more permanent cities and then create a sterile zone of several kilometers with Egypt
*  to prevent the return of the population to activities or residences near the border with
*  Israel it discusses pressuring Egypt to absorb the population of Gaza now the journalist got
*  the leak point out the intelligence ministry is not as powerful as it sounds but it is headed by
*  a Likud politician Likud of course is Benjamin Netanyahu's own party and she's deemed a relative
*  moderate in that party so clearly it needs to be taken deadly seriously given all of the context
*  now we also know the New York Times published an article on the 5th of November about how Israel
*  quietly tried to build international support for what it calls euphemistically the transfer of
*  several hundred thousand civilians from Gaza to Egypt ethnic cleansing of course Israel tried to
*  dress us up with humanitarian nonsense regimes like this often do the same thing just come up
*  with atrocities which they then dress up as no no we're doing it for humanitarian reasons
*  but Egypt's state intelligence service denies Egypt is participating in a process which involves
*  the mass displacement of the Palestinian people to the Sinai desert but if we can see we can see
*  can't we what can happen what could happen that Israel launches the military onslaught against
*  Rafah that it is threatening and that leads amidst terrible bloodshed to mass displacement
*  of the Palestinian people to the Sinai desert where they will be expelled forever this is a
*  clear warning the evidence is there the context is there the precedent is there the language the
*  rhetoric is all there it's very clear if they think they can get away with it they will drive
*  the Palestinian people out of Gaza to the Sinai desert and then as history tells us
*  they will never ever ever be able to return we need to sound the alarm now please like subscribe
*  and share this video listen to us podcast I'll speak to you soon
