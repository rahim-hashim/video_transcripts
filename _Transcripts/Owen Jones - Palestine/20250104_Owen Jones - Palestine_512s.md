# Israeli Politicians OPENLY DEMAND Genocide
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY)
*  They're not even pretending. Eight Israeli politicians belonging to the political parties [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=0.0s)]
*  forming Israel's government who sit on the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee of the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=4.72s)]
*  Knesset, Israel's parliament, have come out and explicitly endorsed genocide. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=9.44s)]
*  Now this is important. It's important because genocide, of course, is clearly being committed [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=14.8s)]
*  by the Israeli state in Gaza. By the end of 2024, that became a consensus from the Israeli-American [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=19.68s)]
*  professor of genocide and Holocaust studies, Omar Batov, to the likes of Amnesty International [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=25.84s)]
*  with their detailed report. Now the central challenge in proving genocide is not the actual [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=31.68s)]
*  acts comprising genocide, but proving intent. Now there was an endless stream of statements [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=36.72s)]
*  by Israeli leaders and officials supporting genocide, but it is important that we keep [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=43.44s)]
*  amassing that evidence. Now as Israeli newspaper Haaretz notes, these politicians wrote in a letter [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=47.28s)]
*  to the Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, that Israel should destroy all sources of water, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=52.96s)]
*  all sources of food, all sources of energy in northern Gaza in order to defeat Hamas, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=58.4s)]
*  as they put it. They've complained that the IDF plan to quote unquote evacuate the population in [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=63.44s)]
*  the north of the strip to the south isn't being done properly. Well, more than that shortly. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=68.64s)]
*  They demand that anyone who doesn't come out with a white flag who moves in the area should be killed. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=73.28s)]
*  It should be noted that there are multiple reports which have been documented, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=78.08s)]
*  including by former Israeli soldiers and Haaretz, the Israeli newspaper there, of Israeli soldiers [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=82.4s)]
*  shooting dead Palestinians waving white flags. They even shot dead Israeli hostages waving white [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=89.44s)]
*  flags. Now using the term evacuation here is, let's just say, it's repulsive. It is absolutely [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  repulsive. It's Orwellian evacuation. This isn't an evacuation. This is ethnic cleansing. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=100.8s)]
*  The so-called general's plan being executed in northern Gaza involves preventing almost any [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=105.92s)]
*  humanitarian aid getting in, including food and other necessities of life, in order to starve the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=110.8s)]
*  people there and use violence to force them out or to kill them en masse, which is of course what [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=115.76s)]
*  is happening. The IDF briefed in November that they wouldn't let civilians return to northern [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=119.84s)]
*  Gaza, which isn't even subtle, is it? That is just ethnic cleansing. Now, it should be noted [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  that the 1948 Genocide Convention prohibits the public incitement of genocide, and Israel legislated [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=132.56s)]
*  for that in 1950. It still remains on Israel's statute books, carrying a theoretical death [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=137.36s)]
*  penalty. In other words, even under Israel's own laws, it is a capital offence. Now these politicians, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=142.4s)]
*  of course, openly demanding the destruction of any source of food, water and energy, that would mean [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=148.16s)]
*  killing every single person in northern Gaza, quite literally. It should be noted that in practice, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=153.28s)]
*  as well as aid being prevented from getting into northern Gaza, the Israeli military has sought to [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=157.52s)]
*  comprehensively destroy Gaza's domestic agriculture and food production. Indeed, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=161.52s)]
*  the brilliant researchers at Forensic Architecture have estimated that 83% of Gaza's plant life [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=166.08s)]
*  has been destroyed, for example. It's worth just considering what's happening to northern [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=171.12s)]
*  Gaza in particular right now. Much of this I discussed in my column for the Scottish newspaper [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=174.72s)]
*  The National. Let's consider, for example, the case of Dr. Hussam Abu Safiyah, the director of [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=179.44s)]
*  Kamal Adwan Hospital. That had been the last remaining major functioning hospital in northern [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=185.76s)]
*  Gaza. That is, of course, until Israel's military marched in, switched off its oxygen machines, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=190.88s)]
*  drove out its medics, its half-naked patients and even emptied it of its babies, out into the cold [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=195.76s)]
*  and burned much of it to the ground. The Israeli army had already butchered his eight-year-old son [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  Ibrahim in a drone strike on the hospital three months ago, which he speculated was a punishment [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=204.32s)]
*  for his refusal to abandon his post. Even then, despite this hideous trauma he remained, even as [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  his hospital was besieged, starved of basic necessities needed to function until he was [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=213.84s)]
*  pictured walking through ruins towards an Israeli tank. But here's the thing, Israeli authorities [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=217.36s)]
*  lie and they lie and they lie and they lie again. For days they denied he'd been detained, leaving [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=222.4s)]
*  his surviving family in a terrible limbo. Israel, you see, has been practising on a mass scale the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  crime against humanity that has forced disappearance, which literally countless Palestinians are victims [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=232.72s)]
*  of. We don't know who they have detained. Now, in this case, after a massive campaign, they finally [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=237.2s)]
*  confess they had detained him, going through their usual claims he's a terrorist, a Hamas officer, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=242.08s)]
*  based on accusations they have a history of throwing around like confetti. After all, Israeli [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=247.20000000000002s)]
*  leaders and officials we know have repeatedly made clear that they regard all Palestinians as having [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  collective guilt in Gaza. Dr Safiyah's family believe he's being held at the Stietheimen prison [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=256.56s)]
*  in Israel. This prison is a stuff of nightmares. Thousands of Palestinians are the victims there [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=262.08000000000004s)]
*  of forced disappearance, held without charge. As human rights organisations like Israel's Bezalem [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=266.48s)]
*  put it, detainees are subjected to harsh arbitrary violence on a frequent basis. What does this mean? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=271.2s)]
*  Sexual assault, starvation, denial of adequate medical care. We could go on. We know several [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=276.32s)]
*  cases of detainees tortured to death. One of them was the esteemed orthopaedic surgeon, Dr Adnan Al [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=281.28s)]
*  Bosch, in April. It's truly disturbing to say this, but necessary. It is believed he was literally [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=287.12s)]
*  raped to death. You may recall footage of Israeli soldiers gang raping a detainee there, leading to [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=294.08s)]
*  a botched attempt to have them detained by the Israeli military. This extremely rare event was [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=299.84s)]
*  caused by a fear that the International Criminal Court would issue further arrest warrants for [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=308.96s)]
*  torture. This is because of complementarity, which is the ICC only intervenes if it is convinced that [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=312.47999999999996s)]
*  the domestic justice system won't deal with the issue itself. In any case, that triggered literal [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=318.4s)]
*  pro-rape riots. What a thing to say, attended by Israeli government ministers. Clearly, those [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=325.04s)]
*  Israeli soldiers are not going to face any justice. We need to talk about Dr Sophia as an injustice [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=332.16s)]
*  in itself, but it speaks to something wider. The deliberate destruction of Gaza's healthcare system, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=336.56s)]
*  which is a key plank of Israel's genocidal onslaught. The destruction of a healthcare system [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=341.44s)]
*  imposes a massive death sentence on so many people. It would impose a terrible death sentence [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=345.68s)]
*  on a country that wasn't in the state of violent destruction that Gaza is. According to the UN, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=350.64s)]
*  1,057 health workers have been butchered since the genocide began. Every single hospital in [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=357.44s)]
*  Gaza has been attacked. That is 36 hospitals and most that are no longer functional, while those [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=362.88s)]
*  remaining are barely operational, deprived of medical supplies, water, energy and other [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=367.28s)]
*  fundamentals. Last October, the Israeli military declared that Al-Shifa Hospital was the main [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=370.64s)]
*  headquarters for Hamas' terrorist activity. They published a video showing a highly complex underground [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=374.88s)]
*  lair to make their point. When it was raided, no evidence was presented which in any way justified [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=380.0s)]
*  this excuse to attack the hospital. While Al-Shifa now relies in ruins, in the case of Qa'al Adwan, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=384.88s)]
*  the Israeli military produced two pistols and a knife. As a UN report found, Israel has [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=389.68s)]
*  implemented a concerted plan to destroy the healthcare system of Gaza, including this [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=394.0s)]
*  constitutive crime against humanity of extermination. Why? For the same reason, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=399.04s)]
*  Israel has destroyed 83% of plant life there. The point is to make Gaza unlivable. There is [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=404.0s)]
*  little subtlety here. The so-called General's Plan called for northern Gaza to be emptied of [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=409.52s)]
*  its population using violence and starvation that has been executed remorselessly. A genocide in [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=413.91999999999996s)]
*  plain sight. There is no excuse, literally zero, for anyone who denies this obscenity. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=419.35999999999996s)]
*  Every crime, every horror facilitated by the West. We will never be forgiven. Nor should we be. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=424.0s)]
*  Please like and subscribe with your thoughts, leave your comments, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=430.32s)]
*  and help us to take on the pro-genocide media. Over the coming weeks, you'll see the plan is to, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=432.96s)]
*  I guess, hopefully take things up a notch. I should also tell you that I'm writing a book at [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=446.71999999999997s)]
*  the moment called The Fall of the West. I'll be writing that over the coming months. Obviously, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=451.28s)]
*  on my mind has been what's been happening to Palestine with the direct facilitation of the [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=462.96s)]
*  West. But the book itself is looking at the economic decline, the military defeats, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=471.12s)]
*  as well as moral collapse and the crisis of democracy unleashed by Western decline, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=479.84s)]
*  the likes of Trumpism, morbid symptoms, but also accelerants. Anyway, I just wanted to let you know, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=485.03999999999996s)]
*  because it's the new year, just keeping you up to date. Obviously, it covers many things, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=490.4s)]
*  Afghanistan, Iraq, economic crisis, the rise of various far-right movements, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=496.08s)]
*  what's happening in Palestine. Anyway, I'll keep you updated with when that comes out, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=501.92s)]
*  but I just want to let you know. Anyway, please like, subscribe, leave your comments, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=505.28s)]
*  patreon.com, slash, 284, and I'll see you in a bit. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18IgpnjcfY&t=509.2s)]
