# Israel DECLARES WAR On United Nations
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbyZRYqu3KI)
*  What is a rogue state? We've heard that term bandied around a lot in the past, particularly
*  in the North East, particularly after 9-11. Iraq, Iran, North Korea, you get the gist. Well,
*  if we're going to start talking about rogue states again, I think we do need to talk about the state
*  of Israel. As I've been noting a lot since this war began, Israel is a state which is in serial
*  defiance of international law, specifically it's a legal occupation of Palestinian land, the theft
*  of land in the West Bank, those illegal settlements. But it is seriously breaking, again,
*  as I keep noting, international law right now in Gaza, the norms of war, collective punishment,
*  forcible displacement, mass bombardment of civilian populations, we could go on. But now look at their
*  attitude towards the United Nations, which whatever you think about it, was set up amidst the carnage
*  of World War II in an effort to prevent the great horrors humanity inflicted on each other, repeating
*  themselves. Now, they're totally worthy critiques of the United Nations to say the least, given a
*  lot of UN states are human rights abusers, the fact that in practice the world order isn't
*  governed by a law in which all are equals, where none are above the law. In practice, great powers
*  and their allies can behave with impunity, which in the current context means that the only superpower
*  that remains, the United States, can behave with impunity and its allies, the likes of Saudi Arabia,
*  for example, and yes, like Israel. Now, going to war against the United Nations is a bit, well,
*  how do we put it, rogue-staty, I would say. This week, the Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, said that
*  what to any rational, sensible, reasonable person assessing the facts should be uncontroversial. He
*  specifically condemned Hamas and the atrocities that they committed. He said Hamas' October 7th
*  murder and kidnap attacks were appalling. He said nothing can justify the deliberate killing,
*  injuring and kidnapping of civilians or the launching of rockets against civilian targets,
*  which I wholeheartedly agree. What he did also do is provide the one thing that Israel always
*  wants to wage war on in these particular terrible moments, which is context. Let's just listen to
*  what the big guy had to say for himself.
*  Absolutely spot on. Now, look, I know the apologists for the Israeli state and its behaviour
*  want us to believe that day one of all of this were the appalling acts committed by Hamas against
*  innocent civilians on the 7th of October and that you can't talk about anything else. And anything
*  else is essentially apologism for terrorism. That's what they would like us to think. They
*  don't believe that, but that's not the point. This is a political, obviously, attack. They think we
*  can't talk about anything. They think that we can't talk about the context of what the Palestinians
*  have gone through. The ethnic cleansing of 700,000 Palestinians from their homes in 1948 and the
*  massacres, the killings that accompanied that and the Nakba, as it was called, the illegal occupation
*  of Palestinian land after 1967, the illegal settlements, the theft of land, the repeated
*  ethnic cleansing of Palestinian people, the mass incarceration, including without charge,
*  including of children, including documented torture, the siege of Gaza, what has been described
*  by human rights organisations in Israel and across the West as apartheid, the killings,
*  always far more Palestinians killed than Israelis. 96% of deaths in the 15 years before October 7th
*  were Palestinians. That's not in any way to justify ever the killing of Israeli civilians,
*  and that's an important point to make. Now, they just want us to believe that basically the
*  extremism of Hamas came from nowhere, that the support that they got can be explained by
*  presumably Palestinians going a bit wacky one day, going, oh, what are we like? Nothing to do with
*  saying how the secular movement, Fata, was deliberately undermined by Israel. It had its
*  own problems, corruption and all the rest of it, by the way, which shouldn't be dismissed, but nonetheless
*  they were undermined by Israel, that its strategy of abandoning armed struggle and seeking peace
*  achieved nothing, and that there is a lot of evidence which, for the likes of the Israeli
*  newspaper Haratz has been airing, that the likes of Benjamin Netanyahu strove to boost Hamas in
*  order to divide the Palestinian movement and make a two-state solution impossible. Now, they want
*  any context to be seen as dangerous, outrageous, extreme. It basically makes you a Hamas operative.
*  Let's just listen to their foreign secretary. He's supposed to be moderate, this guy, relatively.
*  He recently called Eli Cohen for the annexation of parts of Gaza, so that's what we're talking
*  about there. Anyway, let's just listen. Mr. Secretary General, in what world do you live?
*  Definitely, this is not our world. If all nations do not stand by the basic value,
*  the basic value of humanity described in the UN Charter, this will be the darkest hour,
*  the darkest hour of the United Nations under you, Mr. Secretary, at this place, and this place
*  will have no moral justification to exist. Listen to the state of that ranting and raving, suggesting
*  that the end of the United Nations, because what their secretary general said, there's a wider
*  context that has to be understood, which started before the 7th of October. Now, Israel's ambassador
*  to the United Nations, Gilad Erdogan, then called on the UN secretary general to resign. He said
*  he'd expressed an understanding for terrorism and murder. I think, I mean, you should see the guy.
*  I don't know how libel works in these diplomatic contexts, to be honest with you, but he's in a
*  court which wasn't rigged. You're sort of done for libel, aren't you there? Bang to right, I would say.
*  Now, on Wednesday, Erdogan said his country would block visas for UN officials, so they already
*  rejected an application by the UN Under Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency
*  Readiness Coordinator, Martin Griffiths. He said, it's time we teach them a lesson. Sounds a little
*  bit rogue state, you guys, doesn't it? Anyway, Antonio Guitares responded to him being completely
*  defamed and what he said completely distorted and twisted by objective lies, by a state which lies
*  and lies and lies and lies. Here we go. I am shocked by the misrepresentations by some
*  of my statements yesterday in the Security Council, as if, as if I was justifying acts of terror
*  by Hamas. This is false. It was the opposite. In the beginning of my intervention yesterday,
*  I clearly stated, and I quote, I have condemned unequivocally the horrifying and unprecedented
*  7 October acts of terror by Hamas in Israel. Nothing can justify the deliberate killing,
*  injuring and kidnapping of civilians or the launching of rockets against civilian targets.
*  End quote. Indeed, I spoke of the grievances of the Palestinian people.
*  And in doing so, I also clearly stated, and I quote, but the grievances of the Palestinian
*  people cannot justify the appalling attacks by Hamas. End quote. And then I went on with my
*  intervention, referring all my positions on all aspects of the Middle East crisis.
*  I believe it was necessary to set the record straight, especially out of respect
*  to the victims and to their families. Now look, the issue here, Israel thinks it's above the law,
*  thinks it can behave exactly how it wants, and it's completely right. Other countries
*  have broken the law, and if they're not Western client states, that's used as justification for
*  the West to stop bombing them. Humanitarian intervention, that last end quote. I wouldn't
*  support that in the case of Israel, to be clear. What I do support is boycott, divestment and
*  sanctions, which is the strategy employed against apartheid South Africa. Because the problem we've
*  got is with the support of the world's only remaining superpower, they really do think they
*  can oppress Palestinians for decades, steal their land, destroy any chance of Palestinian statehood
*  and commit terrible war crimes and get away with it. And they can. So what else can we do?
*  It's a peaceful movement, which is about building pressure to put on Israel from our governments
*  which support it. We do have to keep fighting for that context. Context is not a justification for
*  atrocities. We have to be clear about that. There's never any justification for killing civilians.
*  Never let the evil of the world throw away your humanity. And no cause on earth justifies the
*  killing of civilians. And I've made myself watch some of the atrocities committed against Israeli
*  civilians on the 7th of October, and they were absolutely vile and indefensible. Horrible to
*  watch. Horrible to watch. And I'm not going to start recommending everyone goes watching them,
*  but it is important to say that. People like me have been consistent on that matter,
*  which winds defenders of what Israel is doing up even more. The vast majority of civilians killed
*  in this so-called conflict are Palestinians. I say so-called conflict because it's too asymmetrical.
*  Military superpower and refugee camps, essentially. And they are being killed by a state with the
*  active support of our government, who have facilitated the injustices which the UN
*  Secretary General referred to and therefore made this horror possible. And that's why we're
*  complacent. That's why we're talking about this so much, because people are like, what about all
*  these other horrors going on? No shortage of horror in this world. But this is a particular
*  crime happening now with the active support of our governments, and it was made possible by the
*  position of our governments over many, many years, allowing the Palestinian people to be abandoned
*  and deprived of their basic rights. And when people say no justice, no peace, some people say,
*  well, that's a threat. But it isn't, is it? It's an observation of reality. That you can't get
*  a lasting peace without justice. And so it is the case here. And it doesn't matter how much
*  Israeli leading officials squeal about it and rant and rave about the United Nations behaving,
*  as I've said, like a rogue state, a thug which knows it can get away with anything.
*  That is the truth. That is the reality. And however much truth angers those committing
*  terrible crimes, it needs to be stated even louder, doesn't it? Anyway, please like and
*  subscribe. Please support us on patreon.com/.joeyz840. We've got loads of interviews and content to come
*  about this horror because we need to keep talking about this as loud as we can.
*  You can keep showing the road on patreon.com/.joeyz840. I'll see you in a bit.
