# Media's Israel Bias EXPOSED By New Report - Its Findings Are Unanswerable
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [March 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9wzvVIhzRQ)
*  It's one thing to conclude that the mainstream media is deeply biased when it comes to Israel's
*  onslaught against Gaza, based on what you can see and hear, but it's another to have that proven
*  with facts. Now that's because you often hear a logical fallacy, which is mainstream coverage of
*  Israel-Palestine is criticised by both those who align themselves with the Israeli state and those
*  who align themselves with the Palestinian people. Therefore it must be correct, it's annoying
*  everyone, therefore it's neutral. Now you often hear this whole narrative with the BBC too, based
*  on criticisms of bias it gets from both left and right, therefore it must get the balance right.
*  Now that's a logical fallacy, whether a broadcaster is biased or not should be decided based on various
*  empirical measurements, not least given for uncritical champions of the Israeli state who
*  are accustomed to receiving the total support of western states and most western media outlets,
*  anything which is seen to deviate from the official Israeli narrative is regarded as bias,
*  even simply reports on Palestinians being killed. Indeed as we can see with the British right
*  and the BBC, in that Strident right wingers are so used to dominating the editorial position of
*  British newspapers, so anything that deviates from that in the wider media seen as outrageous bias
*  to the left is also a means of policing. If you have more institutional power than the other side,
*  you can throw your weight around with accusations of bias that bully broadcasters into embracing
*  your own side. And well in the case of Israel-Palestine, the dispossessed Palestinian people
*  who don't even have a state have very little collective power indeed or even a prominent
*  organised voice in western states, so they're automatically at a huge disadvantage. That's why
*  we need facts, which is why a new report published by the Centre for Media Monitoring or Media Bias
*  in Gaza 2023-2024 is so important. Now I've done previous videos with research looking at
*  bias studies into bias by the BBC, sorry covering the bias of the BBC, as well as US media outlets,
*  but it's so important that we have broader, wider studies. Now this centre was founded by
*  the brilliant Mick Dadversie, he's the media spokesperson for the Muslim Council of Britain,
*  he's been an invaluable analyst of anti-Muslim prejudice and media coverage in the UK for many
*  years. This report is authored by Faisal Hanif, he used to write as a newspaper reporter at the
*  Times and a researcher at the BBC, as well as conducting field research for the Institute
*  for Public Policy Research, a very prestigious think tank, and the University of Oxford Centre
*  on Migration, Policy and Society, so he knows what he's talking about. Now it's worth just
*  stating from the outset that this is a report on the media coverage of what is officially an
*  alleged genocide. It's being investigated as an alleged genocide by the International Court of
*  Justice, which is of course the highest court on earth. Now that has already involved the mass
*  killing of tens of thousands of Palestinians in a very short period of time, around 40% of whom are
*  children, the mass displacement of almost the entire population, the mass destruction of civilian
*  infrastructure to the extent that Gaza now has a different colour and texture and looked at from
*  space, conditions which now are apocalyptic in much of Gaza, the outbreak of famine, projections
*  by researchers of tens of thousands of likely further deaths in the coming weeks and months,
*  repeated statements which indicate intent by Israeli ministers which are clearly genocidal
*  in nature from demanding a total siege on human animals, favourably asking civilians and soldiers
*  to remember the story of Amalek in which God orders the killing of all men, women, children,
*  babies and livestock, calls for Gaza variously to be wiped from the face of the earth, repeated
*  calls endorsed by Israeli ministers for the entire population to be expelled. Okay go on, oh sorry,
*  they call it voluntary migration by which they actually mean you make the conditions
*  so unbearable you then present the the move of the population as a humanitarian gesture.
*  Now why do I say all this? Because mainstream media coverage is on a completely different
*  planet from those realities, the way media coverage of say the crimes of Assad for example or
*  in Bosnia committed by the Bosnian Serb armies, that's not obviously the way that this is being
*  approached. It's framed overwhelmingly as Israel's military response to Hamas with a side debate
*  which is indulged not by everyone by any means about whether it's proportionate or not,
*  not by not whether or not this is a huge vast crime in which critics are marginalised and
*  stigmatised. What the report says is it seeks to establish whether the British media has done its
*  job, fulfilled what's supposed to be its mission, robustly report the news, validate facts and hold
*  those of power to account to as it says reliably inform the public of the facts and share the
*  position positions of all concerned and ideally in a responsible way. Now any good faith reading
*  of this very impressive report show the media has failed badly in that regard. Now the report looks
*  at key TV channels and online news services like the BBC channels, ITV, Channel 4 News, Sky News,
*  Channel 5 News, GB News, Talk TV, Al Jazeera, CNN. Now as the executive summary notes, news coverage
*  tends to treat the 7th of October as ground zero, that is when the clock begins. Those referring to
*  the historical context of a 75 year old occupation of Palestine with all the mass violent ethnic
*  cleansing, terrible crimes committed, what international human rights organisations define
*  as apartheid, we could go on. Those attempting to do any of that are accused by some presenters
*  and columnists as justifying the attacks of the 7th of October, the atrocities that were committed
*  on the 7th of October. Now the coverage strips away context and history, not least how Gaza,
*  which was still under occupation as per international law before the current invasion
*  by the Israeli state and which suffered a blockade since 2005, how all that benefits
*  an Israeli narrative and in the words of the report has constantly promoted the attacks on
*  Gaza and in the West Bank as a war between light and darkness. Meanwhile pro-Israeli voices and
*  talking points regularly lead news reports even as the numbers of Palestinians slaughtered
*  has increased exponentially, ensuring that Israeli life has repeatedly been given
*  unashamed prominence or blatant prominence over that of Palestinian life. The death doll of
*  Palestinians itself has been repeatedly delegitimised with hateful language towards
*  Palestinians, Arabs, Muslims has on occasion not even been challenged. Claims made by official
*  Israeli sources and Israeli journalists have the report notes been amplified and accepted as truth
*  without verification and even when proven to be false, some aren't corrected nor challenged
*  when repeated despite the long track record of Israel's authorities prior to any of this of
*  lying through their teeth. It adds that pro-Palestinian voices and activists have
*  been routinely denounced, misrepresented and targeted by many national media outlets.
*  The right-wing media has been particularly hostile towards pro-Palestinian voices,
*  framing them as supporters of terrorism and anti-Semites as well as being hostile to British
*  values. Yes, well, I think I can speak to that, but that's clearly been particularly the case
*  with Palestinian voices and also disproportionately for example Muslim voices. Now the media has taken
*  cues from politicians in smearing pro-Palestinian advocates and despite arrested protests being
*  lower than that at the Glastonbury Music Festival, the narrative of them being a danger to public
*  safety persists while legitimate shows of solidarity with Palestinians is conflated with the genuine
*  evil of anti-Semitism. The research finds how there's emphasis on Israel's rights,
*  that means often to the exclusion of Palestinian rights and how that's used to shut down pro-Palestinian
*  voices and legitimise official Israeli claims. Now in this detailed research, 147 pages,
*  they find that the evidence we have gathered shows unequivocally that the overall tone of
*  coverage in the Western media has been pro-Israel. So key findings include that 76% of online articles
*  frame the current war as an Israel-Hamas war. Clearly that frames this on terms favourable to
*  Israel because in practice Israel has waged an onslaught based on mass collective punishment
*  with any pretence of a targeted attack on Hamas in practice, just non-existent ludicrous atrocity
*  denial to even indulge that idea. It seems to frame this as Israel-Hamas, if you talk about
*  those terms as legitimate state versus terrorism, the Palestinian people simply non-existent in that
*  framing. So to underline that point, only 24% of news reports mentioning Israel-Hamas or Gaza
*  mention the words Palestine or Palestinian. So you can just see that the erasure of the Palestinian
*  people of Palestine. Al Jazeera English news channel itself has more mentions of occupied
*  territories than all British and American news channels combined. So the entire dynamic of what
*  this actually is, is simply not there. The insistence on Israel's rights, so for example,
*  Israel's right to defend itself was found on 1,482 occasions across broadcast channels,
*  a similar search for the rights of Palestinians to resist yielded only 278 results and 36% of those
*  were from Al Jazeera English alone. Now in broadcasts where emotive language is used,
*  Israelis are about 11 times more likely to be referred to as victims of attacks compared to
*  Palestinians. We're talking terms like atrocity or butchered, massacre, slaughtered. That led a
*  anonymous BBC staff to challenge management on why terms like massacre and atrocity were only used
*  for Hamas. Now over 70% of the terms atrocity, slaughter, massacre were used in reference to
*  attacks against Israelis on the 7th of October. Of course, even though it must be said far, far,
*  far more Palestinians have clearly been killed. Terms used to describe the deaths of Palestinians
*  are sometimes qualified with phrases such as what they say is a massacre. In online British
*  news outlets, emotive terms were found to be four times more prevalent when describing the actions
*  of Hamas against Israelis compared to the description of the killings of Palestinians
*  or civilians in Gaza. So the study found that TV reporting of Israeli perspectives was referenced
*  almost three times more, that's 4,311 than Palestinian ones, 1,598. In online news,
*  it was almost twice as much, nearly 3,000 versus over 1,700. GB News and Talk TV made up 42% of
*  total references to protesters being pro-Hamas. So clearly there's right-wing channels leading the
*  charge at demonising protests against this onslaught. The report finds a deluge of
*  Islamophobia, like Talk TV hosting one right-wing historian who declared that for many, Muslim hatred
*  of Jews is motivated by religion far more than politics, adding the true roots are to be found
*  in the Quran which encourages hatred of Jews and the killing of the infidel, before adding that the
*  hatred of Jews infects much of the Muslim world. Just clear rampant Islamophobia, there were no
*  challenges to any of those points by the host. It finds the report that given, as per the UN,
*  Gaza was under existing occupation due to the permanent land, sea and air blockade imposed by
*  Israel, supply of goods heavily restricted, as well as water and the majority of electricity
*  supplies dependent on Israeli authorities. Israeli authorities even control the electromagnetic
*  spectrum, even the civil registry, that context just almost entirely absent. Constant use of the
*  term Hamas-run health ministry, interestingly until 17th of October, Palestinian health ministry was
*  still widely used, then the use of Hamas-run health ministry increased dramatically. Now why does that
*  matter? Because clearly what that's doing is putting in people's heads the idea that that's
*  just propaganda from Hamas which you should not believe, even though those official statistics have
*  been validated in every single previous conflict between Israel or any kind of military
*  conflagration involving Israel and Gaza, even though they released the names and Israel approved
*  ideas of all victims when Joe Biden questioned that tally, even though the prestigious media,
*  sorry, the prestigious medical journal Lancet confirmed the figures were not being inflated,
*  and even though US sources and Israeli sources both publicly and privately have said that those
*  figures are likely to be correct and actually underestimates, because again I keep saying this,
*  it doesn't include the numbers who are buried under the rubble, many thousands, so that context
*  is simply stripped away and instead the idea is to sow the seeds of doubt. This is Hamas propaganda,
*  even though all the evidence shows that the death toll is not being exaggerated,
*  it's being understated. Now the mention of Israel's rights, Israel's right that term,
*  versus mention of Palestinians' rights is really striking. The BBC is 81% Israel's right versus
*  90% of Palestinian rights. California news, I think somewhat surprisingly, you might think
*  it might be better in this regard, 100% it has Israel's right compared to talking about
*  Palestinians' rights. ITV also 100%, Sky News offers 4% of Palestinians' rights.
*  The report mentions repeated references by news presenters implying collective guilt on the part
*  of the people of Gaza because of Hamas' election in 2005 when they were in a plurality, when the
*  vast majority of Gaza today didn't even vote in that election. On BBC News night, terms like
*  inhuman animals were used to describe Palestinian civilians by Israeli voices, no pushback.
*  In one case, Channel 4 News platformed an IDF veteran who'd taken part in the 1948
*  Deir Yassin massacre of Palestinians, a horrific atrocity. He'd previously declared of Palestinians
*  erase them, their families, mothers and children, these animals can no longer live. That information
*  wasn't included in the interview and in the interview he made clear he thought most Palestinians
*  were responsible for Hamas with statements lacking challenge, but frankly it was an outrage that the
*  broader context was missing there. The extreme opinions of the Israeli ambassador to the UK,
*  Zipi Hotevelli, completely ignored in her 44 UK broadcast appearances in the first month of this
*  horror, such as her statements like, the land is ours, all of it is ours, we did not come here to
*  apologise for that, declaring between the sea and Jordan River there needs to be only the state of
*  Israel, while also declaring that from the river to the sea is genocidal in nature when used by
*  Palestinian supporters. So she's fine to use terminology calling from the river to the sea
*  in practical terms when she's talking about only an Israeli state and therefore the subjugation
*  of Palestinians under apartheid, but it's genocidal when supporters of civil rights for Palestinians
*  use such a term. She also described the 1948 Nakba, the mass expulsion of Palestinians as a lie. Well,
*  you'd think she'd be interrogated about these things, about her views, not so. She also
*  repeatedly spread debunked claims such as that there were 40 beheaded babies on the 7th of October
*  and indeed the report notes that the claims of 40 babies being beheaded were widely shared by media
*  outlets, despite the fact that we know from Israel's official statistic that one Israeli baby was killed
*  on the 7th of October. That's terrible enough by the way, the killing of any baby is horrible,
*  shot through the door of a safe room with 36 children in total being killed on the 7th of
*  October, either because of Hamas missile strikes or bullets in the main. The report notes my own
*  appearance with the Labour MP Margaret Hodge three days after 7th of October in which I very
*  clearly condemned Hamas and their attacks and then Hodge demanded I condemn Hamas as though I hadn't
*  done so at all, clearly I had, at length actually. It's just gaslighting when you're in that
*  situation, you're just like why am I doing this? And then when I attempted to talk about why it was
*  illegal under international law to impose collective punishment on a people and spoke
*  about Palestinian children suffering and how thousands of Palestinians had been killed between
*  2008 and that date before 7th of October, I was accused of having an obsession with Palestine.
*  They know how Palestinian guests are routinely misrepresented such as when Skynie suggested the
*  Palestinian ambassador to the UK had said the Israelis had it coming when actually he'd mourned
*  the loss of life on all sides, he'd actually said Israel knew this was coming their way. They looked
*  at how pro-Palestine protesters were repeatedly, are repeatedly, smitten as pro-Hamas, as anti-Semitic
*  and a danger to Jews. Overall what this report really shows is how Palestinians are dehumanised,
*  that it's ingrained, that it's so ingrained, it's a background hum in the British media,
*  that Israeli narratives are so dominant and again so dominant they become a background hum,
*  that Palestinian life is clearly treated as having far far less worth, that the sort of mass violence
*  used against them is in any way being framed and even suggested as violations of the norms or
*  laws of war. That's those who critique the onslaught who are treated as though they're in the dock,
*  the idea of the Palestinian people having rights just not even there really. Narratives which
*  frankly help justify the mass slaughter of the Palestinians lacking real challenge, we could go
*  on. I mean it's so rampant and so overt and so unapologetic, it just makes you realise when
*  we live in a democracy with caveats, is a phrase I often use, which is you could say well we have
*  a free media don't we, it's not all directly controlled by the government, doesn't really need
*  to be does it, when you just have media outlets which are clearly twisting reality and that's
*  what is happening here. It's not the actual truth, the full truth of what's happening,
*  it's selective, it's distorted. Why does all this matter? It's because Israel's onslaught is only
*  possible because of the support and complicity of western states through weapons, aid, diplomatic
*  and political support. If media outlets were not so weighted in favour in their coverage of the
*  Israeli state, there would be far more public pressure for western states to shift their
*  position, in turn putting huge pressure therefore on Israel. That's why we have to state the obvious
*  truth that our media outlets are complicit in what is a historic crime and that the mass slaughter
*  of the Palestinians and the unimaginable suffering they've endured and will I'm afraid continue to
*  endure for a very long time. They're still perhaps the worst horrors yet to come. Well our media
*  outlets played a crucial role in all of that and that underlines the basic point that the campaign
*  to change this media ecosystem is a matter of life or death on a large scale. Please like and
