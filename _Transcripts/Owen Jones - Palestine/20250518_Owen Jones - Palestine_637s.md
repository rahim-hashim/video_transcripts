# First Western State Says Israel Committing GENOCIDE - Israel
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg)
*  The dam on Israel's genocide is beginning to burst. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=0.0s)]
*  The Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has labelled Israel, quite correctly, as a genocidal state. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=3.36s)]
*  I also point out one thing to you, Mr. Rufi√°n, is that we do not trade with a genocidal state. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  We do not, Your Honour. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=14.0s)]
*  And I believe that the other day, from this platform, I explicitly explained precisely what we were talking about [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  when it was said about some things that do not align with the truth. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=21.2s)]
*  For some reason, this has had very little coverage in the Western media, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  presumably because the outlets which have supported and whitewashed Israel's genocide [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=27.12s)]
*  are loathe to incriminate themselves. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=31.28s)]
*  Now, the angry Israeli media, on the other hand, has been covering it, with the Times of Israel reporting [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=33.28s)]
*  that the Israeli Foreign Minister, the Ministry, has summoned Spain's ambassador for what it describes as a dressing down. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=38.32s)]
*  In a statement, the Ministry says, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=45.36s)]
*  following the severe remarks made by Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=46.88s)]
*  the Spanish ambassador to Israel has been summoned for a reprimand meeting at the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem tomorrow. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Imagine committing some of the most heinous crimes of our age in full view of the entire world for 19 months, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=58.0s)]
*  on top of decades of hideous crimes, and thinking you're the one in the position to be handing out reprimand meetings. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  Now, Pedro Sanchez is the leader of the Spanish Sochas party, as well as Prime Minister. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=68.48s)]
*  He's in coalition with the more left-wing Sumer party. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=72.56s)]
*  Now, last month, under pressure from Sumer, the Spanish government cancelled a deal to purchase Israeli bullets. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=75.36s)]
*  They have also joined Norway and Ireland in recognising a Palestinian state, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=80.72s)]
*  triggering fury from the Israeli state, which accused them of rewarding terrorism. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=84.96s)]
*  Again, pretty rich, for a country which specialises in state terrorism. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=89.44s)]
*  However, the Spanish government has come under criticism for talking the talk but not walking the walk, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=93.28s)]
*  with research last month also finding the Spanish state had awarded 46 contracts [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=98.24s)]
*  with more than one billion euros to the Israeli military since the genocide began, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=102.72s)]
*  breaking their pledge not to engage in the arms trade with Israel. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=106.96s)]
*  Now, contrary to the Spanish Prime Minister's claims, the Spanish government does trade with the Israeli government. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=110.96s)]
*  So you might ask, why does this even matter? Surely this is just empty posturing. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=116.0s)]
*  What matters here is a European government has officially stated for the first time its view [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  that Israel is committing genocide. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=125.28s)]
*  That piles pressure on other Western governments to cease what is criminal complicity in genocide, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  because it points evermore to the overwhelming evidence of genocide, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=132.72s)]
*  and diminishes the excuses that anyone in power can possibly try and produce that they didn't know what was happening. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=136.08s)]
*  It represents another hole being hacked away from the dam. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=142.16000000000003s)]
*  Let's listen in that vein to Tom Fletcher. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=146.08s)]
*  He's the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  a wordy title, but in other words, he's the UN's top humanitarian official. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=154.24s)]
*  He spoke at the Security Council of the United Nations and what he said was utterly devastating. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  What more evidence do you need now? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=163.84s)]
*  Will you act decisively to prevent genocide and to ensure respect for international humanitarian law? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=166.08s)]
*  Or will you say instead that we did all we could? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=175.76s)]
*  International aid workers have been the only international civilian presence in Gaza, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=179.44s)]
*  watching and reporting the unfolding horror. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=185.6s)]
*  So you have that information. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=188.88s)]
*  And now the ICJ is considering whether a genocide is taking place in Gaza. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=191.36s)]
*  It will weigh the testimony that we have shared. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=198.08s)]
*  But it will be too late. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=202.32s)]
*  Previous reviews of the UN's conduct in cases of large-scale violations [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=204.0s)]
*  of international human rights and humanitarian law, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=209.44s)]
*  reports on Myanmar 2019, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=212.72s)]
*  Sri Lanka 2012, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=215.44s)]
*  Srebrenica, Rwanda, both in 1999, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=217.83999999999997s)]
*  pointed to our collective failure to speak to the scale of violations while they were committed. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  This degradation of international law is corrosive and infectious. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=230.64s)]
*  It is undermining decades of progress on rules to protect civilians from inhumanity [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=235.83999999999997s)]
*  and the violent and lawless among us who act with impunity. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=241.51999999999998s)]
*  Humanity, the law and reason must prevail. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=246.48s)]
*  This council must prevail. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=250.79999999999998s)]
*  Demand this end. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  Stop arming it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=255.11999999999998s)]
*  Insist on accountability. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=256.32s)]
*  To the Israeli authorities, stop killing and injuring civilians. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=258.08s)]
*  Lift this brutal blockade. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  Let humanitarians save lives. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=264.47999999999996s)]
*  To Hamas and other armed Palestinian groups, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=268.08s)]
*  release all hostages immediately and unconditionally. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  Stop putting civilians at risk during military operations. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=276.72s)]
*  And for those who will not survive what we fear is coming, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=281.2s)]
*  it will be no consolation to know that future generations will hold us in this chamber to account. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=284.88s)]
*  But they will. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=292.8s)]
*  And if we have not seriously done all we could, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=294.24s)]
*  then we should fear that judgement. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=298.64s)]
*  You see, he has the detailed reports of exactly what's happening. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=300.40000000000003s)]
*  He knows the evidence is overwhelming, that this is genocide, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=303.76s)]
*  and is very clear to him, as it is to anyone who actually understands the scale of the crime being [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=306.48s)]
*  perpetrated by Israel, that history will damn all those who were complicit in this genocide, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=310.56s)]
*  including those with influence and power who stayed silent. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=314.71999999999997s)]
*  Who chose to stay silent. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=318.24s)]
*  Now, there's also an investigation in the Dutch liberal newspaper NRC, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=320.32s)]
*  which brings together seven of the world's leading genocide scholars. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=323.84s)]
*  All of them conclude that Israel's actions are genocidal. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=326.96s)]
*  As Dutch writer Rutger Bredman observes, they state that nearly all of their peers agree with [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=330.32s)]
*  them. That is, there is a consensus amongst genocide scholars. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=335.68s)]
*  Now, these are Holocaust scholars, heads of major genocide research centres, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=338.64s)]
*  their nationalities range from Israeli to American. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  To quote from the article, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=344.72s)]
*  Can I name someone whose work I respect who does not think this is genocide? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=345.92s)]
*  No, there is no counter-argument that takes into account all the evidence, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=349.36s)]
*  says Israeli researcher Rasih Dahl. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=351.92s)]
*  There are certainly still scientists who say it is not genocide, says Unger, but I don't know them. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=353.92s)]
*  There are however scientists who previously rejected the genocide label, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=359.52s)]
*  but have since changed their minds, such as Shmuel Lederman of the Open University of Israel. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=362.32s)]
*  Let's listen now in the same vein to a speech by Logan Rosos, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=368.24s)]
*  a New York University student, and his graduation speech which has gone viral. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=374.08s)]
*  My moral and political commitments [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=390.0s)]
*  guide me to say that the only thing that is appropriate to say in this time and to a group [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=394.24s)]
*  this large is a recognition of the atrocities currently happening in Palestine. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=400.96s)]
*  I want to say that the genocide currently occurring [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=419.52s)]
*  is supported politically and militarily by the United States, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=442.4s)]
*  is paid for by our tax dollars, and has been live streamed to our phones for the past 18 months, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=447.12s)]
*  and that I do not wish to speak only to my own politics today, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=453.59999999999997s)]
*  but to speak for all people of conscience, all people who feel the moral injury of this atrocity. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=457.44s)]
*  I want to say that I condemn this genocide and complicity in this genocide. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=465.6s)]
*  Thank you to the class of 2025 and congratulations. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=483.52000000000004s)]
*  Well, the university has now withdrawn his diploma and is threatening further disciplinary action. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=495.92s)]
*  Once again underlining how it's those who oppose genocide who face persecution, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=503.12s)]
*  not those who support it. The world turned on its head. This young student has shown more courage [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=507.68s)]
*  and insight than the vast majority of Western journalists and politicians and that says it all. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=512.88s)]
*  Finally, let's see his heartwarming action of resistance against genocide by Ben Cohen, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=520.1600000000001s)]
*  who is the co-founder of the well-known ice cream company Ben & Jerry's. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=524.56s)]
*  How will history judge police officers drag away those protesting against the mass murder of [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=555.28s)]
*  children? It should be noted that Ben Cohen is Jewish and it's not noted enough how many [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=582.88s)]
*  Jewish people across the Western world have been arrested, sacked, deplatformed, threatened for [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=588.56s)]
*  opposing Israel's genocide, all done in the name of protecting Jewish safety, persecuting Jewish [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=593.4399999999999s)]
*  people for opposing genocide in the name of Jewish safety. Again, the world turned on its head. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=599.28s)]
*  The dam is clearly breaking. A consensus which should have existed so long ago that this is [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=605.04s)]
*  genocide is being forged. The longer those who resist accepting what this crime really is, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=610.16s)]
*  the longer they hold out, the more history is going to dam them. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ZdArcBfxg&t=614.9599999999999s)]
