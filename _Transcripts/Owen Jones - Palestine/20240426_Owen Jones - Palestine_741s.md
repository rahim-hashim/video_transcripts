# This Israeli Politician Must Think We Are Stupid
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk)
*  It never fails to shock me. What I'm talking about are statements made by Israeli politicians [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=0.0s)]
*  and spokespeople when they're talking to European and American audiences. You see, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=4.72s)]
*  what they do is tailor the rhetoric. When speaking to Israeli audiences in Hebrew, you'll [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=8.88s)]
*  often hear Israeli politicians and all the rest deploying the most blood-curdling, hateful, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=13.32s)]
*  indeed genocidal rhetoric imaginable. But those who are put in front of cameras for [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=17.64s)]
*  foreign audiences? Well, there's a slightly different tone. Now, they're generally helped [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=21.8s)]
*  by the fact that, with courageous exceptions, Western media outlets generally give them [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=25.62s)]
*  a pretty easy ride. Except they're framing, fail to hold into account for obscene war [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=30.3s)]
*  crimes, don't take on lies, indulge propaganda and often frankly they just don't even know [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=34.5s)]
*  their stuff. Now, the problem for the spokespeople of the Israeli state right now is the war [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=39.02s)]
*  crimes in Gaza are just so unbelievably extreme that the reality is impossible to suppress. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=43.34s)]
*  So when an interviewer does the bare minimum, we're subjected to the most absurd possible [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=48.06s)]
*  distortions of reality. We're subjected to lies, clearly, as well as just crazed [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=52.02s)]
*  wars on logic. Now, I'm going to show you a clip from the British-born Israeli deputy [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=57.080000000000005s)]
*  mayor of Jerusalem, Fleur Hassan Nahum. Now, she's being asked about the mass graves [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=60.940000000000005s)]
*  currently being uncovered in hospital grounds in Gaza, with hundreds of bodies being dug [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=66.26s)]
*  out, including women and children reportedly, and bodies with catheters and medical tubes [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=70.62s)]
*  sticking out, otherwise known as patients. People in medical gowns, clear evidence there, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=75.44s)]
*  medical staff, crucially reportedly signs of torture, people shot in the head, bodies [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=80.62s)]
*  with their hands tied behind their backs. Now, let's just listen to Fleur Hassan Nahum [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=86.14s)]
*  being questioned about this on Sky News. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=91.62s)]
*  These 283 corpses found in a mass grave at Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis, the UN Human [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=93.9s)]
*  Rights Chief has said he is absolutely horrified. Who do you think those bodies are? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=100.46000000000001s)]
*  Probably terrorists, because the ratio of combatant to innocent that Israel has is unprecedented [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=107.78s)]
*  in modern warfare. We know we've killed about 15,000 terrorists. There was a terrible battle [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=114.78s)]
*  in those areas, so the chances are... [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=121.3s)]
*  How do you think these people died? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=123.58s)]
*  In gun battles with Israel. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=126.78s)]
*  Why do you think some of the bodies were found with ties around their hands? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=128.9s)]
*  Well, because we probably arrested the terrorists. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=133.22s)]
*  And then killed them? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=135.82s)]
*  Well, I don't know if the terrorists fought back. I wasn't there. But all I can tell you [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=137.66s)]
*  is that this has been a very difficult urban warfare that nobody on earth has experienced [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=141.5s)]
*  this type of warfare, where the terrorists are hiding in tunnels, where they're cowards, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=148.6s)]
*  because they won't face their enemy. They just leave innocent people up there whilst [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=153.18s)]
*  they hide in tunnels that are bigger than the London underground. And they come out, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=156.82s)]
*  and it could be that many of them were shot and they were shooting in a battle. And it [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=162.78s)]
*  could be that there were bombs thrown by them and grenades. There could be a million different [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=169.01999999999998s)]
*  scenarios of why these were found. But remember, we're in the middle of a war. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=175.26s)]
*  Just to clarify for me, if you would, how do they fight back with their hands tied behind [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=179.85999999999999s)]
*  their backs? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=184.17999999999998s)]
*  Well, we don't know what they were doing before their hands were tied behind their backs, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=185.17999999999998s)]
*  do we? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=188.14s)]
*  No, but if you've managed to cable tie them, they shouldn't subsequently find them dead, should we? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=189.33999999999997s)]
*  And maybe, again, we're just conjecturing. Maybe his friends threw a grenade, and then [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=195.73999999999998s)]
*  what happens? Maybe there was a missile, maybe they threw a rocket, and then what happens? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=199.85999999999999s)]
*  Again, this is conjecture. I wasn't there, you weren't there. We can't know. All I know [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=203.94s)]
*  is that our army has the highest- [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=207.61999999999998s)]
*  Why there was Amnesty International and they say there's- [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=209.66s)]
*  Well, a few things there. Now firstly, she peddles this recurring lie, the Israeli state [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=211.89999999999998s)]
*  keeps feeding us an unprecedented ratio of civilian versus combatant deaths. Now Israel [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=215.58s)]
*  denies the official death count for a start, despite death tolls in previous conflicts [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=220.02s)]
*  being validated afterwards by Israel, despite Israeli officials privately saying they're [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=224.46s)]
*  accurate, as well as the US for that matter, as well as humanitarian agencies, as well [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=228.46s)]
*  as the likes of medical journal Lancet, which did a detailed study, and the fact that the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=232.9s)]
*  death tolls actually an underestimate, because it excludes thousands buried under the rubble, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=237.34s)]
*  as well as people killed, for example, without notice, without anyone notifying the health [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=241.06s)]
*  ministry in Gaza, probably because there's no surviving loved ones, despite the fact [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=245.06s)]
*  that the health ministry clearly isn't functioning properly because Gaza's been virtually destroyed, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=248.9s)]
*  as well as the fact that other forms of death caused by conflict are not included, like [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=252.98s)]
*  untreated illnesses because of the collapse of the healthcare system we could go on. But [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=258.06s)]
*  crucially, as the Israeli newspaper, Baharetz, notes, Israel keeps killing civilians who [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=261.7s)]
*  walk past an invisible line and then classifies them as terrorists. So those death figures [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=266.22s)]
*  are just a lie that Israel are giving in terms of the number of terrorists they've killed. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=271.7s)]
*  I don't know why. And just to drive that truth home, this truly despicable individual [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=276.34s)]
*  who's interviewed here previously spread the debunked lie that dead babies in Gaza [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=280.82s)]
*  were not really dead babies. They were being faked with dolls. You know what? I think broadcasters [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=287.14s)]
*  should have just destroyed her over that alone. Every time she ever appears on television, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=293.34s)]
*  she should be made to account for the fact that she spread a lie that grieving parents [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=297.34s)]
*  in Gaza were fabricating the deaths of their children using dolls. Unfortunately, we've [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=304.9s)]
*  got the media that we do. Now, her deranged logical claims in that clip are the reason [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=309.73999999999995s)]
*  she gives in terms of their hands being tied is probably because we arrested them. That's [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=315.34s)]
*  the deranged logical kind of claims she's offering, leading to the obvious question [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=319.34s)]
*  why would they then be killed? Why would IDF kill them? They've got their hands tied behind [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=324.1s)]
*  their backs by definition, they don't pose a threat. So why would you kill them? So she claims [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=328.74s)]
*  because they fought back using bombs or grenades. Yeah, again, Fler, hey, come on, we dealt with that. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=333.06s)]
*  How would they fight back? The whole hand situation. You see, if I've got my hands tied behind my back, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=339.86s)]
*  not throwing anything, am I? Fler, realistically. So she suggests maybe his friend through his friend, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=345.22s)]
*  through a grenade or a missile or rocket. Does she think we're stupid? Does she think we're just [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=351.7s)]
*  thick? Is that what's happening here? She just she goes on television and thinks, I think this [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=354.9s)]
*  audience is actually stupid. What, how does it make sense? Someone's got their hands tied behind [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=359.38s)]
*  their backs, they've been detained by the Israeli army, clearly. If the implicators were also in [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=364.09999999999997s)]
*  detention, they were then killed by Palestinian armed factions firing weapons at them. Is that [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=367.7s)]
*  what she, I don't know, is that what she's getting at? Because she can't be saying that they were [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=372.18s)]
*  detained and then, then on their side, others fired weapons at Israel and then the Israeli state [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=376.66s)]
*  fired back, because the ones with their hands tied behind their backs are the ones detained by the [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=383.3s)]
*  Israeli military. So is she saying that they were killed by Israeli armed factions firing weapons [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=388.98s)]
*  at them when they'd been detained by the Israeli state? Then these particular onslaughts, there'd be [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=393.46000000000004s)]
*  a significant number of IDF soldiers who would have died alongside them because they'd been detained [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=398.58000000000004s)]
*  by them. But that's not true. So just so we're clear here, just so we're clear, if someone has [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=402.42s)]
*  their hands tied behind their backs, regardless of whether they were a combatant or not, they are [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=407.78000000000003s)]
*  classed under international law as hors de combat. Under the Geneva Convention of 1948, they are [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=412.34000000000003s)]
*  non-combatants, they are protected people and it is a war crime, a war crime to kill them. Now get [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=419.86s)]
*  this, Israel has a new line. Yeah, you see, they go, well, these masques clearly are real, can't [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=426.18s)]
*  really hide that canday because we can see the masqués being dug up. But they go, well, the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=431.06s)]
*  Palestinians dug the masqués. What kind of defense is that? These are obviously people killed by the [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=436.18s)]
*  Israeli military. What does the detail change there? As the brilliant US journalist at The Intercept, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=440.98s)]
*  Jamie Scarhill puts it, Israel's new line on the masqués in Khan Unis is essentially, we didn't [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=446.26s)]
*  bury those people we murdered, the Palestinians buried the people we murdered. Let's just listen [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=451.7s)]
*  to this being brought up by a journalist at a press conference of the State Department of the US [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=456.58s)]
*  with spokesperson, Vedant Patel, being interrogated. The Gaza civil service today held a press [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=460.42s)]
*  conference this morning which was televised and they said that evidence showed that many of those [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=468.82s)]
*  pulled out from the three mass graves that they found, including children, were tortured before [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=474.18s)]
*  being killed. Some even showed signs of being buried alive, along with other crimes against [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=480.98s)]
*  humanity that they accuse Israeli forces of. They called for an independent forensic investigation. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=486.97999999999996s)]
*  This administration repeatedly says that it asks Israel, the Israeli government, to investigate [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=493.7s)]
*  itself. As a mediator for peace between Israelis and Palestinians, how does it ever make sense that [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=499.78s)]
*  the United States asks the accused party to examine itself and provide reports that you [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=506.5s)]
*  have previously said that you actually trust? What's wrong with an independent scientific forensic [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=514.02s)]
*  investigation? I mean, if the results of such an independent investigation prove the accusations [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=521.3s)]
*  to be baseless, then that would be in Israel's favor, wouldn't it? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=527.62s)]
*  So as it relates to the continued reporting about, we're seeing about these mass graves. First, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=532.5s)]
*  National Security Advisor Sullivan spoke a little bit about this yesterday, but we continue to find [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=539.78s)]
*  these reports incredibly troubling. That's why yesterday you saw the National Security Advisor [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=545.3s)]
*  call for this to be thoroughly investigated. We want to see these facts looked into and [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=552.74s)]
*  simultaneously we're continuing to press the government of Israel for more information. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=558.5799999999999s)]
*  The IDF has spoken to this in some sense already, but we are continuing to press them for additional [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=562.98s)]
*  information. But why not have an independent forensic scientist, which the Palestinians are [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=569.7800000000001s)]
*  calling for? We think this does need to be thoroughly investigated, but in terms of the [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=575.38s)]
*  modality, we continue to want to see some additional information from the government of [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=579.62s)]
*  Israel before we make other assessments. But you're asking the accused to investigate itself. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=584.74s)]
*  We believe that through a thorough investigation we can get some additional answers. We're also [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=588.4200000000001s)]
*  hoping to continue to get more information from the government of Israel on this. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=593.62s)]
*  Yes, you do. Go ahead. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=597.46s)]
*  Well, exactly. Asking the accused to investigate itself. What does the US administration think [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=602.34s)]
*  they're going to get from the Israeli state? Are they ever going to go, oh yeah, oh that, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=606.82s)]
*  oh that, yeah, we commit some war crimes. Sorry, you've got us red handed this time. I'm really [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=609.86s)]
*  sorry. Put us in the naughty step. What are you like? Yeah, we just did a load of war crimes. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=614.34s)]
*  I know we shouldn't. I know it's embarrassing for you. You're giving us all these weapons. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=619.46s)]
*  People in the United States don't really like watching all these innocent people being [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=623.46s)]
*  killed mercilessly, including little kids, toddlers, babies, just innocent people. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=626.9s)]
*  Generally, I get it. It's bad PR for you. Look, I'd say we won't do it again, but we absolutely [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=632.02s)]
*  will. Just so you're clear, we're going to be committing a lot of war crimes to get used to it. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=637.38s)]
*  Obviously, they're not going to do that. It's just insulting nonsense. The Israeli state lie, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=641.38s)]
*  and lie, and lie, and lie, and lie, and lie. That's what they do. They lie and they kill. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=644.18s)]
*  They kill, they lie. Then they lie again, and then they kill some more. Then they lie again, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=647.86s)]
*  and then they kill, and then they lie again, and then they... That's what we've just been subjected [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=651.22s)]
*  to, you see, for the last six and a half months. Lots of killing and lots of lies. I've done [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=654.74s)]
*  multiple videos on multiple egregious lies. Now, you know what? The US administration may be full [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=658.66s)]
*  of some morally lost people. Although, I have no doubt, but they're not stupid. Don't give them [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=665.78s)]
*  that excuse. They know terrible crimes are being committed by the Israeli state, which they [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=669.38s)]
*  occasionally get a privately hand-wringed about because they're like, oh no, a load of voters [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=673.22s)]
*  in the United States don't really like genocide and we want them to vote for us. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=677.46s)]
*  This polling shows the vast majority, there's a massive lead amongst Biden voters in terms of who [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=680.26s)]
*  thinks Israel's committing genocide over those who don't. So they're like, well, let's just leak to [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=686.5s)]
*  report that we're privately really bummed about this. They know that the Israeli state lies for [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=692.1s)]
*  its teeth, but the US administration has given them a blank check to commit some of the worst [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=698.02s)]
*  crimes of the 21st century. And as I keep saying, the reason we are now seeing an attempt to whip [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=701.9399999999999s)]
*  up a firestorm over protesters is because they've lost public opinion. The apologists for this great [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=705.94s)]
*  crime. They'll keep saying it because it's true. I can read polling and on both sides of the Atlantic, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=711.0600000000001s)]
*  they've lost and that's going to keep, they're going to keep losing and people keep getting more [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=715.94s)]
*  and more angry. And the scale of the horror unleashed has become abundantly clear, which is [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=720.1s)]
*  why we've got to keep up the pressure and we've got to keep speaking the truth because this is a [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdeZCoxKMk&t=723.86s)]
