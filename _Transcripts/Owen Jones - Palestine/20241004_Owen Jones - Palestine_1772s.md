# Israeli Soldiers Aren't Hiding Their War Crimes - They're BOASTING About Them w. Richard Sanders
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_9UueCTnhI)
*  Some of the worst atrocities of our age live stream to us on a daily basis. Now,
*  a big part of the reason we know about the scale of the utter depravity involved in Israel's genocidal
*  onslaught against Gaza is because of the unbelievably courageous work of Palestinian journalists working
*  in impossible circumstances, many of whom of course have been butchered, including with their entire
*  families, in the biggest massacre of journalists in recorded history. But there's another part of the
*  story as well, and that is the proclivity of Israeli soldiers in posting their own war crimes,
*  relishing, reveling in their utter depravity, the suffering they're imposing on the Palestinian
*  people, visibly enjoying much of it. What does that tell us? Well, Al Jazeera have a new,
*  brilliant, compelling, disturbing documentary, of course. You can look it up on YouTube by going to
*  Investigating War Crimes in Gaza. It's part of their Al Jazeera's investigative unit,
*  and the brilliant Richard Sanders, an incredible journalist, who I've interviewed previously,
*  for example, on his documentary on the truth about what happened on 7th of October. Now,
*  I began by asking him about the way Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders describe the
*  IDF, the Israeli army, as the most moral army on earth. Well, it's clearly not the case. I think
*  one of the fundamental problems with Israel in Western media, whether we admit it or not,
*  we tend to divide the world into sensible, serious, what we call Western democratic,
*  liberal democratic countries, and then countries we take rather less seriously, and whose governments
*  we take rather less seriously. And I think there is this core misconception with Israel that it is
*  a Western democracy. It's not. It's an ethno-state. It's a racist ethno-state. And
*  I think we have to relate to information that comes out of the Israeli government or the
*  Israeli military in the same way we would relate to information coming out of a rather dubious
*  Third World dictatorship and not necessarily take it entirely seriously. I think we attach too much
*  weight to the statements of the Israeli government. And in Western media, we give them too much space
*  and too much time. At the beginning, now I just want to put this to you from the beginning of
*  this horror. This is going back to last October. And the Israeli defense minister, Yo Galan, who
*  notably, of course, is one of the two targets of the request for arrest warrants by the ICC,
*  International Criminal Court, Chief Prosecutor for war crimes and crimes against humanity.
*  Now, he said at the beginning, he said this on the 9th of October, that he had released all the
*  restraints on soldiers. That's what he told them directly. And then the next day, he said that
*  Israel was moving to a full scale response and that he had removed every restriction
*  on Israeli forces. I mean, Western media coverage has been a catastrophe. I mean, this is, I think,
*  one of the generally great exceptions. But it is one of the great scandals, I would say, in the
*  modern history of journalism, in that you just had to listen to what Israeli leaders and officials
*  said they were going to do. That was actually the best route map. But the Western media didn't just
*  fail to frame their coverage around those statements. In many cases, they didn't report
*  those statements at all. And I would put it when some people are going, you know, sometimes you
*  get this, oh, why is this breakdown and discipline and all the rest of it? I've just quoted from the
*  defence minister who's in charge of the army telling troops from the beginning, they have no
*  restrictions and no restraints on them. Isn't that part of it? They were told very clearly they had
*  impunity to behave as they wished. Okay. So as we say at the beginning of the film, no one can say
*  they didn't know. In the West, you have to have two types of responses to what the Israelis have
*  done in the Gaza Strip and now Lebanon. One is to straightforwardly support them. The other is to
*  engage in sort of hand wringing and say, well, it's complicated, it's nuanced and so on. Part of
*  the purpose of our film is to say, well, listen to Israelis themselves. Listen to Israeli politicians,
*  listen to Israeli media, listen to Israeli social media and above all, listen to Israeli soldiers as
*  they articulate their own thoughts through social media. There is nothing nuanced or complicated at
*  all in the way the Israelis think about it. The rhetoric right from the beginning, even when it
*  hasn't been overtly genocidal, which it sometimes is, it's certainly been all about ethnic cleansing.
*  Let's just talk about what I call genocide. I've called it genocidal mania, which is when a society
*  basically, you know, there are courageous exceptions within Israeli society, but they're courageous
*  because they're exceptions. You get this combination of a dehumanization of the Palestinian people,
*  a sense of, you know, we've been attacked and we're the victims, we're strong and dominant
*  and we can do what we want. It's quite a lethal combination, I think, isn't it? I mean, how would
*  you explain the kind of what you can see from the way Israeli soldiers behave and speak? What that
*  says to kind of the radicalization, I guess, that's taken place in Israeli society since December,
*  October? I think there has been a radicalization. I think we have to be very careful of this idea
*  that there used to be a more moderate Zionism and if you go way back, there was a good Zionism.
*  Zionism has always been rooted in the dispossession and the subjugation of the indigenous people.
*  I mean, you know, Zionism has its very complex roots in the appalling experiences of Jewish
*  people in Europe, but in terms of the people it is inflicted on, the indigenous population of
*  Palestine, it's no different from any other settler colonial enterprise. The great problem
*  settler colonial enterprises have is that there is an indigenous population and, you know, what do
*  you do with them? And all of those enterprises carry within them genocidal impulses, you know,
*  which you actually see manifested in many of, you know, in the Americas and Australia and so on.
*  And I think this is one of the great dangers. We have a misconception about Israel. As I say,
*  we think of it as a Western liberal democracy. We think of it through the prism of the Jewish
*  experience in Europe and it rather blinds us to these, you know, frankly terrifying impulses,
*  certainly post October the 7th, really quite genocidal impulses within Israeli society.
*  And our failure to grasp that and our failure to grasp the reality of the emotions and the dynamics
*  that are at play there, you know, is catastrophic for the Palestinian people because it leaves them
*  utterly vulnerable and defenseless. Let's talk in terms of, let's talk about the different types of,
*  I guess, well, they're war crimes, we're talking about war crimes here. First thing,
*  wanton destruction. So just the way, and you can see this a lot, Israeli soldiers posting,
*  often weeping, cheering as they blow things up, including dynamiting. So they've gone around and
*  put explosives in buildings, which by definition, there was no threat being posed because they've
*  gone, as was pointed out by a British army from a general who you spoke to, they've got, they've
*  taken, you know, they're not threatened by these, you know, it's not like, you know, they're being
*  attacked from this target and they're firing back. They've gone in and calmly just put loads of
*  explosives and blown up. And we've seen the blowing up of universities, of, you know, a whole range of
*  civilian structures. Tell me, you know, that rejoicing they've got, what do you think that
*  tells us? What's happening? What do you think the kind of, you know, what mentality is being
*  displayed by this desire, this rejoicing in blowing up so many of these structures, which
*  are the foundations of a civil society? It reveals a profoundly racist mentality, but a racist
*  mentality which is given license where elsewhere in the world we recognise this for what it was
*  and began to condemn it at the end of the 20th century. Israel gets license and we don't court
*  it out for what it is. It reveals a profound contempt for the sort of humanity of Palestinians.
*  I mean, those explosions are extraordinary. They use far more explosives than they need to. They're
*  clearly sort of competing for who can make the biggest bang. It also speaks to, yes, an
*  extraordinary sense of impunity. I mean, you're not allowed to just go around blowing up civilian
*  property under international law. You know, it's against the law and it opens you to prosecution
*  for war crimes. And it just speaks to the astonishing sense of impunity Israeli soldiers have.
*  And also this sort of institutional indiscipline in that no one ever comes down from high command
*  or from the government and says stop doing this. They just continue posting these things.
*  It was pointed out in the film, this isn't technically, you can say, is this a war,
*  it's not technically a war crime, but it's disturbing and reveals something,
*  which we'll ask you about. It's the amount of times you can see soldiers posing with women's
*  underwear from the homes that they've stormed into and dressing up with this, with women's underwear,
*  lingerie, that kind of thing. I mean, someone I remember posted a while ago,
*  so it still remains the case, there are far more examples of photos of Israeli soldiers posing with
*  women's underwear than of them rescuing their own hostages by military means.
*  I mean, what's this, you know, this obsession? It's like a trend. What is it? What do you think
*  is happening there? Again, it's racist dehumanisation, it's profound misogyny. I
*  imagine they think they are exposing some sort of hypocrisy in a conservative Muslim society.
*  I think, yes, I mean, we see an awful lot of soldiers dressing up in women's underwear. We
*  see an awful lot more of that than we see of actual combat. This isn't something we had time
*  to go into in the film, but the thing that is remarkably lacking in soldiers' videos is combat,
*  which is what you would think they would be posting. They all have body cams and so on,
*  they could be posting that if it was happening. Every now and then you see them blazing away with
*  their guns, but frequently they are standing up and it's clear there is no incoming fire. So
*  there is a remarkable sort of imbalance in the nature of the material they are posting.
*  Of course there is a contrast here with the Qassam Brigades and Hamas who have posted over 300
*  combat videos since October 7th. Now, of course these combat videos are propaganda,
*  they are edited and I'm sure they are only showing us the missions that succeed and so on. Of course
*  one has to acknowledge that. But at least it shows a comms strategy. They are at least thinking about
*  what will look good, whereas the Israelis just don't seem to care at all. The other point I would
*  make about the Israeli videos is this sort of vexed question of how much damage has been done
*  to Hamas. Most people are saying Hamas has not been defeated, has clearly not been defeated.
*  You see then estimates coming out for the extent to which Hamas has been degraded, 10, 20, 30, 40,
*  50%. I just don't know where people get these, how they make these calculations. But I would,
*  for people who are looking into that, I would urge a very common sense approach. If you scour
*  these videos, these soldiers' videos, and also the videos that the Israeli Army itself puts up,
*  they put up a lot of videos. And again, they are more likely to show combat or at least something
*  that looks like combat. What is very, very striking, you almost never see a dead Hamas fighter.
*  You do occasionally. I'm not saying that they don't exist. People could respond to this and show me
*  a whole bunch of pictures. I've seen them. But remarkably few, remarkably few.
*  Richard, one of the things we keep hearing over and over again is the question of human shields,
*  that the palace, that Hamas uses human shields to protect itself and therefore the atrocities
*  being committed are actually the fault of Hamas. That's why civilians are dying, human shields.
*  What do you say to that? This is an area where I feel the Western media really does share a
*  huge culpability. As you say, again and again, confronted with the enormous and horrifying death
*  toll in the Gaza Strip, particularly amongst children, a third of the dead are children.
*  What Israelis say, what the Israeli government says, what Western politicians say is,
*  ah, but Hamas hides behind the civilian population. Now we go into this in great detail in our film.
*  It's very important to say in our film, on the human shields thing, for the most part,
*  it's not original research. You can get a 22-year-old researcher to research for an hour.
*  I'm going to come up with this. It's really not complicated. Basically, there is not a scrap of evidence
*  that Hamas uses the civilian population as human shields. Yes, I mean, they're both in the same very
*  small space now. If that's what they mean by human shields, then yes, but there's not a scrap of
*  evidence that they're actually forcibly forcing people to stay in places where they're fighting
*  and so on. Also, you have to remember, Hamas, whatever you think of it, is a popular movement,
*  and the Qasam Brigades are rooted in the people. You'd be talking about them hiding behind their
*  nieces, their nephews, their aunts, what have you, and they would very, very quickly lose any
*  legitimacy if they had that. Also, again, a point that's made in our film, what is there about
*  Israeli behaviour over the last year that would lead anyone to think that the presence of a
*  civilian would lead to the Israelis holding fire? I mean, there's nothing at all to indicate that the
*  Israelis have any concern for civilian casualties at all, and so what would be the point
*  of using human shields? Now then, on the other side, it's very well documented for years and
*  years that the Israelis themselves systematically, routinely use Palestinian civilians as human
*  shields, and it's clearly happening on a systematic basis in this conflict as well. And we have,
*  we spoke to six people who had been used as human shields. The interesting thing there was we were
*  speaking to them about something else, just coincidentally they'd been used as human shields,
*  and it drives you crazy. You'll see this, I saw David Lammy recently, and he was sort of
*  stumbling around trying to articulate what he was trying to say was that the deaths of the
*  fault of Hamas because of human shields, and Victoria Derbyshire finished the sentence for
*  him with the word human shields, and Victoria Derbyshire, who is as good as it gets at the BBC,
*  and it's absolutely criminal because it is legitimising the wholesale slaughter of civilians,
*  and why the Western media with all its resources can't just do a really basic, simple bit of fact
*  checking on that just bewilders me. One of the focuses of the Western media and Western politicians
*  after 7th October was on the question of sexual violence, and I know when it obviously
*  gets into that particular discussion, the point I would make is that was talked about
*  as examples of the total depravity of Hamas and other armed groups used to justify
*  the onslaught against Gaza. It just shows these people are animals, they are sick,
*  depraved, twisted animals. That was the basis of that whole discussion. We now have overwhelming
*  evidence about sexual violence committed by the IDF, and you talk about some hideous examples,
*  including a detainee being raped by a dog. Yes, it's clearly absolutely systematic within
*  detention centres. Male rape, the issue of sexual violence against women is rather more complicated,
*  but as you say, there is overwhelming evidence, and I think it's one of these areas here where
*  journalists in the West really do have to ask themselves some questions, because that unquestioned
*  reporting of sexual violence on October 7th gave an enormous impetus and justification to atrocities
*  that happened thereafter, and I strongly suspect that the soldiers who were committing these abuses
*  in these detention centres imagine they're gaining some sort of revenge for something that is supposed
*  to have happened, but there's very little evidence that it did happen on October 7th.
*  But as you say, it's absolutely systematic, widespread. We have an account in our film
*  of a dog being used to rape a man. The Israelis themselves have arrested people under pressure
*  from the ICC for the rape of a man. The UN has done reports on this where they've said it's clearly
*  systematic and widespread, and they've also said that 53 people have been killed
*  in Israeli detention, and again, also in the West, we continue with this great emphasis
*  on the hostages being held in the Gaza Strip. Now, there are thousands of people who are
*  effectively hostages being held in Israeli detention centres, and we now have a mass
*  of evidence that they are being subjected to the most appalling abuse, and ultimately murder,
*  in many cases, and yet the focus continues to be on the fate of the hostages in the Gaza Strip.
*  We actually did a thing which there wasn't room for in the film. We did an analysis. I think there
*  were about 78 released hostages who've given media interviews, and we minutely examined
*  the interviews and the statements they've given for, say, they've been subjected to
*  physical abuse while in captivity. There's just no comparison with the treatment of
*  Palestinians in Israeli detention centres, and quite often when these people are released,
*  they give interviews which rather irritate clearly the prevailing narrative in Israel,
*  and over time, you often see people rather adjusting their own narrative to fit that,
*  but even so, as I say, only four of them say they've actually been subject to physical abuse while
*  in Hamas captivity. The Israeli journalist Gideon Levy told me months ago that Palestinian
*  detainees were treated worse than Israeli detainees. That point about torture,
*  again, it's worth emphasising that so many of these detainees we know, their crime has been
*  Palestinian, hasn't it? The people picked up and often put through the most hideous treatments,
*  including people who were children, including kids. Just tell us how widespread that is.
*  The argument then would be, well, how dare you call these hostages? In the case of Israeli
*  hostages, these are just random people picked up, scooped up, and then incarcerated. But that's the
*  case here, isn't it? You've got the repeated sweeping up of just random people who haven't
*  taken part in any armed activity of any description, and then they're tortured.
*  I mean, that's what's happening, isn't it? And often tortured to death. Yes, and frequently then
*  released after 45, 50, 55 days. I mean, they wouldn't release them if they thought they were
*  fighters. I think one thing I would say is the accounts of treatment that we're getting from
*  released Palestinian prisoners are absolutely horrific. Imagine what they're doing to the
*  people they decide are terrorists in their parlance and who they don't release.
*  And it is important, I say that, by the way, a trap which we shouldn't fall into is to say,
*  well, it's only bad when we're talking about torture for those who aren't accused of anything.
*  Torture is a crime, whoever happens to be on the receiving end of it. I just want to ask as well,
*  there was recently this Israeli podcast that went viral talking about, I mean, talking in very
*  genocidal terms about the Palestinian people. One of them has worked very closely with Benjamin
*  Netanyahu. And they were talking about how Israelis, for example, going about their everyday
*  lives, going to concerts, he said. He went to a concert yesterday. He said, we enjoy the idea
*  that's suffering in Gaza. He said, we're enjoying it. And then joked about putting up a big screen
*  so that they could watch them suffer. I mean, you're right. I totally understand. It'd be
*  wrong to say there's pre and post, October 7, this is crude shift. But it strikes me the level of,
*  because I think it's really important to always point out that sociopaths are a tiny proportion
*  of any given society. It's very comforting to think you look at this and think these are just
*  a bunch of sociopaths. But actually, the vast majority of atrocities throughout human history
*  have not been committed by sociopaths. It's dehumanization, isn't it, the root of this.
*  You just have had a society which has completely dehumanized the indigenous population, as you say,
*  to a degree where those soldiers, combining that with impunity, think they can get away
*  with anything and actually are actively enjoying the pain and the suffering that they're inflicting
*  on an entire people. Yes, I think what the seventh did do was to give license to the most
*  genocidal impulses within Israeli society. And this is part of the point we're making in the film,
*  is these soldiers' videos are very popular in Israel. And Israeli civilians post similar
*  things themselves and just watch Israeli news and political programs and so on. You know,
*  these, this sort of violent genocidal language is not the preserve of a small fringe of Israeli
*  society. I'm not saying that it's every Israeli. Obviously, there are Israelis who react against
*  it. But it's astonishingly prevalent within Israelis. And it's terrifying. I mean, I was
*  actually terrified about this before October the seventh. It struck me that, you know, you have
*  these genocidal impulses in a state which is of the nature of the Israeli state because the
*  indigenous population are a pain in the neck. What do you do with them? They're not meant to be there,
*  you know, and as the situation was deteriorating. And also the nature of the government that came in
*  towards the end of 2022. I think, you know, again, the BBC and so on will interview people
*  and talk to people within the Israeli government. People in the West would have no idea how
*  extremely right wing and overtly racist many of the people in this government are. So yes, I mean,
*  all of the, you know, Palestinians would say that, and I think they're right, that the Israeli state
*  has always been rooted in ethnic cleansing and apartheid because that's the only way you can
*  create an ethnically defined entity in a space which previously was entirely occupied by people
*  of a different ethnicity. But in the past, you know, it's been perceived rather more subtly and
*  certainly subtly enough that we in the West have deluded ourselves, as I say, that Israel is a
*  Western democracy. But now, you know, any sort of mask has slipped. And if you are ignorant,
*  you are wilfully ignorant. As Susan Abelhawa says at the beginning of our film, this is essentially
*  what the film is about. No one could say they didn't know. And just to end on that point,
*  and well, I mean, in terms of the Western approach and the Western racism that runs through the media
*  and the political elite in terms of the response, I mean, I don't want to be that
*  loser who grows from his own Collins because Collins would do that normally problems. But
*  what I wrote in the column this week was if a state hostile to the West was guilty of atrocities
*  that subsceed, there would be wide-broken consensus that it was one of the great crimes of our age.
*  And more importantly than myself, Dina Buti, the Palestinian lawyer says, the world tells us nothing
*  can justify October 7th. And yet everything Israel has done can be justified by October 7th.
*  That's the point, isn't it? It's almost sometimes I just find it astonishing, even though I understand
*  the dynamics at play. I get it. But I get this childlike wonder, horror of just how there seems
*  to be no threshold that Israel can exceed where Western politicians and apart from occasional
*  hand-wringing and all the rest of it. But if this state was hostile to the West, and the way
*  they were behaving, it would be seen as one of the worst atrocities since World War Two.
*  Yeah, and the debate on whether we should be remaining in order.
*  Oh, months ago, months ago, that would have happened within a month of this,
*  at least. This is worse than anything that happened in Kosovo, for example,
*  and NATO used what happened in Kosovo to just go to war.
*  But it's a horrifying blind spot that we have in the West because it, as we say at the end of the
*  film, some people might be rather skeptical about whether we ever did live up to our ideals,
*  but certainly any pretense that we have now of a belief in the rule of law and human rights
*  has just been shattered. And if we don't realise that, people in the developing world realise that
*  the moral authority of the West has been completely destroyed to a degree that I don't think people
*  within the sort of political media class in the West grasp. And also, there is this
*  rather worrying degree to which the political media class in the West is so out of touch
*  on a number of things, actually. But this, especially all the opinion polls show that
*  the mass of the population have the reaction you would expect, which is absolute horror.
*  I frequently meet completely apolitical, sometimes quite conservative people,
*  who are just bewildered by why it's taken as given that we are Israel's ally. And I think
*  it's a very dangerous disconnect. I mean, it's obviously dangerous above all for the Palestinian
*  people. It buckles up our relationships with whole swathes of the world. And I think it's
*  dangerous domestically as well. I mean, in the last election, they probably actually managed to
*  lose a number of seats over this issue. Now, obviously, their opponents there have been
*  demonised as sort of fanatics and that that itself is supposedly a worrying trend. But
*  I don't know, they just don't seem to get it. They just don't seem to grasp how horrific
*  what is happening is and how the majority of people react to this in a human way. They
*  grasp it's horror. And they just don't understand why we're A, standing by and allowing it to
*  happen, but B, actually actively supporting it in many ways. Well, it's a bitter harvest that
*  will be reaped, I suspect, for many generations to come. And, you know, I often think to myself,
*  the fury that I feel, a white guy from Stockport, the fury that's been felt by so many people who
*  are Palestinian, clearly, above all else, Arab, Muslim, but people all over the world. I mean,
*  the consequences of this are going to be felt for a very long time. But what's so important at the
*  moment, given the Israeli state does have a level of impunity, is to bear witness and to document
*  what's happened and to be able to say there was no excuses. There has to be accountability for this,
*  including people going to prison, not just Israeli leaders, but those who facilitated them. There
*  has to be accountability. And this sort of work is absolutely critical, because nobody must be
*  allowed to be given the excuse of saying, I did not know at the time, because yes, you did nothing.
*  No atrocity in history has been so documented as this one. And this is why this documentary is so
*  important. So please, everyone, do make sure you check it out. Leave your thoughts, your comments,
*  whatever. Press like and subscribe. Do share this video, but make sure as well you click on
*  the documentary, you share the video, you share the documentary, you send it to people, maybe,
*  who need to be convinced, need to be persuaded of what's actually happening. Make sure everyone
*  sees it. It's a crucial piece of journalism. Richard, thank you so much as ever.
