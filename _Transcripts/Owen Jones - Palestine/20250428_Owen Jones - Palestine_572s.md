# Pro-Israel Mob ATTACK Women In NYC. Where's The Media Outrage?
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4)
*  Why isn't this headline used? Well, unfortunately, this is something of a rhetorical question, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=0.0s)]
*  but seriously, this is so shocking. This happened in New York on Thursday night. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=4.4s)]
*  Pro-Palestinian protesters had gathered outside Chabad Lubavitch World Headquarters in Brooklyn, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=9.92s)]
*  where Itamir Ben-Gavir, Israel's national security minister, was due to speak. Ben-Gavir even has [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=16.64s)]
*  past convictions in Israel for supporting terrorism and the incitement of racism. He's openly [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  committed to removing the surviving Palestinian population from Gaza and colonising Gaza with [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=28.16s)]
*  illegal Israeli settlements, and he's made repeated genocidal statements, including during [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=33.68s)]
*  his visit to the United States, where he discussed with Republican leaders at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=38.24s)]
*  resort bombing food supplies in Gaza, which he says had their support. As national security minister, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=43.2s)]
*  he's responsible, for example, for the prison system in Israel, where Palestinian detainees, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=49.36s)]
*  most of whom should be considered hostages, are tortured, beaten, starved, raped and killed. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=54.16s)]
*  There are surely few more deserving targets for protesters than Ben-Gavir. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=60.48s)]
*  This is a war criminal, a hateful genocidal racist who in a rational sane and just world [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=64.96s)]
*  would be behind bars. Now later, a violent mob of pro-Israel supporters, all of the men, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  surrounded one of the pro-Palestinian protesters, a 29-year-old woman who was being escorted by a [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=76.4s)]
*  police officer. They were chanting, death to Arabs, in Hebrew, as well as misogynistic [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=82.48s)]
*  abuse, including threats of rape. They brutally assaulted her, throwing a garbage can at her legs, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  as well as smashing her head with a traffic cone, causing her to recoil and scream in pain. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=92.56s)]
*  The mob screams, get him. Let's have a look at some of the footage. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=112.48s)]
*  So a pro-Israel mob of violent men shouting genocidal slogans against Arabs physically [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=134.32s)]
*  assaulted a young woman while threatening worse, including rape. There was also, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=140.56s)]
*  I should say, another incident in which pro-Israel protesters targeted a second woman and injured [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=145.68s)]
*  her as well. Here's a plot twist. The woman posted a picture of herself afterwards, blood on her face [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=150.32s)]
*  and a bandage on her head having required medical assistance for a head wound. She's smiling, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=156.08s)]
*  defiantly, joking that the emergency medical services said she still looked hot despite her [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=162.4s)]
*  injuries. And it turns out she's Jewish and she has an Israeli passport. Let's imagine, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=167.44s)]
*  shall we, that a Hamas leader visited New York on a speaking tour. Okay, I really am asking you to [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=173.68s)]
*  bend your imagination here. That would clearly never happen. They'd be barred from entering the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=179.6s)]
*  country. If they managed to enter, they'd be promptly arrested. Anyway, let's just go along [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=182.96s)]
*  with this, shall we? Protesters marched against these Hamas leaders. Then a mob of largely Arab [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=188.16s)]
*  American men yelling, death to Jews, surround a young woman they identify as one of the protesters [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=192.4s)]
*  and physically assaults her, leading her to be hospitalized with a bloodied head injury. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=198.72s)]
*  And it then transpires she's actually also an Arab American woman with a Palestinian passport [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=203.52s)]
*  who's protesting against Hamas. Look, I resent having to play this game, driven by the obscene [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=207.36s)]
*  dual standards at play here. But you can imagine, it would be front page news. It would lead news [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=212.32s)]
*  bulletins. It would lead to fierce denunciations from politicians across the West, including the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=218.16s)]
*  US president. I know it. You know it. We all know it. Now, ever since 7th of October, there's been [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=222.16s)]
*  a massive focus on the question of Jewish safety in the US and the Western world. To be clear, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=228.32s)]
*  Jewish safety is extremely important. All Jewish people in the West deserve to be safe and secure. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=232.88s)]
*  Anti-Semitism is real. It's a grave evil. And anti-Semitism must be confronted and defeated. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  The problem is twofold. Firstly, that the question of threats to Jewish safety has been deliberately [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=242.72s)]
*  conflated with opposition to Israel's genocide in an effort to silence and indeed criminalize [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=247.76s)]
*  anyone speaking out against the genocide facilitated by the United States and its Western allies. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=253.2s)]
*  Secondly, anti-Palestinian and indeed anti-Arab and anti-Muslim racism and hatred has been [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=258.56s)]
*  deliberately left out of this conversation. On the first point, we saw how protests against [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=264.0s)]
*  the genocide, particularly on university campuses, were demonized and portrayed as a dangerous [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=269.2s)]
*  menace to Jewish people. Even though all of these protests involved Jewish students, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=274.08s)]
*  including in leading positions, this absurdity was brought into sharp relief a year ago when [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=278.4s)]
*  a young woman marched into a protest at Yale University to prove it was anti-Semitic. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=283.44s)]
*  Just take a look at what happened. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=289.44s)]
*  I will not feel shame. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=304.71999999999997s)]
*  Incredible stuff there. She was wearing a t-shirt and blazing with Jew, yelling, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=309.12s)]
*  look at my face, I'm not afraid. I will not feel shame. And got completely ignored. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=312.47999999999996s)]
*  And the real chef's kisses was three Jewish protesters were standing next to her holding a [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=316.64s)]
*  Jews for a free Palestine banner. Really just sums up the absurdity of the whole thing. Someone [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=321.68s)]
*  trying to self-victimize themselves, acting as though somehow they'd be menaced or threatened [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=327.44s)]
*  because they're Jewish, while actual Jewish protesters against the genocide were freely [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=331.92s)]
*  standing around and participating in the protests she claimed was an existential threat to people [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=337.52000000000004s)]
*  like herself. Now, this phenomenon was articulated very well by Nara Milinich, a Jewish academic [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=341.6s)]
*  at Columbia University. I interviewed her about this a year ago. Very instructive. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=347.36s)]
*  I think we have to distinguish between actual real discomfort. And we need to take that discomfort [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=352.32s)]
*  seriously. That students may feel when they encounter ideas that are anathema to the ideas [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=359.84s)]
*  or radically different from, or seemingly hostile to the ideas with which they grew up. We have to [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=366.71999999999997s)]
*  distinguish between discomfort, emotional discomfort and actual harm and harassment, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=373.91999999999996s)]
*  actionable harassment. Now, Donald Trump, who has a history of making antisemitic statements, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=383.28s)]
*  who has reportedly said that Hitler did some good things and wanted to fire his generals like [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=388.16s)]
*  Hitler did, who was openly supported by Nazis and white supremacists, who he's met, has used the [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=392.48s)]
*  question of Jewish safety to issue a diktat criminalising pro-Palestinian protests on campuses [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=397.92s)]
*  and indeed deporting people who've taken part in campus protests against the genocide. At the same [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=404.24s)]
*  time, anti-Palestinian and anti-Arab and anti-Muslim hatred has not been taken seriously at all. The [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=409.76000000000005s)]
*  opposite, in fact, it's been whipped up by politicians and media outlets up to and including [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=414.8s)]
*  Donald Trump himself. There's been hideous crimes at the Illinois landlord who stabbed to death [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=420.32s)]
*  the six-year-old Palestinian American boy Wadiya Al-Fayoum, as well as leaving his mother with [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=426.88s)]
*  severe stab wounds. There were three Palestinian students who were shot in Vermont, leaving one [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=432.8s)]
*  of them paralysed. And in February, a Jewish man in Florida shot two Israelis he thought were [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=437.28000000000003s)]
*  Palestinian. In an absurd twist, two Israeli victims who survived relatively unscathed were [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=442.32s)]
*  convinced their attackers were Arab and concluded their post about the attack with death to Arabs. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=447.04s)]
*  Meanwhile, Donald Trump uses Palestinian as an insult and is repeatedly called, of course, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=453.92s)]
*  for Gaza to be emptied of its Palestinian population, while Republican politicians have [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=457.76s)]
*  used repeatedly genocidal language from the Republican lawmaker who called for all Palestinians [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=462.48s)]
*  to die to the Republican congressman, Randy Fine, who was called for Gaza to be destroyed, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=467.2s)]
*  streets to overflow with blood, so on. Really blood-curdling genocidal stuff. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=472.24s)]
*  And of course, there's been an endless stream of genocidal statements from Israeli leaders and [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=476.4s)]
*  officials, of course, Israel armed and backed by the US and other Western countries as they actually [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=480.88s)]
*  enact genocide against the Palestinian people. Yet with this context, the lack of media coverage [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=485.76s)]
*  of what happened in New York has been instructive. Take this headline from Reuters, New York probes [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=491.91999999999996s)]
*  reported counter-protest assaults during Israeli officials' visit, as the academic Asal Rad, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=497.76s)]
*  who has done an incredible job exposing absurd racist Western headlines about Israel's genocidal [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=502.71999999999997s)]
*  onslaught, you know, just exposing the double standards and all the rest. Anyway, as she puts [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=510.8s)]
*  it, would you have any idea that this headline is about a pro-Israel mob assaulting women and [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=515.4399999999999s)]
*  shouting death to Arabs in New York City? Who thinks for a moment this would have been the [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=520.0s)]
*  headline if it had been a mob of violent Arab-American men screaming death to Jews [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=524.08s)]
*  as they attacked a young woman opposed to Hamas? This once again exposes the loud and proud [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=528.48s)]
*  unapologetic double standards at play here. They're not even trying to hide it. We will continue, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCKN6pGK3N4&t=533.6s)]
