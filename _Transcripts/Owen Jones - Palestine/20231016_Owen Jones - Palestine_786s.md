Video Description: After thousands took to the streets to oppose the horror being unleashed against Gaza, the BBC smeared us as Hamas supporters. This is dangerous - and shows how a British Establishment exposed for defending war crimes intends to treat those upholding human rights.

# The BBC SMEARS Gaza Peace Activists
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7_Cmlg5t-w)
*  This morning someone got in touch with me who wished to remain anonymous with a clip from BBC
*  News about the protests which took place on Saturday across Britain against Israel's
*  slaughter ongoing now in Gaza. I can't believe the BBC said this he told me and when I watched
*  the clip neither could I. He'd recorded it on his mobile phone because I had no idea how to get
*  around the BBC's anti-screen recording technology. I messaged someone called Sol Stanneworth who does
*  an invaluable service in recording TV clips please do follow him and he published it. Just listen to
*  this. Here in the UK the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak visited excuse me a Jewish school in London
*  to underline his support for the community. The visit followed several demonstrations across Britain
*  during which people voiced their backing for Hamas which many countries including the UK
*  and US consider a terrorist organisation. Absolutely wild, wild scenes there from the BBC. I was at
*  that protest on Saturday. I was at a march opposed to the murderous onslaught against Gaza
*  which from the siege of water, food and electricity to the indiscriminate slaughter of civilians
*  with over a thousand children alone reported killed constitutes a grave war crime. A war crime
*  committed with the direct complicity of our governments. Now I saw countless banners
*  opposing the war and war crimes. I met numerous Jewish activists for peace. I saw nothing. Zero
*  zilch supporting Hamas. I went up and down the length of that demonstration. I'd also note the
*  police were present throughout the protest clearly scouring the demonstration for anything
*  which they could construe as constitution support for Hamas. It was a peaceful protest and there
*  were only a handful of arrests which frankly at such a mass for demonstrations such as that I mean
*  at football matches you get more arrests than that. Now speeches specifically condemned all
*  attacks against all civilians and absolutely rightly so as well. Now at a protest of such a
*  huge size you'll always get some idiots to say the least attaching themselves to it and apparently
*  footage was found of a couple of protesters with images of the paragliding Hamas attackers on their
*  backs. Obviously completely unacceptable. In no way were they in any shape or form representative
*  of that demonstration. Indeed two years ago a much smaller pro-Israel demonstration featuring
*  tanks like there will never be Palestine it's our country my effing country which was also attended
*  by far-right convicted criminal Tommy Robinson. Watch this.
*  That was I should note a protest which was addressed by the Israeli ambassador to Britain.
*  Can you imagine if the BBC described that as a far-right pro-Israel rally? Now as for the
*  protest they smeared you might well think well this was just one lapse by the BBC. It wasn't.
*  It was clearly a editorial decision made which was signed off which we know because a different
*  presenter repeated the exact same words an hour later. Well meanwhile here in the UK the Prime
*  Minister Rishi Sunak has visited a Jewish school in London to underline his support for the Jewish
*  community. The visit followed several demonstrations across Britain during which people voiced their
*  backing for Hamas which several countries including the UK and the US consider a terrorist
*  organisation. Now I'll tell you why this is dangerous and I do not use that word flippantly.
*  Many of those marching are Muslim and that is understandable because it is Muslims being
*  disproportionately slaughtered in great numbers and the BBC risks encouraging the idea that
*  British Muslims are terrorist supporters and therefore dangerous and that risks inciting
*  hatred against Muslims and violent hatred at that. It's also an example of anti-Palestinian racism
*  which has shaped media coverage throughout this hideous episode and also obviously for many many
*  decades in which Palestinian civilian life is treated as having less value than Israeli or
*  Western civilian life and all solidarity with the Palestinian people is demonised and smeared
*  and treated as illegitimate. Now I'll tell you why this is dangerous. When we get these awful
*  episodes of violence in the Middle East you get a spike in hate crimes both anti-Semitism and
*  Islamophobic both of which need to be condemned and for. Let me give you one example in Illinois
*  this weekend a six-year-old Palestinian American boy was stabbed to death, his mother injured,
*  when their landlord using the pretext of the current nightmare in Gaza and Israel
*  murdered them and he reportedly shouted you Muslims must die. Playing with fire, playing with fire,
*  that's what happens when Muslims and Palestinians in particular are demonised. Now after a firestorm
*  online the BBC was forced to retract what they said and let's just hear what they said on air.
*  We spoke about several demonstrations across Britain during which people voiced their backing
*  for Hamas. We accept that this was poorly phrased and was a misleading description of the pro-Palestinian
*  demonstrations. Now here's the weather. Note there is no apology, poorly phrased, misleading,
*  very euphemistic language there. Neither have we been offered an explanation of the editorial
*  process which led to this smear. Note too how they linked the protest specifically to threats
*  against Jewish people. It was in a preamble to the Prime Minister visiting Jewish schools to show
*  solidarity with the Jewish community. They were trying to specifically link these protests with
*  potentially violent hatred against Jewish British citizens. Now the smear from the BBC should be
*  seen alongside the government smearing of protesters. Our, unfortunately, Home Secretary
*  Soella Bravaman described the protest as an intimidating mob, a lie, a total lie. It was a
*  peaceful protest. I was there. And citing the chant of from the river to the sea Palestine will be
*  free which she describes as a slogan that is widely understood as a demand for the destruction of
*  Israel. Now this was rightly taken apart by the brilliant Mick Dadversie who's a media spokesperson
*  for the Muslim Council of Britain. He says the Home Secretary is treading on dangerous ground here.
*  A peaceful demonstration is being slurred as an intimidating mob and a chant heard at the rally
*  is being mischaracterised. He quotes the Jewish media outlet which takes on the belief that a
*  free Palestine would necessarily lead to the mass annihilation of Jewish Israelis in terms of the
*  context of this phrase and how it's used as rooted in deeply racist and Islamophobic assumptions
*  who the Palestinians are and what they want. Adding, Mick Dad, that is either used to mean
*  the historic land of Palestine will be free from occupation, discrimination and bigotry in a two
*  state solution or there should be a secular state with one person one vote where everyone is free
*  both entirely valid and legitimate aims. Now I want to take on another smear against those protesting
*  against this war crime. Across the country there have now been multiple Labour councillors
*  quitting the Labour Party, often clearly very painful decisions. That comes after Keir Starmer,
*  the disgrace of a leader, endorsed the cutting off of water and energy to Gaza,
*  therefore endorsing a war crime and Labour shadow Attorney General Emily Thornberry refused to
*  condemn this war crime and a shadow Foreign Secretary David Lamry refused to condemn Israel's
*  demand for Gazans to flee their homes under threat of violence, another war crime, as well as their
*  overall failure as a party to condemn the mass slaughter now ongoing in Gaza at the hands of
*  the Israeli state. One is Councillor Amna Abdel Latif from Manchester City Council who denounced
*  the Labour leadership for effectively endorsing a war crime. Bang on. As well as councillors,
*  the young Labour BAME officer, Lababa Khalid, resigned last week adding that the Labour Party
*  is no longer a safe space for Palestinians and Muslims. Three days later she discovered
*  that members of her own family had been killed by the Israeli state in Gaza. She found out on
*  Twitter. Now a journalist called Lee Harpin who constantly regurgitates whatever Labour sources
*  tell him, as far as I can tell, he's basically a mouthpiece for anonymous star official smearing
*  the left, wrote Labour source on the few quitting the party over party stance on Hamas, shaking off
*  the fleas. Fleas. Those are the words used which he clearly approvingly has posted on Twitter.
*  People disgusted, repelled by Labour sickening de facto endorsement of war crimes many of them
*  Muslim including a young woman who has lost members of her family. This is sickening. It
*  is grotesque and cowardly. So pathetic little dweeb. Now one of those dweebs running the Labour
*  Party hiding behind anonymity. He then, Lee Harpin, deleted his tweet claiming it be misinterpreted.
*  How could that be misinterpreted Lee? What are you talking about? I mean if you're gonna post
*  these vile things on Twitter it leads to have the decency to stand by the vile you're posting
*  instead of claiming it's misinterpreted. Now the truth is what is going to happen is this. This is
*  an important point. A very important point. More and more people are going to see what the Israeli
*  state is doing to the Palestinian people. They're going to see the mass death. They're going to see
*  the massacres. They're going to see the war crimes and they're going to get angry about it. And when
*  they're going to get more and more angry they're going to get angry specifically with the politicians
*  who have facilitated this monstrous crime. And what's going to happen is this. These politicians
*  and their media allies are going to double down on smearing those of us who oppose Israel's massacre,
*  who oppose war crimes, who oppose the occupation, who oppose apartheid and who oppose the West
*  complicity in this unspeakable horror. Just a few random facts from the last couple of days to
*  spell that out. This unspeakable horror. They've run out of water in Gaza. The UN reports no clean
*  water in their shelters. They've reports of Gazans drinking sea water. It may well be thirst which
*  ends up killing more of the people of Gaza than the bombing itself. Food is running out.
*  Body bags are running out. There is nearly no fuel left for the hospitals. Generating, powering
*  those ventilators. Mass graves are being dug. In one case the UN reports that 12 members of a staff
*  member of the independent commission for human rights were killed including his wife and his three
*  children. As extended families crammed together the living generations of 45 families were wiped
*  from the Gaza registry. What does that mean? That's the entire bloodlines gone wiped from the face
*  of the earth from the grandparents to the grandchildren. Every day there are a report of
*  medics and journalists and UN officials being murdered. A top Israeli military lawyer says if
*  you want to destroy Hamas then you have to destroy Gaza because everything in Gaza almost every
*  building there is a stronghold of Hamas. There is no excuses here. They are broadcasting their
*  intents. This is not a war crime they're trying to cover up. They are loudly broadcasting it to the
*  world. There is no excuse for not knowing what is currently unfolding and what is to unfold in the
*  next few days and those who have cheered this on who have justified it and rationalized what is
*  happening they are going to get queasy in the coming days and coming weeks. Don't let them get
*  away with it. The blood is on their hands as well and they must never be forgiven for what they have
*  done. The death toll as it is is around 3,000. A third of them children but with so many buried
*  under rubble that's a conservative estimate. The founding international criminal court prosecutor
*  Luis Moreno Acampo declares the siege of Gaza could be considered a crime against humanity
*  and a genocide. It goes on and on. Gaza is now hell on earth and the ground invasion hasn't even
*  begun. The bloodbath has been greenlit by our politicians and justified by the media and yet
*  as those of us standing against this war crime who face being vilified. You like me may have read
*  throughout history how terrible atrocities are committed and ask yourself how could they possibly
*  have happened? How could so many people who consider themselves humane and civilized and even loving
*  become so blind to pain so able to make themselves so complicit in unspeakable horror? Well now you
*  know. Now you know. It's happening in front of you. This is how it happens and unless we keep speaking
*  out and fighting it so many more people are going to die and they're going to die with the direct
*  complicity of our politicians and our media. It is up to us. This is a matter of life and death on a
*  colossal scale. Please like, subscribe, desupport the channel on patreon.com for us ownjoes84
