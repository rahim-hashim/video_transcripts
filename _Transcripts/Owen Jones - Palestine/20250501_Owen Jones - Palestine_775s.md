# EXPOSED: Israel Handed Power In UK Justice System - w/. Huda Ammori
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw)
*  A foreign power handed influence in Britain's justice system. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=0.0s)]
*  These are new revelations published in the Guardian newspaper about the British [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  government sharing contact details of counter-terrorism police and prosecutors with the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=6.72s)]
*  Israeli embassy whilst there was an investigation into protests at an arms factory. The context here is [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=10.64s)]
*  the arrest of 10 Palestine Action activists under the Terrorism Act during a protest at an Israeli [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=16.56s)]
*  weapons factory last August with another 8 then arrested three months later. According to the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  Guardian, the email sent by Nicola Smith, the head of international law at the Attorney General's [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=27.04s)]
*  Office and obtained through a Freedom of Information request was sent 11 days after she'd met [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=31.68s)]
*  Grudzki Eckstein. It was redacted apart from the subject matter. What the hell is going on here then? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=35.92s)]
*  As the solicitors for the Palestine Action activists ask, the information disclosed in [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=41.28s)]
*  response to an FRI request clearly raised questions and need further investigation. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=46.08s)]
*  Why, for example, did the Attorney General's Office provide the contact details for the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Crown Prosecution Service, an independent body to the Israelis? What further exchanges followed [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=54.88s)]
*  and was there discussions about ongoing criminal prosecutions? Palestine Action takes direct action [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=59.92s)]
*  in the UK against Israel's genocide up to and including breaking the law, which in the world [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=65.36s)]
*  we live in is judged to be worse than breaking international law to facilitate the mass slaughter [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=69.92s)]
*  of innocent people. I've covered their prosecutions, the prosecutions taken against their activists on [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=74.88s)]
*  this channel repeatedly, including the use of anti-terror legislation against them. I'm honoured [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  to be joined again by the brilliant Huda Amori from Palestine Action to talk over what these [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=83.92s)]
*  revelations mean. Firstly, tell me your response to what we've discovered. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=88.16s)]
*  Well, I think it's quite disturbing to say the least. We now know that the Attorney General's [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=95.6s)]
*  Office, which is part of the UK government, sent the Israeli Embassy, the Deputy Israel Ambassador, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=102.88s)]
*  to be specific, contact details for the CPS and the counter-terrorism police. This was whilst the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=109.68s)]
*  investigation into the 2018 was ongoing, which obviously suggests that there was follow-up [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  communication because there was contact established between the Deputy Israel Ambassador and the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=124.48s)]
*  counter-terrorism police, a unit overseeing the Filton 18 investigation and other cases as well. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=130.4s)]
*  We've heard of other journalists being arrested under the Terrorism Act, other activists being [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=137.2s)]
*  arrested under the Terrorism Act following the contact being established in this case. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=142.72s)]
*  It is very disturbing and could point to the fact that there could be an abusive process [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=150.23999999999998s)]
*  in these cases because the Israeli Embassy, the Deputy Israel Ambassador, has no business having [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=157.67999999999998s)]
*  details of the prosecution in this case if not to be discussing ongoing legal cases, whether [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=164.24s)]
*  ramifications and the consequences of this political interference are very severe for those [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  being subject to prosecutions. I mean, that's the thing. With your lawyers, are they kind of [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=178.72s)]
*  shocked by this, that the idea that a foreign power, and let's bear in mind this is a foreign power, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=184.4s)]
*  is being given some sort of literally as well not transparent influence in the justice system? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=190.88000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it is shocking in the sense that we have the evidence in black and white now. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=198.72000000000003s)]
*  And you know when we look at the Filton 18 case, which is when at first it was 10 activists who [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=206.4s)]
*  were arrested in August 2024, the contact details that were sent to the Israeli Embassy was a [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=212.56s)]
*  follow-up to a meeting between the Deputy Israel Ambassador and the Attorney General's office on [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=218.0s)]
*  August the 28th. After that, there were 10 more violent raids and arrests and people being locked [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=223.84s)]
*  up. Now they make up the AT. But I think when this case started, it was shocking in and of itself [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=231.36s)]
*  that there was an accusation of the terrorism connection, which is a very, very serious [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=240.0s)]
*  accusation and has led to them, as you've talked about before, some might be denied bail for up to [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=245.84s)]
*  two years before they go to trial. So I think that in itself is shocking. And it does point to the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=251.28s)]
*  fact that this is a political case. So I think that people were already thinking there has got to be [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=257.12s)]
*  some sort of political interference in these cases because you know the riots in summer 2024, there [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=263.84000000000003s)]
*  was no terrorism connection associated there. It's not been used in this way. It's completely [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=270.96s)]
*  unprecedented. But now we have evidence to show that the foreign government was involved and would [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=276.96s)]
*  have been discussing things with the Crown Prosecution Service and the counter-terrorism [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=285.52s)]
*  police. And it just shows that the state is prioritizing the interests of a foreign genocidal [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=291.52s)]
*  entity over the rights and freedoms of their own citizens to the point where we're having people [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=298.08s)]
*  locked up, unconvicted for two years before trial, and they face harsher sentences if this terrorism [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=304.0s)]
*  connection is decided by the judge at this. I mean, this is a crucial point. This is a state [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=311.59999999999997s)]
*  which is committing genocide, whose leaders have a res warrants against them for war crimes and [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=319.84s)]
*  crimes against humanity. Where there is a consensus among genocide scholars, this is genocide. There's [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=326.8s)]
*  a case at the International Court of Justice on genocide as well as actually multiple other cases [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=331.92s)]
*  as well. There are more arrests expected from the International Criminal Court as well for [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=336.64s)]
*  other Israeli leaders and officials, but they won't be made public now so we won't know when [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=341.12s)]
*  they happen. But that's definitely the case. That's the context. This is like just France. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=344.16s)]
*  France has got its own problems and crimes it's been committed throughout the past or whatever, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=352.32s)]
*  but we'll talk about genocide being committed by foreign power here. Do you know what I mean? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=357.28s)]
*  It's not just like France or Germany. It's a country, an entity, whatever you want to call it, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=361.28s)]
*  which is committing genocide. Yeah, definitely. And also, you have to remember what the Filtern 18 [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=367.36s)]
*  were accused of doing, which is destroying Israeli quadcopter drones, the kind of quadcopter drones [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=375.28s)]
*  being used to commit this genocide. So I think what's being exposed here is even further, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=381.84s)]
*  we already knew Britain was participating in the genocide. We have these flights going from [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=387.6s)]
*  from Britain to Akuteri to Israel. We have these weapons being made here, but now not only are they [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=393.6s)]
*  directly participating in the ongoing genocide, but they are violating their own laws in order [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=401.84s)]
*  to protect this genocidal entity over the rights of their own citizens. So this is how far they are [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=409.84s)]
*  willing to go to protect a foreign regime which is committing genocide. Because in the CPS Code of [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=415.2s)]
*  Conduct, it says categorically that the prosecutors have to be free from political interference, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=424.4s)]
*  political pressure or any improper influence. Now this is 100% improper influence. If you're [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=431.28s)]
*  having contact with the Israeli embassy and when those things occur, it is an abusive process [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=438.24s)]
*  and the prosecution should be stopped as a result. The case should be thrown out as a result of this [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=445.52s)]
*  evidence coming to light because it is crucial that this is what even the attorney general says. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=451.84000000000003s)]
*  He did a lecture on the rule of law, ironically, towards the end of last year. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=461.84000000000003s)]
*  Paramount to the rule of law is the independence of the judiciary and there was a reason for that [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=467.84000000000003s)]
*  because when you don't have that, it allows for corruption, it allows for people with influence [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=472.88s)]
*  to completely corrupt our system and then it's those at the receiving end who are bearing the [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=477.6s)]
*  consequences of that political interference. That's why it's an abusive process and why the [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=483.52000000000004s)]
*  only just solution is for these cases to be thrown out. I think what's really disturbing [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=490.16s)]
*  as well is that if there was phone numbers passed on and no one's phoned, how is the public ever [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=496.48s)]
*  going to get hold of that kind of information? The fact that a foreign regime can freely call [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=504.32000000000005s)]
*  the people prosecuting British citizens under draconian laws will never know the full extent. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=511.52000000000004s)]
*  This is just scratching the surface but it does show that there is contact. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=518.08s)]
*  You alluded to this, the attorney general, with his speech on the rule of law. We're told that [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=526.5600000000001s)]
*  the independence of the judiciary is a cornerstone of this great flourishing democracy that we have [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=530.72s)]
*  in this country. What does that say about that particular claim? It completely disproves it. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=536.24s)]
*  That's the point, isn't it? This is something which everyone should be absolutely [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=543.2s)]
*  up in arms about. It's clearly a violation of that. This isn't the first time we've seen [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=547.44s)]
*  something like this. This is quite extraordinary in and of itself because of how specific it is. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=555.44s)]
*  We've seen meetings between Albert Systems government ministers in the same room with [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=562.24s)]
*  senior police officers and with someone from the attorney general's office who was there [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=569.2s)]
*  to represent the CPS. The people prosecuting the case, the police officers who are going to [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=574.8s)]
*  be the ones who bash people's doors, Albert Systems and government ministers all in the same room [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=582.8s)]
*  discussing Palestine action cases. They are completely blurring the whole separation of [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=588.4799999999999s)]
*  powers. Why are they doing that? Why are they corrupting their so-called democracy? It's to [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=595.28s)]
*  protect this weapons manufacturer. It's interesting as well because it just shows how embedded [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=602.0s)]
*  Albert Systems is with the Israeli government. The fact that the Israeli government is doing their [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=609.76s)]
*  bidding and is lobbying, is working to protect them, interfering in the judicial system on their [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=616.96s)]
*  behalf. In that chain that we talked about where they sent the contact details, that was a follow-up [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=624.48s)]
*  to meeting on August 28th. Someone else who was involved was Douglas Wilson who is the director [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=630.56s)]
*  general of the attorney general's office. One of the most senior civil servants you can get there. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=636.56s)]
*  He was involved in discussions with the Israeli embassy back in 2022 and they were discussing [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=642.0799999999999s)]
*  Palestine action cases and the defenses available in our court cases and that was exposed in The [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=648.4799999999999s)]
*  Guardian a year later. There is a long, there's a series of these things happening but now it's [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=653.28s)]
*  culminated in people being held behind bars accused of terrorism. We're talking about a [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=660.88s)]
*  weapons manufacturer who tests their weapons during a genocide on Palestinians. This is clearly a [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=668.16s)]
*  result, what can be seen as a result of this build-up of political interference and this need to [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=677.04s)]
*  crack down on people. I think this is such an explosive revelation and it obviously exposes the, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=682.72s)]
*  well as you say it scratches the surface because we just don't know the full relations that exist [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=692.24s)]
*  between the British state and the Israeli state. We just don't know. I mean this is just like, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=697.28s)]
*  gives us a little inkling of the sorts of things happening behind the doors of the British public [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=701.6s)]
*  and people in this country about who are told they have this independent judiciary and all [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=707.68s)]
*  the rest of it. We know, you can see that isn't the case and that actually as well as exposing [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=713.8399999999999s)]
*  British complicity in genocide or further exposing it, it should ask very searching questions about [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=718.9599999999999s)]
*  the nature of democracy in this country as we are told. So it's such an important case and [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=724.9599999999999s)]
*  as ever Palestine Action doing incredible work putting their freedom at risk [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulQNB75cqw&t=729.5999999999999s)]
