# Why Gaza Is So Much Worse Than You Think
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [November 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCOZqM30Ng0)
*  This is the worst argument that you'll hear in defense of Israel's murderous onslaught against Gaza,
*  but it's also an extremely common argument. I'm sure you've come across it yourselves and it needs taking on,
*  not just because it is total abject nonsense, but because it actually underlines the unique horror
*  of what's happening right now in Gaza. So in that sense, it becomes inadvertently useful.
*  Now it goes like this. Why are you all focusing in Gaza and protesting about Gaza so much
*  rather than X, Y or Z horror? Now superficially, of course, this is an argument for never
*  protesting about anything, that unless you protest against everything simultaneously,
*  then you can't protest a single thing. I won't tidy my own room because the rest of the world is a mess.
*  Now that won't satisfy critics on its own, that argument, because then the focus is, it's argued,
*  is on Gaza is driven by a particular and unjustified hatred of Israel with an underpinning
*  of anti-Semitism. So here are some other basic points before we make the bulk of the argument,
*  I suppose. Firstly, the longevity of this conflict slash injustice. It dates back to 1948,
*  actually further than that, but look, for all intents and purposes, I think it's important to
*  talk about what happened then and there on in when Israel was founded and what was known as the Nakba
*  resulted in the ethnic cleansing of 700,000 Palestinians from their homes with around 15,000
*  of them killed. Then follows, after that, the longest belligerent occupation in modern times
*  and then Gaza specifically, the longest siege in modern times. Now the clock did not start with the
*  war crimes undeniably committed by Hamas on the 7th of October, as much as apologists for Israel's
*  current massacre in Gaza would like us to believe otherwise. Now a second point is the unique horror
*  of racist domination, commonly known as apartheid. Now apartheid has been used to describe Israel's
*  oppression of the Palestinians by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the
*  Israeli human rights organisation, Bet Slem, among many others. There were those who, back in the
*  Cold War, asked why there was so much focus on apartheid South Africa when there was no shortage
*  of other brutal and oppressive and indeed murderous regimes on the face of the planet,
*  and the answer here is that racist domination is widely regarded as a very specific and unique
*  horror. But the comparison is made with responses to this horror and other horrors with the argument
*  going that we're ignoring far worse atrocities and have done than that currently being unleashed
*  against Gaza. Now there's a cartoon circulating on Twitter which sums up this basic line of argument.
*  It shows four pictures of Westminster, each with a caption. The first says Assad kills 500,000
*  Muslims in Syria with the streets around the houses of parliament empty. Then 230,000 Muslims
*  dead in Yemen the same. 24,000 Muslims massacred in Myanmar the same. Then Israel defends itself
*  against Hamas, one way of putting it isn't it, packed with protesters, huge numbers of protesters
*  of Westminster Bridge. Now this argument inadvertently makes the case for just how extreme the war in Gaza
*  is, by accident, in ways you might not appreciate even if you are opposed, as I hope you are, to
*  what is currently unfolding. Let's take Syria first. Now that is an undeniably diabolical
*  conflict if you look at the impact on human life. In terms of actual figures, the UN Human Rights
*  Office believes that more than 306,000 civilians in Syria were killed between 2011 and 2021.
*  A truly horrendous tally. Many more combatants were killed other than that, on top of that,
*  but obviously we need to focus on the civilian death toll here. Now it's not true of course
*  that all of those were killed by the Assad dictatorship. We're all aware, I'm sure,
*  of other murderous factions operating in this war, ISIS for example, but the regime is responsible
*  for the large majority. Now a credible analysis by the Syrian Network for Human Rights, it's opposed
*  to the regime, but I think the analysis is highly credible, suggests that the regime killed 87%
*  directly, violent deaths we're talking here, of civilians. If you include military action by their
*  Russian allies, that brings the tally up to 90%. So it's reasonable to believe that around 275,000
*  civilians have been killed by the Assad regime. Now the first point here really is the crucial
*  point. Before we go on, Israel is armed and backed by the West. Our governments actively support the
*  massacre that it is undertaking in Gaza. It's therefore directly complicit, just as the Putin
*  regime is incidentally directly complicit in the crimes committed by the Assad regime in Syria.
*  Now this is such a screamingly obvious point, that the only conceivable reason, in my mind,
*  apologists for Israeli war crimes refuse to engage with it, is cynicism rather than say complete and
*  total stupidity. It's so obvious. In a democracy, you use mass collective action to put pressure on
*  power, principally your government, to change its behaviour, not exclusively, it might be companies
*  too for example. Now Israel is essentially an outpost of the West, of which we are part,
*  and the massacre it is conducting is directly facilitated by the governments which arm it
*  and support it. That's why we are so furious and agitated and doing our best to fight it. The same
*  is not true with Assad. Assad is a hostile state. The government already regard and have loudly made
*  it clear that they are opposed to the atrocities committed by Assad. I'm going to add some very
*  important caveats here. Now there are those who agitated for military action in Syria by the West,
*  which we did march against. I spoke at protests against such military action and proudly treated
*  to as well, because we believed we would again make ourselves directly complicit in the slaughter of
*  innocent civilians. We looked at the evidence base, always worth learning from history, as much as
*  our opponents refused to do so. We looked at Western interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, spoiler.
*  They were all completely catastrophic. Everything that was claimed was wrong and our worst fears
*  were confirmed and much beyond. Now we wanted to prevent that happening all over again. Now I would
*  know that over 3,000 civilians in Syria were estimated to have been killed by Western forces.
*  That's not exactly a small number, is it? It's the same number as those killed in 9-11 and adjusting
*  for population size would indeed be the equivalent of over 40,000 American civilians and without,
*  as you'll note, stopping Assad. If that was the war aim, who has in a meaningful sense, won the
*  Syrian civil war? Now I know that Russia is correctly denounced for its hideously indiscriminate
*  bombing of Syria, but the West is still responsible for 44% compared to the deaths committed by Russia.
*  So just under half the number committed by Russia and 60% of the deaths ISIS is responsible for.
*  So if we think ISIS is bloody, the West is responsible for the proportionally 60% of
*  the same number of deaths as ISIS. Now there's another point. Those of us who were protesting,
*  those who did protest over the question of Syria, wanted the West to engage in military action.
*  There were those who wanted that to happen. They were protesting about the war with a specific
*  demand on the government. We want you to militarily involve yourself in this war. Now those such as
*  myself were not going to align ourselves with those people for the reasons that I've set out.
*  Now compare what I think we should agree is the catastrophe, the total catastrophe of the Syrian
*  war to the current situation in Gaza. And this is where I'm afraid it gets pretty grim. We have the
*  figures provided by Gaza's Ministry of Health. Now those are routinely attacked on the grounds
*  that the Ministry of Health is run by Hamas and therefore its statistics are not credible or
*  reliable. Well in previous conflicts the final fatality figures released by the Ministry of Health
*  have been validated by the United Nations and Israel itself. Furthermore when Joe Biden casts
*  doubts on Palestinian fatality figures the Ministry of Health released the names, ages,
*  gender of each victim plus the Israel approved identification numbers of each person. So to prove
*  their figures are correct but they're actually underestimates because they don't include thousands
*  of missing people. The vast majority of whom are almost certainly buried under rubble who cannot
*  be identified yet because in the chaos of wartime it is not possible to retrieve those bodies.
*  That's why it's best to defer to the figures the estimates of the Euromed Human Rights Monitor,
*  an independent human rights group based in Geneva chaired by Richard Falk, the former UN Special
*  Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories and Professor
*  Amitris of International Law at Princeton University, a very credible group. Their latest
*  figures have over 17,000 dead of which nearly 14,500 are civilians. Now if we go by the estimated
*  pre-war population of Syria back in 2011 it was 22.73 million, around 10 times higher than pre-war
*  Gaza, about 2.2 million. Now if we adjust Gaza civilian death size death toll, sorry for population
*  size, that is the equivalent of well over 150,000 civilians being killed in Syria. Now that is just
*  over half of the total Syrian civilian death toll and significantly more than the total that we can
*  reasonably blame the Assad regime for. So what does that mean? It means in a bit over six weeks
*  Gaza civilian death toll is half as much as Syria's total civilian death rate after 10 years
*  and that's the war in Syria is seen correctly as hideously brutal. That just shows you
*  how bloody, how violent this death toll, this so-called war, this massacre,
*  correctly is in Gaza. You can see the civilian death rate compared to a war in Syria which we
*  all correctly regard as one of the great horrors of our time. Now the obvious retort here is I've
*  excluded combatants from Syria's death toll. One estimate there has on top of the figure I just said
*  well over 300,000 combatants who've been killed as well. So how do we know I'm actually quoting
*  civilian deaths in Gaza and they're not Hamas fighters? Well based on the Ministry of Health
*  figures which are credible for the reasons set out and indeed accepted as such by the UN
*  and other agencies, 70% of those killed in Gaza are women and children. Now many are uncomfortable
*  what they call the women and childrening of this conflict because many civilian men are dying too
*  and we should mourn them which I'll come on to but the fact is women and children are not Hamas
*  fighters so that's 70% we can just take them out. We know they're not military combatants. Now on
*  the point about men, the Iraq body count were an internationally respected research project,
*  excellent work who sought to estimate violent civilian deaths after the invasion of Iraq
*  which they did only based on validated public reports. It was always going to be an underestimate
*  but they wanted to just find kind of a absolute cast iron here's the death toll, violent death
*  toll among civilians that we can reasonably pull out. Now at the end of October they went through
*  the deaths of individual deaths released by the Ministry of Health. What was their conclusion?
*  They said that analysis of Gaza mortality data shows that few of the victims can have been
*  combatants. The modest excess of adult males killed can be explained by their greater exposure to risk
*  in ED rescue efforts. These IDF attacks are overwhelmingly and unforgivably on civilians.
*  It gets worse and worse so as I've said 70% of fatalities in Gaza, violent civilian deaths I'm
*  talking about are women and children. In Syria in the first four years of war a detailed academic
*  study in the British Medical Journal found 25% of fatalities caused by violence among civilians
*  were women and children. Let's just look at children in Syria in the first two years of war
*  the estimated proportion of civilian of children killed was 10%. In Iraq according to the Iraqi
*  body counts database that was 8.6% since the invasion, 8.6% of violent civilian deaths were
*  children. In Ukraine according to UN figures since the invasion it's around 6% children again who are
*  make up the total violent civilian deaths. Going off the latest figures from the independent Euromed
*  human rights monitor of the civilian death toll in Gaza 46.5% are children. Compare that again
*  in Gaza nearly half of those killed among civilians are children compared to 6% in Ukraine, 8.6%
*  in Iraq and 10% in the first two years of the Syrian war. So we know a number of things the
*  violent civilian death rate is far worse in Gaza than in Syria and older civilians a far higher
*  proportion of those killed are children. Now to continue they mention Myanmar and indeed the
*  Rohingya genocide is a one of the great obscenities of our time. Over 24,000 believe murdered by the
*  Myanmar military in the period after August 2017. Now again crucial point, Myanmar is not a western
*  ally which is armed and backed by our governments. In fact it's subjected to economic sanctions and
*  an armed embargo. Correctly so. Now what would the request for our protest be on Myanmar? What
*  would the demands be? Again it's a crucial point. Now Yemen is an excellent example actually and it
*  is itself instructive. The Saudi war in Yemen is something I've been passionate about raising
*  and I'm not saying this to blow my trumpet I think it's a damn indictment of the rest of the
*  media but no British columnist has written more about the war in Yemen than myself. I've written
*  several columns about Yemen over the years. No one can credibly accuse me of not caring about
*  Yemen. I filmed a documentary about the war in Yemen. I went to a refugee camp, a Yemeni
*  refugee camp, it had a huge impact on me. It's the only time I've cried on camera. Now this is a war
*  prosecuted by brutal dictatorship western support. Saudi Arabia suppresses every basic democratic
*  freedom, it strips women of basic rights, beheads dissidents and gay people, exports extremism,
*  chops up journalists even and has prosecuted a murderous war against Yemen. It is armed and
*  backed by the west and therefore is an excellent point to raise. Again it brings into sharp focus
*  the sheer horror of Gaza. An estimated 15 000 Yemeni civilians are estimated to have been killed
*  by direct military action, most because of airstrikes by the western backed and armed
*  Saudi coalition over a period of six years. Again 15 000 Yemeni civilians suffering violent deaths
*  should be considered an intolerably high and outrageous tally. That's why I've written so much
*  about it. Now Yemen's average wartime population was over 30 million, around 14 times bigger than
*  Gaza's population. So a similar number of Yemeni civilians have been killed by airstrikes as in
*  Gaza but one over a period of six years not six weeks, a B with a population 14 times bigger.
*  We should also note that while the Saudi regime is responsible for some deaths there's multiple
*  armed actors in this war. The internationally recognized government, the Houthi movement
*  which is backed by Iran and is responsible for atrocities and war crimes as well.
*  Various local non-aligned forces, Al Qaeda, I mean it really is unfortunately a violent free-for-all.
*  So the direct the total death toll in Yemen is the direct responsibility of different forces.
*  So even the total civilian death toll can't be adequately and accurately compared with those
*  killed directly by Israeli military forces in Gaza. Now if the equivalent number of Yemenis
*  were killed as Palestinians now have been killed in Gaza that would mean over 216 000 Yemeni
*  civilians being killed. But here's where things get really grim because it is estimated that
*  Yemen's actual total death toll is closer to 377 000 over many years it must be said but that is a
*  brutal obviously figure. Now Gaza's civilian death rate over a few weeks is already half of that
*  if you adjust for population though an unknown proportion of the total I've just mentioned in
*  Yemen are combatants. Now the point is that in Yemen many of these deaths are attributable not
*  to weapons but to for example being denied access to health care to clean water and to food and
*  here's where it gets really bleak. It's likely that the bulk of those who will end up dying in Gaza
*  who will have premature deaths will not be because of bombs or missiles it will be the
*  collapse of the health care system the spread of illnesses avoidable illnesses the lack of clean
*  water food of housing could go on. So you see the horror currently unfolding in Gaza is of a unique
*  and specific scale it is significantly much much worse than we can see in these other examples
*  that I've provided and that's when you link to the rhetoric of the Israeli government and their
*  intent you can see why so many scholars of genocide are saying that genocide is unfolding in Gaza it's
*  not just about the death tally it's not even contingent on that but when you link it together
*  with intent and the rest you can see what we are fighting against. This is one of the great
*  horrors of our age and it will only continue to get worse because many of the people in that final
*  death toll whatever that final death toll is and I don't even want to think about it
*  most of them are probably still alive and that's the problem a significant proportion of Gaza's
*  population will be wiped out and it will be one of the bloodiest examples of our age of what we
*  describe as warfare though in my view it's too asymmetric a conflict to describe it as such
*  it is a massacre. Please like and subscribe do keep the show on the road on patreon.com
