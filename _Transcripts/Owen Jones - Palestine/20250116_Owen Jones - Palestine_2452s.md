# Palestinian Analyst EXPOSES Truth About Gaza Ceasefire - w/. Mouin Rabbani
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98)
*  Now a ceasefire has been announced to begin on Sunday in Gaza. What does that mean in practice? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=0.0s)]
*  And how much credit should Donald Trump get? For example, that's being discussed. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=7.04s)]
*  Does this show that Joe Biden, because of used leverage a long time ago, is it respite, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=12.64s)]
*  but only for a limited time? Could this mean an escalation of the genocide yet to come? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=18.8s)]
*  And we've got lots to talk about. And it's brilliant to be joined by the brilliant [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=23.28s)]
*  Mourinho-Robani. Every time we have you on, huge amounts of love and praise for your incredible, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=25.92s)]
*  incisive analysis. Mourinho is a Dutch Canadian, sorry, Dutch Canadian, not at all, a Dutch [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=32.32s)]
*  Palestinian analyst, journalist, and analyst, author, and the editor of Jadaliyah. It's great to see you. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  Great to be with you, Owen. And if I could just start by expressing my extraordinary respect and [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=46.24s)]
*  appreciation for your brilliant investigation of the BBC that was published on DropSite News [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=52.08s)]
*  not long ago. I think it's something everyone should read to get a better understanding [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=59.92s)]
*  of how the corporate or mainstream media has operated or failed to operate during this [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  genocide. And again, I think it shows that, as with other institutions, the problem is not so much [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=71.68s)]
*  with journalists who, as a rule, are committed professionals with basic moral standards and [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=78.88s)]
*  decency and so on. But the problem is to be found in management, and particularly senior management. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=84.88s)]
*  Well, a high praise from you in particular. And I just want to pay tribute to the journalists. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=92.16s)]
*  As you say, they did come forward. They'd be fighting a battle. They struggle between, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  do we stay and fight, or is this, as you identify, systemic problem just too much to overcome? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  And they've done their best in very difficult circumstances. And I think history will judge [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=107.67999999999999s)]
*  them well in a way. I'm afraid lots of journalists who know this is a terrible evil have failed to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  step up and do anything. So kudos to them. And I wish there were more journalists like them. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=118.64s)]
*  I just want to start. I mean, we've just seen these, the ceasefire has been announced, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=124.88s)]
*  and it's difficult not to be moved by the footage of Palestinians just joyous in Gaza, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  because they've suffered so much, such a long period of time in apocalyptic circumstances that [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=136.56s)]
*  I think are beyond the imagination really of the vast majority of people. You can only a fraction [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=142.08s)]
*  really understand what they've gone through. People, sorry, those many people listening and [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=147.76s)]
*  watching this. What do you think? Is this, you know, do we at least celebrate the respite, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=153.2s)]
*  at least? Do you think it is a respite? Sorry, I should say, of course, Gaza's been pummelled [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=158.16s)]
*  at the moment, the ceasefire, to begin something. Well, I think it's important to distinguish [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=162.56s)]
*  between three separate elements. The first is the ceasefire agreement, or rather, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=167.28s)]
*  ceasefire and captive and hostage exchange agreement. And that was formally announced [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=173.68s)]
*  yesterday, Wednesday. The second is getting from that agreement to its actual implementation. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  And here we are experiencing last-minute snags that relate to Israel's difficulties in formally [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=188.23999999999998s)]
*  endorsing the agreement that it has already agreed to. And this is a combination of kind of the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=197.84s)]
*  typical drama that one expects from Israeli leadership whenever they have to admit to anything, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=204.48s)]
*  and some coalition difficulties. And of course, trying to say that the issue here is that Hamas is [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=212.08s)]
*  trying to change the terms of the agreement, which is absolute nonsense. And then the third is that [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=220.16000000000003s)]
*  this is not a comprehensive agreement in the sense that it lays out a series of steps that the various [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=228.88000000000002s)]
*  parties will take upon its coming into force that will immediately result in a cessation of [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=237.36s)]
*  hostilities, comprehensive exchange of captives and hostages, and so on. But rather, it is a [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=242.88000000000002s)]
*  phase deal in which the second and third stages remain to be negotiated during the implementation [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=248.32000000000002s)]
*  of the first stage. So that's a kind of long way of saying there's a lot that can still go wrong. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=256.72s)]
*  There's a lot that probably will go wrong. But nevertheless, the mere existence of this agreement, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=263.52s)]
*  I think, represents a genuine milestone. It may prove difficult to return once again to full-scale [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=269.44s)]
*  genocidal campaign. But even if only the first stage is implemented over the course of 42 days, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=278.15999999999997s)]
*  given what the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have gone through, which really is beyond words, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=288.16s)]
*  and I suspect we'll learn a lot more if and when foreign journalists are able to enter the Gaza [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=294.40000000000003s)]
*  Strip as well and basically corroborate everything that we've been shown and told by Palestinian [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=303.12s)]
*  journalists in the Gaza Strip over the past 15 months. I mean, even a day's respite, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=309.76000000000005s)]
*  I think, would be significant at this stage. But I would say we now have an opportunity [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=317.12s)]
*  to bring this to an end. Of course, it doesn't address issues of accountability of the underlying [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=324.8s)]
*  political questions and crisis and so on. But when you're subjected to genocide for the better part [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=332.32s)]
*  of a year and a half, even just bringing that to an end without addressing anything else is a [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=340.4s)]
*  fundamentally significant and critical achievement. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=349.03999999999996s)]
*  With this announcement, Joe Biden took to the airwaves, to the press conference, and he declared, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=355.76s)]
*  this is the deal that I put forward last spring, as if that was somehow to be celebrated rather [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=361.91999999999996s)]
*  than actually incriminating. I mean, what do you think of him saying that? He's saying, well, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=369.68s)]
*  trying to take credit for it on the basis that this is his deal, which he clearly has failed to [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=375.44s)]
*  use any leverage to secure. Well, I was a little surprised that Biden is claiming that this is the [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=380.48s)]
*  deal that he presented over half a year ago and that it is only this week that it has finally [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=387.44s)]
*  been concluded. I mean, it's an inadvertent but massive admission of impotence and incompetence, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=396.56s)]
*  particularly if we recall what Biden said at the time in late May of 2024. He didn't say, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=405.36s)]
*  this is an American proposal which is being presented to the Israelis and the Palestinians. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=414.32s)]
*  He said, I am now presenting a proposal that has been formulated by Israeli Prime Minister [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=420.72s)]
*  Netanyahu and that has already been endorsed by the Israelis. In that context, the only missing [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=428.96s)]
*  element was consent or agreement by Hamas to what, according to Biden, was an Israeli proposal being [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=437.92s)]
*  presented by the Americans. Well, that agreement came at the beginning of July of last year, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=449.44s)]
*  but it was only in January of this year that an agreement was announced. And the Israeli journalist [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=457.28s)]
*  Ronan Bergman had a long piece in the leading Israeli newspaper, Yadot Aharonot yesterday, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=464.72s)]
*  in which he said you would need an industrial strength microscope to recognize any distinctions [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=473.6s)]
*  between what Biden proposed in May and what was agreed in January and makes it very clear [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=483.92s)]
*  that Hamas was being very flexible during these negotiations. And I think the agreement yesterday [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=491.04s)]
*  shows that they've moved significantly from their initial positions. Whereas Israel has had to [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=497.36s)]
*  backtrack on all the additions and amendments and changes that it tried to make to the agreement [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=506.0s)]
*  after it presented it to the Americans. So basically, as people have been saying since [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=511.28000000000003s)]
*  October of 2023, the only missing element in bringing an end to this was an American phone [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=517.92s)]
*  call to the Israelis. And that didn't come until January of this year. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=524.88s)]
*  So there's been a lot of debate and discussion because, you know, the presidential election in [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=531.04s)]
*  the US was something which created a lot of very heated emotions amongst those who are vigorously [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=536.08s)]
*  opposed to Israel's genocide about what they should do. Not least because it was a democratic [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=543.84s)]
*  administration which has armed and facilitated this from the beginning. And at the same time, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=549.68s)]
*  you have Donald Trump, who we know his position in his associations, and the people he's appointed [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=555.52s)]
*  or sorry nominated for his administration are kind of pro-Israel fanatics. So a lot of people [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=562.3199999999999s)]
*  now, some people are going, well, see actually, you know, the idea that we vote for the Democrats [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=568.4799999999999s)]
*  and actually that's the best, the lesser evil and that's the way of getting a deal. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=573.8399999999999s)]
*  Look at this and go, well, actually, Donald Trump, in the report, played a pivotal role [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=579.28s)]
*  in using pressure. What do you think of that? What's your assessment? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=584.56s)]
*  The question that needs to be asked is why is Israel now accepting something that it has [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=588.64s)]
*  consistently rejected for over half a year? And there are two explanations. There's one that's [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=596.3199999999999s)]
*  put forward by Israeli analysts like Mayra Zonshine of International Crisis Group and [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=604.08s)]
*  Marin Rappaport, who are very well informed, I should add. And what they're basically arguing [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=610.24s)]
*  is that things have fundamentally changed from the Israeli leadership's perspective during the [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=616.8000000000001s)]
*  past six months. That Israel's successes against Hezbollah, its attacks on Iran, its elimination of [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=623.0400000000001s)]
*  Yahya Senwar and other Hamas leaders, and the overthrow of the Assad regime in Syria, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=631.2s)]
*  created the political conditions that allowed Israel's leadership to declare victory and go [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=640.48s)]
*  home, but that for primarily domestic political reasons, Israel is presenting itself as having [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=647.9200000000001s)]
*  been forced to accept something against its will by the incoming Trump administration. I don't want [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=656.16s)]
*  to be entirely dismissive of that perspective because, again, these are generally very well [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=662.7199999999999s)]
*  informed analysts. But having said that, why did it take so long and what changed during the past [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=669.6s)]
*  month? Well, in my view, the crucial factor here was an unambiguous message from the incoming Trump [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=678.56s)]
*  administration to the Israeli leadership that we don't care about your domestic coalition difficulties. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=685.84s)]
*  President-elect Trump is entering the White House on January 20th. He does not want to deal [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=697.12s)]
*  with a Middle East crisis on the day that his presidency begins. And, you know, given that this [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=704.0s)]
*  is happening while flags are flying at half mast for recently deceased President Jimmy Carter, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=711.84s)]
*  Trump absolutely does not want to deal with a Middle East crisis that includes American hostages [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=718.72s)]
*  as he begins his second term in office. So here is the deal. You're going to accept it or else. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=725.12s)]
*  And that, I think, is 80% plus of the explanation. And I think Netanyahu then looked at these [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=733.12s)]
*  realities. He understands that Trump is someone who has a very personal approach to foreign [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=741.76s)]
*  relations. He knows better than to get on Trump's bad side on day one and probably also believes [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=747.2s)]
*  that he can once again play Trump the way he did during his first term and perhaps after the first [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=753.68s)]
*  stage of this agreement, find a way to resume the war. Who knows? You know, one can also [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=762.72s)]
*  make up all kinds of conspiracy theories that this is all a ruse and there's actually an [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=768.8s)]
*  agreement between Biden, Trump, and Netanyahu to use this as camouflage to attack Iran and whatnot. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=775.8399999999999s)]
*  I don't think so. I think, you know, unlike Biden, who has a passionate attachment to Israel and has [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=781.68s)]
*  been very deeply invested in all things Israel from the very outset of his career, Trump, you know, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=790.3199999999999s)]
*  he may have his preferences, but at the end of the day, he doesn't give a damn about Israelis, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=796.88s)]
*  Palestinians, Iranians, Saudis, or anyone else. He only cares about Donald, John, Trump. And [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=801.12s)]
*  he's acting that way. I mean, if we look at what Netanyahu is getting out of it, I mean, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=809.68s)]
*  lifting all sanctions on Israeli extremists, settlers, spyware companies. And I mean, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=817.36s)]
*  what's been suggested, I mean, is, I mean, that was the secretary, the nominated, the appointed [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=822.8s)]
*  secretary of state, sorry, I should say Marco Rubio talking about this. It's also believed, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=828.8s)]
*  you know, the West Bank, maybe a carp launch for land thefts. And actually, you know, we know that [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=834.16s)]
*  for the Israeli state, the real prize is the West Bank. I mean, that's why they militarily disengaged [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=840.9599999999999s)]
*  from Gaza in the first place, wasn't it? You know, it was because, you know, let's just, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=846.24s)]
*  we'll take the West Bank does. I mean, do you think that's what this is? I mean, the, you know, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=850.96s)]
*  it's kind of, well, the problem here is that there are all kinds of reports, but very few [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=855.04s)]
*  confirmed facts. And the other question we need to ask is, what would be different if the steal [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=863.76s)]
*  wasn't reached? I mean, if you look at the past four years, Israeli land theft in the West Bank [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=870.24s)]
*  has reached unprecedented size and scale with zero consequences, except for, you know, a few [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=876.24s)]
*  settlers and settler organizations who can be counted on the fingers of an amputated hand being [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=883.76s)]
*  sanctioned by the U.S. and then the EU. I mean, what I do find interesting is if, if we go back [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=889.2s)]
*  a few months to the ceasefire that was concluded in Lebanon, apparently, Israel insisted that [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=896.16s)]
*  France had to make a clear statement against the International Criminal Court in order [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=905.12s)]
*  to be permitted to be part of this agreement. And at the time, French President Emmanuel Macron came [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=910.4s)]
*  out and made some noises to the effect that Netanyahu would not be accepted, would not be [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=915.12s)]
*  arrested on French territory or something to that effect. Now in the past week, we've had the Polish [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=922.48s)]
*  prime minister and now the Italian government making similar noises. And it would be interesting [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=928.5600000000001s)]
*  to learn what, if any commitments, the incoming Trump administration has made to the Israeli [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=934.56s)]
*  government basically about consigning the International Criminal Court to the dustbin of [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=941.5999999999999s)]
*  history. As far as these other issues that are concerned that you raise, whether it's the West [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=947.68s)]
*  Bank, Iran, you know, the additional Syrian territory that's occupied now by Israel or pushing [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=952.88s)]
*  more energetically for Saudi Israeli normalization. I haven't seen anything concrete. It's entirely [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=960.8s)]
*  plausible that there were informal arrangements or commitments from the White House to Israel in the [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=969.1999999999999s)]
*  context of this agreement. But having said that, and I do believe that for Trump, it was a very [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=977.8399999999999s)]
*  simple calculation, no crisis on January 20th and all other issues will be dealt with subsequently. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=986.24s)]
*  Because isn't the, you know, the big prize would be from Trump's perspective, if you look at Trump [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=993.44s)]
*  social, where he lauders deal is, he talks about getting the hostages home. Yes. So as soon as that, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=998.88s)]
*  you know, if that happens, we get to the stage where we're talking about Israeli hostages, people [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1006.8s)]
*  should also of course be talking about Palestinian hostages, people who are detained without charge, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1010.88s)]
*  including children under the most barbaric circumstances with the crime of war, crime [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1015.92s)]
*  against humanity and forced disappearance. But, you know, the Israeli hostages who'd be taken back [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1020.64s)]
*  and of course should be returned to their loved ones. That as soon as the last hostage goes back, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1025.2s)]
*  then would Trump be, you know, in theory, just relaxed about now and, you know, he just [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1031.84s)]
*  wants him back in and just, I mean, blowing up what, but carrying on the genocide? Well, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1036.72s)]
*  that may well be the case, but that's also why, you know, when Israel insisted on this being a [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1042.48s)]
*  phased or staged deal, that not all captives and hostages will be released during the first phase. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1050.9599999999998s)]
*  I should also point out that there are a number of hostages and captives, I'm not sure if they're [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1060.56s)]
*  exact numbers, but I think it's in the single digits, who are US citizens and not only Israeli [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1067.52s)]
*  citizens. And clearly Trump's priority is to ensure that those are released in the first batch. And I [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1073.76s)]
*  think Hamas would also very much like to return them before Trump assumes office on January 20th. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1081.52s)]
*  And, you know, you look at this again from the White House's perspective, you don't want to be [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1092.08s)]
*  Carter, but you do want to be Reagan, you know, with the American hostages being released as you're [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1096.16s)]
*  pledging allegiance to the Constitution or whatever it is those characters do on Inauguration Day. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1103.8400000000001s)]
*  And so that, I think, is really the main issue here. Now, of course, you know, from a Palestinian [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1110.72s)]
*  perspective, Israel was given two options at the very outset, a single exchange in which all Israeli [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1118.64s)]
*  captives and hostages are exchanged for all Palestinian hostages and prisoners, or a phased [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1128.48s)]
*  deal, which also results in all for all. We don't yet have the details. And of course, phases two [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1136.24s)]
*  and three remain to be finalized. But at this stage, it does not appear that Palestinians have [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1143.68s)]
*  achieved that goal of retrieving all Palestinian prisoners and hostages in exchange for releasing [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1150.4s)]
*  all the Israeli captives and hostages. Just in terms of, I mean, where we're at, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1157.3600000000001s)]
*  it was very striking that Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in a throwaway comment, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1166.8799999999999s)]
*  said that Hamas had recruited almost as many ministers as they'd lost. And, you know, from [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1173.6799999999998s)]
*  the very beginning, if you listen to Joe Biden's interviews, when he specifically asked, you know, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1182.08s)]
*  does this need, you know, the war aim is the total elimination of Hamas, he said yes. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1188.72s)]
*  So, you know, that was the, you know, the two war aims were, I mean, it's not a war, but I mean, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1196.4s)]
*  if it's called just in terms of how it's framed, were to retrieve the hostages by military means, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1200.96s)]
*  that's a failure. They killed more hostages than they saved. And obviously, the significant [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1206.4s)]
*  hostage releases were because of a ceasefire and a detainee swap. And then the other is to eliminate [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1210.4s)]
*  Hamas. And obviously, you know, I mean, I just think that itself is, you know, this is the most [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1216.88s)]
*  confessed crime in history. But they've just said, because if the whole rationale for this just mass [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1223.0400000000002s)]
*  slaughter with all the depravity would be, well, you know, the end would be the end of Hamas and [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1229.3600000000001s)]
*  peace and all the rest of it. But if that's then removed, then all you've got left is just mass [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1236.0s)]
*  slaughter for the hell of it, almost. There's no purpose to it. So I just think, what do you think, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1240.5600000000002s)]
*  because I just think it's so extraordinary how you just said it casually. It was like, and it [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1246.48s)]
*  hasn't received the media attention it should have done, which is they've just said that Israel's main [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1250.16s)]
*  so-called war aim has failed. It's null, it's void. Well, I think we need to also go back to October [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1255.68s)]
*  23 and recall that at the time, Israeli as well as US and to a certain extent, European officials as [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1264.56s)]
*  well, were saying there will be no negotiations and there certainly won't be any agreement. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1274.0s)]
*  Israel will achieve its objectives through the application of brute military force. And that's [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1280.72s)]
*  the end of it, that, you know, by the end of November, that had changed with the first [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1287.92s)]
*  agreement. And now the idea that Israel can achieve any of its objectives without an agreement [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1294.32s)]
*  and without negotiations is an illusion. And the other element, of course, was that Hamas would be [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1304.0s)]
*  removed from power by force. And it's telling that what's been revealed so far about the agreement [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1311.76s)]
*  yesterday doesn't mention anything about post-war governance and administration in the Gaza Strip. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1319.76s)]
*  And so there is another Israeli failure. But getting back to Blinken, I think there's two [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1329.28s)]
*  ways to look at his statement. The first is it could be considered a pretext or justification [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1333.92s)]
*  for an Israeli resumption of its military campaign in the Gaza Strip after the first stage [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1341.68s)]
*  on the grounds that, you know, well, there are just as many Palestinian militants as there were [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1346.88s)]
*  in October and Israel needs to eliminate the military threat or whatever. But another one is, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1352.24s)]
*  yes, an inadvertent admission of not only tactical but strategic failure. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1360.0s)]
*  Will Barron I mean, on that, I mean, this is what I guess the [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1366.48s)]
*  national security pick for Donald Trump has suggested, he did an interview with a podcast [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1370.64s)]
*  in which he suggested that this would end, it would have to end with the elimination. He said [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1379.44s)]
*  Hamas must be destroyed and play no role in post-war Gaza. That's of course, Mike Waltz. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1385.36s)]
*  I mean, you kind of think, well, we've had now since October 2023 of the most, you know, I mean, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1392.7199999999998s)]
*  Gaza is a different calling texture, as I keep saying, when looked at from space, it's [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1401.6s)]
*  destroyed. What would, you know, what I mean, that suggests a kind of, it's either bluff or it's just [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1405.84s)]
*  a very disturbing threat. What I mean, what do you think when you hear that you just think it's just, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1415.92s)]
*  what, you know, he said, we'd be clear that Gaza has to be fully demuralized, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1422.56s)]
*  but Hamas has to be destroyed to the point that it cannot reconstitute and that Israel has every [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1426.0s)]
*  right to fully protect itself. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1430.16s)]
*  Well, you know, a lot of people are saying a lot of different things and there's his incoming [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1432.16s)]
*  national security advisor, you know, there's his incoming secretary of state, Marco Rubio, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1439.92s)]
*  who is no less fanatic. Both of them, you know, look like Vienna choir boys compared to his [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1445.28s)]
*  nomination for ambassador to Israel. Mike Huckabee, who is the secretary of state, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1451.44s)]
*  Mike Huckabee, and then you've got others. But, you know, making statements and then actually [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1459.04s)]
*  formulating and implementing the policies to achieve those objectives are two very different [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1467.6s)]
*  things. And the question now, the key question, I think, for the coming year, once Trump is in office, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1474.56s)]
*  is will he simply outsource policy on key issues to those who care most about these issues in [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1482.8000000000002s)]
*  exchange for their blind loyalty? In other words, will he give the pro-Israeli faction and in his [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1493.3600000000001s)]
*  administration free reign to do as it pleases in exchange for its loyalty to his presidency? [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1498.96s)]
*  Or will he actively intervene in the policy process in order to avoid certain crises, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1508.24s)]
*  like, for example, direct US military confrontation with Iran, which would make Iraq look like child's [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1516.24s)]
*  play? Because I think it's important to also recall that Trump has a diverse coalition. You [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1524.0s)]
*  know, there's not only the pro-Israel fanatics and the neocons and the interventionists, but there's [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1529.12s)]
*  also kind of the isolationists and the anti-war constituency that have been alienated by the [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1536.16s)]
*  Democrats and have chosen to either sit out the election or shifted their loyalty to Trump. So, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1545.3600000000001s)]
*  you know, you can, it's quite clear what the direction of travel is, and we have the first [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1552.8s)]
*  Trump administration as a good indication of where the priorities lie. But it's also now a [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1557.76s)]
*  completely different reality in the middle of this. So with someone as erratic and unpredictable [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1564.4s)]
*  as Trump, I think speculation is more difficult than it would be with a rational leader or politician. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1570.24s)]
*  I mean, I am wondering what you think about what danger there is of the mass [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1576.88s)]
*  violent expulsion, ethnic cleansing, from Gaza entirely of the population, because, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1584.24s)]
*  I mean, Gaza at the moment is not a habitable place. I mean, just one statistic, because, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1589.2s)]
*  you know, I think it's just revealing. And this is from a while ago, 83% of all plant life has [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1596.24s)]
*  been destroyed. The hospitals, the healthcare system, violently dismantled over a thousand [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1602.8s)]
*  medics killed, every hospital attacked, most of them no longer workable. People just living in [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1608.88s)]
*  makeshift shelters, having been forced to move often time after time after time again, the rudiments [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1614.96s)]
*  of civilization just aren't there. You know, you can just see, you know, that's not sustainable. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1622.0s)]
*  And you either have a mass rebuilding effort, which just does not seem remotely [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1628.4s)]
*  imaginable. Or you then you could see the kind of almost they try and dress up in humanitarian [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1635.04s)]
*  garbs. Well, you're right, it's not sustainable. We're gonna have to do something about it. We're [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1640.64s)]
*  gonna have to, they're gonna have to go. Well, you spoke of mass forcible expulsion. And earlier, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1645.1200000000001s)]
*  we were talking about Israel's war aims. And it's quite clear that in October of 2023, the forcible, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1650.24s)]
*  mass forcible expulsion of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip was a war aim and had been more or less [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1657.6000000000001s)]
*  explicitly announced by senior Israeli leaders and subsequently embraced by Washington. And you may [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1662.4s)]
*  recall that Secretary of State Antony Blinken went on a tour of the region to try to bring Arab [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1668.16s)]
*  client states on board and to cooperate with this proposal. And he was met with categorical refusal. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1676.4s)]
*  The Carnegie analyst, Yazid Sayed has suggested that in Egypt, its president, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1684.4s)]
*  Abdel Fattah al-Sisi was in principle open to this idea, but was unable to pursue it because of very [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1693.76s)]
*  strong opposition from other power centers in the Egyptian military establishment. So mass forcible [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1701.36s)]
*  expulsion, I think is no longer on the agenda, even in the event of a resumption of Israel's [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1709.36s)]
*  military campaign. But you're entirely correct. The Gaza Strip is unfit for human habitation [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1716.96s)]
*  and is heading in the direction of being unfit even for human survival, unless there are drastic [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1725.6000000000001s)]
*  changes. So if you can't have mass forcible expulsion, well, then you go to a situation [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1732.5600000000002s)]
*  like we've seen in the Mediterranean during the past decade of desperate people getting into [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1738.64s)]
*  fishing boats or rubber dinghies or whatever and trying to make their way to the nearest [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1744.16s)]
*  island or other country. So that, I think, is Israel's preferred scenario for the coming period. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1753.3600000000001s)]
*  Having said that, there's also a precedent here. It's worth recalling that the Gaza Strip did not [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1760.16s)]
*  exist before 1948. The Gaza Strip is a direct product of the Nakba when, during the late 1940s, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1765.2s)]
*  virtually overnight, the population of the Gaza Strip more than tripled from 80,000 to more than [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1773.28s)]
*  240,000, with this huge stream of destitute, penniless, desperate, malnourished refugees coming [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1781.12s)]
*  mainly from southern Palestine. And somehow, despite these abominable conditions, they survived. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1790.6399999999999s)]
*  There was quite a bit of emigration to Gulf states and so on during the 50s and 60s, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1801.12s)]
*  but it was a society that reconstituted itself and to a certain extent also managed to thrive [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1807.1999999999998s)]
*  and develop. So I would certainly not underestimate the extraordinary resourcefulness [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1815.1999999999998s)]
*  of Palestinian society in the Gaza Strip, particularly if, as the society was assisted by [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1823.2s)]
*  UNRWA starting in the late 1940s, if there is a similar international effort in the coming year [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1831.1200000000001s)]
*  or two, the society has a chance to reconstitute itself. Israel will do everything possible [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1839.44s)]
*  to prevent that opportunity. And of course, given all the toxic waste and so on, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1845.68s)]
*  conditions are much more difficult now, but I wouldn't write it off entirely. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1852.08s)]
*  I'll just say a couple of other things. I mean, just in terms of the West Bank, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1857.4399999999998s)]
*  just returning to that point, I mean, in terms of some suggested that annexation might actually [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1861.6799999999998s)]
*  be something not to be embraced, but if it happened, no one could deny that Israel is [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1868.6399999999999s)]
*  an apartheid state. It would just be too blatant. And that opens up opportunities and makes the [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1875.68s)]
*  prospect, for example, of a one state democratic, the idea of it being a secular state where [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1885.3600000000001s)]
*  everyone has equal rights more imaginable. And it's not like they haven't thought about that. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1891.6000000000001s)]
*  That's one of the reasons I think they've held off from annexation anyway. What do you think? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1895.8400000000001s)]
*  What do you think about that question of the West Bank annexation and that question? [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1900.0800000000002s)]
*  Well, I think those who are incapable or unwilling to recognize that Israel today is an apartheid [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1903.76s)]
*  state won't be swayed by anything Israel does in the future. But specifically regarding your [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1914.8s)]
*  question and accepting it for the sake of argument, that would apply if Israel conducted a [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1920.8799999999999s)]
*  comprehensive wholesale annexation of the Gaza Strip. And at least initially, I think that's very [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1929.76s)]
*  unlikely to happen. What we're more likely to see is Israel annexing the settlement blocks, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1936.48s)]
*  the key settlement blocks, or perhaps annexing what's known as Area C in the West Bank, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1943.28s)]
*  which consists of some 60% of the West Bank and kind of keeping the main Palestinian cities, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1950.0s)]
*  at least for the indefinite future, as kind of these isolated, surrounded, ghettoized Palestinian [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1956.88s)]
*  enclaves, Bantustans, if you will, and then make the argument, well, there's a Palestinian authority, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1964.24s)]
*  you know, they have their own administration. So what do you mean apartheid? We're giving them [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1972.72s)]
*  their freedom. I guess, finally, I just want to just think about Joe Biden and his administration. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1978.48s)]
*  Well, indeed. But just in terms of where we're at, actually, and what's happened, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1987.68s)]
*  and give it that broader context. There's a piece in the Lundri V of books last year, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1992.4s)]
*  the show after Gaza. And it recalled the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in the early 1980s, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=1998.4s)]
*  in which Ronald Reagan, the then Republican president, was notoriously so shocked, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2005.5200000000002s)]
*  supposedly. I mean, maybe this is actually real politicking stuff, but let's just go along with [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2010.96s)]
*  it for the sake of it. He certainly did say to the then liquid prime minister, Menekin Begin, [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2015.04s)]
*  that it was a Holocaust, that he's perpetrating, and it must stop. And Begin protested about the [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2019.76s)]
*  word Holocaust, but nonetheless did so. And this young American senator, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2025.6s)]
*  and known as Joe Biden, he emerged and he met Begin. And in Begin's own stunder count of the [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2032.1599999999999s)]
*  meeting, he goes, the senator commended the Israeli war effort and boasted that he would [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2044.8799999999999s)]
*  have gone further, even if it meant killing women and children. Begin himself was taken aback by [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2048.24s)]
*  the words of the future US President Joe Biden. No, sir, he insisted, according to our values, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2052.64s)]
*  it is forbidden to hurt women and children even in war. This is a yardstick of human civilization, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2056.88s)]
*  not to hurt civilians. Well, I mean, Israel was not doing that at the time. And if that's the [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2061.28s)]
*  yardstick, where does that leave Israel today? I guess my point is just, I don't know, more [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2064.96s)]
*  broadly, it's just the, you know, I think when people look, for example, at take Assad, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2069.1200000000003s)]
*  just give Assad as an example, because a lot of people recognize that Assad is a mass murdering [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2075.1200000000003s)]
*  monster, even though he had this slightly, I don't know, he didn't have the demeanor, did he? It's [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2080.7200000000003s)]
*  like the banality, he didn't have that demeanor. And Joe Biden had this folks, you know, a lot of [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2086.32s)]
*  people still, the West can't see itself as the world sees it kind of thing. But I'm just, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2089.6s)]
*  Joe Biden is a figure, you know, who in the mid 1980s stood to Congress and said, you know, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2095.92s)]
*  Israel is the best investment, however many billions that the US has ever had. And if it [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2102.48s)]
*  didn't exist, we'd have to create it. It's this combination of Israel being a crucial strategic [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2106.0s)]
*  asset and Palestinian life having very little worth at all. And there's just been this game [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2113.6s)]
*  since last October, hand drinking occasionally and all the rest of it for domestic political [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2119.2s)]
*  purposes, and to deflect criticism because of the ever declining moral standing of the United [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2125.52s)]
*  States. But I just wouldn't, what just that just Biden is the phenomenon, if you like, and what [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2131.44s)]
*  we've gone through in this period, what, sorry, what the palette, what, you know, what people [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2136.08s)]
*  and guards and so on have gone through. Yes, well, I'd like to make two or three points. First, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2139.3599999999997s)]
*  regarding this anecdote from 1982, it's unclear to what extent this was concocted by Begin for [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2143.84s)]
*  his own purposes, to what extent it's accurate. But what's often left out of the accounts of the [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2151.92s)]
*  phone call between Reagan and Begin is that preceding that Reagan received a phone call from [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2161.28s)]
*  then Saudi Crown Prince Fahd, basically telling Reagan that Israel's onslaught, the fire bombing [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2169.92s)]
*  of Beirut was putting Arab lead, pro-Western Arab leaders in an increasingly difficult position. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2179.36s)]
*  And that was ultimately what more than anything else motivated Reagan to call Begin and tell him [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2188.4s)]
*  it has to come to an end. And it's a fundamental distinction between 1982 and 2023, 25, where here [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2195.44s)]
*  what we've seen from the Arab states and the Arab state system has been absolute and total inertia. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2205.44s)]
*  And it's something that hasn't been discussed enough because I think without understanding [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2212.7200000000003s)]
*  the total inertia and in some cases the act of complicity of Arab states and governments during [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2218.2400000000002s)]
*  this genocide, we can't properly appreciate not only the extent of Israel's actions, but also the [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2225.36s)]
*  depth of U.S. complicity. Because there hasn't been any restraint, their interests haven't felt [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2234.4s)]
*  threatened and so on. So I wanted to make that point. Second one regarding Biden, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2244.7999999999997s)]
*  he does come from this generation of American politicians who, as you indicated, Israel is [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2251.7599999999998s)]
*  seen as a vital strategic asset, very deep racial animosity to Arabs and Palestinians in particular, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2259.2s)]
*  in particular, I think, which is since September 2001, also come layered with an extra dose of [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2269.12s)]
*  Islamophobia. But I think it's very difficult to conceive of any other president, even his [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2279.84s)]
*  immediate predecessor, Trump, who would have been as thoroughly, unconditionally, uncritically [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2289.6800000000003s)]
*  supportive of Israel as Biden has been during the past 15 months, whether it would have been [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2297.6000000000004s)]
*  Reagan, Clinton, Obama, you name it, there would have been, let's say, a threshold, there would [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2305.52s)]
*  have been a limit to the support they would have been prepared to offer Israel for whatever [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2312.1600000000003s)]
*  opportunistic reasons. With Biden, we never reached that point. And it got to the extent [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2319.52s)]
*  of not only absolute and total disdain for international institutions, international legal [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2325.7599999999998s)]
*  institutions, international law, the rules of war and all the rest of it, but also complete and [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2332.96s)]
*  total disdain for US domestic legislation. I mean, the number of times that senior Biden [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAOa-pi_N98&t=2338.0s)]
