# Israeli Spokesman TORN APART On TV - His Lies Completely Fall Apart
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE)
*  Watching this Israeli spokesperson being destroyed on air on mainstream media outlets is cathartic. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=0.0s)]
*  Throughout 20 months of genocide, the vast majority of the western media have allowed the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=7.36s)]
*  Israeli state to lie, to distort, to deflect, to upend reality, to gaslight. Well, in Britain [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=12.48s)]
*  and other European countries, certainly something seems to be suddenly shifting, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=18.8s)]
*  alas, long after Gaza was essentially wiped from the face of the earth. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=23.44s)]
*  The Israeli spokesperson, David Mensah, is British by origin and his political activities [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=29.12s)]
*  in the UK should disturb you, certainly disturb me, I'll come on to that. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=35.36s)]
*  Let's start with this interview on Sky News with the presenter Kamali Melbourne. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=40.16s)]
*  The Israeli army, they issued warning shots in the air and still some of these suspects [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=45.92s)]
*  continued to advance towards the troops in a threatening manner. Still, further fire was [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=52.72s)]
*  directed close to them, but not to them, but they continued their advance. So we know very [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=59.04s)]
*  well about this report, but I must tell you again that we have released verifiable footage [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=65.04s)]
*  of Hamas gunmen themselves firing at Gaza. The footage that you just alluded to from the incident [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=72.16s)]
*  on Sunday is disputed, it was not of the humanitarian foundation. No, I don't agree with [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=80.4s)]
*  you, I don't think it's disputed at all. It's probably disputed by people that want Hamas to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=87.84s)]
*  retain control of aid distribution, but we're not going to have that anymore. Let's talk about this [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  incident on Tuesday, 27 people killed, you say there was a threat, do they have weapons? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  Well, you'll have to ask the IDF for the specifics. I'm asking you, you're here to speak. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=105.68s)]
*  I'll tell you that the IDF is not preventing the arrival of Gazans at humanitarian sites. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=110.4s)]
*  That was not my question David, as you well know, they have weapons. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=115.04s)]
*  It's precisely the opposite, we are encouraging it. Now the warning shots were fired away from [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  the aid distribution point in response to the threat perceived by IDF troops. Now we are [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=123.76s)]
*  facilitating, using this independent operation of this NGO, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=130.16s)]
*  specifically precisely to ensure that aid reaches civilians and not Hamas. There have been many, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=137.2s)]
*  many occasions of Hamas lying to international media and unfortunately international media [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=144.48s)]
*  repeating those lies and that very often leads to dead people. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=150.0s)]
*  I'm putting the questions to you and as you well know in recent weeks we have spoken to Hamas about [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  this, this 27 that were killed, three children were killed, two women, were they a threat as well? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=158.16s)]
*  Well, again, every bit of news which comes out of Hamas, of Gaza, is controlled by the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=163.6s)]
*  terrorist organisation. There have been many, I can read you a whole list. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=170.4s)]
*  So we can't be trusted to what you're saying? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=172.72s)]
*  No, I'm not. I'm saying that you need to verify, do your jobs media. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=174.48s)]
*  We would love to, David, we would love to. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=177.76s)]
*  We are not preventing Gazans from accessing humanitarian aid. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=178.4s)]
*  David, as you know David, and as you and I have spoken about before, we would love to verify this, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=180.32s)]
*  but international journalists are not allowed into Gaza, are they? Why not? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=184.72s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you very, very clearly what the reason is for that. Our priority [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=189.28s)]
*  is getting our hostages out, not skies journalists in. That's our priority, that's what we care about. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=193.6s)]
*  Now, real journalists enter Gaza with the IDF. Hamas journalists, unfortunately, never leave [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=200.4s)]
*  because they work with Hamas and to be fair to those journalists reporting from Gaza, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=206.24s)]
*  you won't be alive very long if you ever do produce any sort of output that is against Hamas, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=211.12s)]
*  because Hamas will kill you. So many so-called journalists in Gaza, and of course we regret [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=217.6s)]
*  any journalists which have been killed, real journalists, but you know Hamas operatives. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=222.4s)]
*  You're distinguishing between real journalists and fake journalists. The point is, David, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=227.12s)]
*  journalists aren't allowed, from international organisations are not allowed into Gaza, are they? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=231.51999999999998s)]
*  And I'm asking you again, why you don't allow them? Why don't the Israeli government allow [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=235.2s)]
*  journalists in? You'll know the charge that's put to the Israeli governments is that they don't [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=239.44s)]
*  want the world to see what's really happening. Again, so there's no shortage of output from [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=243.12s)]
*  Gaza. It's been on the front of our screens for 20 months now, but our priority is getting our [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=248.24s)]
*  hostages out. You're not letting... We want to get our live hostages out, not sending your journalists [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=252.8s)]
*  in. I will remind you that Hamas arrested a BBC journalist about 10 years ago and they held him, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=257.76s)]
*  and he was only released when there was an international outcry and finally Hamas released [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=264.56s)]
*  him. Now that same outcry has not happened for our Israeli people being held hostage for more than [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=270.08s)]
*  600 days now. Our priority is getting our hostages out, not sending your journalists in. David, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=278.56s)]
*  that is entirely misleading. You know that there has been international condemnation of the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=284.32s)]
*  hostages that are still being held. It is untrue for you to make that choice. I'm not talking about [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=289.44s)]
*  condemnation in words. I'm talking about real action. When real pressure is put on Hamas, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=294.32s)]
*  the terror organisation, things happen. Well, as you know, there's a peace process. You know, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=299.68s)]
*  when they get stronger, I'll tell you when they get stronger. There's a ceasefire process that's [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=303.52s)]
*  on the way, that's ongoing as you know, and we'll come onto that in a moment. David Mensah really is [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=306.40000000000003s)]
*  a caricature. You have to wonder if the Israeli state is just giving up trying to convince the [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=311.44s)]
*  British population if that's who they're serving up. Now we should note that in the aid massacres, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=315.44s)]
*  that is Palestinians being massacred as they try and get food for them and their families, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=322.16s)]
*  Israel has lied through its teeth, originally claiming no incidents had taken place before [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=327.52s)]
*  eventually claiming they'd fired warning shots and then they'd fired at some suspects, suspects [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=331.76s)]
*  they refused to identify. No, he's asked if the victims had weapons, that is to probe what legal [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=336.47999999999996s)]
*  justification Israel possibly has for massacring these Palestinians. And then the official Israeli [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=341.52s)]
*  spokesperson says, ask the Israeli military, ask the IDF. He's the Israeli spokesperson. Why would [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=346.79999999999995s)]
*  that be necessary? It's getting useful, isn't it? I'm here to represent the Israeli state and [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=351.36s)]
*  answer all your questions. No, can't ask me that. No, ask someone else. The truth is he clearly knows [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=357.68s)]
*  these are unarmed civilians. Now he brings up the video footage released by the Israeli authorities [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=363.04s)]
*  of a totally separate incident, which was criminal gangs firing at Palestinian civilians, criminal [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  gangs who all the evidence point to are in cahoots with the Israeli occupation. He's accused for [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=374.64s)]
*  banning international journalists, for Israel banning those journalists from entering Gaza, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=379.84s)]
*  is Israel's priority is getting out the hostages. How does that even make any sense? What does one [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=384.32s)]
*  have to do with the other? Why would Israel no longer banning journalists, foreign journalists, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=388.15999999999997s)]
*  obviously there's lots of Palestinian journalists, or there were, except obviously they were slaughtered. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=393.44s)]
*  Why would them no longer banning those foreign journalists entering Gaza interfere with getting [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=398.55999999999995s)]
*  the hostages back? What are you talking about? What's absurd is he claims there's a lack of [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=402.15999999999997s)]
*  attention for the Israeli hostages when their lives have been treated by Western politicians [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=406.24s)]
*  and media outlets as having infinitely more worth than the Palestinian population of Gaza. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=411.12s)]
*  It's also based on a basic fundamental deceitful premise, which is that the Israeli state is focused [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=417.44s)]
*  on getting the hostages back. They've only got a significant hostage releases through ceasefire [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=423.44000000000005s)]
*  agreements and indeed by releasing Palestinian hostages. Israel has killed far more hostages [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=427.68s)]
*  of its own than its rescued by military means. They even shot dead three of their own hostages [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=433.68s)]
*  when they were shirtless, yelling in Hebrew and waving white flags. If Israel wanted to retrieve [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=438.40000000000003s)]
*  their hostages above anything else, they wouldn't have behaved anything like this. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=443.04s)]
*  The reason international journalists are banned is because Israel doesn't want them [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=447.52s)]
*  reporting on Israel's war crimes. It's really straightforward. David meant to count as there's [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=451.6s)]
*  been no shortage of output from Gaza. That's in large part because of the Palestinian journalists [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=456.72s)]
*  who've suffered the biggest massacre of journalists in human history at the hands of you, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=460.64s)]
*  your masters, the Israeli state. Now let's listen to another clip with David Mensah being interviewed [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=465.03999999999996s)]
*  this time on Channel 4 News being interviewed by Krishnan Gurumurthy. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=470.32s)]
*  You have no evidence that that was Hamas or it was at the same incident. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=520.8s)]
*  Okay, that's slightly ridiculous. Sometimes, Krishnan, you actually advocate for Hamas and [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=526.48s)]
*  I must say it's bizarre. No, that's offensive David. You really shouldn't say things like that. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=531.1999999999999s)]
*  It is offensive to Israel. It's just attacking the media. It is offensive to Israel. It's a talking [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=535.92s)]
*  point and it just shows you're avoiding the question. The question is... I'm not avoiding the question. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=539.76s)]
*  This aid operation that you are operating now is ineffective. The UN won worked and you have [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=545.44s)]
*  stopped the UN distributing aid. It was the UN who were distributing aid, not Hamas. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=553.84s)]
*  The opposite is true, Krishnan. They're dead, David. They're not just injuries. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=560.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean there's a pattern here, is the trouble, of you saying things and Israel saying things that [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=565.2s)]
*  turn out later to be untrue and that's clearly what's happening here as well. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=570.24s)]
*  So that is what Hamas wants you to think. We have developed a new system to separate. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=576.64s)]
*  No, it's not the fact. The facts are that seven million meals have been given to hungry Garzons. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=582.72s)]
*  That's the fact. Again, this lie being shamelessly repeated by David Mensah about the video released [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=588.0s)]
*  by Israel of a totally different incident from the aid massacres involving shootings by criminal [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=593.04s)]
*  gangs, which the evidence suggests, rather than Hamas, are allied with Israel. But just listen to [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=598.08s)]
*  the desperation of the talking points. Sometimes you advocate for Hamas. Krishnan Gurumerthy is [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=603.76s)]
*  now Hamas. That's where we're at. The Israeli state has literally adopted a strategy of calling [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=610.4000000000001s)]
*  anyone and anything who doesn't regurgitate their shameless propaganda, Hamas. Who is this convincing [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=615.76s)]
*  anymore? He says it's offensive to Israel. Well, maybe if Israel's feelings don't really hurt, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=623.12s)]
*  they should stop committing genocide and indeed every war crime under the sun. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=628.32s)]
*  He says this is what Hamas want you to think. That's how he responds to incontrovertible facts. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=633.36s)]
*  If you say facts which are just facts but inconvenient to Israel's arguments, then he says, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=637.84s)]
*  well, that's what Hamas wants you to think. It's not the bottle, is it, in the classic sense? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=642.88s)]
*  But I'm glad that Krishnan Gurumerthy points out that Israel keeps saying things which turn out to [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=647.2s)]
*  be untrue. In common parlance, we call those lies, by the way. And indeed, as with the aid massacres, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=652.24s)]
*  Israel's modus operandi has been to lie and lie and lie about the atrocities it commits, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=657.6800000000001s)]
*  with the supine Western media amplifying those lies. And even when in some cases they take those [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=661.92s)]
*  lies apart, it's too late, lacking in prominence, increasingly when attention has moved elsewhere, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=666.72s)]
*  and then divorce and wider coverage. That is, the Western media then carry on treating [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=671.6s)]
*  subsequent Israeli claims as somehow credible, continuing in many cases to frame entire stories [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=675.36s)]
*  around them, acting like that relentless pattern of lying just never happened. But honestly, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=681.36s)]
*  wait till you hear this. They reject the independence investigation. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=688.88s)]
*  And we are not... Listen, when the British Army is accused of doing misdemeanours, there is no [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=691.76s)]
*  independent investigation. There is an internal investigation. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=698.48s)]
*  True wrongs don't make a right. That's what all democracies do. No, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=701.6s)]
*  because it's double standards, Krishnan. That's what you're guilty of. Different rules apply to [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=704.08s)]
*  Israel. Is it because we're Jewish, Krishnan? What do you even say? Is it because we're Jewish, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=710.08s)]
*  Krishnan? Beyond parody. If you were satirising these people, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=720.1600000000001s)]
*  to be very clear, we're talking about the cheerleaders and spokespeople of the Israeli state, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=724.72s)]
*  that's the sort of crap you'd come up with. There's no question the British Army committed [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=730.64s)]
*  war crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq, by the way, and I'd passionately support prosecutions for those [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=734.24s)]
*  who committed those crimes, as well as Tony Blair, who I, like millions of others, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=738.16s)]
*  hold to be a war criminal. I've written about this extensively, Belaway. It's not to belittle [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=741.8399999999999s)]
*  the crimes committed by the British Army, to point out that the Israeli Army committing genocide [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=745.28s)]
*  against the people who's landed and stolen and illegally occupied isn't a category of its own. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=749.4399999999999s)]
*  This is all they have. Everything they say is a demonstrable and provable lie, so they just lash [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=754.64s)]
*  out and claim that anyone even challenging them is Hamas and anti-Semitic. Now, who is David Mensah? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=759.1999999999999s)]
*  You might be curious to find out. This really is grim. David Mensah is the former director of [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=764.48s)]
*  Labour Friends of Israel, which lobbies on behalf of the pro-Israel cause. He worked as a political [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=769.12s)]
*  aide for multiple Labour MPs when Tony Blair was leader of the Labour Party. He's a former Labour [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=774.16s)]
*  councillor. It gets worse, Mensah ran the mayoral campaign of a certain David Lammy. He's now the [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=778.08s)]
*  British Foreign Secretary. People with the worldly of David Mensah are now in government. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=783.52s)]
*  They're running the country. They're the sort of people in charge of the Labour Party. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=788.24s)]
*  Now, I'm glad there's some actual scrutiny emerging of Israeli propagandists in mainstream [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=792.88s)]
*  media outlets, but alas, this is much too late for the people of Gaza. That said, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAMu8SnQwJE&t=797.28s)]
