# BBC HUMILIATED Over Israel Bias - Public Showdown And DEVASTATING New Report - w/. Miqdaad Versi
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME)
*  This is absolutely devastating, both a new report which exposes the BBC's extreme and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=0.0s)]
*  statistically undeniable bias over Israel's genocide and the BBC director of news content, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=6.88s)]
*  Richard Burgess, being utterly humiliated in public over his ignorance about the subject. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=12.4s)]
*  Now, before I show you that, let's talk about this detailed new report from the Centre for [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=18.48s)]
*  Media Monitoring. It's entitled BBC on Guards of Israel, One Story, Double Standards. Now, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=22.48s)]
*  I discussed this report later on in this video with the Centre's executive director, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=28.0s)]
*  Mick D'Adversi, but let's discuss some key findings. The report looked at a 12-month [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=32.56s)]
*  window between 7th October 2023 and 6th October 2024. It looked at 3,873 articles, as well as over [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=37.52s)]
*  32,000 broadcast segments on TV and radio. It found that despite there being 34 times more deaths [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=46.08s)]
*  in Gaza than Israel, and even that is a drastic underestimate because the official figures don't [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=52.8s)]
*  include vast numbers of deaths, so always bear that in mind. But nonetheless, there was an almost [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=56.88s)]
*  equal number of articles profiling personal and humanising stories about specific Palestinian or [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=61.440000000000005s)]
*  Israeli victims. So that means in practice, far more per-victim coverage of Israelis, far, far more. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  Now, BBC article headlines mentioned Palestinian casualties, just twice as many as Israeli [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  casualties. Despite that massive disparity, far, far more Palestinians have been killed. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=80.88s)]
*  Again, far more coverage per Israeli casualty. Indeed, Israeli deaths were mentioned 33 times [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=86.08s)]
*  more across articles and 19 times more across TV and radio when measured on this conservative [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=92.56s)]
*  per-fatality estimate. The use of emotive words is so telling. The word massacre or massacred was [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  applied nearly 18 times more frequently to Israeli victims compared to Palestinian victims in BBC [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=104.24s)]
*  articles. Emotive words like atrocity, slaughter, barbaric, deadly, brutal were used almost four [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=110.96s)]
*  times as much when applied to Israeli victims in articles. 38 interviewees on TV, radio were [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=116.24s)]
*  pressed to condemn Haas' 7th October attacks, but there were zero occasions in which interviewees [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=123.6s)]
*  were pressed to condemn Israeli attacks, despite the latter being far, far more lethal. While the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=129.68s)]
*  7th October attacks were referenced at least 40% of those BBC articles, just 0.5% of articles [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=134.64s)]
*  referenced any historical context in terms of these Israeli occupation settlements and so on. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  Now, I discussed some of these other damning statistics with Mick Dabversie later on, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=147.67999999999998s)]
*  but first, at the launch of this report, Richard Burgess, BBC director of New Content, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=152.48s)]
*  was confronted by the brilliant journalist Peter O'Byrne. Just have a listen of this. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=156.88s)]
*  I don't understand the effects of October 7th without the handle of the record. I fully understand [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=165.2s)]
*  that. You never bothered to tell your viewers and listeners. Now, how Rachel reported it, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  Yo Yo's has reported these Israeli papers, ABC News, United Nations, BBC, I would love to know [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=178.16s)]
*  why you have never reported it. Never mentioned your plants on it. Question number one. Question [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=186.48s)]
*  number two. This report reveals that the BBC has only once in passing mentioned a Dahiya doctrine [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=192.48s)]
*  and cannot understand what is going on in Gaza, has been going on for the last almost two years, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  without knowing Dahiya doctrine is official, Israeli doctrine, which licenses indiscriminate [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=206.16s)]
*  destruction of civilian assets, including people in order, but terrify the other side until it [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=212.72s)]
*  exists. The BBC has never once mentioned, except in passing, why not? It's a grotesque omission, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=218.48s)]
*  I would have thought, but I would love to get your explanation. Remember, I want to give you the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=225.35999999999999s)]
*  fact that to begin with, the BBC scarcely reported the genocidal comments made by the most senior [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=230.72s)]
*  Israeli politicians, including, never apparently according to this report, the Amidep remarks, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=238.88s)]
*  the genocidal remarks of Netanyahu. So you never educated your audience about the genocidal remarks, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=244.64s)]
*  according to this report, on a hundred occasions, you closed down their references to genocide by [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=252.16s)]
*  your guests. This makes you complicit, my dear friends. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=260.08s)]
*  You are part of a new generation of other such as the two immensely grave matters. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=265.52s)]
*  You, the BBC, become complicit in that. That is in mind. I just want to mention one other thing, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=274.96s)]
*  and I can't believe what I'm going to say. This figure of six percent, 170 something journalists [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=283.44s)]
*  murdered by Israel. The BBC doesn't bother to report six percent of them, whereas you [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=291.11999999999995s)]
*  usefully reported 60 percent of the Ukraine journalists. Do you agree with David Blanley that [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=298.23999999999995s)]
*  there are no journalists in Gaza? You were saying you have your own people. Why? I would love to know why you [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=305.59999999999997s)]
*  made the road walking. Because I find it, as a journalist, as a human being actually, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=311.92s)]
*  and now I can ask you, on this pipeline, in one final test, simply the best. We have in Britain [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=317.52000000000004s)]
*  the leading historian of Israel. His name is Havish Trey. You won't have heard of him because you've [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=326.48s)]
*  never got him on your panel. Havish Trey is the leading historian. He's written more [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=331.76s)]
*  authoritative books about the history of Israel than anybody else. Now, he's never been invited. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=337.04s)]
*  Before this meeting, I wrote to Havish Trey. I didn't tell him why. I said, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=343.92s)]
*  have you ever been approached by the BBC to come on our challenge? He said, no, I've been invited by [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=348.56s)]
*  the LZR, but never by the BBC. Now, as you know, Havish Trey is a president. You have all sorts of [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=355.36s)]
*  line of mind to come onto the BBC. I'm not going to make them. We all know who they are, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=364.56s)]
*  despite all this rainy stuff. But you've never invited the one person who more than anybody else [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=369.36s)]
*  in Britain is. Only in Oxford is he emeritus professor of international relations. He's [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=374.8s)]
*  come to Sanatana College, but you've never bothered to invite him. Doesn't that tell us something [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=379.76s)]
*  really kind of weird about the way you're conducting your coverage of this terrible conflict? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=385.44s)]
*  I've got huge admiration for you Peter, and I can hear you in the back and the security. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=404.0s)]
*  Peter hasn't made any good points. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=409.92s)]
*  I do not, and there's no points for you to claim to understand what he has not in view of some of [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=411.6s)]
*  the darker Skype nineilla л caught, I'm sorry. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=418.0s)]
*  Narry me up. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=423.04s)]
*  Your central is the complex, aren't I? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=424.02s)]
*  No, my role is to direct him. I'm not a middle east exit App, just surface. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=429.2s)]
*  I wouldn't play knee-jerk play in doubt. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=436.64s)]
*  So I will send somebody along who does actually, who can thank BBC, rather than who will truly say, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=439.44s)]
*  don't talk about it, don't talk about it, don't talk about it, don't talk about it. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=444.71999999999997s)]
*  You've done that in all of them. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=447.04s)]
*  Absolutely extraordinary. The BBC director of news content clearly does not know the subject [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=450.88s)]
*  at all. Let's talk now to Mick Daversie. I put it to him first, it is a statistical fact that in BBC [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=455.68s)]
*  coverage, Palestinian life does not even have the fraction of the worth of an Israeli life. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=460.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's really disappointing to see that the way that the BBC seems to value different lives [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=465.6s)]
*  seems to come across very differently. And the way we looked at this is we demonstrated that the [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=471.44s)]
*  number of articles that highlight and show Palestinian lives, given the number of deaths [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=478.16s)]
*  that have been, is so, so, so much fewer than the number of articles which mention Israeli casualties. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=484.32000000000005s)]
*  And I think the problem here is that whatever way you cut it, the same outcome comes, right? So [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=491.68s)]
*  it's not just across an article. We also looked at headlines. We also looked at the first paragraph. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=499.12s)]
*  We wanted to say, you know, it may, they may have come back with the argument that at the bottom of [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=504.24s)]
*  each article, they say they started October the 7th, where lots of Israelis have been killed in [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=509.2s)]
*  a massacre that is fair to talk about and important to mention. But even if you get [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=514.48s)]
*  rid of some of these excuses that might explain some of the data, it doesn't work. And so the [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=522.4s)]
*  evidence is unequivocal that the Palestinian lives are talked about and seem to be valued less and [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=530.4s)]
*  written about less. And you can even see that when it comes to journalists, like Palestinian [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=538.48s)]
*  journalists who have been killed are covered significantly less than, for example, Ukrainian [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=543.2s)]
*  journalists who have been killed. And you're like, well, what is it about them that's a problem here? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=550.4000000000001s)]
*  And from our perspective, bringing this out highlights an issue which may or may not be [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=555.12s)]
*  intentional. We're not making any claim on intent. We can't prove that. But we can say this is the [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=562.32s)]
*  reality. So what are you going to do about it? And that's our contribution to this debate. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=567.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's really striking the terms used to describe violence, I think really sum up [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=573.6s)]
*  part of the problem with the overall reporting, which is, as we know, Israeli violence is just [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=580.08s)]
*  exponentially more lethal and more destructive. That's just a fact. But that obviously isn't [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=588.5600000000001s)]
*  how it is presented in BBC reporting. And indeed, we can see that with emotive terms. So [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=594.72s)]
*  terms like atrocity, slaughter, barbaric, deadly, brutal, used almost four times more when describing [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=603.2800000000001s)]
*  Israeli victims, butchered, butchering, or used exclusively for Israeli victims. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=608.5600000000001s)]
*  For example, murdered to use 220 times for actions against Israelis and just once from [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=617.6800000000001s)]
*  Palestinians. I really think this helps get to the crux of the matter, doesn't it? Because it's about [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=622.6400000000001s)]
*  a demarcation of violence. This violence is illegitimate. And this violence actually has [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=627.84s)]
*  a legitimacy attached to it. That it is the violence of us, which is the moral civilized world, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=634.4000000000001s)]
*  which, you know, the moral civilized world, which butchers starving Palestinians with tanks, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=643.36s)]
*  versus the barbarians. And that basically is what's happening here, isn't it? That's essentially [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=650.5600000000001s)]
*  basically what is structuring the way this is looked at and why this isn't seen as one of the [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=656.7199999999999s)]
*  great, you know, presented as one of the great crimes of our age as the BBC would, for example, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=661.36s)]
*  if they're covering the Rwandan genocide. I think that's right. What we see is that [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=665.76s)]
*  that terminology difference, right? Even on Palestinian side, the terms that are used are [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=671.8399999999999s)]
*  died rather than murdered. It's casualties, it's displaced, it's injured, it's struck. These are [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=678.56s)]
*  things being done to them. It's often very passive. In lots of the examples, we see headlines where [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=684.4s)]
*  Israel's just not mentioned. And we've got example after example, where it appears that Israeli [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=690.48s)]
*  action is almost subliminally removed from the equation. So not only do you have the point we [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=697.52s)]
*  talked about earlier, where Palestinian victims are not covered in the same way, not humanized in [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=704.0799999999999s)]
*  the same way. We've also got the actual action of the aggressor not being carefully and thoughtfully [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=709.04s)]
*  and equally demonstrated and actually even hidden at times where the language, as I said, is more [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=714.9599999999999s)]
*  passive about them and is not so emotive. And that emotive point has multiple levels. It's not just [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=719.92s)]
*  the language of individual words like murdered and barbaric, which I think is important. It's [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=725.92s)]
*  also about the stories that are written about the victims. And you see through the statistics how [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=731.5999999999999s)]
*  the number of victims who have had profiles written about them is not even anywhere near [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=738.88s)]
*  proportional to the number of deaths that have happened. And you just wonder why. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=746.96s)]
*  That's not reasonable. It's not fair. Palestinian lives need to be treated equally in our view. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=752.5600000000001s)]
*  And we would think that should be everyone's fault. And why are certain humanized far more [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=758.1600000000001s)]
*  than others? It shouldn't happen in that way. But that's what we're seeing through the evidence. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=764.0s)]
*  I mean, BBC Journalist told me that the internal systemic BBC view was that [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=770.08s)]
*  Israel was Ukraine and Palestine was Russia. That's basically, I know this sounds crude, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=776.8s)]
*  but that's basically the analytic kind of equivalence in terms of how they portray it. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=785.44s)]
*  We can see again, this is this point again about how this is the statistics, what the statistics [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=790.56s)]
*  are actually telling us. So the BBC interviews Palestinians 1,085 times on TV and radio compared [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=794.9599999999999s)]
*  to 2,350 times for Israelis. But I mean, this statistic here really says it all. BBC presenters [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=802.4s)]
*  share the Israeli perspective 11 times more frequently than the Palestinian perspectives, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=809.92s)]
*  even when interviewing neutral third parties like humanitarian organizations. And to flesh those [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=813.8399999999999s)]
*  statistics out, BBC presenters and they put forward, you know, Israel would say this, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=817.68s)]
*  Israel would say that. That's what that means. 2,340 times compared to 217 times for the [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=822.0s)]
*  Palestinians. Again, I mean, this really is, I guess, again, going to the crux of the issue, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=829.4399999999999s)]
*  isn't it? It is Israel is us. It's the West. That's the point. It's seen as a legitimate, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=833.8399999999999s)]
*  you know, this is a Western democracy waging a legitimate campaign. And there are questions [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=840.64s)]
*  we can have about is it proportionate or not, which is, you know, we can agree to disagree. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=846.8s)]
*  That's the analytic analytical framework rather than there is a great crime taking place. What [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=851.8399999999999s)]
*  should be done to stop it, which is how they would talk about, for example, Kosovo back in the day, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=859.04s)]
*  and not belittling what happened in Kosovo, but it was not even a fraction of the crime [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=863.5999999999999s)]
*  being committed here. I think that's the that is exactly the crux of the matter. The question of [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=868.16s)]
*  what is the role of a journalist and how what should journalists do? I think that the BBC tries [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=874.8s)]
*  to say that it's trying to be duly impartial about what it's talking about here. I would [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=881.52s)]
*  argue that firstly, its actual role is to inform the audience about what's happening and to [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=888.88s)]
*  investigate and find the truth rather than just try and show both sides to something. And I think [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=894.0799999999999s)]
*  the problem that we see here is that across every one of those axes, they fail. So firstly, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=900.0s)]
*  I don't think they've been duly impartial. All the evidence suggests that they have shown one side as [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=905.28s)]
*  priority, as fairer as the one that they want to almost prioritize in many ways. And that you can [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=912.48s)]
*  see that through the way that they have responded to Palestinian perspectives and how the individual [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=917.36s)]
*  news readers have continuously challenged guests with the Israel would say this. In a way, they [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=926.08s)]
*  haven't done that with saying Hamas would say this or Palestine would say that in the same way. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=932.48s)]
*  In the way that they've shut down discussions about genocide, over 100 times they've done that. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=937.6800000000001s)]
*  And they've done all of those things without actually investigating the rationale behind it. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=943.76s)]
*  So if it comes to, for example, genocide, the point about the BBC, in my view, is they should [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=949.84s)]
*  be informing the audience why people are saying there's genocide. Okay, fine, you don't have to, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=955.12s)]
*  the BBC doesn't have to make a claim and say this is genocide. The ICJ hasn't made a formal [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=959.84s)]
*  ruling that it is genocide. Okay, I understand that point. But let's try and then understand why [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=964.16s)]
*  are all these human rights organizations, why are these individual people quite senior within [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=969.84s)]
*  the United Nations, why are they all using the term genocide? And the problem is that all of [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=974.4s)]
*  these specific examples of genocidal statements made by leaders within Israel are not even covered [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=980.16s)]
*  on the BBC website. Amulek, right, by Netanyahu, not by Ben Gavir and Smotra, who are of the far [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=989.1999999999999s)]
*  right are known to be even sanctioned by the UK, but by Netanyahu himself. When he says [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=997.12s)]
*  genocidal things that should be reported, understood, contextualized when people are [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1004.24s)]
*  starting to talk about the deaths that happen afterwards, you say, well, guess what, the [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1010.24s)]
*  Prime Minister, the Defense Minister, these are people who have been indicted by the [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1014.64s)]
*  international criminal court, the highest court in the land. Then you've got Ben Gavir and Smotra, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1019.6s)]
*  who are far right and sanctioned by the UK. These are the types of statements they've been saying, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1024.32s)]
*  and this is what they've done. That's why these people are calling it genocide. If you put it [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1029.68s)]
*  like that, those are the facts. Those are informing. That's getting you to the truth. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1034.16s)]
*  And the problem that I see is that, unfortunately, even this idea of trying to both sides, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1038.5600000000002s)]
*  these guys will say this, these guys will say that, they're not even doing that. But they need to go [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1043.3600000000001s)]
*  further and actually lay out, inform the audience about what's actually happening. And for me, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1047.3600000000001s)]
*  that's a major failure. I mean, that point about genocidal intent is, I think, critical. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1053.1200000000001s)]
*  And one of the, well, I mean, there's so many critiques you can throw at the Western media [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1059.6s)]
*  in terms of how they've reported on this. I think it's the biggest scandal in Western [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1064.32s)]
*  journalism modern history. But what they did in terms of lying by mission, which is what this is, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1069.6s)]
*  is fail to report on the statements of genocidal intent and criminal intent made from the very [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1074.6399999999999s)]
*  beginning. One example I always use, because I think it's just so clear-cut. I mean, there's [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1081.12s)]
*  so many things that are clear-cut. But this was the Major General Ghassan Alyan, a senior Israeli [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1085.6s)]
*  general. He was in charge of COGA, the IDF civilian arm, in charge of distributing humanitarian aid, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1092.08s)]
*  in theory, for example. He said, this was posted on the COGA Twitter feed, addressed to Hamas and [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1099.28s)]
*  the residents of Gaza. That's what it was who was addressed to. Hamas became ISIS and the citizens [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1105.6s)]
*  of Gaza are celebrating instead of being horrified. Human beasts are dealt with accordingly. Israel [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1110.3999999999999s)]
*  has imposed a total blockade in Gaza. No electricity, no water, just damage. You want it to hell, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1115.28s)]
*  you will get hell. They didn't report on that statement at all. And there were so many other [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1119.52s)]
*  statements which are not reported at all. Yoav Galant's statement about human animals and the [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1125.36s)]
*  siege, which is mentioned in a handful of articles, not given- I mean, when it's mentioned at the time, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1130.96s)]
*  it's buried. It's not given any legal context at all. And those statements of intent were the best [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1137.6s)]
*  predictors about what Israel should have done. They should have framed the BBC coverage of, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1144.32s)]
*  this is Israel's intent. But what's actually happened, I want to hear your thoughts on this, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1149.28s)]
*  is what the BBC have done. Because they say, look, we have to report on Israel's perspective and put [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1155.2s)]
*  their side of the story. That's true, actually. But this is what they do. They treat those statements [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1161.52s)]
*  as though they're happening in a parallel universe. And instead, they use statements, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1166.8s)]
*  which aren't in Hebrew, written in English, for these broadcasters, which bear no relation [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1172.56s)]
*  to what Israeli leaders and officials are saying to their own people, that are purely for Western [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1178.96s)]
*  audiences, and use those statements instead. Of course, we are not attacking civilians, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1182.72s)]
*  that kind of thing. But that itself, it just sums up the deception, doesn't it? Which is, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1187.2s)]
*  they've erased all those statements of genocidal and criminal intent. They haven't framed their [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1194.4s)]
*  coverage around them at all. And they treat them as though they're just not happening. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1199.6s)]
*  It's just a huge lie by omission. I think that's the reason that the whole chapter in our report [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1205.9199999999998s)]
*  is covering this, because it's so important. For me, it's actually a failure of basic journalism, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1213.52s)]
*  if you don't give the appropriate context. If all these people are talking about genocide, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1222.0s)]
*  and the way you respond is, sorry, genocide is not what's happening here, which is what one [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1226.56s)]
*  BBC reporter said, which is actually not even impartial. It's not like Israel's saying, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1230.96s)]
*  it's actually putting a BBC perspective. But on all the other occasions, when they shut down [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1235.44s)]
*  that debate, when they suppress the discussion there on genocide, that can only be considered [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1241.36s)]
*  to be potentially impartial. If you also did the same the other way around, if you also give context [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1248.1599999999999s)]
*  to why people are saying it's genocide, there needs to be a lot more. What we found quite [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1253.12s)]
*  interesting is that even if you go into one level deeper, questions like the Dahlia Doctrine, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1259.1999999999998s)]
*  the Hannibal Directive, these are really quite important policies. These are things within the [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1267.1999999999998s)]
*  Israeli psyche, if you like, or within the government's way of working. And they're not [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1274.6399999999999s)]
*  reported at all. And you're thinking, well, this is, these are the things that are actually [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1281.92s)]
*  happening on the ground. These are their policies on this topic. Can you not link the two? Like, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1288.24s)]
*  can you not at least put some context and say, look, they're saying they're starving, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1294.16s)]
*  they should starve the people and they're clearly doing it. This is 101 basic journalism, in our [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1297.76s)]
*  view, to highlight the context of what's happening, and to explain and to understand and to then be [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1303.44s)]
*  able to appropriately report. This is really basic stuff and we think they've got this [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1309.84s)]
*  fundamentally wrong. A couple of final things. I mean, one is, you mentioned then about a raft of [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1315.12s)]
*  organisations, obviously a consensus really on genocide, but genocide scholars, including Israeli [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1322.8s)]
*  scholars on genocide, like Professor Omar Bartov, for example, Razigal. That's happened all the way [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1327.9199999999998s)]
*  through. And this mentioned the term war crimes in relation to Israeli violence against Palestinians, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1332.0s)]
*  as mentioned only 121 BBC articles, 3%. It's been noted that as a rule, and this is in the report, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1338.96s)]
*  Hamas-run health ministry has been used consistently, that is used to discredit the [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1348.56s)]
*  statistics about death when actually all the evidence shows it's a massive underestimate. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1354.4s)]
*  I mean, this just shows what I'm saying now will sound almost utopian, it shouldn't be utopian, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1358.88s)]
*  about the BBC. They should, as those sorts of rules, Benjamin Netanyahu, who is subject to an [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1362.4s)]
*  arrest warrant for war crimes and crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1370.96s)]
*  if the BBC is going to go along the establishment, like a signatory to the International Criminal [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1375.92s)]
*  Court, whose chief prosecutor is a British lawyer, but do you see what I mean? It's almost like you [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1381.8400000000001s)]
*  say that, and it's just the very least they should be doing. The Israeli leader is subject [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1386.8s)]
*  to an arrest warrant for war crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1394.96s)]
*  but that is not mentioned almost at all. It's as though it never happened. It's only in specific [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1401.04s)]
*  articles about the ICC. And it's more than that. When Trump meets Netanyahu, we could frame this as, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1405.84s)]
*  and it would be a factual statement, Trump is meeting a person who is indicted by the [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1412.64s)]
*  International Criminal Court. That is the reality, that's the statement, but that's not mentioned. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1416.5600000000002s)]
*  It's a consistent challenge. This idea of war crimes, if you look at Russia, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1422.0s)]
*  our stats show that Russia's mentioned as a perpetrator of war crimes almost three times [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1429.3600000000001s)]
*  as often as Israel's mentioned as a perpetrator. The war crime basis is very similar, but what you [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1434.8000000000002s)]
*  do, and the way this comes out so powerfully, is that when you're providing rationale for why [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1442.0s)]
*  is Israel doing what it's doing, it does that in 75% of articles. The BBC provides that rationale [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1448.24s)]
*  that Israel says, this is why we're doing what we're doing. But when Russia's doing what it's [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1455.2s)]
*  doing in Ukraine, only 17% of the time is that rationale provided. So what we're seeing is [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1458.8s)]
*  it's fundamentally unfair and unreasonable. If you want to give context, if you want to say Hamas [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1465.52s)]
*  run health ministry rather than Gaza run health ministry, which is what they use everywhere, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1471.6000000000001s)]
*  then at least at the very minimum say, but the Israelis, everybody else kind of agrees with all [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1476.08s)]
*  these figures as well. You can't minimize these figures of the deaths that have happened, which [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1483.52s)]
*  is what Gaza run health ministry does, without also laying out and sharing the fact that Israel [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1489.68s)]
*  itself believes that the tens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed. And so the figures [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1496.64s)]
*  are not really where there is a difference of opinion. They may have a different view on who [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1502.4s)]
*  they've killed. That's a different question, but that's not what the Gaza run health ministry [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1506.72s)]
*  moniker is trying to do. It's trying to diminish the number of deaths and it's trying to change [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1512.88s)]
*  the argument. And I think we need to get back to the real point here, which is Israel is conducting [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1517.1200000000001s)]
*  a genocide here. It needs to be held to account. And media outlets need to reflect the reality, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1521.44s)]
*  report the truth, find out what's going on and do their own investigation, which they have done in [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1527.28s)]
*  certain places. There has been some good reporting, but as a whole systemically, this is a real [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1532.24s)]
*  problem. And the report we've done by the Center for Media Monitoring showcases this explicitly. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1537.76s)]
*  Exactly. And you're right. I mean, the whole reporting, again, the framework is basically [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1543.8400000000001s)]
*  is this proportionate or not? As though, you know, you would describe a genocide is this a [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1549.28s)]
*  proportionate response? I mean, just finally that point with Russia just really sums it up. You're [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1553.68s)]
*  absolutely right. I mean, we can see there the rationale you mentioned. I thought a kind of [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1558.48s)]
*  absurd, well, I mean, it's beyond deranged this when the massacre of 16 paramedics and first [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1565.12s)]
*  responders who were thrown in a mass grave, which Israel lied through their teeth about. And the [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1571.52s)]
*  BBC, despite the fact that we know Israel has lied over and over and over again, that's just a fact. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1575.52s)]
*  And actually, occasionally, you know, mainstream outlets have actually belatedly rebutted and [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1581.92s)]
*  taken apart many of the deceitful claims made by Israel. You still got, including that case, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1586.08s)]
*  even when the evidence came out, they kept saying this is the Israeli perspective. For example, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1593.28s)]
*  and this for me was an idea. When they put forward as a credible claim by Israel, that the reason [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1597.36s)]
*  they had buried the bodies of the paramedics they'd massacred is to prevent them from being [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1604.8s)]
*  eaten by wild animals. Now, I mean, the point is with Russia, they don't do this. They don't treat [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1610.08s)]
*  Russian claims as credible. And the statistics here, as you just said, prove that they do not [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1617.12s)]
*  treat Russian claims as credible because they treat them as propaganda. They treat them basically as [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1624.32s)]
*  we don't believe these are credible or honest. So therefore, we can't treat them as a credible source. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1631.1999999999998s)]
*  And I think that's exactly what they should be. They need to be investigating propaganda, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1636.7199999999998s)]
*  which comes out again and again and again across multiple stories across the whole year. Every [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1641.52s)]
*  single time there is something that happens. You almost see the same playbook happening. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1647.28s)]
*  No, this never happened. Okay, actually it did. Okay, well it happened, but it happened somewhere [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1651.28s)]
*  else and it wasn't our responsibility. Hamas was the one who shot that person. But then they find [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1656.32s)]
*  out actually that was not the case. But it wasn't us who did it. It was one person by themselves. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1660.4s)]
*  No, this is a systemic problem within the Israeli army where they are ordered to do these types of [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1663.6000000000001s)]
*  activities. These sort of attack on civilians. It doesn't just happen. These are deliberate. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1670.0s)]
*  There are multiple examples of deliberate attacks, unequivocally deliberate attacks, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1675.2800000000002s)]
*  where a sniper goes and hits a young child. These are not exceptions. This is the rule. This happens [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1679.92s)]
*  again and again and again. And there's so much evidence from this, from Western media to Eastern [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1688.08s)]
*  media to every type of media out there, which is understood and investigated. So I agree. I think [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1693.04s)]
*  the problem of treating Israel as just someone who is a fair interlocutor rather than as someone who [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1698.56s)]
*  is trying to pump out propaganda is a failure of basic journalism. You need to challenge and [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1705.28s)]
*  challenge robustly. And the point, if you're going to put the Israeli perspective all the time, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1711.28s)]
*  how often do you see an Israeli who comes on who gets challenged with the Hamas perspective on [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1717.04s)]
*  these issues? It never happens. And I'm not saying you necessarily should. But the perspective that [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1722.32s)]
*  gets put against them is the United Nations. So that's fine. But the neutral party should not be [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1727.1999999999998s)]
*  the other side. The neutral party should be the believed story. And I think there's a problem here. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1734.1599999999999s)]
*  If you've got independent arbiters here, whether it's if you don't trust the Palestinian Germans, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1740.48s)]
*  which is outrageous, by the way, they should. But if they don't trust the Palestinians on the [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1744.4s)]
*  ground or Palestinian journalists, well, at least trust your own British doctors who've gone there. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1747.8400000000001s)]
*  At least trust the videos you see of what's happening on the ground. At least trust the [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1753.52s)]
*  Israeli soldiers who have come out and said this is what's happening. Instead, you have Israeli [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1759.8400000000001s)]
*  media, which showcases a lot of this information again and again and again, really quite well [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1764.8000000000002s)]
*  sometimes, to be honest, and Western media basically ignoring it. And it's fundamentally [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1770.8s)]
*  problematic. And if you're trying to pretend or claim impartiality, the evidence here suggests [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1776.96s)]
*  that there is no basis for that claim. So brilliant, hugely important report, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1783.2s)]
*  which exposes, as I said, this element, the BBC's contribution to the biggest scandal [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1789.68s)]
*  of Western journalism in our time. Thank you so much, Alissi. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1795.52s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1799.2s)]
*  So there we have it. Overwhelming, devastating evidence that the BBC in practice has played an [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1801.04s)]
*  indefensible role in this genocide. These statistics speak for themselves. They can't be denied. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=052e22XabME&t=1805.28s)]
