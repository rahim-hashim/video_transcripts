# Instagram SUSPENDED Me Over Gaza - Censorship Spirals Out Of Control
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc)
*  Last week, Instagram shut down my account over Palestine. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=0.0s)]
*  That's clearly what happened, as I'll explain, and there was a wider point here about censorship [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=3.2s)]
*  by meta of pro-Palestinian content on both Instagram and Facebook, particularly I would note with [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=7.76s)]
*  Palestinians being targeted. I'm using my own experience as something of a hook. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  I was trying to use my Instagram on my phone, as you do, scrolling, looking at what was going on, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=17.28s)]
*  and it just stopped working. You know, you try to get it up to date, and instead I was just getting [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=22.32s)]
*  freezing and an error message. So I logged into my email, and in big red letters it read, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=26.799999999999997s)]
*  Take action or lose access to Owen Jones' journal. That's my handle. It went on to say, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=31.84s)]
*  Hi Owen Jones' journal, your Instagram account has been suspended. This is because your account or [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=38.8s)]
*  activity on it doesn't follow our community standards on dangerous individuals and organisations. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=42.959999999999994s)]
*  If you think that we made a mistake, you have until the 8th of October 2025 to appeal. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=48.64s)]
*  Now then I went on to submit an appeal. This was, I know, rather ominously phrased when I did that, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=53.36s)]
*  because it said, If we find that your account doesn't follow our community standards, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=61.04s)]
*  it will be permanently disabled and you won't be able to appeal again. So sudden irreversible [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=64.88s)]
*  death, years of building up an Instagram profile, building up a follower base, making contacts with [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  people all over the world, that would all be erased. It didn't actually tell me what content [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=75.2s)]
*  was the problem. But it did say that it was because the suspension, because your account [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=79.28s)]
*  or activity on it doesn't follow our community standards on dangerous individuals and organisations. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=84.08s)]
*  Well, my content is almost exclusively about Palestine, of course, so this would suggest my [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  account had been flagged on the ground so I was judged to support, for example, Hamas, which is [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=95.68s)]
*  obviously a groundless allegation. I clicked on Meta's community standards, which explained this [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=100.4s)]
*  particular policy, and it read, In an effort to prevent and disrupt real world harm, we do not [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=105.36s)]
*  allow organisations or individuals that proclaim a violent mission or are engaged in violence to have [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=110.4s)]
*  a presence on our platforms. We assess these entities based on their behaviour, both online [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=116.88s)]
*  and offline, most significantly their ties to violence. Under this policy, we designate [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=120.88s)]
*  individuals, organisations and networks of people. The IDF obviously would fail that particular [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=125.68s)]
*  policy if it was applied consistently. Now, look, this went on to explain entities which engage in [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  serious offline harm, including organising or advocating for violence against civilians, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=138.4s)]
*  repeatedly dehumanising or advocating for harm against people based on protected characteristics, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  or engaging in systematic criminal operations. It also says, In addition, we do not allow content [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  that glorifies, supports or represents events that Meta designates as violating violent events, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=154.56s)]
*  including terrorist attacks, hate events, multiple victim violence or attempted multiple [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=160.08s)]
*  victim violence, serial murders or hate crimes. Now, obviously, none of this applies to me. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=163.44000000000003s)]
*  What we do know is that pro-Israel activists, hardline Zionists, target those in the pro-Palestinian [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  space who oppose the genocide, who oppose apartheid, who support Palestinian national [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  self-determination. They smear us as being violent or supportive of violence, every accusation, of [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=179.28s)]
*  course, being a confession on their part. I mean, they're literally just rolling around in violence [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=185.2s)]
*  and incitement to violence. Anyway, they report us to Meta in an effort to silence us and to shut us [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  down. In this case, my account was reinstated. It was suggested to me it was an error. Well, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=197.2s)]
*  intriguingly, on the very day that my account was suspended, the as ever brilliant DropSite [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  News published a report entitled, Leaked Data Reveals Massive Israeli Campaign to Remove Pro-Palestinian [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=208.32s)]
*  Posts on Facebook and Instagram. This is what it said. A sweeping crackdown on posts on Instagram [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=214.08s)]
*  and Facebook that are critical of Israel or even vaguely supportive of Palestinians was directly [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=219.76000000000002s)]
*  orchestrated by the government of Israel, according to internal Meta data obtained by DropSite News. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=225.44s)]
*  The data show that Meta has complied with 94% of takedown requests issued by Israel since October [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=230.4s)]
*  7, 2023. That is wild. Israel has been barring Instagram with takedown requests for content, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=236.88000000000002s)]
*  criticizing Israel or just being vaguely supportive of Palestinians. And Meta is [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=242.08s)]
*  overwhelmingly complying with that. DropSite News say that Israel is the biggest originator of [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=247.44000000000003s)]
*  takedown requests globally by far. Strikingly, they say Meta has widened the net of posts it [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=252.16000000000003s)]
*  automatically removes creating, in the words of DSN, what can be called the largest mass censorship [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=257.44s)]
*  operation in modern history. The report finds that what is so unique is that while normally [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=263.12s)]
*  government requests for posts to be taken down focus on content created by their own citizens [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=269.6s)]
*  in their own countries, Israel's online censorship campaign focuses on countries outside of Israel. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=273.76000000000005s)]
*  Furthermore, it notes Meta is trading an AI program and it will in future moderate content [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=279.28000000000003s)]
*  automatically based on this previous behavior, so permanently baking in pro-Israel censorship. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=285.12s)]
*  Now DropSite News know about this because of whistleblowers. They say Israel's requests have [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=290.64000000000004s)]
*  overwhelmingly targeted users in Arab and Muslim majority countries in what's described as a [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=296.08s)]
*  massive effort to silence criticism of Israel. They report the data also show that Meta removed [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=300.72s)]
*  over 90,000 posts to comply with takedown requests submitted by the Israeli government in an average [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=306.32s)]
*  of 30 seconds. Now previously, right towards the beginning of the genocide at the end of December [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=311.44s)]
*  2023, Human Rights Watch released a report finding that, in their words, Meta's policies and practices [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=317.68s)]
*  have been silencing voices in support of Palestine and Palestinian human rights on Instagram and [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=323.28s)]
*  Facebook in a wave of heightened censorship of social media beginning on the 7th of October. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=328.32s)]
*  In those first two months, Human Rights Watch documented over 1,050 takedowns and other [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=333.91999999999996s)]
*  suppression of content on Instagram and Facebook that had been posted by Palestinians and their [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=338.88s)]
*  supporters. They specifically noted that included human rights abuses. Indeed, of the 1,050 cases [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=344.0s)]
*  reviewed, 1,049 involved peaceful content in support of Palestine that was censored or otherwise [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=351.04s)]
*  unduly suppressed. A further report, which came out at the end of last year by BBC Arabic World [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=356.96000000000004s)]
*  Service and Monitoring journalists in December, found that Facebook severely restricted the [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=362.56s)]
*  ability of Palestinian news outlets to, in the BBC's words, reach an audience during the [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=367.28000000000003s)]
*  Israel-Gaza war as they misleadingly describe it. They found that newsrooms in the Palestinian [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=372.24s)]
*  territories suffered a steep drop in audience engagement since the genocide began, with Meta [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=377.04s)]
*  claiming any implication of deliberately suppressing specific voices was unequivocally false. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=383.52000000000004s)]
*  The data on 20 Facebook pages belonging to key Palestinian-based news organisations showed their [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=390.8s)]
*  engagement plummeted with a 77% collapse after 7th October. Palestine TV, for example, had 5.8 [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=395.68s)]
*  million followers on Facebook when the study was done, but there was a 60% collapse in the number [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=403.36s)]
*  of people seeing their posts. Yet at the same time, the Facebook pages of Yedior Aronot, Israel High [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=408.64s)]
*  Arm and Channel 13, Israeli media outlets, whose content was also overwhelmingly war-related, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=415.76s)]
*  had audience engagement surging by nearly 37%. A Meta employee leaked internal documents to [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=420.72s)]
*  these journalists about a change in the algorithm, toughening the moderation of Palestinians who [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=428.64s)]
*  commented on Instagram posts, and they said within a week of the Hamas attack, the code was [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=432.64s)]
*  changed, essentially making it more aggressive towards Palestinian people. Meta told the BBC it [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=437.28s)]
*  was down to a spike in hateful content from the Palestinian territories, to which you can only say, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=441.91999999999996s)]
*  have you seen the content coming out of Israeli media organisations? Hateful is quite the euphemism. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=446.47999999999996s)]
*  It's clear what's going on here. Meta is orchestrating massive censorship of pro-Palestinian [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=452.08s)]
*  content, which of course disproportionately hits Palestinians. I'm actually getting my ban overturned, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=456.24s)]
*  but what about those who don't? It's clear there is a systematic attempt to silence the truth. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=460.64s)]
*  Accordingly, we need to speak louder. Please like and subscribe, press share the video, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ7b7lpoZYc&t=465.68s)]
