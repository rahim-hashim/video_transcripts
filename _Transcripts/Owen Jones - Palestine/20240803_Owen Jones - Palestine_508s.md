# Gaza BETRAYED By UK Government
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [August 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U3VeqXszwQ)
*  Finally, it looked as though the pressure was paying off. In opposition, Kirstama's Labour Party
*  had of course legitimised Israel's genocide and rampage in Gaza, including the now Prime Minister,
*  Kirstama, backing Israel's right to get off water and energy to civilians. It refused to back
*  a ceasefire for months, and as Gaza was wiped from the face of the earth, its people violently
*  displaced, its hospitals destroyed and tens of thousands of people exterminated, Labour stood
*  behind what was termed Israel's right to self-defence. The party opposed ending arms sales,
*  it legitimised the decision to pull the plug on funding to UNRWA, the main humanitarian organisation
*  during a humanitarian catastrophe based on a pack of lies, and it cast doubt on South Africa's case
*  of genocide at the International Court of Justice, the now Health Secretary Wes Treating described
*  that as a distraction. It suspended Labour MPs who stood against the depravity, while
*  shallow ministers who backed a ceasefire were sacked or resigned, and when predominantly
*  Muslim councillors quit in disgust, a Labour source boasted the party was shaking off the fleas,
*  and when, after many many months, it finally backed a ceasefire, it did only because the
*  Scottish National Party had cornered it on the issue by introducing a motion, and then Labour
*  proceeded to gut that motion, stripping away mentions of collective punishment, which Israel
*  is guilty of because that would mean taking action rather than relying on words.
*  Well, what difference getting a slap from the electorate can make? You see, Labour won its
*  landslide, albeit on a paltry third of the vote, amidst the lowest turnout in the history of
*  British democracy, but it lost seats to the Greens and five independents standing on anti-genocide
*  tickets, with two shadow cabinet ministers facing humiliating losses. So, finally, we were making
*  progress. Labour restored funding to UNRWA, that's the UN's main, well it's the UN's agency for
*  Palestinian refugees, as I say, the main humanitarian agency in Gaza, a welcome move, even though it
*  should be said the European Union and many European states, including Israel, staunchest ally on the
*  continent, Germany, having done this many months before. After dilly-dallying and briefing that the
*  Foreign Secretary David Lammy was chickening out, the government announced it was scrapping a
*  departing gift to Israel from the Tories, an attempt to wreck the International Criminal
*  Court's chief prosecutor's requests for arrest warrants against Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin
*  Netanyahu and his defence minister Yoav Galant for war crimes and crimes against humanity.
*  It was further reported that it would act on legal advice, making it clear that Israel
*  is violating international law, which places a legal duty on Labour to cease selling that state
*  weapons. All of this reason to cheer. Yes, it is absurd that we have to cheer the bare minimum,
*  in this case respecting international law and not directly facilitating genocide, but this is a
*  question of life and death on a mass scale. Anything, anything at this point is a step forward,
*  it's something. So it became something of a disappointment to say the least, to discover
*  that Labour was only contemplating banning some weapons, with some artificial distinction being
*  made between weapons that could be used for defensive or offensive weapons, as if that can
*  truly be made in the first place. As the Campaign Against the Arms trade also noted,
*  suspending arms sales to Israel is meaningless if it does not include components for F-35 fighter
*  jets which are raining death and destruction on Gaza. They add that the UK industry makes
*  15% of the value of every F-35 fighter jet, including key elements such as the fuselage,
*  targeting lasers, bomb release mechanisms and critical electronic systems. All key in
*  the committing of war crimes. But now we discover that Labour is delaying making such a decision.
*  According to Jewish News, senior Jewish Labour stakeholders took part in frank and engaging
*  discussions with ministers before the decision was made with one leading figure described as
*  a key supporter of Stama reportedly expressing concerns about such a move. Now clearly like
*  other minority groups with a long history of suffering bigotry, Jewish Labour supporters
*  have the right to organise and make their views heard. There should however be a strict demarcation
*  which we all observe between the behaviour of the State of Israel and the Jewish community. What
*  representations were made here exactly? We know that the Board of Deputies of British Jews has
*  strongly condemned even the mild shift Labour has offered as has the Chief Rabbi who demanded
*  an urgent meeting. With all due respect, what business of theirs is it? It's Britain's approach
*  to a foreign state committing terrible atrocities. It's so important that we emphasise what should
*  be a sacred demarcation between the State of Israel and the Jewish people. Furthermore,
*  let's listen to the Foreign Secretary David Lammehere.
*  We want a credible and irreversible pathway towards a two-state solution,
*  a safe and secure Israel along a viable sovereign Palestinian state. We're committed to recognising
*  a Palestinian state as a contribution to a peace process at a time that's most conducive to that
*  process. I must press him further on government recognition of a Palestinian state. This should
*  have been a starting point 30 years ago. I believe recognition would level the playing field and would
*  kickstart the peace process which has been recognised by so many of our European counterparts.
*  Recognition should not be at the conclusion. So what will the government do if Israel refuses
*  to entertain any moves towards a two-state solution which they have persistently and vocally
*  rejected? Well, what that means in practice is Labour's attitude to an independent Palestinian
*  state is what Spanish people would call mañana mañana, an undefined moment in the future which
*  means never in practice. Or could mean never. Because that is handing Israel a veto, it's
*  Knesset or parliament just voted overwhelmingly to oppose a two-state solution. The Israeli state
*  will only ever understand deeds, not empty words and that means placing pressure on Israel. There
*  has to be huge pressure because at the moment they have no intention of ever allowing an independent
*  Palestinian state of any description. Now we should note that as is most countries on earth
*  have recognised Palestine. Most recently that's Spain, Ireland and Norway. Britain underlaid it
*  as an outlier. Indeed let's listen to David Lammy again. Can I say to the honourable gentleman there
*  is absolutely no abandonment of our close ties and our relationship with Israel and it was hugely
*  important for me to speak to both the Prime Minister and the President to reiterate that of course.
*  Look we're talking about a state committing genocide here. How low are our expectations when
*  it feels like a utopian fantasy to expect our government to impose sanctions on a state
*  committing grotesque human rights violations. Instead it's lauding its alliance and trying to
*  assuage people, try to calm people's nerves that Britain would ever have some rupture with the
*  Israeli state even as it commits some of the worst crimes of our age. Yet,
*  Labour's refusal to accept the basic humanity of Palestinians remains all too evident.
*  David Lammy issued a tweet on Thursday marking 300 days since this horror began which mentions the
*  suffering of Israelis but had not a single word to spare for the Palestinians who have been butchered,
*  maimed, starved and displaced. The horrors they have suffered for months.
*  And after months of this suffering, any respite for the Palestinian people has to be welcomed.
*  But how low the bar has been set. On a daily basis, the Israeli state has committed some of
*  the worst crimes of the 21st century in full public view, a live stream genocide with the
*  complicity of the British government which can't even bring itself to scrap arms sales. The lesson
*  here is clear, it is only pressure on Labour which has succeeded in bringing it to the fore.
*  Labour has succeeded in bringing it to the fore. The answer then, surely, is to make sure that
*  pressure only gets greater. Please like and subscribe. Do leave your comments, leave your
