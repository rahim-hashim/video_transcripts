# Gaza, Genocide, Capitalism - And Hope - w/. Yanis Varoufakis and Raoul Martinez
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ)
*  Hello. So we have quite a lot to speak about to say the least with our key brilliant guest [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=0.0s)]
*  today. We've got the incredible Yanis Varoufakis, who I think you will, if you don't know who [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=5.44s)]
*  Yanis is, what's the point really at this point? Former Greek finance minister, economist, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=10.44s)]
*  author, lots of hats. Raoul Martinez also has lots of hats. Brilliant writer, author, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  actually as well. They're both collaborating at the moment on a great series called In [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=22.36s)]
*  the Eye of the Storm, the political odyssey of Yanis Varoufakis, which I just can imagine [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=25.96s)]
*  is set in the future, which I've always thought actually Yanis Varoufakis was kind of set [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=30.76s)]
*  in the future. It has sort of traveled back in time to impart his wisdom. But they've [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=34.92s)]
*  also started a brilliant podcast called Eye of the Storm with some of the world's leading [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=40.6s)]
*  thinkers and artists. So we are going to talk about that. I'm going to start though, I have [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=43.56s)]
*  to say Yanis, I'm going to have to obviously start by talking to you about the latest [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=47.28s)]
*  instormance of the political dystopia we currently find ourselves in. Now, this is [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=53.36s)]
*  related to what happened at the Palestine Congress in Berlin. I've actually already [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  interviewed Yudi Raz, who is a Jewish activist who was arrested that day. And just so we're [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=68.56s)]
*  clear about why he was arrested, he was wearing his kippah, his Jewish cork up. A German police [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=75.2s)]
*  officer was pointing at it and laughing. Yudi Raz accused him of being anti-Semitic [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=81.08s)]
*  in doing so. And then the police officer arrested him on the basis that was causing offense [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=85.64s)]
*  to a police officer, dragged him away. And then he and everybody, sorry, Yudi Raz and [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=89.84s)]
*  everybody else there were obviously smeared with anti-Semitism, as well as being Islamists [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=95.08s)]
*  by the German government. Yanis Varoufakis, due to speak there, was then banned from Germany, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=100.32s)]
*  banned from all political activity, including doing videos. So not even being in Germany, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=107.64s)]
*  just doing like a speech. Can you just explain what the hell is going on here? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=114.16s)]
*  When the surreal replaces the real by the order of the Ministry of the Interior, it's [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=120.92s)]
*  very difficult to explain what on earth is going on. But I think that you gave us a very [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=129.76s)]
*  good example of a German policeman arresting a Jew for anti-Semitism. That's the definition [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=134.4s)]
*  of surrealism. A few months earlier, another colleague of ours, a member of the same organization, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=141.72s)]
*  a very well known and brilliant Jewish voice for a just peace, a German Jewish organization, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=148.4s)]
*  Iris Heffetz. Iris Heffetz is an Israeli Jew. She lives in Berlin and she practices psychoanalysis [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=156.36s)]
*  and she decided to perform a one-woman protest on her street just outside her residence. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=162.96s)]
*  So she walked on the street on her own without anybody around her, carrying a little placard [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=172.08s)]
*  in which she had written with her own handwriting, as an Israeli and as a Jew stopped the genocide [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=177.68s)]
*  in Gaza and German police arrested her for anti-Semitism. So compared to this absurdity, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=185.48000000000002s)]
*  what they did to me was just a misdemeanor. Of course, it does have very serious repercussions [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  because to this day, my lawyers in Germany have been demanding of the state a written [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=202.0s)]
*  statement of who decided my being banned from Germany, when, is the ban still valid and [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=211.52s)]
*  what is the rationale of the ban? After lots of phone calls and emails, they emailed back [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=223.96s)]
*  to my lawyer, a brilliant activist lawyer. They sent him a letter addressed to me which [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=229.52s)]
*  said that Mr. Varvakis, within 48 hours, you will have a written response to your questions. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=240.51999999999998s)]
*  48 hours later, they got another email saying it was a two-page letter to me explaining why [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=246.35999999999999s)]
*  there wouldn't be a response and the explanation effectively amounted to saying that if they were [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=252.04s)]
*  to disclose to me who decided to ban me, when and why, that would have severe repercussions [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=259.08s)]
*  for the capacity of the Federal Republic of Germany to collaborate with intelligence services, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=271.03999999999996s)]
*  meaning of course foreign intelligence services, in order to minimize the threats [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=279.91999999999996s)]
*  that the Federal Republic of Germany faces. I don't think I need to add anything more, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=285.24s)]
*  except my brief comment that this is of course the end of any pretense to democracy, to the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=290.76000000000005s)]
*  rule of law, when you're being accused essentially of terrorism or of supporting terror or trivializing [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=299.72s)]
*  terrorism because this is what has been published in every German newspaper and you don't have the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=306.28000000000003s)]
*  opportunity to see what the rationale is or to challenge your accuser or to find out who your [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=311.32s)]
*  accuser is and also it is the end of the European Union. I am a citizen of a member state of the [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=316.68s)]
*  European Union. I was a candidate, I was myself a candidate, a German candidate in the European [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=323.24s)]
*  Union Parliament elections in 2019. I gathered 135,000 votes which is not completely insignificant, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=329.8s)]
*  135,000 citizens of the Federal Republic of Germany voted for me. The party I belong to, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=336.52s)]
*  Mera25, is running in Germany, in Greece, in Italy, but also in Germany, and I'm not allowed even to [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=343.23999999999995s)]
*  zoom in to a meeting in the Federal Republic of Germany for reasons that will not be disclosed to [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=349.23999999999995s)]
*  me because the Federal Republic of Germany feels that its national security will be jeopardized if [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=356.03999999999996s)]
*  I find out who accused me. That's what I'm talking about when I'm saying that the surreal has [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=361.4s)]
*  essentially colonized the real. Before I ask both you and Raoul about this visit to Berlin [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=369.0s)]
*  recently, I just want to get your thought on this Janice, in terms of this is normally a country [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=377.15999999999997s)]
*  run by two centre-lefts, I don't really know what centre-left means really to be honest, it's one of [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=383.96s)]
*  these terms thrown around that never has ever given me a working definition, but nonetheless [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=387.15999999999997s)]
*  the Social Democrats and the Greens are supposed to be progressive parties, they're in coalition [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=390.68s)]
*  obviously with the centre-right party, the free Democrats, but nonetheless this isn't a formally [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=395.32s)]
*  right of centre government overall. The AFD, the far right are on the march, if this is happening [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=400.28000000000003s)]
*  now, this level of authoritarianism, an entire congress, a free meeting being shut down, people [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=405.88s)]
*  gathering using their rights of freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, including stopping a British [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=412.36s)]
*  Palestinian doctor from entering the country altogether, barring you, arresting Jewish [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=417.24s)]
*  activists, I keep saying it, watching German police officers dragging off Jewish activists wearing [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=423.32s)]
*  their get-pair, doesn't sit well with me, just triggers a certain emotion doesn't it. If that's [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=428.84000000000003s)]
*  happening now, what's going to happen when, I mean in terms of the given the political movements in [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=434.36s)]
*  Germany and elsewhere, if we're already at this stage under Social Democrats and Greens? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=441.8s)]
*  Well it's already spreading isn't it, already a few days after my ban in Germany, Jean-Luc [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=448.12s)]
*  Mélenchon who you know scored more than 20 percent of the vote in the last presidential election in [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=456.92s)]
*  France, he was barred from entering university and delivering a speech about Palestine along with [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=463.64s)]
*  members of parliament. That was in Paris. Since then there have been numerous reports of [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=470.36s)]
*  candidates from his party being banned from delivering speeches, from attending meetings, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=478.04s)]
*  theatres were cancelling bookings for the party, but oh and allow me to make a broader point, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=485.32000000000005s)]
*  this is not some craze that simply has taken over those who are ruling Germany, the centre-left as [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=495.56s)]
*  you put it, or indeed in France, it's been a long way coming. Remember that the very harsh austerity [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=503.48s)]
*  that was introduced across Europe did not begin in Greece in 2010, it began in 2008, 2009 in Germany [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=514.44s)]
*  and it was spearheaded by the SPD, the Social Democratic Party, when they were in government [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=525.0799999999999s)]
*  together with the Christian Democrats, but it was the German, the German, the Social Democratic, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=531.96s)]
*  the Quellen of the British Labour Party finance minister, Mr Steinbrück, who actually gave a long [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=541.4s)]
*  speech as to why austerity is necessary for democracy. So if you combine that with the ill [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=548.36s)]
*  effects of austerity on the majority of the Germans, because you know 50 to 60 percent of Germans today [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=557.8000000000001s)]
*  are worse off today than they were 20 years ago, so you mentioned the rise and rise, the inexorable [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=564.52s)]
*  rise of the ultra-right, the alternativverdorch and the IFD, well those things go together, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=571.4s)]
*  so you've got the centre-left adopting the policies of the right, creating discontent, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=576.68s)]
*  which then feeds the ultra-right. Now where is Palestine coming into this? Well it's my [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=582.8399999999999s)]
*  considered opinion, this is quite speculative, but it is my view that around the end of the 1980s, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=590.52s)]
*  sometime in the 1990s, the impossibility of having a legitimate nationalist or patriotic even, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=598.92s)]
*  German ideological glue for the Federal Republic of Germany, especially after reunification, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=611.88s)]
*  because of the Holocaust, because of the awful crimes committed against the Jews, but not only [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=619.3199999999999s)]
*  against the Jews, caused a shift. The whole system of power in the Federal Republic, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=625.48s)]
*  having shed nationalism because it was unsustainable after the Second World War, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=636.04s)]
*  they adopted an alternative Zionism, saying, allow me to make a little bit of a joke here, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=640.2s)]
*  the same way that Thatcher privatised electricity in Britain and effectively sold it to [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=649.88s)]
*  a nationalised French company, so you know, their own nation nationalised Britain's electricity. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=658.2s)]
*  Similarly in Germany, a Zionist nationalism, a Zionist white settler mentality, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=665.24s)]
*  being instead of the homegrown German nationalism in order to bring together [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=676.2800000000001s)]
*  the political centre, the centre left, the centre right, and that fed into the great inroads of the [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=683.5600000000001s)]
*  ultra-right. I think that's very perceptive. I mean Raoul, by the way I should also say Raoul [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=691.8000000000001s)]
*  is also a writer, an award-winning filmmaker, which is relevant partly to the trailer I'm about [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=698.84s)]
*  to show as well. But before I do, just bring in, just show the trailer. Right, I'm just interested [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=702.84s)]
*  in your thoughts, because I was just saying yesterday, I saw this, I think an American [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=707.8000000000001s)]
*  professor, or some American kind of right-wing thinker who says, he just tweeted out about the [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=713.0s)]
*  faculty members of New York University creating a ring around the guards of solidarity [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=722.9200000000001s)]
*  encampment to protect their students, and then they retweeted it, dear NYPD, please, please, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=727.24s)]
*  arrest these faculty members. And I just tweeted, have you noticed how talk of cancel culture and [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=731.96s)]
*  free speech on campus and there was no right to be offended and ridiculed of safe spaces ended [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=736.52s)]
*  after 7th of October? Which it did, by the way. No one's talking about cancel culture anymore, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=740.44s)]
*  have you noticed? Because people who were talking about cancel culture, the people now trying to [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=744.6800000000001s)]
*  cancel everyone who stands in support of Palestine. That's exactly what happened, by the way. People [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=747.8000000000001s)]
*  haven't really noticed this properly yet, but they should. But I'm just interested, because [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=753.08s)]
*  I think the world will look back at this period and see the world on its head in the abstract, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=759.32s)]
*  which is a genocide law and slaughter against the people of Gaza. And the people who are being [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=763.08s)]
*  persecuted and silenced and arrested and deplatformed and all the rest are the people [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=768.2s)]
*  who oppose the mass slaughter, including in Germany disproportionately Jewish people who [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=773.8000000000001s)]
*  have been targeted, but also minorities, particularly an Iranian, a gay Iranian German [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=778.2s)]
*  got in touch with me. He'd fled Iran as a refugee, worked in a shop in Germany, back to ceasefire. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=783.8000000000001s)]
*  Non-Jewish Germans suddenly were calling him racist terms in Islamist, go back to your [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=789.4s)]
*  shithole country, tried to force him to put the Israeli flag on his door. That's the kind of [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=795.96s)]
*  thing we're talking about. But what do you just think about this? The way that this kind of [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=799.88s)]
*  basically an attempt to intimidate and silence and what's driving it, do you think? Because I [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=803.88s)]
*  think partly they're morally disgraced and they know it. And they also know that this movement [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=809.0s)]
*  has one public opinion and that's going to have to have consequences. So that's why they're [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=814.0400000000001s)]
*  including in Germany, I'd say. I mean, absolutely. And I think, you know, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=818.12s)]
*  we're living through a period of intense war propaganda and the more unforgivable the action, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=823.08s)]
*  the more intense a propaganda has to be to control the population, to encourage support of, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=830.84s)]
*  of horrific violence, or very often simply to distract people away or scare people [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=838.92s)]
*  into silence, which I think we've seen many, many examples of. Years ago, I did a documentary [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=845.9599999999999s)]
*  called The Lottery of Birth and the book I wrote explored this idea in some depth. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=852.12s)]
*  And for me, it's a powerful idea because it really, it encourages us to focus on the ways [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=858.28s)]
*  in which human beings can be conditioned across a whole spectrum of behaviour. We can be conditioned [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=865.56s)]
*  to embrace the most irrational and the most awful forms of human behaviour imaginable. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=871.2399999999999s)]
*  And we see throughout history, every kind of example. And we can be conditioned to do [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=877.9599999999999s)]
*  beautiful things and contribute peace and beauty and truth to society. And what we're seeing now, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=885.0s)]
*  I think, are the awful outcomes, the awful result of many decades of conditioning, which brings out [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=892.84s)]
*  the worst, which is designed specifically to polarise human beings and to encourage us to view [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=902.76s)]
*  the world through the lens of national, ethnic and religious identities, which blinds us to the [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=912.76s)]
*  foundational truth that every person on this planet is a brother and a sister, that we're so [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=918.52s)]
*  much more similar than we are different. And these identities which we are encouraged, which we are [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=924.04s)]
*  conditioned to identify with on men intellectually, emotionally, they distort our perception of reality [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=933.72s)]
*  and they make us potentially a dangerous force in the world and easier to manipulate. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=942.28s)]
*  So that's what I see is really this. We've learnt the wrong lesson from history. You know, the lesson [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=948.12s)]
*  is about conditioning, the dangers of conditioning. So we end up not seeing each other for what we are, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=954.04s)]
*  which is human beings with beautiful potential and dangerous potential. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=961.56s)]
*  Which is exactly what the work you're doing now is trying to push. So let's just have a look at this [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=966.04s)]
*  trailer and then we'll have a little talk about it. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=971.08s)]
*  Debt is to capitalism that which hell is to Christianity, unpleasant and essential. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=973.88s)]
*  We are in the middle of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=980.36s)]
*  The sacrifices of the Greek people will bring the country back to prosperity. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=984.76s)]
*  The 2008 crisis was not one of the normal periodic downturns. It is the longest [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=990.36s)]
*  damage inducing crisis in the history of capitalism. I could feel that the tsunami was coming. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=996.6s)]
*  The result being the modern world that we live in. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1003.72s)]
*  We were negotiating with financial terrorism creditors who did not want their money back. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1008.28s)]
*  Every asset of the Greek state was bundled together. This was a hidden bailout and we [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1013.48s)]
*  were collateral damage. They want our properties, they want our homeland. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1020.04s)]
*  Austerity is another term for class war. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1024.84s)]
*  Orchestrated attempts of economic aggression. It cannot be described in any other way. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1027.24s)]
*  I could see Wolfgang Schäuble, the German finance minister, getting very agitated. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1032.68s)]
*  He gets the floor. Elections cannot be allowed to change economic policy. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1036.52s)]
*  It became a massive battle to prevent the public ever from finding out. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1042.04s)]
*  I've never listened to such an inaccurate report. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1048.44s)]
*  This is what an oligarchy does when an oligarchy gets threatened. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1050.92s)]
*  Like David and Goliath, they had to get rid of him. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1054.68s)]
*  The landline rings. If you want your son to continue to return safely every night, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1059.56s)]
*  you better lay off. And he mentioned a particular bank. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1064.68s)]
*  We're being dragged into a labyrinth. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1068.3600000000001s)]
*  They had to find ways of violating their own rules. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1072.04s)]
*  It is Wall Street who's our enemy. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1075.64s)]
*  Our regulators became enablers. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1078.76s)]
*  All you can talk about is fairy tales of economic growth. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1081.48s)]
*  Anybody who does economic science is either a fool or is trying to fool you. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1085.64s)]
*  We are seeing an almost Newtonian revolution in the science of economics. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1092.1200000000001s)]
*  It takes a small spark to ignite an evolutionary moment. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1099.16s)]
*  Either we move beyond capitalism or we die. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1103.64s)]
*  Oof, chills. Excellent stuff. Very excited about this. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1114.3600000000001s)]
*  Also, just watching that, it's quite interesting just because there's not been enough [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1119.0s)]
*  films made about just the period we've lived through. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1123.72s)]
*  This very discombobulating, intense age, I would say. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1126.0400000000002s)]
*  Before I just ask Raoul about making this film, I just want to ask you, sorry, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1130.44s)]
*  Yannis, again, not to just keep revisiting traumas here. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1135.32s)]
*  Because you both went to launch a documentary in Berlin and then to find out that the owner [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1139.8799999999999s)]
*  of the cinema, who is Jewish, and this is always relevant because again, the number of German [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1144.52s)]
*  Jews who come into Prussia is just, I mean, history will again, I think be pretty damning. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1148.76s)]
*  Including from the police to cancel the event because of your stance on Gaza. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1155.48s)]
*  The owner stood firm, but there was a security guard hired for the Q&A because of threats [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1159.56s)]
*  made against Yannis. Sounds pretty tense, if I'm honest, Yannis. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1165.24s)]
*  It is, isn't it? I never imagined that I would live such moments in Berlin. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1172.28s)]
*  And as a kid, I grew up in a fascist dictatorship. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1181.4s)]
*  You know, all those events that you're describing now and reminding me of, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1192.2s)]
*  just take me back to, you know, when I was an eight, nine, ten year old. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1199.0s)]
*  And I remember in the middle of winter, my parents who were very worried about [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1203.24s)]
*  relatives, my own father who had been in prison, but others who were still in prison. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1211.0800000000002s)]
*  And they wanted to hear news about, you know, what's happening with our regime, because of course, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1216.76s)]
*  there was no way of finding out through our own media. And I remember what I call our Red Blanket [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1222.3600000000001s)]
*  days. My mom and dad huddling together under a red blanket in the middle of their living room [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1227.4s)]
*  with a shortwave radio trying to listen to Deutsche Welle. And the reason why they were [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1233.24s)]
*  doing that was banned to listen to Deutsche Welle. And we had very nosy snitches living nearby. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1237.48s)]
*  So they were trying to, you know, to muffle the sound of Deutsche Welle. For me, Deutsche Welle, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1246.6s)]
*  as a kid, you know, Deutsche Welle is the BBC of Germany. It was, you know, the voice of democracy, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1252.3600000000001s)]
*  the voice of freedom. For me, Germany was a mythical place out there that we're our friends. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1259.72s)]
*  And to experience those scenes in Berlin only recently in the launch of Raoul's documentary, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1265.16s)]
*  by the way, this documentary is Raoul, you may see it. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1271.4s)]
*  Oh, sorry. Yeah, I know. I see you just collaborating together. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1273.6399999999999s)]
*  You were there just making and directing a film, to be fair. But I should be glad. This is Raoul's [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1278.68s)]
*  brilliant film, just so everyone's aware of it. Carry on. Sorry. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1283.0s)]
*  This is a huge film. I'm just there as a topping head. And, you know, just it is absurd. And I feel [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1285.32s)]
*  very peeved and saddened by what's happening to the German people. Because I have a very [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1292.76s)]
*  strong connection with the German people, since I was a young, very young person. And they're [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1301.8s)]
*  again being dragged in onto a very hazardous road to a heartless society in which a new kind of [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1307.64s)]
*  German McCarthyism is preventing them from resisting this passage to yet another situation [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1316.28s)]
*  where they are being complicit to genocide against their interests, but in their name. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1326.2s)]
*  I just think that people, I don't know, maybe of a certain younger generation weren't aware of what [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1334.44s)]
*  Janis was referring to there. He meant the the the the the the kernels, the Junta, that real Germany [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1339.1599999999999s)]
*  from 67 to 74. Yeah, hideous, hideous regime in in in Greece, which was backed obviously by the West. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1344.52s)]
*  It was engineered by the CIA and NATO. This is another reason when people say to me that, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1354.76s)]
*  you know, unless Ukraine is a member of NATO, they cannot be democracy. I grew up in a NATO [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1359.32s)]
*  member state, which was a fascist dictatorship. So, you know, I have lots of question marks about [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1364.04s)]
*  the official version of events today everywhere around Europe. And of course, people often are [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1370.36s)]
*  in terms of Britain, not to our history in terms of the role of the British, obviously after World [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1376.2s)]
*  War Two in Germany and the brutal counterinsurgency offensive, which Britain's involved in. But [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1380.84s)]
*  unfortunately, all of Britain's dark history is generally erased. So, yes, let's be clear, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1388.44s)]
*  the artistic genius behind this masterpiece. And it looks absolutely incredible, very, very excited [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1394.04s)]
*  about it. So just tell me why, what what what made you think we've got to do this? This is a [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1398.8400000000001s)]
*  series we've got to make. Yeah, well, I think it goes back to the financial crisis of 2008. And [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1403.48s)]
*  seeing how the language of economics was weaponized, the burden of that crisis on many millions of [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1410.76s)]
*  people who played no part in creating it, particularly with the language of austerity. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1417.96s)]
*  And I saw how powerful this was. And also just more generally how the language of economics is [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1422.44s)]
*  used to cordon off the most important decisions really in our polity. And so, no, these are [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1428.52s)]
*  technical decisions to be made by a small class of experts. And to the extent you succeed in doing [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1435.56s)]
*  that, you remove the demos from democracy and the fact that you end up with an illusion of choice. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1441.24s)]
*  And so I had this impetus. I wanted to do a documentary that could somehow provide people [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1450.04s)]
*  with a framework that would empower them to make sense of these control mechanisms. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1455.0s)]
*  And around that time, I had the privilege of being invited to a private event where Janice was [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1461.8s)]
*  speaking. And he was talking about market failures, GDP, various technical aspects of economics. But [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1468.04s)]
*  he had the audience in the palm of his hand and he was making everyone laugh and he was incredibly [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1477.96s)]
*  engaging. And for me, that was the beginning. That was a seed of the idea because I just, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1481.96s)]
*  I recognize Janice's profound gift for communication, his deep understanding of these [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1487.0s)]
*  matters. And then I went and investigated in more depth his story, his journey going from intellectual [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1491.24s)]
*  to politician, finance minister. And I thought this is just an inherently dramatic story, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1499.24s)]
*  that it's a microcosm of dynamics which we're all experiencing at a global level. Where with the [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1506.92s)]
*  rise of Syriza in Greece, you have this remarkable moment, this powerful example of what happens [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1515.0s)]
*  when crisis creates an opportunity. Very often we all want change, we're all fighting for change in [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1521.96s)]
*  society if we're progressives. But the window of opportunity opens up hugely in these moments of [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1527.96s)]
*  crisis. And in Greece, it sort of went further really than in the UK, we had Jeremy Corbyn in [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1536.92s)]
*  the US, we had Bernie Sanders, but in Greece, the left actually came to power, in very common [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1543.0s)]
*  power, we'll see how much power they actually had in the story. But they came to office at least. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1548.92s)]
*  And I think learning the lessons from these moments of opportunity and crisis are incredibly [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1554.12s)]
*  important for the left, particularly because the history immediately gets rewritten by the powerful. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1560.04s)]
*  And that stops us learning the lessons of what went right and what went wrong. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1567.64s)]
*  So a fair bit of the documentary series, and it started out as a documentary feature, a single [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1573.32s)]
*  feature, but the interview with Yanis was so rich that it expanded to a six-part series. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1578.76s)]
*  So it explores Yanis's journey as a politician, intellectual, finance minister, but then it goes [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1584.84s)]
*  on actually to expand its scope, to look internationally at the dynamics which are driving [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1592.04s)]
*  the various crises that we're living through economically in terms of ecology and climate [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1597.88s)]
*  change and the broader dynamics of capitalism. But I have to say what really I think holds the [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1602.52s)]
*  whole series together is Yanis's personal human story. The fact that, you know, I often quote Tony [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1608.04s)]
*  Benn saying that the most powerful word in politics is no. And Yanis is a really powerful example [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1616.28s)]
*  of someone who when it really counted, when it really mattered, he had the courage and integrity [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1623.72s)]
*  to say no to the troika, to some of the most powerful institutions of capitalism. And so the [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1629.0s)]
*  series is a combination of these elements, the human, the intellectual, the micro and the macro. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1636.84s)]
*  So yeah, that's the next phase. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1645.0s)]
*  I mean, that quote that Milton Friedman, the right-wing economist, but [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1649.24s)]
*  only a crisis actually perceived produces a real change when that crisis occurs. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1655.08s)]
*  The actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around and tapped into that idea. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1659.6399999999999s)]
*  Often like to quote enemies on things when they're being very perceptive as they are there. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1665.96s)]
*  And before I ask you, I want to ask about art there and how that has an impact. I mean, Yanis, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1670.84s)]
*  just, you know, because I guess it gives you an opportunity to just reflect on this age in which [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1674.1999999999998s)]
*  we live. Because at the moment what happens is, I guess it often feels when you're operating in this [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1680.12s)]
*  environment as a public figure, public intellectual, it's kind of you're lurching from one crisis to [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1684.92s)]
*  another, doing lots of different interventions, you know, just to be able to take a step back and [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1689.0s)]
*  look at everything. And I just wonder actually, again, quoting from the right, it's sometimes [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1692.6000000000001s)]
*  said by the American right, I don't know who said this, but Barry Goldwater was a right-wing [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1700.3600000000001s)]
*  Republican candidate who lost a landslide in 1964 to LBJ and stood on a kind of right-wing platform, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1707.0s)]
*  which was then rejected basically. But it was sometimes said about Ronald Reagan's victory in [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1713.72s)]
*  1980 that Barry Goldwater won, it just took 16 years to count the votes. And what I mean by that, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1719.8s)]
*  and it's interesting because, you know, Raoul Saji said no, and the Greek people also said no in a [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1725.72s)]
*  referendum, of course, on the Troika, but their verdict was overturned. But I just want to get [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1729.88s)]
*  Yanis, looking back at this, I sometimes think this is like a first wave of the new left. And [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1735.0s)]
*  you could see the kind of, you know, Podemos in Spain, Bernie Sanders in the United States, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1740.28s)]
*  Jeremy Corbyn here, you know, various other kind of movements that emerged obviously soon as it [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1744.3600000000001s)]
*  in Greece. And it looks like we kind of like laid the foundations that now have lots of kind of [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1750.28s)]
*  ideas, which we didn't have before, because the left was very on the defensive and defined by [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1754.68s)]
*  what it was against, not what it's for after, you know, the kind of defeats of the 1980s, I'd say. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1757.72s)]
*  That's changed. You've got a whole politicized level of youth, I would say, not in all countries, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1762.44s)]
*  in Italy, things aren't looking good for young people. In France, there's a mixed bag. But you [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1767.56s)]
*  do have a more politicized group of people. And I just wonder, you know, having been involved in [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1773.24s)]
*  so much involved in one of those waves in Greece, and still are, but having an international kind [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1777.6399999999999s)]
*  of platform, what do you think? Was this our first wave and actually the next wave will be better [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1783.32s)]
*  prepared? Well, I hope so. This is why we are stealing politics. This is why I'm stealing [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1789.32s)]
*  politics, because, as you say, and as Milton Friedman correctly said, the way I see it, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1796.2s)]
*  allow me a surfer's paradigm or paradigm metaphor. These rebellions are generated by the very [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1803.16s)]
*  extractive system that we live in, call it capitalism, I call it techno feudalism these days, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1814.92s)]
*  doesn't matter. It's an extractive system which produces greater and deeper crisis [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1821.24s)]
*  from the same production line that it produces iPhones, or whatever it is, you know, industrial [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1830.36s)]
*  robots. So these rebellions are a natural phenomenon, a natural repercussion of the [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1835.56s)]
*  system we live in, and they come in waves. So like good surfers, we cannot create a wave, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1844.84s)]
*  but what we must do, we must be prepared with our ideas, with our narratives, with our policies, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1852.36s)]
*  to catch the next wave. In 2008, which was the greatest, greatest shock to the capitalist [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1858.36s)]
*  system since 1929, in my estimation, it was even bigger of a shock than 1929. But that's neither [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1865.48s)]
*  here nor there. We, of the left, internationally, we were not ready for it, and we didn't catch the [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1872.04s)]
*  wave. We tried, Occupy Wall Street, Occupy the City of London, Indignados in Spain, that then [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1876.92s)]
*  gave rise to Podemos, the Aganaktis many here in Athens, that gave rise to Syriza. So you're [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1885.08s)]
*  absolutely right about that, but I must say that there is a profound asymmetry between the Milton [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1893.0s)]
*  Friedmans and the Goldwaters and so on, and us, of the left, and the asymmetry has to do with [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1901.8s)]
*  with money and power. So when, you know, Milton Friedman used to be a charlatan. He was shunned by [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1908.52s)]
*  the establishment, his ideas in the 1950s, especially in the 1960s, were denigrated by [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1915.3999999999999s)]
*  the very establishment, which after the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1922.04s)]
*  embraced him. But it didn't just happen because he had ideas lying around the floor. He had [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1929.08s)]
*  huge resources. The Mont Pelerin Society, industrialists like the Koch brothers and so on, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1936.36s)]
*  they were providing for huge quantities of money, media cover, think tanks, that with a lot of [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1942.6799999999998s)]
*  researchers churning out data that was manipulated in order to provide backing for the [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1950.92s)]
*  monstrous ideas behind monetarism and Thatcherism and Reaganism and so on. We don't have these [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1962.1200000000001s)]
*  resources. Instead, unlike Reagan, who was a class warrior or Thatcher, who defended the bourgeoisie [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1967.48s)]
*  that put her there, to the hilt, and was a remarkable class warrior on the other side, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1977.0s)]
*  our side, when we got an opportunity here in Greece in 2015, we blew it. And we blew it because [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1983.96s)]
*  essentially our leadership surrendered. They were co-opted. The system proved too powerful, too rich [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=1990.76s)]
*  and too much of a lure to the individuals in our midst, and they took us over, essentially. And [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2000.2s)]
*  once our government here surrendered, Podemos was dust. The Linke in Germany was dust. You folks in [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2006.12s)]
*  the United Kingdom with Jeremy, you put up a little bit of a fight. The 2017 general election [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2015.08s)]
*  was a magnificent result, as far as I'm concerned. I was there in Britain with you folks, and I [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2021.0s)]
*  basked in that very short-lived glory. But then immediately after that, they found a way of [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2027.8799999999999s)]
*  undermining it. So there is an asymmetry. We don't have the resources that the bourgeoisie, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2032.68s)]
*  the ruling class have, and therefore we must be better prepared and we must be [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2039.88s)]
*  more united and more solidaristic with one another. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2046.6000000000001s)]
*  I mean, Raoul, just a couple of other things. I mean, in terms of, I mean, firstly, you've got [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2051.08s)]
*  this new podcast series called The Eye of the Storm, and it's just like a media empire here, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2054.36s)]
*  being born, which I'm thoroughly enjoyed with these new media empires, Medea Sand with Zetio, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2058.04s)]
*  which have been very proud to be taking part in. But just interested, yeah, tell me, you know, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2063.32s)]
*  because this is about engaging with some of the world's leading thinkers and artists. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2067.64s)]
*  I need just to just, yeah, kind of what's, you know, is that kind of trying to, what's the aim [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2072.12s)]
*  there? Is it to try and kind of knit it together? And I'm interested because, you know, you're [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2076.44s)]
*  of an artistic disposition, just how art and politics, how that, you know, how they go together. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2081.24s)]
*  Yeah, well, look, I think we need more art in our politics and more politics in our art [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2088.44s)]
*  generally. And that's a sort of guiding principle for me in my own work. The podcast is an excuse, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2095.4s)]
*  an opportunity for Yanis and myself to explore more deeply the themes of the documentary series. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2103.32s)]
*  And I hope over the course of the podcast, with the many conversations we're having with, you know, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2110.2s)]
*  truly incredible thinkers, beautiful people, that we can knit together a framework which can [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2114.76s)]
*  empower people to make more sense of the reality that we're living through, which is a very [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2123.4s)]
*  disorientating reality. But in terms of power of art, I mean, I think of it in terms of our [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2128.2000000000003s)]
*  perceptual environment and our perceptual environment is saturated with content designed [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2135.7200000000003s)]
*  to manipulate, to misinform, to distract and to polarise. And that leaves most of us [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2143.3199999999997s)]
*  disorientated and isolated, isolated from each other and also isolated from parts of ourselves. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2150.68s)]
*  I think art can do the opposite. I see true art as profoundly nourishing, nourishing on an emotional [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2157.72s)]
*  level, on an intellectual level, even on a spiritual level. And that's what I see as a [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2164.84s)]
*  power of art. It connects us, it reconnects us to parts of ourselves and to truth, to reality and [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2171.8s)]
*  to other people. So yeah, in terms of diet, it's about shifting our diet. And I think, oh, and you [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2180.6000000000004s)]
*  know, you've, I don't know if you regard what you do as artistic per se, but I think your contribution [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2187.32s)]
*  with your channel over these months, I just want to say, has been immensely important. And [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2193.4s)]
*  particularly in a media landscape, which has, which is just barren. It's really shown itself up in [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2198.6800000000003s)]
*  recent months. Barren in terms of just humanity and commitment to basic principles of journalism [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2205.96s)]
*  and truth. And so, you know, in this landscape, at this point in our history, we need independent [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2214.28s)]
*  media, we need independent discussions. And I think we need art to play a role in reconnecting [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2222.52s)]
*  us and hopefully inspiring us to think beyond the present moment, you know, cultivate our imaginations, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2229.48s)]
*  not be stuck within the existing parameters, and give us the courage and the energy to act, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2237.64s)]
*  act on a shifting course. That's what I see as, you know, the potential of art. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2248.44s)]
*  Very beautifully put. Just finally, Alice, let's end, because I'm very excited about this, and I'm [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2254.28s)]
*  sure everyone's going to check this out and spread the word, as I'm sure they will. Yeah, I mean, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2259.08s)]
*  you know what, I just took it at the moment. I'm speaking later to an academic at Columbia [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2266.04s)]
*  University, a Jewish academic, and we can see at the moment how, I say that because there's this [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2270.6s)]
*  huge attempt to demonize those protesters at Columbia University who are protesting, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2276.76s)]
*  obviously, against a genocidal war in Gaza. And it's just, you know, you see at the moment [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2281.5600000000004s)]
*  mass graves being uncovered. And, you know, something I said yesterday is that you know [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2287.88s)]
*  you're living through a crime of historic proportions when two words in the English [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2295.48s)]
*  language are put together, mass graves. There's a clue there, isn't there, really? Throughout [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2298.6800000000003s)]
*  history, that's, I think, one of your biggest red flags. But, you know, you're seeing, obviously, [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2303.56s)]
*  the reason you're seeing this attempt to demonize those here at Stanley Gates, one of the great [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2313.0s)]
*  crimes of our age is because of the sheer level of obscenity. It's impossible to suppress. They [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2317.16s)]
*  know they've lost public opinion, and we mentioned Germany McCarthyism, but the polling shows this, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2324.68s)]
*  and that most Germans, a large proportion, oppose Israel's onslaught on Gaza. And they know there's [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2329.64s)]
*  going to be consequences for them and for the positions that they hold. And, you know, what [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2335.56s)]
*  your work here is doing, as an example, is tapping into that. People have a thirst for it because, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2341.8s)]
*  you know, we've rarely seen such a collision between the media, where the media's at, [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2347.96s)]
*  and where people are at. I mean, Gaza really sums that up. So, I mean, I'm just wondering that, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2352.7599999999998s)]
*  you know, bearing with your project in mind, I mean, what do you think? I mean, I look at [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2359.64s)]
*  these younger people and they're just, they're not taking any shit. They grew up in a world [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2363.24s)]
*  defined by a failed economic model and catastrophic foreign wars, all of them catastrophic on their [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2368.2s)]
*  own terms and on the terms of the impact on humanity. And the response to younger people [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2375.0s)]
*  who are saying, we grew up with this and it is bullshit. It is hideous bullshit. We suffer the [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2382.28s)]
*  consequences and we are watching depravity every single day and we're going to fight back. And the [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2388.76s)]
*  response is just to beat, you know, to go for them, demonize them, make them to be this demonic, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2395.64s)]
*  evil mob, turning the world upside down. But it gives hope, doesn't it, Anas? Because I just think [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2401.64s)]
*  you look at this and you just think, well, actually after the age in which we've lived with all these [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2406.12s)]
*  defeats, but there are people who, you know, that generation, I just think they're not going to [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2409.64s)]
*  take it anymore. Again, to quote a right American right wing kind of, you know, we're mad and we're [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2414.7599999999998s)]
*  not going to take it anymore. What do you think? This moment actually does give a lot of hope. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2420.2s)]
*  It's what keeps me smiling. I was reading today the headlines, Financial Times, New York Times, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2423.8799999999997s)]
*  Wall Street Journal, one headline, gung-ho, wonderful that the US Senate passed a bill [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2437.64s)]
*  giving $96 billion to three war zones, essentially, two that are active, one in Ukraine, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2444.68s)]
*  another in Gaza to Israel, and a third to Taiwan, fermenting war there in the Pacific, that would be [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2453.16s)]
*  even more horrendous than what we already have. So the whole establishment in Europe and the United [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2461.72s)]
*  States and Canada and Australia and New Zealand, they're celebrating the fact that almost $100 [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2467.3999999999996s)]
*  billion is going to be spent yesterday on more war. And yet you have young people, you can see the [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2472.44s)]
*  proliferation of protests across the United States. These are not guided by anything. These are [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2481.08s)]
*  spontaneous demonstrations. It reminds the older ones of the manner in which the establishment [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2487.7999999999997s)]
*  in Washington, but also in Europe, lost control of the youth in the mid-60s as a result of the [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2499.88s)]
*  anti-war protests against Vietnam. In a sense, I said that on the day on the 7th of October, [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2506.28s)]
*  and of course I was not invested in that, but there is a parallel between the Hamas attack on the wall, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2514.76s)]
*  separating the wall, effectively barbed wire of the concentration camp, also known as the Gaza Strip, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2521.48s)]
*  with the Tet Offensive in Vietnam, which was a desperate offensive. It yielded lots of deaths. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2528.44s)]
*  There was a lot of cruelty, but nevertheless that changed the narrative and created this student [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2537.96s)]
*  movement in the United States, which then spread and also gave rise to the May of 1968 across Europe. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2544.8399999999997s)]
*  So yes, I get a lot of, well, the only source of hope, but a lot of it, a very rich source of hope [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2551.88s)]
*  from the youth, from the students, especially in the United States, where everything begins there [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2561.08s)]
*  in the same way that under the Roman Empire everything began. But Owen, can I just say one [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2566.28s)]
*  thing about Raoul, because it hasn't been said, and because you made the point about art. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2572.6s)]
*  He's a painter, he's a very accomplished painter. You can see, you can look at his [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2580.76s)]
*  portraits in the National Portrait Library Gallery in London. And I'm saying that because [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2586.84s)]
*  you asked about art, and what sticks to my mind is Picasso's comment about Guernica, [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2594.76s)]
*  that which is of course the painting of a massacre from the Spanish Civil War. And [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2602.6800000000003s)]
*  remember what he said, that paintings are not for decorating rooms or museums or galleries, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2610.44s)]
*  they're instruments of war, sometimes defensive, sometimes offensive. So that's how I see his [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2614.6000000000004s)]
*  documentary. Well, I'm extremely excited about the documentary, and I think everybody who's listened [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2621.48s)]
*  to both of you speaks so eloquently and so beautifully. There's always a huge amount of [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2627.96s)]
*  humanity in the works of both of you. And I think we do need to take stock of everything we just [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2632.44s)]
*  live through. And this is such a brilliant way of doing it, such an engaging way of doing it, [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2639.96s)]
*  which makes a lot of often quite complex ideas very accessible, which is always something I'm [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2643.8s)]
*  very fond of, and the podcast as well. So it's a big honour, but I'm very excited about it. So [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2647.4s)]
*  Eye of the Storm, make sure you can go, everyone now, it's just been released, 80 countries, [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2653.88s)]
*  it's been viewed in. Go to eyeofthestorm.info, but I'll put that in the description so everyone [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2659.1600000000003s)]
*  will be able to see that anyway, as soon as they click on this. So but make sure you click on it [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2665.6400000000003s)]
*  and spread the word. Very excited to share this video as well. Leave your comments, [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2669.56s)]
*  love to hear your thoughts. Press the like button, subscribe, but Yanis and Raoul, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2674.28s)]
*  very excited about the new project. And thanks for joining us. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2680.6s)]
*  Thank you for taking such huge risks with the stance you are taking regarding Palestine. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2684.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, I'm sure I speak for all of us, I'd never forgive myself if I did anything else, but thank [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2689.3199999999997s)]
*  you. But not everybody else is doing their duty. I've noticed. Yeah, I've noticed. And I'll just [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2693.3199999999997s)]
*  say I'll never forgive them. So we're absolutely clear about that, I'll put that on record. Anyway, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGYhMJ00fQ&t=2701.0s)]
