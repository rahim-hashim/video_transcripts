# Tucker Carlson DESTROYS Iran War Stooge
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y)
*  Tucker Carlson has destroyed the pro-war Republican Senator Ted Cruz over Iran. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=0.0s)]
*  It's fair to say that I'm not a political sympathizer of Tucker Carlson at all, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=6.48s)]
*  I should emphasize that fact, but it is worth just watching this clip from this upcoming interview. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=10.72s)]
*  How many people live around by the way? I don't know the population. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=17.12s)]
*  At all? No, I don't know the population. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=20.48s)]
*  You don't know the population of the country you seek to topple? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=23.52s)]
*  How many people living around? 92 million. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=27.84s)]
*  Okay. Yeah. How could you not know that? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=29.6s)]
*  I don't sit around memorizing population tables. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=34.0s)]
*  Well, it's kind of relevant because you're calling for the overthrow of the government. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=36.72s)]
*  Why is it relevant whether it's 90 million or 80 million or 100 million? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=40.56s)]
*  Why is that relevant? Because if you don't know [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=44.160000000000004s)]
*  anything about the country. I didn't say I don't know anything about the country. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=45.2s)]
*  Okay, what's the ethnic mix of Iran? They are Persians and predominantly Shia. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=47.36s)]
*  What percent? No, you don't know anything about Iran. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=53.040000000000006s)]
*  So, okay, I am not the Tucker Carlson expert on Iran. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=56.64s)]
*  You're a senator who's calling for the overthrow of the government and you don't know anything [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=60.64s)]
*  about the country. No, you don't know anything [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=64.64s)]
*  about the country. You're the one who claims they're not trying to murder Donald Trump. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=66.4s)]
*  No, I'm not saying that. You're the one who can't figure [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=69.68s)]
*  out if it was a good idea to kill General Soleimani and you said it was bad. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=71.68s)]
*  You don't believe they're trying to murder Trump? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=74.88s)]
*  Yes, I do. Because you're not [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  calling for military strikes against them in retaliation. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=77.36s)]
*  And if you really believe that. We're carrying out military strikes today. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=79.76s)]
*  You said Israel was. Right, with our help. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=82.80000000000001s)]
*  I've said we, Israel is leading them, but we're supporting them. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  Well, this, you're breaking news here because the US government last night denied, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=88.47999999999999s)]
*  the National Security Council spokesman Alex Pfeiffer denied on behalf of Trump [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=92.32s)]
*  that we were acting on Israel's behalf in any offensive capacity at all. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=96.24s)]
*  We're not bombing them, Israel's bombing them. You just said we were. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=99.44s)]
*  We are supporting Israel. It's high stakes, you're a senator. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=103.52s)]
*  If you're saying the United States government is at war with Iran right now, people are listening. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=106.0s)]
*  Oof, well indeed. As with Iraq, as with Afghanistan, as with Libya, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=109.91999999999999s)]
*  warmongers are cheering on military interventions in countries they know [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=114.08s)]
*  very little about whatsoever. In each of these cases, these ignorant warmongers predicted [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=117.2s)]
*  devastating success and were often high on their own triumphalism. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=122.88s)]
*  They were unable to predict the catastrophes that many of us predicted. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=126.56s)]
*  It reminds me of the words of the US diplomat Michael Metrinko. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=131.44s)]
*  He was in Afghanistan. He was one of the few US officials [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=135.44s)]
*  during the occupation who actually had an understanding of Afghan culture. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=139.84s)]
*  He said of the CIA operatives who swamped the country after the 2001 invasion, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=142.56s)]
*  who were unable even to speak the language of the vast majority of cases, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=146.8s)]
*  I would dismiss all, 99% of them as amateurs. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  Tucker Carlson represents a particular strand of the Donald Trump [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=153.68s)]
*  MAGA base who took the promise to end the forever wars seriously. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=157.28s)]
*  Well, Trump has slapped him down writing on his true social platform. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  Somebody please explain to Kookie Tucker Carlson that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=164.88s)]
*  that's all in capitals that bit. Well, Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's Director of [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=169.52s)]
*  National Intelligence, pointed out three months ago, the US intelligence assessment is that Iran [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=172.8s)]
*  is not building a nuclear weapon. Let's hear what Trump had to say to that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  I don't care what she said was what he said about his own director of national intelligence. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=193.68s)]
*  The truth is Donald Trump's claims to be the peace candidate were always lies. That's not to [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=197.68s)]
*  let the Democrats off the hook for their crimes, it's to speak the truth about Trump and those who [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=202.4s)]
*  he duped. These Trump allies are far from alone. Another one is the far right Republican [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=207.44s)]
*  representative Marjorie Taylor Greene. From Georgia, Marjorie Taylor Greene, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=212.56s)]
*  Congresswoman Greene, you have been a voice of reason and America first policy. Tell us how you [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=217.12s)]
*  see this conflict between Israel and Iran. Matt, I see it just as you do and you laid that out [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=224.08s)]
*  so well. That's the America first message, but it's also the truth that the American people [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=231.44000000000003s)]
*  have woken up to. We've watched for decades propaganda news. I'll call out Fox News and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=235.84s)]
*  the New York Post. They're known to be the neocon network news. We have propaganda news on our side, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=241.84s)]
*  just like the left does. And the American people have been brainwashed into believing that America [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=248.08s)]
*  has to engage in these foreign wars in order for us to survive. And it's absolutely not true. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  Look, let's be clear, we are not on the side of these people. These are awful people, by the way. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=262.96000000000004s)]
*  They don't oppose these wars because they're opposed to innocent people suffering horrible [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=266.72s)]
*  violence, or because they regard wars of aggression as outrageous injustices. They just reduce [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=270.0s)]
*  everything to what they see as crude US self-interest, which is why should the US [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=274.4s)]
*  care about these foreigners and these foreign problems? You can hear that fleshed out by Steve [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=278.71999999999997s)]
*  Bannon, the former chief strategist to Donald Trump. Israel is a sovereign nation. I'm a big [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  supporter of Israel, big supporter of Israeli nationalism. It's a sovereign nation. It has to [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=287.44s)]
*  make decisions that are right for it as it should, as all nations on earth should do. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=293.2s)]
*  But when you start making decisions that are predicated upon the assumption that America's [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=299.68s)]
*  going to come in, not just for defense, but for offense, because the same crowded Fox all weekend [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=304.72s)]
*  has been sounding the war toxins. America's got to go on offense. We have to go on offense. We [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=310.56s)]
*  have to support. We've got the equipment. We've got the pilots. We have the refueling. We have to [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=315.28000000000003s)]
*  help them take out Fodor, the second and the most, the one that's more secure in the mountainside. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=321.20000000000005s)]
*  We have to be there. No, we have to make decisions that put America first. This has to be thought [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=326.88s)]
*  through. This Pearl Harbor type attack on the moolahs is fine for Israel, but is right for [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=333.6s)]
*  the United States. When we have 10 million illegal alien invaders just on Biden's watch [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=341.28s)]
*  in the United States, particularly in our major cities, which president Trump comes out last night [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=347.6s)]
*  and says, we're going to double and triple down to get them out. That's the war we face. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=351.92s)]
*  It's basically an everyone for themselves mentality. I believe that the US client [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=357.12s)]
*  states should stand on their own two feet. Another example is Republican Congressman Thomas Massey, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=360.72s)]
*  who joined forces with the Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna to prohibit US involvement in the Israel [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=366.40000000000003s)]
*  Iran war. He added, this is not our war. Even if it were, Congress must decide such matters according [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=372.96000000000004s)]
*  to our constitution. You can see why they're worried with the vast majority of the US public [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=378.64s)]
*  opposed to the US military getting involved. The latest YouGov poll found that 60% of Americans [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=382.71999999999997s)]
*  oppose US military involvement in Iran, with just 16% in support. Among Trump voters, 53% [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=388.08s)]
*  reposed, just 19% in support. Perhaps that's because they remember the last time they were [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=394.15999999999997s)]
*  browbeat in supporting all these other wars, which they were told would make the US safer and bring [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=399.2s)]
*  peace and democracy when they actually led to thousands of US troops being killed alongside the [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=403.68s)]
*  mass slaughter of Arabs and Afghans, the rise of violent extremism, sectarian warfare, the mass [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=408.64s)]
*  displacement of people and general hideous chaos. Indeed, it seems today I am favourably quoting [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=413.68s)]
*  people I have no political sympathy for. And next up is Emmanuel Macron, the president of France. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=419.28000000000003s)]
*  As he said there, does anyone think what was done in Iraq in 2003 was a good idea, or what was done [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=433.68s)]
*  in Libya in the past decade? No, the countries in the region do not need a new wave of chaos. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=461.68s)]
*  Well he's right, isn't he? The boy's right, the boy, he's much older than me. But I mean, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=467.04s)]
*  it's correct. The fact is that the US is already up to its neck in this war of aggression, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=473.04s)]
*  in defiance of the will of its own people. Donald Trump said, we have, we now have, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=477.52s)]
*  sorry, we now have total and complete control over the skies of Iran. We? What does he mean [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=482.32s)]
*  by we? Here exactly. Well, it's rather obvious, isn't it? Yet with polling also showing overwhelming [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=487.6s)]
*  UK opposition to participating in Israel's war of aggression, the UK government has announced [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=492.72s)]
*  it's sending military assets to the region and is refusing to rule out intervening in support of [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=497.92s)]
*  Israel. This particular scene in that context is very symbolic indeed. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=501.68s)]
*  Kirste Amadei, the British Prime Minister, quite literally scrambling on his hands and knees for [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=517.6s)]
*  Donald Trump. But this from the German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is deeply revealing. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=520.8000000000001s)]
*  Israel is doing the dirty work for all of us, he says. This is Germany officially supporting [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=530.16s)]
*  Israel's war of aggression and illegal war as Germany continues its long and gruesome history [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=533.76s)]
*  of hideous, violent obscenities. Nonetheless, this is a confession. Israel's crimes are indeed the [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=539.6s)]
*  crimes of the West. It is Western states he must be held accountable. That brings us to the truly [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=546.24s)]
*  beyond hideous, I don't know what the right word is for this man, who's going to end up in prison, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=553.76s)]
*  the Israeli British propagandist, Elon Levy, he was spokesperson for Benjamin Netanyahu before [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=559.6s)]
*  he was sacked. Imagine that, imagine, imagine being some dweeb who was sacked by Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=564.08s)]
*  and then just carrying on this propaganda for a genocidal state. He posted a picture of the [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=571.1999999999999s)]
*  Middle East highlighting the much smaller Israel versus the much bigger Iran, posting since 1967 [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=578.64s)]
*  there has never been a clearer example of David vs Goliath. Leave aside, Iran was actually an ally [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=583.36s)]
*  of Israel between 1967 and 1979. Israel is a nuclear armed power which has the total support [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=589.4399999999999s)]
*  of the United States, which as you probably know is the world's only superpower. It might be spying [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=594.8s)]
*  you know in decline, but it is still the only superpower as well as other Western states who [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=599.28s)]
*  have armed it to the teeth. It's got nuclear weapons, again nuclear weapons, which it is [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYt2atqL4Y&t=604.48s)]
