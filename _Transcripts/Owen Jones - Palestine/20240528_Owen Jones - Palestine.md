# Israel's Rafah Massacre They Think They Can Get Away With Anything
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TwbPewyzPI)
*  Eight months of Israel's depraved, genocidal frenzy in Gaza, and we must never ever ever
*  stop being shocked, never stop being disgusted and never stop feeling righteous rage. This
*  must never be normalised. Israel has just massacred dozens of Palestinian civilians
*  in Raffa, where most of Gaza's pre-war population was driven to, originally under threat of
*  violence by the Israeli state. Many of them are children, kids, babies. I've seen as
*  too many of you have videos and images of the child disintegrating bodies of children,
*  of decapitated babies. It's worth stating clearly that there was far more outrage over
*  the alleged beheading of Israeli babies on the 7th of October, which I must point out
*  did not happen, which was invented, including by President Joe Biden, who lied to the world
*  when he'd said he'd seen images of beheaded babies. There was far more outrage over that
*  fiction than there has been over 14,000 plus Palestinian children being slaughtered, many
*  of them babies, including the babies beheaded yesterday by the Israeli missile strike in
*  Raffa. That particular entirely false claim was used to justify a genocidal onslaught
*  which has killed so many babies, so many toddlers, so many young kids, so many teenagers as well
*  as so many other innocent Palestinians. Last week, the International Court of Justice issued
*  a legally binding order for Israel to cease its military onslaught against Raffa on the
*  grounds that it may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could
*  bring about its physical destruction whole or in part. We're talking there of course
*  about genocide.
*  Now, the Israeli state has given its response. They claimed that this was an intelligence
*  based precision strike targeting two senior Hamas figures and the IDF to deform like it
*  has done with its atrocities over and over again, trying to deflect a lie, claiming this
*  strike didn't take place in the humanitarian area designated. Then Benjamin Netanyahu publicly
*  declared that it was a tragic mishap. To be fair, they normally spend months until
*  they admit responsibility after doing lie deflection, muddy waters and wait until the
*  tension has moved on and everyone just fires us in the fog of war. Now, Netanyahu then
*  added, I will keep fighting until the flag of victory is raised and I don't intend
*  to end the war before every goal has been achieved if we give in the massacre war turn.
*  Quite something to say when you are yourself perpetrating one of the great massacres of
*  our age, the equivalent death toll of so many October 7th already with so many October
*  7th inflicted against Gaza still to come. The Israeli state claimed yesterday that these
*  were two legitimate targets under international law, targets with the use of precise munitions
*  and on the basis of precise intelligence and that they are aware that a fire caused ignited,
*  meaning that several civilians were harmed. Well, that's one way of putting it, isn't
*  it?
*  Let's listen to the lies and deflections of Israeli propaganda. So let's listen to
*  NGOs on the ground like Médecins Sans Frontières, their emergency coordinator in Gaza, Samuel
*  Johan said, women and children were among the people that were brought to the stabilisation
*  point and once again, civilians are paying the price of this war. This Israeli attack
*  on a populated camp in a so-called safe zone in Ra'atha shows the complete disregard
*  for the lives of civilians in Gaza. Now, a few things to note, a crucial piece of investigative
*  journalism by Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham has found that Israeli intelligence sources
*  told him that the army, the Israeli army was willing to accept 20 civilians killed for
*  lower ranking Hamas members and up to 300 for senior Hamas figures. Now, the chief prosecutor
*  of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, last week issued arrest warrants against
*  Benjamin Netanyahu and his defence minister, Yov Galant. In an interview since, he said
*  there were attempts to kill Margaret Thatcher, Airy Neve was blown up, Lord Mountbatten was
*  killed, there was the Enskillen attack with knee cappings, but the British didn't decide
*  to say well on the Fall's Road, that is the heart of Catholic Belfast there, and doubtfully
*  maybe some IRA members and Republican sympathisers, so therefore let's drop a £2,000 bomb on
*  the Fall's Road, you can't do that. I should point out that, of course, that isn't to
*  say and shouldn't be to say that Britain did not commit horrific atrocities against
*  the Irish people for centuries in fact, but including for example the likes of Bloody
*  Sunday. But just going on what he's saying, this is the point, I think that's interesting,
*  he hasn't issued arrest warrants specifically relating to Israel's bombing campaign. In
*  his statement last week, he said that was still being investigated. Obviously, the ICC
*  has been prevented from entering Gaza to assess evidence like international journalists have,
*  but this suggests more charges are on the way. The point he was making is that even
*  if you say we've got a military target here, you cannot simply drop a bomb and slaughter
*  a load of civilians in the process. You cannot simply say well in this case we have two legitimate
*  targets so dozens of civilians killed, including so many little kids, that's legitimate class
*  But there's several other points here too. Israel said they launched this attack based
*  on their intelligence with military precision, so even if they try to pass off this as some
*  sort of accident, that means their military is not capable of operating in a way that
*  doesn't slaughter civilians. Their best defense there is they are totally incompetent, not
*  the world-leading military force they claim to be. And indeed, how many accidents, Israel?
*  How many? You saw tens of thousands of Palestinians, huge numbers of children for eight months
*  now. Even if you apply the best possible story for Israel here, that they simply could not
*  anticipate some sort of chain reaction based on this targeted bombing, which would kill
*  lots of civilians. But bear in mind, even their main patron, their main ally on earth,
*  the world's last remaining superpower, the United States of America, publicly said they
*  were not convinced Israel could proceed with any major offensive against Rafah in a way
*  that could protect civilians. Gaza is one of the most densely populated places on earth
*  and obviously huge numbers remain in Rafah. They were warned by their main ally it was
*  an operation without massive slaughter. So again, the whole point there, which was made
*  by their own allies, is it was not safe to proceed against in a military attack on Rafah.
*  So anyway you look at it, they don't actually have any excuses. Where does Joe Biden has
*  publicly stated red lines than now? Now let's listen to Bushra Khalidi from Oxfam describing
*  You have teams in Gaza. What more can you tell us about what happened in Rafah itself?
*  There are no more words really to explain how horrific the images we woke up to this
*  morning. I don't only have colleagues, I also have friends. I've got my in-laws that are
*  in Gaza. I mean the sheer panic and fear of this just culminating further. We saw images
*  of children blown up to pieces, burnt to crisp and I'm sorry to be graphic but that
*  is what we saw this morning. We woke up to more images of destruction and death and a
*  whole camp of tents on fire. These are displaced people, these are people that have experienced
*  relentless bombings. They are likely to have lost their homes. They're sheltering in somewhere
*  they think is safe although we have said numerous times how nowhere in Gaza is safe.
*  It's appalling, it's horrific and it needs to stop and we thought that this was going
*  to be the red line. We thought that with the ICJ order member states would really take
*  this upon themselves to really impose measures to stop the Rafah incursion. Yet what we're
*  seeing is more death, more destruction in the last standing city of Gaza. Listen to
*  this Palestinian man's testimony. I lost five family members. We were sitting in tents when
*  suddenly the camp was bombed. I lost five family members all burned completely. Among
*  the victims were pregnant women. They kept telling us this area was safe until we're
*  bombed. Listen to this too from Al Jazeera. On Sunday at least eight Israeli missiles
*  struck a tent camp in Rafah housing dozens of displaced families in an area the Israeli
*  military itself had designated as a safe zone. The airstrike sparked a fire killing dozens
*  of people, most of them women and children. Witnesses say some were trapped inside these
*  tents and burned alive. Trapped in tents and burned alive. It's not really possible to
*  imagine the terror, the horror, the pain of the last moments those people had alive.
*  Now let me read this post by Hamze Atta, a Palestinian journalist based in Luxembourg.
*  Israel burnt five members of my family's death in Rafah, the safe zone, when it bombed
*  their tents. One, Wissam Al Atta, 29 years old. Two, Hindari Al Atta, 29 years old. Hamada
*  Al Atta, 35 years old. Mesa Al Atta, 32 years old. Miada Al Atta, 23 years old. Let's try
*  and remember some of those names. Those people are people who lived, who loved, who feared,
*  who hoped, who wept, who laughed, who argued, who hugged, who had dreams for the future
*  as they lived the nightmares of their present. They deserved better, so much better, than
*  to be burned alive as the world's most powerful nations did nothing but aid and abet their
*  murder. The children who've been butchered remain faceless, not treated as children like
*  the ones you have or your loved ones or neighbours have like the children who play down the street.
*  So let's see some of those kids.
*  Now look, if this was an atrocity that had just been committed by Russian forces, burning
*  alive dozens of refugees, including little kids, and we are staring at the bodies incinerated
*  of, of incinerated children and headless babies, there would be justified screams of outrage
*  and disgust from Western leaders and media outlets. It would be used as key central evidence
*  that Vladimir Putin is one of the great monsters of our age. But when Palestinians are burned
*  alive by Israel, the best that can be hoped for is hand wringing and Israeli lies and
*  attempts at deflection and mudding the waters being indulged. There hasn't even been an
*  attempt to disguise how little worth is attached to Palestinian life. So those who backed Israel's
*  murderous onslaught and now scroll past the charred bodies of kids in your timeline trying
*  to reassure yourself this is not on you, you didn't sign up for this. Yes you did. Israel's
*  political and military leaders could not have been clearer from the start that they were
*  planning one of the great crimes of our age. From the very beginning, they made blood-curdling
*  promises while slaughtering Palestinian civilians from the very start, it should be said. You
*  either chose not to listen or you ignored them. More realistically, you made a conscious
*  choice that you did not believe Palestinian life had anything like the same value as Israeli
*  life and you acted on that choice. Political, media and public figures in this country and
*  other countries aided and abetted one of the worst crimes of our age. And when they were
*  not given, when they were they not given more prior warning of what was to happen than most
*  crimes in history. You could have put pressure on your government to use its leverage over
*  Israel. You chose not to. Now mass protests in Paris have broken out in response. We can
*  see huge numbers there who took to the streets in disgust and horror and fury at what has
*  happened in Ra'aqa and of course demands for this horror to end. But you know what
*  I still can't over that? What I still can't forgive? It isn't the ones who still cheer
*  up this obscenity on who I regard as depraved beyond redemption. It's those who remain
*  silent, who won't speak out and describe this crime for what it is except for hand
*  wringing, futile meaningless hand wringing. That's why I listened to this by the South
*  African influencer, Candice King. And let's just say it struck a chord.
*  This is a monster. People are burning right now. Their bodies. Can you imagine the smell?
*  There were just rumors of babies being beheaded by Hamas. No one saw pictures. These were
*  just rumors and the world went crazy. But there are photos and pictures of beheaded
*  babies in Ra'aqa. The beheaded babies should draw the line for us all. And if it hasn't
*  drawn a line for you, you are fucked. You're cooked. You're cooked. I'm not crazy. You're
*  crazy because you're not doing anything and you think this is normal. Me right now, this
*  is normal behavior. You're not acting normal. You can see that stuff and stay silent. You're
*  crazy. You should lose your mind. In fact, if you're not going to lose your mind, I urge
*  me to be a psychopath.
*  Well, that is a far more normal response to children being burned alive with Western complicity
*  than saying nothing, than feeling nothing, than looking away and pretending it isn't
*  happening. It's hard not to feel like you're not going mad when you live through one of
*  the great crimes of our age and there are so many people who could use their power to
*  stop it who are doing nothing. Now, I read this poem from Fida Hazanat posted by the
*  Gaza Poets Society. It was a night. The tents wept over the bodies of children they couldn't
*  shield from the bombs. And I must confess, I sobbed when I read that. All I just want
*  to finally say is this. If you're British, you do actually have power right now. There's
*  an election now. Tories are going to lose badly, deservedly so. Labor are going to
*  win no matter what. But despite the hand-wringing, they refuse to support any actual action like
*  ending arms sales to Israel as a bare minimum. The Green Party, on the other hand, do support
*  that kind of action as do independent candidates like Jeremy Corbyn in the symptom North and
*  Leanne Mohamed in Ilford North. The least we can do, given the Tories are toast no matter
*  what, is to support them, to send a Labour message. Enough. Take action. Stop facilitating
*  genocide. We should act. That is a concrete thing we can do right now rather than just
*  give another blank check for the next government, which will have a huge majority to do as it
*  wants, which will mean doing nothing to stop this horror and make it stop for good.
