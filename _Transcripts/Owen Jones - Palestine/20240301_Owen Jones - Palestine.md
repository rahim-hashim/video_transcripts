# Rishi Sunak's CHILLING Speech Denouncing Gaza Protesters Exposes Sinister Plan
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [March 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bwgp0qqAY8)
*  The world has turned upside down. I'm increasingly coming to the conclusion that the British
*  establishment are just trying to gaslight us to the verge of total madness. This evening,
*  the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced he was suddenly doing a speech outside No. 10 Downing
*  Street. When this happens, a lot of commentators go, oh, general election time, because general
*  elections are announced from election outside No. 10. Not so new. Instead, Rishi Sunak did what can
*  only be described as the speech version of a meeting that could have been a very menacing email.
*  Let's just hear a little snippet of it.
*  I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not
*  going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie.
*  I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not
*  going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to
*  lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not
*  going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to lie.
*  Okay, what's going on here then? Well, it's clear who's going to be held to account for the mass
*  slaughter of Palestinians through bombs, bullets, starvation, the destruction of Gaza's medical
*  system. It's clear who's going to be portrayed as the real dangerous bad people in all of this.
*  As Israeli soldiers shoot children in front of their parents, babies have their limbs amputated
*  about anesthetic, two mothers killed every hour, children perishing of hunger while families make
*  bread from animal feed to survive, credible reports of Palestinian women being raped by Israeli
*  soldiers, paramedics being blown up as they try and save terrified children who were then
*  themselves killed, for most of Gaza's civilian infrastructure being severely damaged or destroyed,
*  who's going to be really portrayed as the baddies, as desperately hungry Palestinians are massacred
*  as they're trying to get flour for their starving families? Who is going to be the villain in the
*  peace? You guessed it right, the people who oppose the slaughter. That's who's being portrayed in this
*  country as the real hateful extremists, those who oppose the biggest mass slaughter of children in
*  a conflict in recent times, orchestrated by a far-right government in Israel whose leaders denounce
*  the Palestinian people as human animals and Nazis and who have repeatedly issued blood curdling
*  statements about destroying Gaza and to be fair to them, oh boy have they stuck to their words.
*  Why is all this happening? You might legitimately ask, because our establishment know that the
*  scale of the crime being committed against Gaza is simply too great to hide, they know
*  that leaves them morally exposed, so they're playing a game of deflection. No, we're not the real
*  dangerous extremists, the ones who oppose the mass slaughter are the real dangerous extremists,
*  crucially as well, they're trying to silence anyone who can hold them to account over what
*  they've done, particularly as the true scale of the horror becomes ever more apparent.
*  In this speech, Senac denounces George Galloway's by-election win in Rochdale. Galloway just won
*  for a very straightforward reason, that's because Labour decided to back the mass slaughter of the
*  Palestinians, up to and including the leader of the Labour Party, Keir Starmer, backing Israel's
*  right to cut off water and energy to civilians, a war crime which he later claimed he never believed
*  despite having said it. A rational response to the Rochdale by-election is to acknowledge the
*  strength of feelings so many have about the historic crime being committed in Gaza, and I
*  say that as no fan of Galloway, to say the least, someone whose undeniable oratory skills and
*  campaigning abilities have been wasted because of the multiple reactionary political positions he's
*  taken and alliances he's made, but a Prime Minister using a national address to denounce a
*  by-election result as a threat to democracy. Yeah, that's giving sinister isn't it? Now,
*  his claim, Rishi Senac, is that extremists have taken over the streets and hijacked protests.
*  Let's just be straightforward and direct here. This is a lie. It's a manufactured deceit. The
*  mass protests in Britain, which reflect overwhelmingly public opinion, the polls consistently show that
*  support for an immediacy's file has a huge majority of support behind it. That's what this is really
*  about. The political elite see a mass movement which reflects where the public are. They resent
*  it putting pressure on them because it's effective. So they try and present that
*  pressure as dangerous, threatening extremism that has to be stopped. Now, as I keep saying,
*  it's got no relationship to the truth at all. There are very few arrests at these protests,
*  significantly fewer than large football matches. It's really wild actually when you see politicians
*  and media outlets come together to create a narrative based on the title pack of lies.
*  They just think that if you keep saying something enough times, it just becomes the truth.
*  But what we're seeing here is a case study in how authoritarianism takes hold of societies. I'm sure
*  many of you have read books or watched documentaries about how societies succumb to
*  authoritarianism. It's exactly like this. You create a moral panic about dissenting voices.
*  You portray them as dangerous extremists who will unleash terrible violence at any point unless
*  they're stopped, who threaten the entire social order and fabric and national unity, and who are
*  useful idiots or fifth columnists for hostile foreign foes. That's what's happening here.
*  You can see it. You know, I read this treat by someone called Robert Colville, who is the centre
*  of, director of the Centre for Policy Studies, a very well-connected right-wing think tank,
*  and the co-author of the 2019 Conservative Manifesto. Very revealing to say the least.
*  You see, there was a protester heckling Rishi Sunak during his speech, which a lot of journalists
*  got very annoyed at, which again, it's like, get your priorities straight. So Robert Colville
*  treated, protesters shouting angrily in the background of Sunak's speech, kind of proves his point.
*  Does it? Really? Okay, so I think this is actually quite a useful point being made here about how
*  Rishi Sunak and others are conflating the right to peaceful protest, however annoying you might
*  consider it. Peaceful protest is often seen as annoying throughout history. It's supposed to
*  annoy powerful people. Conflating the right to peaceful protest with violent intimidation.
*  It isn't even subtle. Heckling politicians is a centuries-old tradition. In a democracy,
*  you can heckle people who rule you. It comes with a package. The sort of countries where it's illegal
*  to heckle politicians, they ain't democracies. Now we already have a raft of legislation clamping
*  down on protest. The right to protest is already thoroughly demonised. We're heading in a direction
*  where the right to protest is being made impossible. That anything other than voting is being
*  portrayed as threatening and incitement. You know what's interesting? We keep seeing politicians
*  and media allies going, oh, politicians are being pressured to vote against their consciences.
*  This is intolerable in a democracy. What are you on? Have you never heard of the whipping system?
*  Political parties have whips who are in charge of discipline, whose literal job is to make
*  sure MPs don't vote according to their conscience. Indeed, they've got to track record these whips
*  in threatening politicians into voting the way they want, destroying careers, even compiling
*  dossiers on private lives with the intention of saying that if you don't vote a certain way,
*  we're going to leak your affairs buddy boy. There's no more panic about that, is there?
*  Instead, the right for people to build collective pressure on MPs is being demonised. That is a key
*  ingredient in a democracy. The idea basically is pressure and even threats are okay in a
*  democracy, but some form of collective pressure from people who aren't part of the Westminster
*  set? That's intolerable. That's tyranny. Now, a lot of our social progress was won
*  by people building pressure on politicians. They didn't like it. That's the point. But that is now
*  being construed as violence. Now look, if we're talking about extremism and division,
*  are these people just devoid of shame? No, no. No government has fostered so much division as the
*  Conservatives. That's their purpose. They're constantly trying to turn people against the hate
*  figures of the moment, generally vulnerable minorities who lack a voice to be able to defend
*  themselves, benefit claimants, migrants, refugees, trans people, we could go on. All their demagoguery
*  during the Brexit palaver, remember all that? Right-wing media allies, the Tories splashing
*  things like enemies of the people with pictures of some judges because they asked for some more
*  democratic oversight of us leaving the European Union. Crush the saboteurs, we could go on. Indeed,
*  the Tories are a cesspit of Islamophobia. They never got meaningful scrutiny of that with Boris
*  Johnson as leader after he compared Muslim women to letterboxes and bank robbers, triggering a huge
*  increase in hate crimes. But now, despite former Tory vice chair Leigh Anderson being belatedly
*  suspended over his gratuitously Islamophobic comments, which Tory ministers refused to condemn
*  as homophobic, and a load of Tory MPs were up in revolt over it, that aside, no action against
*  Suheila Bravaman, our former Home Secretary, suggesting Islamists are running the country.
*  Now the Tories are a racist party. They're an ever more extreme political party. As we see here,
*  they're becoming ever more authoritarian. They're coming for our rights and our freedoms. They were
*  won at huge cost and huge sacrifice by our ancestors who were demonised at the time as dangerous
*  extremists. It's not for us to allow those rights and freedoms won at such cost to just be
*  taken away. And for the right to protest and to put pressure on our rulers to be construed as
*  violence. This is what dictatorships do. And if you care about democracy, you should be very worried
*  indeed. Please like and subscribe, keep the show on the road on patreon.com, share this video,
