# One Of Israel's VILEST War Crimes Yet - Where Is The Media Outrage?
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE)
*  This is so depraved, so evil, that it is difficult to know where to even begin. A phrase that has [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=0.0s)]
*  often rightly been applied to the Israeli state goes like this, every accusation is a confession, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=6.32s)]
*  and this story, which in fact emerged in the Israeli media, could not underline that more [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=12.4s)]
*  hideously. It's a story which first appeared in an Israeli investigative outlet called [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  The Hotter Place in Hell, and is based on testimonies from Israeli soldiers themselves. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=22.72s)]
*  That's in Hebrew, but the Israeli-Palestinian outlet Plus 972 magazine has helpfully written [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=28.08s)]
*  out in English what the report details. Let me just read the first sentence. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=33.2s)]
*  A senior officer in the Israeli army's Nahal Brigade tied an explosive cord around the neck [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=38.0s)]
*  of an eight-year-old Palestinian man and forced him to serve as a human shield, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=43.76s)]
*  ordering him to scout out abandoned houses under threat of having his head blown off. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  After he had served his purpose, the soldiers ordered the man to flee with his wife, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=53.84s)]
*  but upon being spotted by another battalion, they were both shot dead on the spot. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=58.080000000000005s)]
*  This was last May in Zaitoun, a neighbourhood in Gaza City, which is in the north, which has been [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=62.96000000000001s)]
*  subjected of course to the worst devastation in Gaza. The Israeli soldiers were conducting a sweep [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=68.80000000000001s)]
*  of houses there, and then encountered an elderly Palestinian couple who told the soldiers, who could [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=74.48s)]
*  speak Arabic, that they could not evacuate because of their mobility issues that compelled [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=79.6s)]
*  the man to use a cane. Their children had already fled. According to one of the Israeli soldiers [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=84.24s)]
*  quoted, at that stage the commanders decided to use them as mosquitoes. Now a mosquito is a [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=90.0s)]
*  euphemism for a human shield. The Israeli military forces Palestinian civilians to protect their [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=96.32s)]
*  soldiers from say being shot or blown up by explosives. The woman was then detained in her [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=102.16s)]
*  home, but the man, again only able to walk with the help of his cane, was forced from house to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=108.24s)]
*  house. As an Israeli soldier quoted as explaining puts it, he entered each house before us so that [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=114.16s)]
*  were any explosives or a militant inside he would take the hit instead of us. This is already [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  depraved behaviour and intolerable war crime, but listen to this detail. Before the Kowur sweep began, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=126.39999999999999s)]
*  one of the officers took a detonation cord, that is an explosive fuse, which is used to connect [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=131.6s)]
*  charges and explosives and then according to Plus 972 magazine, attached it to an initiating [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=136.0s)]
*  charge and tied it around the elderly man's neck so as this soldier put it, so he wouldn't run away [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=140.72s)]
*  even though he was walking with a cane. He was told that if he did anything wrong or didn't follow [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=145.84s)]
*  orders, the soldier behind him would pull the cord and his head would be torn from his body. This went [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=150.56s)]
*  on for eight hours. The soldiers then brought this elderly man back to his home and then ordered both [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=157.04s)]
*  him and his wife to flee by foot to the so-called humanitarian zone in southern Gaza. Crucially, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=164.72s)]
*  the soldiers did not inform the nearby soldiers that an elderly couple was about to cross through [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=170.4s)]
*  that area. According to the soldier, after 100 metres, the other battalion saw them and [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=174.8s)]
*  immediately shot them. They died like that in the street. Now the Israeli rescue outlet, the hottest [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=180.96s)]
*  place in hell, further relays testimonies from soldiers about the army's open fire regulations, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=187.68s)]
*  which state that any Palestinian, whoever they are, found moving in a combat area after the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=195.04s)]
*  designated evacuation time has passed is considered an enemy combatant. So this elderly couple were [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  automatically considered enemy combatants by Israeli soldiers and killed. Plus 972 [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=204.24s)]
*  magazine state this is denied by the IDF, they give that short shrift correctly. It is just [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  worth for a minute pausing to reflect on something. A man who was at least 80 years old in Gaza was [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=215.12s)]
*  born in 1946 or 1945 or earlier. This man as a small child would have survived the Nakba, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  the violent expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homes as Israel was founded, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  in which around 15,000 Palestinians were killed and 531 Palestinian towns and villages were wiped [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=233.52s)]
*  from the face of the earth. Statistically, he is likely to have been a child refugee whose [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=239.76s)]
*  family fled the Nakba, because the vast majority of Gaza's population are the families of those [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=244.64s)]
*  who fled then. He would have survived the 1967 war when Israel seized Gaza and the West Bank, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=249.04s)]
*  he would have survived decades of Israeli occupation, he survived the siege of Gaza, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=255.04s)]
*  the longest siege of our age, he survived multiple brutal onslaughts on Gaza by Israel. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=259.2s)]
*  He survived all of that, and his last moments on earth, this frail elderly man with poor mobility, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=265.84s)]
*  his last moments on earth in the apocalyptic ruin of Gaza were Israeli soldiers tying a detonation [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=270.71999999999997s)]
*  cord around his neck to force him to be a human shield, used to go from house to house to check [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=276.32s)]
*  for unexploded devices each time not knowing if he was going to be blown up by such a device with [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=281.68s)]
*  a threat of the Israeli soldiers blowing his head off with an explosive cord if he didn't comply. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=286.0s)]
*  And after hours and hours and hours of that terror, that sheer terror, he was told to flee [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=291.03999999999996s)]
*  alongside his elderly wife, presumably who he'd been married to for so many decades and gone [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=295.52s)]
*  through so much together knowing what his likely fate would be before they were gunned down after [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=300.24s)]
*  a few metres together. I resent having to play this sordid game which is based on the total [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=305.12s)]
*  dehumanisation of Palestinians in which their lives are stripped of all meaning and all worth, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=310.08s)]
*  but just imagine Hamas militants had done this to an elderly Israeli couple in their 80s. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=314.71999999999997s)]
*  This atrocity alone would be deemed as conclusive evidence of Hamas' utter depravity, it's evil, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=319.28s)]
*  indeed it would be offered up as evidence of Hamas perpetrating the worst possible evil that [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=325.2s)]
*  humanity is capable of. But this is not said about the Israeli state and its armed forces, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=330.8s)]
*  instead Western governments continue to arm a military committing these obscenities, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=335.92s)]
*  and our media outlets overwhelmingly continue to cheerlead and whitewash what this military [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=341.2s)]
*  is doing. And this is surely the tip of the iceberg. We know that Israel has wiped Gaza [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=347.59999999999997s)]
*  from the face of the earth and we know about multiple atrocities, but this is one atrocity [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=354.16s)]
*  from last May. And yes it happens to have been brought to light this time, but how many such [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=358.96000000000004s)]
*  crimes are not being reported? Why would they be in the main? Israeli soldiers would have to come [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=364.8s)]
*  forward and discuss the crimes that they've committed. And no, you can't just say, oh this [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=370.72s)]
*  is one-off, you know, maybe it's some rogue soldier. It was an entire unit, it was their commander [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=375.12s)]
*  who ordered this to happen. A group of soldiers and their commander did this together. Obviously [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=381.28s)]
*  no one objected to any meaningful extent to stop this from happening. They all took part in it, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=387.91999999999996s)]
*  it went on for hours. How many other such crimes are happening? And also what does it tell us about [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=394.15999999999997s)]
*  the death toll? Who would have reported them dead? How, you know, how they reported dead to be [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=400.47999999999996s)]
*  included in the official statistics? By who? Which brings us back, by the way, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=406.64s)]
*  this brings us back to every accusation is a confession. Last August, the Israeli newspaper [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=411.76s)]
*  Haaretz published an investigation headlined, Israeli army uses Palestinian civilians to inspect [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=418.15999999999997s)]
*  potentially booby-trapped tunnels in Gaza. The investigation stated random Palestinians have [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=423.36s)]
*  been used by Israeli army units in the Gaza Strip for one purpose, to serve as human shields [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=428.47999999999996s)]
*  for soldiers during operations. It goes on, our lives are more important than their lives, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=434.4s)]
*  soldiers were told. The thinking is that it's better for the Israeli soldiers to remain alive [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=439.67999999999995s)]
*  and for the Shra'ashim, the names they use, to be the ones blown up by an explosive device. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=443.91999999999996s)]
*  That's the term Shra'ashim used to describe these human shields. Other newspaper outlets, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=450.08s)]
*  which are otherwise overwhelmingly biased towards Israel, have similarly reported on this crime. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=455.28s)]
*  Last October, the New York Times published a report headlined how Israel's army uses [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=460.08s)]
*  Palestinians as human shields in Gaza with a subheading which gives you the gist. Israeli [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=464.4s)]
*  soldiers and Palestinian former detainees, say troops, have regularly, regularly forced captured [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=469.2s)]
*  Gazans to carry out life threatening tasks, including inside Hamas tunnels. The same month, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=474.71999999999997s)]
*  CNN also published a story headlined the Israeli military has used Palestinians as human shields [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=479.91999999999996s)]
*  in Gaza, soldier and former detainees say. The next month, the Washington Post published [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=484.79999999999995s)]
*  Israeli forces use civilians as human shields in Gaza, Palestinians and soldiers say. Before [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=489.84s)]
*  you give a cookie to these media outlets, yes, you always have had, I've said this from the beginning, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=495.44s)]
*  you can find examples of good journalism about what Israel's atrocities are, what it's doing to [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=500.08s)]
*  the people of Gaza and beyond in these sorts of outlets. But they are orphaned, by which I mean, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=505.35999999999996s)]
*  they are not woven into the overall reporting of what's happened. They are outliers, which are not [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=510.71999999999997s)]
*  given proper prominence. And therefore, you know, the notion of Israel using human shields [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=516.48s)]
*  is not something which is then understood and processed with a consensus as an established fact. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=522.64s)]
*  Instead, overwhelmingly, by contrast, the whole narrative in human shields is focused on claims [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=529.76s)]
*  that Hamas uses them. And this is a narrative used to justify wiping Gaza from the face of the earth [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=534.32s)]
*  and slaughtering civilians. On the grounds all of this death and destruction is really caused [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=539.6800000000001s)]
*  because civilians are being placed in harm's way by Hamas. Now, strikingly, the definition of [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=544.0s)]
*  human shield here is completely different. There was a lot of goalposts moving here, I can assure [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=549.12s)]
*  you, because this is referring actually to military targets being in close proximity to civilian areas [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=552.96s)]
*  and to civilians. This is unhinged nonsense. Gaza is one of the most densely populated lands on earth, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=558.48s)]
*  and if we're going to go there, Mossad and IDF headquarters are also located slap bang in the [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=564.08s)]
*  middle of civilian areas. Are Israeli civilians being used as human shields? For example, when [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=568.8s)]
*  Iranian missiles could potentially have blown one of those up. It is entirely right to hold Hamas [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=574.3199999999999s)]
*  to account for war crimes committed against Israeli civilians. The evidence for the use of human [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=580.56s)]
*  shields, however, simply isn't there. In the 2009 Israeli onslaught on Gaza, Human Rights Watch [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=584.9599999999999s)]
*  established the following. In the killings documented in this report, Human Rights Watch [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=591.8399999999999s)]
*  found no evidence that the civilian victims were used by Palestinian fighters as human shields or [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=596.24s)]
*  shot in the crossfire between opposing forces. In each of the incidents, Israeli forces appeared in [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=601.44s)]
*  control and Palestinian fighters had left the area in question. The civilian victims were in [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=606.24s)]
*  plain view and proposed no apparent security threat. In the 2014 Israeli onslaught on Gaza, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=611.52s)]
*  Amnesty wrote, Amnesty International, the other human rights organization who do so much work, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=618.24s)]
*  obviously in this area, they wrote, Amnesty does not have evidence at this point that [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=623.12s)]
*  Palestinian civilians have been intentionally used by Hamas Palestinian armed groups during [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=627.28s)]
*  the current hostilities to shield specific locations or military personnel or equipment [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QxbxkgJAE&t=632.08s)]
