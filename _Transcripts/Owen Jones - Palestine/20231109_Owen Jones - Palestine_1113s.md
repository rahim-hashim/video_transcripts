# Suella Braverman's UNHINGED NONSENSE Taken Apart
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [November 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE)
*  So, Anna Braverman. Oh my word. We really do have a live one here, don't we? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=0.0s)]
*  Now, she is on the rampage, to say the least, whipping up bile, hatred and division, as is her want. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=4.64s)]
*  That is her modus operandi. Nothing new there, but she's taking that to a whole new level. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=10.0s)]
*  Basically, she's trying to use the movement against the mass slaughter of innocent people in Palestine, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=14.88s)]
*  with the direct complicity of our government, to further that particular kink of hers. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=19.2s)]
*  I think we can put it that way. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=26.0s)]
*  Many say she's trying to get sacked, so she can be a martyr to the right-wing cause and then become [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=27.28s)]
*  leader of the Conservative Party. Whatever. Whether she's leader or not, the Conservative Party [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=32.72s)]
*  belongs to her now. She's won the battle of ideas, it dances to her tune, the Conservatives that is. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=37.44s)]
*  Now, she's penned an article for the Times newspaper about the protest this Saturday [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=42.72s)]
*  against the massacre, which she tried to get banned. Unlucky Sweller, that failed. Dry your eyes, mate. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=46.56s)]
*  This article is unhinged, even by her standards. I'm going to go through it and just show how [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=53.36s)]
*  unhinged it is and expose these arguments for what they are. She speaks about the long-established [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=58.4s)]
*  traditions of freedom of expression, including freedom of assembly, the right to protest [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=63.36s)]
*  in public as a cornerstone of our democracy. That is why peaceful marches are never banned, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=68.08s)]
*  and even controversial and disruptive ones are police rather than blocked. I agree with her. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=72.56s)]
*  That's the only part of the article we're going to agree on, about freedom of expression and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=76.24s)]
*  freedom of assembly and the right to protest in public being a cornerstone of our democracy. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=80.24s)]
*  These rights, by the way, were won. They were fought for at huge cost and sacrificed by ordinary [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=84.47999999999999s)]
*  people who defied authority, who defied the likes of Suella Bravman throughout history. They were [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  not given to us as acts of beneficence, of generosity, of charity by the powerful. They [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=96.32s)]
*  didn't wake up one day and think, oh, let's give the people the right to protest. We had to fight [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=101.36s)]
*  for them. It's so important that we know that. When she talks about peaceful marches never being [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=106.24s)]
*  banned or controversial, firstly, what a load of hypocrisy, given what she has done, for example, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=110.32s)]
*  with the policing bill, is tried to drive through repressive legislation or has done repressive [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=116.08s)]
*  legislation which cracks down on the right to protest. That was under her predecessor, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=121.19999999999999s)]
*  but she supported it and she's continued to support and enforce laws which crack down on the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=126.08s)]
*  basic right of peaceful protest. She doesn't believe in it. I mean, the government have even [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=131.76s)]
*  introduced legislation which cracks down on protests if they are too noisy. Protests are, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=136.39999999999998s)]
*  by definition, noisy. They don't believe in the right to protest and any claim to the country is [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  a nonsense. Now, she says, the way the law works is clear. If a chief constable believes there's a [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=146.95999999999998s)]
*  serious risk of disorder, which the police will struggle to contain, he or she can ask the home [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  secretary to ban a march. Now, unlucky for her, there is no serious risk of disorder. That's the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=156.88s)]
*  problem. If there was, the Metropolitan Police would ban it because the Metropolitan Police, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=162.4s)]
*  despite the fact she and her allies are trying to portray the Metropolitan Police as some sort of [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  den of leftiness and woke, they don't like protesters. I know that because I've been on [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=172.96s)]
*  so many protests and the Metropolitan Police often crack down, I have done, in the most brutal way [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  possible within their powers. They don't like these protests. The point is, if they had an [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=184.4s)]
*  excuse, if they thought they had intelligence to justify banning the protest, they would do it like [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=190.8s)]
*  that in a heartbeat. But the fact is, if they do it without reason, they'll be dragged through the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=195.36s)]
*  courts and they will lose. They will have to, there'll be a court, a process, they get taken to court [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=201.36s)]
*  and then they have to explain in front of the court why they banned the protest. They have to [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=208.48000000000002s)]
*  offer the evidence in public for why they did so. If the evidence isn't there, they are buggered. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=211.68s)]
*  And that's the point. The police are not standing their ground against the Weller-Bravoman and the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=217.12s)]
*  government because they suddenly have become uber liberals who believe in democratic freedoms. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=220.88s)]
*  They don't think they have a leg to stand on. And the reason they don't think they have a leg to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=226.48s)]
*  stand on is because they do not. Now, she goes on, there is a debate to be had about whether other [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=230.48s)]
*  considerations should play a part in such decisions. Are some public displays so offensive they deserve [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=235.6s)]
*  to be banned? Is there a level of disruption into the life of a city that is too great to justify [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=240.72s)]
*  demonstration? Nevertheless, the law as it stands makes it clear that marches should always, always [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=245.04s)]
*  be permitted. Well, it's clear what's happening here. What she means is the existing law is wrong [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=250.4s)]
*  because she wants to clamp down on the right to protest. That's the debate she wants. Should we [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=255.04s)]
*  basically be allowed to protest? That's the debate she wants. She wants a police state. That's what [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=259.92s)]
*  she's hinting at. That's not hyperbole. Clearly, she wants the police to have sweeping powers to [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=264.08s)]
*  just scrap protests on a whim. I mean, this talk about if a protest is deemed so offensive. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=269.84s)]
*  All this time for the last few years, the left has been accused of shutting down free speech [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=277.03999999999996s)]
*  by trying to silence things that cause us offense. That is literally the entire moral, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=281.91999999999996s)]
*  sorry, the whole basis of the moral panic about free speech and so-called cancel culture. Now, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=287.59999999999997s)]
*  it is a nonsense. It generally means powerful people who think free speech means saying anything [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=292.88s)]
*  you want without any consequence that no one can even criticize you because that's an attack [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=297.44s)]
*  on your free speech. So they scream at us, don't they, from their newspaper columns, TV studios, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=301.6s)]
*  from radio interviews, from book deals. We're silenced. We're silenced. A megaphone in our ears [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=306.24s)]
*  about how silenced these powerful people are. But often it's just because their latest column, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=311.6s)]
*  Bating Refugees or Trans People, or another largely voiceless and marginalized minority, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  got quote tweeted by a teenager on Twitter who has rightly embarrassed them by being much younger [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=321.44s)]
*  but more informed and less bigoted than they are. So let's just be honest. They want to shut down [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=326.56s)]
*  our protest in solidarity with the Palestinian people because they are offended by it. I get that. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=331.44s)]
*  Protests are always going to cause offense to the powerful. That's kind of the point. We're [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=335.76s)]
*  using our collective power to challenge the powerful. In this case, because the British [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=339.12s)]
*  government is directly aiding and abetting a massacre. They are arming and supporting Israel [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=343.2s)]
*  as it slaughters well over 10,000 people, including well over 4,000 children. That is [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=347.92s)]
*  an underestimate. Another human rights group, an independent human rights group, believes it's well [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=353.92s)]
*  over 13,000 because, and I'm sorry to have to say this, the figures don't include decomposing [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=358.16s)]
*  bodies buried in the rubble currently being eaten by starving dogs. Now that is not a pleasant thing [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=363.28000000000003s)]
*  for me to have to say. But if the reality of this horror is sanitized, then we are not going to turn [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=367.68s)]
*  public opinion around in terms of they are on our side in support of a ceasefire. But we want people [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=372.64s)]
*  to have an urgency about what we do to force the government to shift their position. Now, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=378.64s)]
*  many more will die, not just because of missiles. Likely most will die of other causes. This is a [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=383.92s)]
*  human made humanitarian catastrophe. No clean water, lack of food, medicine, collapsing healthcare [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=389.28000000000003s)]
*  system, disease, untreated illnesses, pregnant women without medical care, as well as cancer [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=394.72s)]
*  patients, those with underlying serious health conditions. We could go on. Now, if I was being [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=400.24s)]
*  accused of being an accomplice to that kind of horror, however factually grounded it might be, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=405.12s)]
*  I'd be offended. Damn right you'd be offended, wouldn't you? Now, the way to avoid this scenario [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=408.88s)]
*  is simply not to be an accomplice to mass murder. But alas, Bravamen has made a rather different [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=413.84000000000003s)]
*  life decision. Now, if we went down Bravamen's route, virtually all protests would be banned [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=420.88s)]
*  because some powerful people would find them offensive. Now, she goes on to speak of Hamas's [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=424.96s)]
*  atrocity, which should be rightly condemned. I have over and over again. And as a nation, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=430.48s)]
*  we're united in doing so. It's just many of us, in fact most of us, don't believe the answer is [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=435.04s)]
*  collective punishment and killing at least 10 times as many innocent civilians as those Israeli [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=439.92s)]
*  civilians killed on October 7th. And indeed it's likely to be more than 13 times and indeed many [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=446.0s)]
*  more times to come. She says there have been dignified vigils in London held by Britain's [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=452.0s)]
*  Jewish community, but that is not what has tested our capacity to maintain public order. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=456.32s)]
*  These vigils are absolutely crucial. Of course they should be defended. They are different [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=461.44s)]
*  from protests, which are about using our collective power to advance demands rather than, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=464.8s)]
*  quite rightly specifically, about mourning the dead, including those so brutally murdered by [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=469.52s)]
*  Hamas on the 7th of October. She goes on, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=474.71999999999997s)]
*  of violence around the fringes, but because of the highly offensive content of chants, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=486.32s)]
*  posters and stickers, this is not a time for naivety. We have seen with our eyes [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=489.68s)]
*  that terrorists have been valorised, Israel has been demonised as Nazis and Jews have been [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=493.59999999999997s)]
*  threatened with further massacres. What a load of cries and lies, load of nonsense, load of gibberish, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=497.84s)]
*  load of bollocks from Soella Bravaman. Now hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=501.68s)]
*  On the biggest demonstration in which up to half a million people marched, there were how many [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=506.88s)]
*  arrests? A thousand arrests, five hundred arrests, a hundred arrests, fifty arrests, ten arrests. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=511.44s)]
*  That's a lower arrest rate than the average football match. Now, if you go to these protests [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=515.6s)]
*  and see them with your own eyes, rather than rely on the deceitful claims of politicians and media [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=521.12s)]
*  outlets, you'll see something more akin to a family day out. You'll see people from all backgrounds [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=525.04s)]
*  marching together, Muslims, Christians, non-believers, hello, and Jewish people. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=529.76s)]
*  A crucial point, Jewish peace protesters have always been a crucial part of every demonstration. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=533.84s)]
*  They have directly organised their own protests since this all began. There is a Jewish bloc [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=539.68s)]
*  meeting this Saturday at the Simon Bolivar statue in Belgrave Square. It will be a significant size [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=546.0s)]
*  that bloc. When she says violence on the fringes are nonsense, any violence at these peace marches [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=552.16s)]
*  will be lower than the sorts of violence you routinely get on London's streets. In fact, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=557.1999999999999s)]
*  they almost certainly lower these protests, the rates of violence, simply by clearing the streets [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=561.28s)]
*  and flooding them with peace protesters. Now, she says, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=565.44s)]
*  offensive chants, posters and stickers. I went up the length and breadth of these protests and I did [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=568.32s)]
*  not see them. And I know what an offensive, people go, well, you don't know what, like you probably, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=572.8000000000001s)]
*  you don't think an actually offensive chant or poster or sticker is offensive. That's not true. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=576.6400000000001s)]
*  I'm well aware that we need desperately to have protests that offer reassurance and inclusion to [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=582.0s)]
*  Jewish people in this country and beyond. The point is they were crawling these protests with cops, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=588.32s)]
*  with a mandate to arrest anyone showing support for Hamas or Hezbollah, and they couldn't find [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=594.0s)]
*  them either. Now, there's a panic, a moral panic about the chant from the river to the sea, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=598.16s)]
*  Palestine will be free, an intentionally misconstrued phrase because the vast majority [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=603.52s)]
*  simply mean that Palestinians will be free from the river to the sea. And that means, for example, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=607.76s)]
*  either a two state solution where you have an independent, viable Palestinian state based on [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=614.0s)]
*  the pre-1967 borders, or instead you have a one state secular solution with one vote, one citizen. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=618.8s)]
*  Now that might seem far off, but it's not viable in the here and now, but it's a legitimate thing [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=626.4s)]
*  to argue for. But that's the point. They're trying to misconstrue these sorts of arguments. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=631.92s)]
*  Now she claims Jews were threatened with further massacres on these demonstrations. Such a vile, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=636.8s)]
*  baseless, nonsense claim, and actually a dangerous claim because it's whipping up fear. It makes [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=641.04s)]
*  people scared. You shouldn't throw these things around without solid evidence. Now she goes on, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=648.08s)]
*  each weekend has been worse than the previous one. Last Saturday in central London, police were [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=654.5600000000001s)]
*  attacked with fireworks. Train services were brought to a halt by demonstrators and poppy sellers [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=658.32s)]
*  were mobbed and prevented from raising funds for veterans. Now last Saturday, there wasn't a [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=663.2800000000001s)]
*  nationally organised demo. People were told to take part in their own local activities. I mean, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=666.88s)]
*  no one was injured in these, by the way. It's so important to say this. The few who agreed fireworks, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=671.76s)]
*  as she describes it. Well, to be blunt here, what you get in nationally organised protest is you have [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=676.72s)]
*  stewards, which make sure the protest happens in an orderly and a peaceful way. If you ban protests, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=683.6s)]
*  then you still get these other protests, which don't have stewards organising them. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=689.52s)]
*  Now as so many travelled that day, this last Saturday from London Euston, which was full of [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=694.56s)]
*  protesters, to Manchester Piccadilly, also full of protesters, my journey wasn't impeded. As for [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=698.96s)]
*  poppy sellers, trying to portray protesters as threats to poppy sellers is a baseless nonsense, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=704.32s)]
*  but also train stations are often crowded at peak times. I mean, you get football matches. Are they [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=708.5600000000001s)]
*  deemed a mortal threat to poppy sellers? A lot of people go on these protests, wear poppies. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=712.6400000000001s)]
*  Now she goes on, as we approach a particularly significant weekend of the life of our nation, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=716.8000000000001s)]
*  one which calls for respect and commemoration, the hate marchers, a phrase I do not resign from, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=720.5600000000001s)]
*  intend to use armistice day to pray through London in yet another show of strength. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=725.0400000000001s)]
*  Hate marchers, there she goes. She's the hate preacher, the most notorious hate preacher in [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=728.4000000000001s)]
*  the country. He describes immigration as a mortal threat to civilisation, called migrants or hurricane, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=732.08s)]
*  which is a natural disaster which kills people in large numbers. It goes on about numbers of kids [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=737.36s)]
*  born to foreign born mothers in order to scare people. Now, you know, she's the one full of [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=742.8000000000001s)]
*  hatred. I think we need to be clear about this. As for armistice day, the march starts two hours [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=748.0s)]
*  after the two minute silence. It goes nowhere near the Cenotaph. We march from Hyde Park to [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=752.4000000000001s)]
*  the US Embassy. On armistice day, I'll be remembering my great great uncle. He was mowed down on the Somme [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=756.48s)]
*  at the age of 19, the youngest of seven. My great granddad, he died in the Royal Air Force in 1942 [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=761.52s)]
*  during that war. My granddad, he was in the Merchant Navy, which are the second highest [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=767.4399999999999s)]
*  level of attrition after the RAF. His boat was sunk twice. He survived on an open boat for 10 days. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=772.24s)]
*  I'm remembering all those killed in wars, including those who have been killed right now, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=778.4s)]
*  as were many who will be marching. Many others have relative lost in war. It's not a rare thing, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=782.96s)]
*  is it, for British people living in this country to have lost relatives in war. And there'll be [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=787.92s)]
*  service personnel who'll be marching. I know of several. Now, you know, this idea on armistice [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=792.7199999999999s)]
*  day when it falls on a Saturday that the nation stops, that's never happened. What better way to [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=797.52s)]
*  mark a day on which war ended than to call for another war to end? As Harry Patch, the last [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=801.68s)]
*  surviving Tommy put it, war is organised, murder and nothing else. Who could look at the mass graves [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=807.76s)]
*  of Gaza and conclude anything else? As for a show of strength, we protest every Saturday. That's the [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=812.24s)]
*  tradition of protests. It's on a Saturday because people have working kids, so they can't take part [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=817.04s)]
*  otherwise. You know, and people don't generally do on a Sunday, we can't do it on an armistice, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=821.52s)]
*  we can't do it on Remembrance Sunday. I think everyone would agree on that. We're showing the [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=824.88s)]
*  strength of opinion. Just 3% oppose a permanent ceasefire. The same number who believe the earth [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=828.48s)]
*  is flat. Now she goes on. Here we reach the heart of the matter. I do not believe these marches are [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=833.28s)]
*  merely a cry for help for Gaza. They are an assertion of primacy by certain groups, particularly [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=837.76s)]
*  Islamists of the kind we're more used to seeing in Northern Ireland, also disturbingly reminiscent [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=842.16s)]
*  Ulster are the reports that some of Saturday's march group organisers have links to terrorist [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=846.8s)]
*  groups including Hamas. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What happened there, Densoella? We truly have gone off [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=850.4799999999999s)]
*  on the deep end, haven't we? You deranged lunatic. Firstly, what comparisons is she trying to make [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=854.24s)]
*  here in Northern Ireland? Does she know anything about Northern Ireland? An assertion of primacy [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=858.56s)]
*  by certain groups. This only makes sense if she's comparing protesters, what, with the loyalists [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=862.4799999999999s)]
*  or in Georgia and their intentionally provocative marches through Catholic or nationalist areas [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=867.68s)]
*  based on sectarianism? Is she doing that? She want a war with the Northern Ireland unionists [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=872.08s)]
*  that the Tories have always backed. Bit of a weird flex there, Soella. But the crux of the matter is [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=876.72s)]
*  this. She's trying to whip up bigotry against Muslims. That's the only interpretation that I [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=880.72s)]
*  think is valid. That's what's happening here. That many Muslims take part is not surprising [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=886.08s)]
*  because many Muslims are currently being slaughtered. Not exclusively. Christians too. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=890.72s)]
*  The Christian community going back to the fourth century in Gaza is at risk of being destroyed [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=895.2800000000001s)]
*  forever. Now she wants us to think Muslims are dangerous, violent, disloyal extremists on these [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=899.44s)]
*  protests. But they're marching against violence. That's the point. They're marching against violence [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=904.32s)]
*  that's backed by the government. They're marching against mass death aided and abetted by Braverman [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=908.72s)]
*  and her colleagues. They come with their families. You have elderly British Muslims. You have little [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=913.0400000000001s)]
*  kids. They're driven as families, as citizens by the same motives as anyone else. They don't like [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=917.12s)]
*  this violence and this massacre. So disgusting attempt by Braverman to use Gaza to whip up conflict, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=923.0400000000001s)]
*  to divide our communities and to turn us against our neighbors. And here's the thing. There are [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=928.4s)]
*  extremists marching this Saturday. The far right, they're mobilizing. She's not saying anything [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=932.48s)]
*  about them because she's fueling them. They back Israel's mass slaughter. They like Sulema Braverman. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=936.4s)]
*  They see us, those of us marching against mass murder in exactly the same way as Braverman sees [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=941.04s)]
*  us. She's giving them legitimacy. She's encouraging them to see us as fair game. And do you know what? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=945.68s)]
*  I'll say this. If anything happens to any of us at the hands of these people, then that hate [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=950.4s)]
*  preacher, Sulema Braverman, squatting in the home office, I'll tell you this, mark my words. We will [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=954.56s)]
*  hold you personally responsible and accountable for anything that happens. She then claims [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=959.04s)]
*  preposterously, unfortunately, there's a perception that senior police officers play favorites when it [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=964.0s)]
*  comes to protesters. During COVID, why was it that lockdown objectives were given no quarter by public [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=968.7199999999999s)]
*  order police, yet Black Lives Matters demonstrators were enabled, allowed to break rules and even [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=973.1999999999999s)]
*  greeted with officers taking the knee? Are you on crack? I mean, I'm just playing a game of Ocon's [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=977.5999999999999s)]
*  razor here and working out the simplest, likeliest explanation for this insanity. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=982.08s)]
*  The Met has repeatedly been found, including by a recent government inquiry, to be institutionally [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=987.0400000000001s)]
*  racist and institutionally homophobic and misogynist. You think the Met, the Metropolitan [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=994.1600000000001s)]
*  Police of Viddelwood Sympathy for BLM. It's a lie. A report in 2020 found that the Metropolitan [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=999.9200000000001s)]
*  Police's policing of the BLM protests was itself institutionally racist, including excessive [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=1006.6400000000001s)]
*  force, including horse charges, one of which rendered a woman unconscious, baton charges, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=1011.84s)]
*  pepper spray and violent arrest was commonly reported and well evidenced. Why are you lying, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=1015.84s)]
*  Suella? Right-wing and nationalist protesters, she goes on to say, who engage in aggression are [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=1019.6800000000001s)]
*  rightly met with a stern response, yet pro-Palestinian mobs displaying almost identical behavior are [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=1024.96s)]
*  largely ignored even when they're clearly breaking the law. Now, she goes, this is a load of gibberish. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=1030.48s)]
*  The police have always come down like a ton of bricks on the left's protests. Now, she talks [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=1034.48s)]
*  about how football fans are treated. Football fans can be treated really badly, working-class [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=1039.92s)]
*  fans throughout history treated terribly by the police, but she's playing divide and rule here. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=1044.48s)]
*  She's not trying to make police less severe than anyone. She wants them to be more severe [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=1048.64s)]
*  and harder. That's what she wants. Now, she goes on that if the march goes ahead this weekend, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=1054.5600000000002s)]
*  the public will expect to see an assertive and proactive approach to any displays of hate, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=1059.04s)]
*  breaches, conditions and gender disorder. There we have it. She wants the cops to overreact. She [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=1062.64s)]
*  wants them to cause confrontation. We know in previous protests, things go downhill when the [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=1066.4s)]
*  cops behave like this. She's trying to whip up bile and hatred and division. Now, the far right [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=1070.72s)]
*  may end up doing her job for her, but look, they're losing the battle for public opinion. They know [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=1075.1200000000001s)]
*  most of us back as ceasefire. They're trying to turn the tables, to turn the world upside down, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=1079.2800000000002s)]
*  that the real extremists are the ones who oppose the mass murder of little children. The real [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=1083.52s)]
*  moderates are the ones who support it. It's not true. It's the other way around. So, we should [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=1088.5600000000002s)]
*  respond to Suela in exactly the right way. We should turn out in great numbers this week, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=1092.16s)]
*  this Saturday. We bring our friends, our relatives, our loved ones, our colleagues, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=1095.76s)]
*  our acquaintances, just drag random people off the streets. Defy her and this government and come [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=1099.0400000000002s)]
*  full of peace and determination to stand by the Palestinian people in their darkest hour. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yahc3nEa1kE&t=1103.76s)]
