# LEAKED: Israel's War Machine Exposed
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [December 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs)
*  Hello, we are now over two months into the horror, which is of course, enveloped Gaza since the 7th of October attack on Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=0.0s)]
*  And the number of civilians who've died is biblical in nature. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=7.8s)]
*  And reliable, credible estimates suggest perhaps 1% of Gaza's population has been killed since the 7th of October. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=13.36s)]
*  Now, a brilliant piece of investigative journalism, and it really is superb and everyone should read it by plus 972 mag and local call. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=22.52s)]
*  Which is entitled a mass assassination factory inside Israel's calculated bombing of Gaza, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=30.4s)]
*  exposes from the inside based on sources working in Israel's intelligence community corroborated by Palestinian testimonies and using data, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=35.52s)]
*  crucially, how this machine works, this factory. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=44.28s)]
*  And I'm delighted to have Yuval Abraham and Israeli investigative journalists who worked on this fantastic piece of work. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=48.28s)]
*  Firstly, hello Yuval, great to speak to you. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=54.6s)]
*  Hi, it's good to be here. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=56.64s)]
*  Thank you, Owen. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=57.879999999999995s)]
*  So firstly, these sources, how did you get these sources located in the intelligence community? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=59.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it took a while. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=67.16s)]
*  I think there are a few reasons why they agreed to speak. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=70.8s)]
*  I think one reason is that really the scale of the destruction now happening in Gaza is so, so big. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=73.96s)]
*  We all can see it, right? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=82.48s)]
*  That even people who are part of that system were there felt like they were shocked. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=84.8s)]
*  They all came after the collective trauma, the massacres of Hamas on October 7. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=92.08s)]
*  But as they began to see what they were asked to do, many sources felt that it was honestly unjustifiable. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=96.28s)]
*  And there's a lot of Israeli journalists who are now being critical of the military. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=105.24s)]
*  It's almost a taboo subject. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=112.75999999999999s)]
*  And we at Plus972 Magazine, we are a Palestinian-Israeli media outlet. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  We're very, very critical. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=118.19999999999999s)]
*  And yeah, that's pretty much. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=120.32s)]
*  Can you explain what you uncovered? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=123.56s)]
*  How this, what you describe as a mass assassination factory, how does it work in practical terms? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=125.32s)]
*  Sure, yes. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=132.68s)]
*  So the term mass assassination factory alludes to this trend in the military that has been going on for the past few years. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=133.68s)]
*  To really automate a large part of the target creation process in Gaza. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  So not all of that process is automated, but large parts are automated. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=148.16s)]
*  Now, you know, Gaza is under Israeli control. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=152.84s)]
*  It's under occupation. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=156.68s)]
*  Israel controls, obviously, the electromagnetic space, the airspace, the land, the sea, who gets in, what gets in. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=157.68s)]
*  And that creates an opportunity for basically accessing almost infinite amounts of information. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=165.48000000000002s)]
*  When you have almost endless amounts of information and you have artificial intelligence and automated software to sort of try to make targets for bombing from this information, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=172.72s)]
*  that allows Israel to carry out, you know, assassinations on a massive scale, knowingly killing the process, hundreds and thousands of civilians. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=185.52s)]
*  So, yeah, that's in a nutshell. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=195.52s)]
*  There's a lot to it. So, yeah. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=198.88s)]
*  So in that, I mean, one of the things you discuss is how the ratio of what is seen as an acceptable number of civilians per military target has shifted. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=200.88s)]
*  So before it would have been dozens, but now it's hundreds per military target. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=209.83999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you know, so one of the sources that I spoke with was actually shocked by this said that he actually cried when he was talking about this. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=214.35999999999999s)]
*  And he said that there are now knowingly allowed to kill several hundred Palestinian civilians in order to carry out an assassination attempt against one senior commander of Hamas. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=223.28s)]
*  And this, you know, changed because the army has this concept called collateral damage degrees, which is the way the army regulates the killing of civilians. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=239.56s)]
*  So this was in place also in previous operations. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=251.2s)]
*  So if soldiers know that they are now operating under collateral damage degree number five, then they know that alongside every target, they are allowed by the military, authorized to kill five civilians or less. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=253.28s)]
*  In this operation, after October 7th, really many of these protocols were abandoned, as you said, from dozens to hundreds of civilians being knowingly killed. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=266.48s)]
*  And also in terms of just the protocol, right, one source recalled how they would get a pinpointing of the target where, you know, a target is safe for assassination and it's not accurate. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=275.67999999999995s)]
*  So they're not sure. It's a very wide radius. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=285.59999999999997s)]
*  Right. In the past, protocol would say, well, we have to pinpoint it because we're dropping bombs that are burning houses. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=287.64s)]
*  So now that source says they were often just bombing very wide radiuses, not spending time to save time, right? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=295.03999999999996s)]
*  Not spending time. And again, knowingly, the killing of civilians happens knowingly. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=302.56s)]
*  They know they are going to kill civilians in the process. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=307.44s)]
*  It's not a mistake. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=310.24s)]
*  In terms of when we just find a military target. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=314.0s)]
*  Now, some might think to themselves, we're talking there, maybe someone at the very core of a Hamas leadership. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=318.04s)]
*  But how's that defined? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=324.0s)]
*  Because in this work, it suggests this could actually be a Hamas member who isn't actually particularly consequential, is judged to be an acceptable target. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=325.2s)]
*  And they're targeted at home, not in a tunnel, for example. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=335.72s)]
*  And that may well include wiping out their entire family, including a baby, children. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=339.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=346.52s)]
*  Yeah. So obviously, there are many different categories of targets, right? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=347.96s)]
*  Some could be more legitimate under international law, some could be less legitimate. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=351.16s)]
*  I think what you've described for me is, you know, and I think the investigation suggests it is an extremely illegitimate target where you knowingly drop a bomb that weighs a ton on a house of somebody who is part of Hamas's military army. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=354.48s)]
*  But they are not in a place where fighting actually takes place, right? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=371.32000000000005s)]
*  They're at home. And you kill not only that person. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=375.88s)]
*  You kill all of his family members and often all the neighbors in the building. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=380.08000000000004s)]
*  One source that actually did this told me that when he was doing it, he thought it would be like if when Israeli soldiers go back home on the weekend to their families and go to sleep and meet their parents and a militant group would bomb their homes, killing all of their families and then claim that they were using their family as human shields. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=384.84000000000003s)]
*  And when you have AI and when you have these capabilities to sort of create these sorts of targets on a massive, massive scale, that could be partially. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=407.68s)]
*  It's not the only reason, but part of the reason why the destruction in Gaza is so, so massive right now. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=416.91999999999996s)]
*  One of the sources you quote, this really struck me, nothing happens by accident when a three year old girl is killed in a home in Gaza is because someone in the army decided it wasn't a big deal for her to be killed, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=425.03999999999996s)]
*  that it was a price worth paying in order to hit another target. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=434.88s)]
*  We are not Hamas. These are not random rockets. Everything is intentional. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=437.76s)]
*  We know exactly how much collateral damage there is in every home. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=441.15999999999997s)]
*  So it's not as though they bomb, our house is bombed, they're like, well, we find it afterwards. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=445.11999999999995s)]
*  Oh, whoops. But actually in advance that is known. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=450.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. It's part of the way you create targets. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=454.44s)]
*  Like you're going to say, you know, the target has this and this amount of people in it. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=457.59999999999997s)]
*  And I think what's interesting, I mean, I mean, what you said is a completely accurate quote. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=462.8s)]
*  And what's interesting is that that source actually used the words a three year old child with me. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=466.44s)]
*  And that shows that that source was really thinking it's true in the military. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=472.71999999999997s)]
*  You know, nobody's going to say child. Right. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=477.84s)]
*  They say a word in Hebrew is called a Naza. That's what they say. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=480.84s)]
*  And it basically is an abbreviation of collateral damage. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=484.6s)]
*  So it's spoken about as as really, you know, oh, how much NASA does the target have? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=487.92s)]
*  It has eight. Well, let's see if we can make it five. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=493.08s)]
*  Oh, so it the language that is used in these spaces, obviously dehumanizes it. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=495.71999999999997s)]
*  It masks reality. And I think and I feel this personally as well. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=504.71999999999997s)]
*  You know, I have a good friend in Gaza who lost, you know, all of his family were killed by Israel. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=508.48s)]
*  And for me, we all talk about politics all the time. Right. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=516.72s)]
*  But for me, this is also a very emotional thing. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=519.6800000000001s)]
*  If you if you have empathy for humans who are living there, you cannot accept this war tactic. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=522.32s)]
*  It's impossible. You know, you you cannot rationalize it. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=528.48s)]
*  And I'm OK. We can rationalize. We can talk rationales. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=531.64s)]
*  I'm completely fine with it. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=534.1600000000001s)]
*  But it's important to remember, I think, that the human emotional side of it and how you need to mask that, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=536.48s)]
*  you know, in order to carry out such a policy. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=541.44s)]
*  One of the big narratives of this whole hideous horror show, which has been going on for the last two months, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=544.52s)]
*  goes like this, that Hamas goes out of its way to deliberately kill innocent civilians despite its public denials. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=549.8000000000001s)]
*  I've watched myself video footage of them killing innocent civilians. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=557.64s)]
*  Israel, on the other hand, does not seek to kill innocent civilians. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=561.88s)]
*  If innocent civilians are killed, that is unfortunate, but it is not the intention of Israel. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=566.96s)]
*  And therefore, there is a moral distinction, even if the scale of killing by Israel is much, much bigger. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=572.16s)]
*  What does your work tell us about that whole narrative and that claimed moral distinction? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=577.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's an excellent question. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=583.76s)]
*  I've been really thinking about it myself for quite some time. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=585.4399999999999s)]
*  I have two responses for you. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=589.04s)]
*  I mean, the first is that I think that from the perspective of the child, right, that is being killed, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=591.68s)]
*  whether it is by Hamas or by Israel, right, it doesn't really matter. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=596.12s)]
*  Like when we look at the mother that her children died, do they care how that happened? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=600.76s)]
*  So that's the first thing. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=609.0s)]
*  The second thing is that it is true. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=610.8s)]
*  I mean, this idea of intentionality is playing such a major role in the way the West understands violence and in international law as well. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=612.96s)]
*  But I think that when you look at a system like Israel system where you have a loose definition of what a military target is, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=623.68s)]
*  when you knowingly, right, you knowingly are not killing, you know, a few, you're killing hundreds of civilians knowingly to strike one target. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=632.8s)]
*  When you can do that, you can multiply that, you know, using artificial intelligence. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=641.48s)]
*  When you have all of these factors combined, does intentionality even matter anymore? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=646.4399999999999s)]
*  Or does it play such a big role as we ascribe to it? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=652.24s)]
*  I personally think that my evidence suggests that it doesn't, right. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=655.88s)]
*  There is a complete this, you know, I hear it from not one source, I'm talking to seven. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=659.12s)]
*  There is a disregard for Palestinian civilian life. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=665.36s)]
*  This is I think the only thing that sort of limits Israeli actions and international audiences should know this. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=668.36s)]
*  The only thing is international pressure, especially US pressure, but also countries like the UK. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=678.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I can go. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=687.24s)]
*  Well, linked to that is the question of terrorism, because Hamas is obviously officially classified as a terrorist organisation by the UK, the US and the European Union. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=691.0s)]
*  And of course, if you use violence against civilian populations in order to achieve political goals, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=701.0799999999999s)]
*  well, I mean, you can see why the definition of terrorism is reached. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=707.92s)]
*  But the issue here is what you talk about in the brilliant piece of work you've done called the Dahya doctrine, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=712.36s)]
*  which was initially enacted in the second Lebanon War 2006. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=719.9599999999999s)]
*  And this is regarding something called power targets, which I'll ask you to define, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=725.64s)]
*  where over a thousand more than thousand power targets were caught. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=729.12s)]
*  The idea of causing mass devastation to civilian areas for strategic purposes. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=732.36s)]
*  And the idea was that this would create a civilian from civil society in Lebanon or indeed in Gaza, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=738.0400000000001s)]
*  where people would put public pressure on either Hezbollah in Lebanon or on Hamas in Gaza. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=745.64s)]
*  And I suppose I would put you firstly, obviously define power targets. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=752.6800000000001s)]
*  Secondly, isn't that terrorism? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=755.36s)]
*  If you're using violence against civilians in order to achieve a political goal, what's the difference? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=757.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you know, so power targets are officially defined by the military. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=766.0s)]
*  The official narrative is that it's high rise buildings. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=771.8s)]
*  So it's residential high rises. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=775.4s)]
*  You know, Gaza has one of the most densely populated places on earth. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=776.92s)]
*  70 percent of the population are refugees. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=780.68s)]
*  So they don't have their building up. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=782.8s)]
*  So there are a lot of these high rises. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=784.92s)]
*  And the military says, you know, we're bombing these high rises. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=786.5999999999999s)]
*  They have said so in the past because there is something in the building that we have marked as a military target. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=789.0799999999999s)]
*  And that legitimizes the bombing of that building. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=795.24s)]
*  Now, I've spoken to three independent sources in Israeli intelligence who have been previous operations, not in this one, previous ones, either planned or bombed power targets. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=798.4s)]
*  So they have a deep knowledge of this tactic. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=809.48s)]
*  And they told me that not only was the idea here to place to bomb these high rises, you evacuate the families, but you destroy the entire high rise back in the time, right? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=811.92s)]
*  To put civilian to put pressure on civilian society. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=825.16s)]
*  The concept of having a military target in the high rise was used as a way to mask that. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=829.12s)]
*  So they speak about how and it shows you again, it comes back to this idea of intentionality. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=834.8399999999999s)]
*  They would find something in the high rise that can be associated with Hamas. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=840.76s)]
*  It's not something that's considered of high military value, a spokesperson's office, OK, something like that. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=844.36s)]
*  Right. And because they have this chokehold of intelligence, because Hamas is embedded in Palestinian society, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=849.3199999999999s)]
*  because they have also built some military infrastructure in civilian areas, you can if you want to, you can pretty much, you know, mark almost not every building, but probably most of the building in Gaza and bomb them. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=856.8s)]
*  And by masking, you know, so one source said that he felt they were doing something that for him resembles terrorism, right? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=870.24s)]
*  Because he said just to just to quote that, if they would tell the whole world that Islamic T had offices on the 10th floor, not part of the target, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=876.8s)]
*  that its existence is a justification to bring down the entire high rise with the aim of pressuring civilian families who live in it in order to put pressure on terrorist organizations. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=882.32s)]
*  This would itself be seen as terrorism. And they added. So they do not say it. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=890.84s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. I mean, sources told me that they were bombing these buildings because it was a way to make civilians in Gaza feel like Hamas is losing control, right? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=895.72s)]
*  To make civilians in Gaza feel like their leadership betrays them, to make them film these super iconic high rises and post them on social media. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=905.1600000000001s)]
*  And that creates deterrence. This is the way they thought about it. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=913.9200000000001s)]
*  Now, look, in the past, in 2021, they bombed the high rise that had the AP and AFP media outlets. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=916.88s)]
*  Perhaps you remember sources have told me that was a power target. Right. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=922.3199999999999s)]
*  So in 2021, they bombed nine power targets and they evacuated them for civilians because the idea was to destroy the buildings, not kill the civilians. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=925.88s)]
*  Now, in this operation, the military has said on the fifth day that they bombed 50 percent of the targets. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=934.8s)]
*  The military bombs were defined as power targets, more than a thousand. So from nine to over a thousand. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=940.52s)]
*  Now, I haven't spoken to the sources who bombed power targets this time. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=946.4399999999999s)]
*  I don't know if the same evacuation protocols were in place. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=950.72s)]
*  Looking at the hundreds of children who were killed, looking at examples of high rises that were bombed while civilians were inside, while journalists were inside. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=954.52s)]
*  I am assuming, right. And this, I mean, investigative journalists are welcome to continue this work. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=962.2s)]
*  I think there's a lot to uncover here. I'm assuming that these power targets were bombed without the same type of evacuation protocol. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=966.52s)]
*  Again, killing civilians for a type of target that, as you say, its focus is on harming the civilian population, not a military target in previous operations. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=974.0s)]
*  And just quickly, before I ask my final question, I mean, it is striking that with such an extraordinary death toll and the official death toll, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=986.6s)]
*  which has been validated in previous conflicts because people try and discredit them because of the Hamas run administration being around 16000, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=994.6s)]
*  but their bodies buried under the rubble. So others suggest it's over 20000 now killed. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1001.84s)]
*  But probably they only think between 1000 and 3000 armed militants out of a much, much bigger force has been wiped out. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1006.2800000000001s)]
*  What does that tell us about this whole AI generated military strategy? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1014.2800000000001s)]
*  Well, I think I think in a way it helps us understand that, you know, bringing all of these intelligence officers were saying things that are quite obvious. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1019.64s)]
*  At the end of the day, it's quite obvious to anybody who looks at what's going on in Gaza, who looks at it with human eyes, who notices the data that you pointed out, who speaks to Palestinians. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1028.04s)]
*  I'm not sure. I don't think that the revelations are extraordinary in the sense that they're revealing something that probably somebody who was critical has not thought of. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1038.48s)]
*  But it shows that people in the system are also aware of this. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1047.84s)]
*  And that's important because we are hearing this narrative, right, that Israel is doing everything in its power to not harm civilians in Gaza. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1051.6s)]
*  And, you know, as an Israeli and as a journalist, I just have to say that that is not true. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1060.08s)]
*  Just finally, what I did want to allude to is and I start by just to circle back to the beginning, just in terms of how courageous. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1065.9199999999998s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure you don't like to be complimented like this. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1072.04s)]
*  And we do have to remember, of course, the very courageous Palestinian journalists actually in Gaza who are being killed with my colleagues in the British media [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1074.04s)]
*  and the Western media, most of them barely saying anything about them. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1081.04s)]
*  But it is very courageous what you're doing in the atmosphere in Israel. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1084.44s)]
*  I just want you just quickly just in terms of what the atmosphere is actually like in Israel for this kind of journalism is what appetite exists. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1087.24s)]
*  And I think partly linked to it is the fact that it's this sense of actually not only is a dehumanization, you always get in these situations. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1096.44s)]
*  It's nothing specific to this horror. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1104.6399999999999s)]
*  But the way the coverage people getting it's almost like buildings are being destroyed, but not people. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1107.24s)]
*  So just think, you know, what's the atmosphere like to publish something like this in the current given the discourse in Israel? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1112.48s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I actually spoke to my mother like two days ago and she said she feels we are the entire society is reliving October 7th again and again and again. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1119.28s)]
*  And I think you can understand that. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1130.1200000000001s)]
*  atrocities committed by Hamas, the murderers, the hostages that many of them are still there. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1132.6s)]
*  And on top of, you know, 15 years that Gaza has been under siege, complete separation, a regime of inequality and apartheid that, you know, I have I'm sitting here in Jerusalem, right? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1139.1999999999998s)]
*  Palestinians, most of them cannot even get to Jerusalem, right? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1153.1999999999998s)]
*  There is complete, complete, complete inequality between us. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1156.8s)]
*  And that has created high levels of dehumanization. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1159.8s)]
*  I think even you can see it on both sides. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1163.68s)]
*  Right. And now to come to the Israeli society with this report, most of them, I feel, didn't really care. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1165.48s)]
*  Like, you know, polls show that 60 percent of Israelis, roughly 60 percent think that the military is not using enough force in Gaza. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1174.24s)]
*  There is around one point five percent of Israelis that think that it's using too much force. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1182.1599999999999s)]
*  So we're not seeing the images that the world is seeing from Gaza on the news. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1187.0s)]
*  And we are collectively traumatized. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1191.9599999999998s)]
*  And I think, honestly, we need the help of the world to stop this war and to start addressing the core political issues at hand and reach equality and equal sovereignty between Israelis and Palestinians. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1194.2399999999998s)]
*  And there's a really brilliant point, particularly about empathy and humanity, which has been stripped away from the way we often discuss this. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1209.48s)]
*  And just finally, again, this is extremely courageous journalism. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1217.0400000000002s)]
*  I think when the history is written and what's happened, what you've done here will be an absolute core plank of what's happened. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1221.0s)]
*  It's been validated and said corroborated by the Guardian newspaper as well. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1228.6000000000001s)]
*  It was brilliant work. Thank you so much to you, Val. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1232.92s)]
*  Please like and subscribe and do share this video. Get the word out. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1235.6000000000001s)]
*  Thank you, Val. Really, really appreciate it. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1238.92s)]
*  Thank you very much. Yeah. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIbxF7GXfHs&t=1240.6000000000001s)]
