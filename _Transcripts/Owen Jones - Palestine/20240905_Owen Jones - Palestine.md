# This Palestinian Is Fighting Genocide. We Can Help Him.
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [September 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7kkf4CzkrA)
*  This is so important. Israel's genocide against the Palestinian people relies above all else
*  on their dehumanisation, that we don't think of those who are being bombed and shot and starved
*  and displaced and traumatised as fellow human beings like us, who love, feel pain, who have hopes,
*  dreams, ambitions, fears, anxieties. Their deaths become numbers, statistics, rather than each one
*  being a unique human imprint on the world, scrubbed away forever. And that's why I want to talk to you
*  about a brilliant young Palestinian man in Gaza who I've been corresponding with. His name is
*  Ahmed Mata and I'm asking you to support him. And I've included the link for his GoFundMe
*  in the video description, on YouTube, on Twitter in the description and on my Instagram in the
*  bio, the links there. Now this will help him pay for the living costs for him and his family in
*  the impossible conditions of a Gaza which is being bombed and besieged by the Israeli army
*  with the support and complicity and facilitation of our governments in the West, as well as helping
*  them to get out when the border crossing with Egypt is reopened so that they can have safety
*  from this unimaginable violence. I want to tell you about it. Please listen to this. He's 27 years
*  old. His father was killed by the Israeli army in 2003 when he was just six years old. A reminder
*  as ever that this did not all begin on the 7th of October, that the Palestinian people have suffered
*  endless atrocities at the hands of their occupiers for so long. Before this onslaught, he had finished
*  his studies at university where he had a degree in media studies driven by his passion for
*  photography and art, which really does shine through on his Instagram content. He was hoping
*  for a career in that kind of field. Now those dreams were torn apart by Israel's murderous onslaught
*  and now he has just one goal, to keep his family safe. He's lost 21 of his relatives, 21 of his
*  relatives in this horror. When I say lost, they have been killed, killed by the Israeli state.
*  Many of us would struggle to mourn if two of our loved ones were killed, but 21,
*  where do you even begin? That itself is indicative of the sheer scale of what we rightly call a
*  genocide. He and his family have been displaced six times since last October. They now live in
*  makeshift tents in Khan Yunis, lacking proper shelter to protect them from these hideous
*  conditions. Last November, his niece Taghreed was born. Imagine looking after a newborn baby
*  in these conditions, who has only known the horror of a genocidal war, and is estimated that 20,000
*  babies have been born in the apocalyptic conditions of Gaza since last October. He tells me she has
*  never known the comfort of a real home, and she has never had a single night of peaceful sleep.
*  He tells me that the conditions he and his family are enduring are beyond difficult,
*  that they lack even the most basic necessities. Food, he says, is extremely scarce, what little
*  they find is often outrageously overpriced. They struggle daily to secure enough to eat, but even
*  when they do, it's never enough. The quality is poor, forcing them to resort to primitive methods
*  to survive, scraping by with whatever they can find. He goes on, as if the lack of food and
*  shelter wasn't enough, we are now facing the spread of diseases. With no access to proper hygiene
*  products or clean water, illnesses are becoming rampant in our camp. The unsanitary conditions
*  make it nearly impossible to stay healthy, and we are constantly at risk of falling ill. This is
*  particularly terrifying given the already dire circumstances. Let me carry on reading to you
*  what he has said, what he's communicated to me. Every night, the terror continues as planes fly
*  low over our tents, adding to the immense stress and anxiety that we live with daily, especially
*  for our children. The heat during the day is unbearable, and with winter fast approaching,
*  we don't know how we will manage to survive the cold without proper shelter. We are desperately
*  trying to raise awareness about the severe hardships we face in Gaza. The lack of food,
*  the spread of diseases and the constant fear of attacks have made our lives a daily struggle.
*  We endure in the hope that the world will recognise our suffering and take action to provide
*  the relief that we so desperately need. It is so important that we hear this hideous reality.
*  It's not possible for any of us who have not lived such a hellish existence to fully comprehend
*  what it's really like. We must try as hard as we can though. You see, what Ahmed and his family
*  are going through, what the surviving population of Gaza is going through, a surviving population,
*  I'm sorry to say, which shrinks with every day, every passing day, in terms of those who
*  are being slaughtered. What they're going through is made possible because of our governments
*  and our media. Our governments arm those who have laid waste to Gaza, including destroying the homes
*  and dreams of Ahmed and his family and so many others, as well as butchering and maiming tens
*  upon tens upon tens of thousands of people. They have offered our governments diplomatic and
*  political support and aid to the Israeli state as it perpetrates one of the worst crimes of our age,
*  a genocide in plain sight. Our media meanwhile has repeatedly, shamelessly, spread the lies of
*  the Israeli state. It happens every day. It has whitewashed crimes and often failed to report on
*  crimes at all, as well as erasing the responsibility, the corpability of the Israeli state and crucially,
*  it has dehumanised the Palestinian people. It has been my firm conviction throughout this,
*  that if we can make everyone see the humanity of the Palestinian people, their innate worth
*  as human beings, being no smaller than our own, then we can stop this crime. So I'm asking you
*  to support Ahmed and his family by clicking on the GoFundMe link. And I should say, the amount
*  of money it takes to get a single person out of Gaza is huge. That's why we have to raise so much
*  money, as well as the astronomical living costs of living in this tiny besieged strip. And I'm also
*  asking you to follow him on Instagram and share his stories. Let your friends, your followers see
*  him, listen to him, know and understand what he's gone through. Let's make it encourage people
*  to speak out, to use the power we all have when we come together collectively to demand this crime,
*  this abomination, this genocide comes to an end. I promise that, that I will support him and his
*  family with my platform as best I can. But it is part of a much bigger commitment to stand
*  by the Palestinian people to the very end, to win them justice and emancipation by standing alongside
*  them, the right to determine their own future free of occupation and subjugation, and to bring to
*  account all those who have made possible one of the worst crimes of our age. And finally, that's
*  my thanks to you, Ahmed. I cannot imagine how hard things are for you and for your family and the
*  survivors of Gaza. Every day I try, every day, but I still always know it's impossible to properly
*  comprehend. But in these hideous, unimaginable, apocalyptic circumstances, your humanity,
*  your resolve, your determination shine through. And you are doing more than you know to try and
*  tell the world to stop this horror. You've done more than your bit. You've done your side of the
*  bargain. And it is incumbent on those of us who are not suffering like you and your family to do
*  all we can to spread the word, to act on our responsibility as citizens of countries facilitating
*  this crime. So thank you to Ahmed. Thank you to those of you watching and listening for doing
*  everything that you can. Please click on the GoFundMe link. Support as best you can Ahmed
*  and his family. Follow Ahmed. Spread the word, spread the message, and above all else, do everything
*  you can to stand against the genocide of the Palestinian people.
