Video Description: Israel's Netanyahu and Turkey's Erdogan have engaged in a vicious war of words, each accusing the other of mass murder. They're both right about each other - they just don't have a moral leg to stand on. But this spat had an unfortunate consequence for Netanyahu - he just accidentally confessed to genocide.

# Netanyahu Admits To Genocide (Accidentally)
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [December 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58n-pwtiIw)
*  You may have heard the expression, every accusation is a confession.
*  And in the case of the Israeli state, this phrase could frankly not be more apt.
*  Now a war of words has broken out between Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of Israel,
*  and Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the President of Turkey.
*  Now you may have seen the meme on the internet of two Spider-Men pointing at each other,
*  and this was what came to my mind when I saw this spat.
*  They both have so much in common. Both are mass murderers who have waged bloody wars
*  against peoples denied their right to national self-determination,
*  to have a state that is of their own. In the case of Erdogan, it's a war against the Kurdish people.
*  In the case of Netanyahu, of course, the Palestinians. Both have been aided and abetted
*  by Western states who have armed and backed them to the teeth, although in the case of Turkey,
*  that relationship has admittedly deteriorated, particularly over the last decade. Both have
*  justified their slaughters on the basis of fighting terrorism and atrocities committed against
*  their own civilians. Now today Turkey's Erdogan has issued the current statement.
*  They used to speak ill of Hitler. What difference do you have from Hitler? They're going to make us
*  miss Hitler. Is what this Netanyahu doing any less than what Hitler did? It is not. He is richer than
*  Hitler. He gets the support from the West. All sorts of support comes from the United States.
*  And what did they do with this support or the support? They killed more than 20,000 Garzons.
*  Now a few things here. When he says they used to speak ill of Hitler, and most of us still do,
*  what with the whole genocidal conquest of Europe, including the specific genocide
*  of the Jewish population in which two-thirds of European Jews were exterminated, as well as other
*  genocidal slaughters of Roma, disabled people, Serbs, Socialists, Communists, truly, we could go on,
*  when he says they're going to make us miss Hitler. Don't think so buddy. I think you can speak for
*  yourself there. Now you don't actually need to invoke Hitler and the Nazis to condemn Israel's
*  bloody mayhem in Gaza. It is bad enough on its own terms. Now Netanyahu has hit back. His tweet
*  is really quite something and I should warn you, it's going to raise your blood pressure. I'm giving
*  you that advance warning. He says, Erdogan, who is committing genocide against the Kurds and who
*  holds the world record for imprisoning journalists who oppose his regime, is the last person who can
*  preach morality to us. The IDF, which is the most moral army in the world, is fighting to eliminate
*  the most abhorrent and brutal terrorist organisation in the world, Hamas ISIS, which has committed
*  crimes against humanity and which Erdogan has praised and whose leaders he hosts. The most moral
*  army in the world. Goodness me. Well we will come on to that. Don't worry about that. Firstly, both
*  of them are right to accuse the others of mass murder, that being the basic underlying critique
*  of each. They just don't have a moral high ground from which to denounce the other. Netanyahu is
*  quite correct that Turkey has a notorious record when it comes to jailing journalists. I visited
*  Istanbul in 2017 and interviewed dissidents, including persecuted journalists and the relatives
*  of those locked up. But given Netanyahu's forces are now responsible for the biggest mass murder
*  of journalists ever recorded in any conflict since those records began many decades ago,
*  over 100 journalists and media workers are now estimated to have been killed in Gaza. I'm not
*  entirely convinced he's well positioned to slap down Erdogan on that front. But by accusing Erdogan
*  of genocide, Netanyahu has himself accidentally admitted to genocide. There really is no getting
*  around that. Now let's just stick to the basic facts. There's an estimated 30 to 45 million Kurds
*  lodging Kurdistan, which straddles Iraq, Iran, Syria and of course Turkey. Now today up to 20
*  million Kurds live in Turkey. They make up at least in any case a fifth of the population. Now
*  there's long been Kurdish struggles for our homeland, including under the Ottoman Empire,
*  and after Turkey became its own state there were several Kurdish uprisings which were violently
*  put down. Indeed even Erdogan apologized a decade ago for the killing of more than 13,000 Kurds by
*  the Turkish military in the late 1930s in which aerial bombings and poisoned gas were used against
*  innocent civilians. Long oppressed, the big Kurdish uprising of our time in Turkey was led by the
*  PKK or the Kurdish Workers' Party in 1984, so four decades ago almost exactly. Now between 30,000
*  and 40,000 have been killed in that time. It's difficult to know how many of those are Kurdish
*  civilians rather than say Kurdish fighters or Turkish soldiers or indeed Turkish civilians,
*  but the evidence suggests that a large majority are Kurdish civilians. It is not to let Erdogan
*  off the hook and we shouldn't do so to point out that most of those killings and indeed the worst
*  atrocities happened before his time as autocratic leader of Turkey back in the 1980s and 1990s.
*  That includes Kurdish villages which have depopulated in the 1980s and 1990s, ethnic cleansing,
*  estimated to be around 3,000 of those villages and an estimated 3 million Kurdish refugees
*  driven from their homes or internally displaced. Now Erdogan has continued this vicious war for sure
*  including many killing many innocent civilians. Indeed one rare example he expressed back in 2011
*  regret for killing 35 Kurdish civilians on the Iraqi border in an airstrike claiming it was a
*  operational mistake, but in 2017 as an example the UN declared that Turkey's military and police
*  forces had killed hundreds of people in an onslaught against Kurdish rebels in south eastern
*  Turkey and listed summary killings, torture, rape and widespread destruction of property
*  all taking place in a 17-month period so that was over 2015 to the end of 2016.
*  Now you know what even if you take the entire onslaught directed by the Turkish state against
*  the Kurdish people which was a horrendous onslaught, is a horrendous onslaught, it is very
*  damning for Netanyahu. He's incriminated himself. When the Kurdish uprising began the Kurdish
*  population in Turkey numbered over 8 million by 1995 it was 12 million today it's around 20 million.
*  Now remember between 30,000 and 40,000 have been killed, let's just assume they're mostly Kurdish
*  civilians, it's still a hideous figure. Remember these statistics disguise humanity always. Every
*  single death is a horror and tens of thousands of deaths is an obscenity. It should be rightly
*  regarded as such. So if we say there were 30,000 Kurdish civilians killed out of a population
*  which was 8 million in 1985 then 12 million a decade later and now 20 million, let's stick to
*  those statistics. Now according to the Euromed Human Rights Monitor an independent NGO based in
*  Geneva nearly 30,000 Palestinians, overwhelmingly civilians, have been killed in Gaza in 80 days or
*  so. Now they have a higher figure than the official figure which is somewhere over 20,000 because they
*  include those buried under the rubble who have not been officially certified as dead. I'm afraid to
*  say they clearly are dead which is why we should use that figure. Before Israel's onslaught began
*  there were 2.2 million Palestinians or so in Gaza so 30,000 overwhelmingly civilian Palestinians have
*  been killed in 11 and a half weeks that out of a population originally of 2.2 million. There's
*  another point to be made here and I think this is an important point that we're talking about violent
*  deaths here in Gaza but as the UN aid experts and others are pointing out and specialist experts in
*  war most people in these situations don't die because of the actual violence, they die because
*  of the collapsed healthcare, the lack of food and clean water, all of these are huge problems in Gaza
*  so you know Benjamin S. Nye himself has said that the war has only just begun it has many months to
*  come so we're talking about this death toll which doesn't include those who will drive hunger of
*  untreated underlying health conditions of those injured but who can't get treatment
*  and the collapse basically of civilization in in Gaza and we're already on around 30,000.
*  A comparable number of Kurds have been killed by the Turkish state over a much much longer
*  period we're talking for decades here and the percentage of Palestinians killed is much much
*  higher and again most of these crimes were not committed by Erdogan even though he certainly
*  committed his own. While in Turkey a proportion of Kurds were driven from their homes to cities
*  the vast majority of the Palestinian population has been driven from their homes in Gaza almost
*  all of them much of Gaza has been wiped from the face of the earth and Benjamin Netanyahu is openly
*  discussing permanently driving out the Palestinian population his government has been using openly
*  genocidal language from so-called human animals to Netanyahu favorably quoting the story of Amalek
*  from the Bible in which God orders the Israelites to avenge the Amalek nation by killing every man,
*  woman, child and baby. This is not simply an accusation from Netanyahu it's a confession
*  if Turkey is guilty of genocide then what of Israel what has been done to Gaza is far far
*  worse than yes the terrible crimes committed against the Turkish people. There's another point
*  here as well in terms of hoisting certainly apologists for Israel from their own petard
*  because many of those defenders apologists of Israel have said that accusations of genocide
*  cannot be true and they point to how Gaza's population has increased over the last few
*  decades. Now firstly this is just a ludicrous argument full stop because the the thrust of
*  the argument about genocide focuses on the onslaught against Gaza since 7th of October
*  we know that places hugely afflicted by poverty birth rates tend to be higher and also where would
*  this leave for example Stalin's Russia, Stalin's Soviet Union because when Stalin was dictator
*  there were famines, the great purge, the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union which killed 27 million
*  Soviets soldiers and civilians a huge atrocious loss of life and yet the Soviet population even
*  if you exclude those for example Baltic states the Soviets annexed was higher in 1953 than in
*  1924 does that mean that the great purges the the famines the Nazi invasion didn't happen?
*  Ludicrous. Now as for when he talks about the Netanyahu the most moral army in the world oh
*  yeah wiping out so many innocent civilians wiping out entire bloodlines from the planet
*  committing almost every possible war crime collective punishment forcible displacement
*  as well as accusations which must be urgently investigated of summary executions torture
*  the full works indeed there's no more appropriate way to end than to look at this video posted by
*  an Israeli soldier in a neighborhood of Gaza looking at it all you can see is total destruction
*  just rubble and a few remains a crime of historic proportions aided and abetted by western governments
*  who backed and armed Israel and western media outlets who whitewashed war crimes in many cases
*  openly cheering them on and refusing to speak out and call this for what it is whether we let
*  them get away with that well that's up to us please like subscribe do support this keep us
