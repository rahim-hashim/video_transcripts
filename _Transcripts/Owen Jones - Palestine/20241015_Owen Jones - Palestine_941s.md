# Biden Administration Just Admitted Genocidal Complicity: Don't Be Fooled By Letter To Israel
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288)
*  This really is truly deeply cynical, shameless stuff by the Biden administration in the United [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=0.0s)]
*  States. It is desperate stuff and it is also a confession and it is a confession in US complicity [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=6.0s)]
*  in genocide. Now, this is a letter which has been released. It's a letter from the US administration [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  to Yoav Galan. He is Israel's defense minister. Now, there is a request for an arrest warrant [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=21.2s)]
*  against Galan by the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor. That arrest warrant is pending. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=28.48s)]
*  Principally, it's on the grounds of the deliberate starvation of the Palestinian people in Gaza. So, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=34.08s)]
*  war crimes and crimes against humanity. That request was made five months ago. We are waiting [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=41.52s)]
*  for the pretrial judges to accept that request, but keep it at the front of your mind when we [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  talk about this. Now, the letter to Yoav Galan is written on behalf of the US secretary of state, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=54.24s)]
*  Antony Blinken, whose role has included, among other things, constantly sowing the illusion that [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, is interested in a ceasefire when he clearly is not, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=66.16s)]
*  and the US defense minister, Lloyd Austin, all of which, of course, all of them have stood squarely [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=72.48s)]
*  behind the US policy of arming Israel to the teeth while it commits some of the most heinous crimes [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=78.72s)]
*  of our age. Now, the letter notes previous correspondence from April, six months ago, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=83.52s)]
*  from Blinken to Galan, emphasizing that in accordance with US law and policy, the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=88.8s)]
*  Department of State of Defense must continually assess the Israeli government's adherence to the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=93.52s)]
*  March 2024 assurances that, and I quote, Israel would facilitate and not arbitrarily deny, restrict, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=98.24s)]
*  or otherwise impede, directly or indirectly, the transport or delivery of United States humanitarian [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  assistance, and US government supported international efforts to provide humanitarian [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=111.12s)]
*  assistance to and within Gaza. They note here the legal revisions of the Foreign Assistance Act [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=115.44s)]
*  in the US. Bear this in mind, it means that the US must immediately end arms to any state, which is [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=123.2s)]
*  impeding US sanctioned humanitarian aid as a matter of law. Now, this letter declares, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=130.8s)]
*  we are now writing to underscore the US government's deep concern over the deteriorating [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=136.96s)]
*  humanitarian situation in Gaza and seek urgent and sustained actions by your government this month [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=141.36s)]
*  to reverse this trajectory. They now declare basic facts about the humanitarian catastrophe, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=146.8s)]
*  which have been loudly reported to the world for many, many months since this began, by the United [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=151.84s)]
*  Nations, by NGOs, by aid workers, by those journalists who decided not to be complicit in [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=157.36s)]
*  genocide. They say in this letter, the humanitarian situation for over 2 million civilians in Gaza is [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=162.4s)]
*  increasingly dire. Despite the July transition from combat operations to special counter-terrorism [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=168.16s)]
*  operations in the Gaza Strip, multiple evacuation orders have forced 1.7 million people into a narrow [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=173.36s)]
*  coastal zone from Awasi to Deir al-Palah. Extreme air crowding has put these civilians at high risk [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  of lethal contagion. Humanitarian implementers report that they are unable to meet essential [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=186.72s)]
*  survival needs of aid-dependent civilians. Trucks carrying humanitarian commodities, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=191.2s)]
*  including perishable goods funded by the United States, are delayed at crossing platforms. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=195.83999999999997s)]
*  I am losing my mind reading this letter. I'm losing my mind. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=201.92s)]
*  Which I'll explain. Let me continue, if popular pressure allows it. We are particularly concerned [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=205.76s)]
*  that recent actions by the Israeli government, including halting commercial imports, denying or [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=211.2s)]
*  impeding nearly 90% of humanitarian movements between northern and southern Gaza in September, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=215.52s)]
*  continuing burdensome and excessive dual-use restrictions, and instituting new vetting and [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=221.12s)]
*  onerous liability and customs requirements for humanitarian staff and shipments, together with [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=225.84s)]
*  increasing lawlessness and looting, are contributing to an accelerated deterioration in Gaza conditions. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=231.04000000000002s)]
*  It goes on to say that since Israel's assurances early in the year, the amount of aid delivered [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=238.08s)]
*  has dropped by more than 50%. And that the amount of assistance entering Gaza in September [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=241.76s)]
*  was the lowest of any month through the past year. What they should also note is Israel has [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=246.23999999999998s)]
*  waged war against Gaza's food production and its agriculture. It's not just about the fall in [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=251.76s)]
*  humanitarian aid getting in. Gaza's ability to produce its own food. I mean, many of those workers [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=258.56s)]
*  have been killed. Those agricultural workers, those food production workers. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=266.64s)]
*  But Gaza's ability to create, grow its own food as well. The Israeli state has waged war on that. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=270.96000000000004s)]
*  The needs of that population have obviously drastically grown. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=278.72s)]
*  So you've got to bear all that in mind. They haven't bothered to talk about that, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=283.44000000000005s)]
*  but they are completely genocide. So that's really the least of their problems, I would say. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=286.48s)]
*  They also say to reverse this downward humanitarian trajectory and remain consistent with [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=290.08000000000004s)]
*  its assurances, Israel must act immediately and within the next 30 days on the following concrete [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=293.92s)]
*  measures. Failure to demonstrate a sustained commitment to implementing and maintaining these [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=298.96s)]
*  measures may have implications for US policy under NSM 20 and relevant US law. Now, the next 30 days, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=303.2s)]
*  which conveniently enough happened to be after the US presidential elections. That's what they talk [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=312.32s)]
*  about. The next 30 days. I think this is really important when they talk about that. Because [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=317.35999999999996s)]
*  some have interpreted this, first of all, as an arms embargo or the threat of an arms embargo, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=322.4s)]
*  but they don't actually say that at all. There is no commitment to take such a legally necessary [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=329.76s)]
*  step, just that they say there could be implications, but in practice that can be nothing. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=335.76s)]
*  And they wait until after the election. It happens. Now they talk, they go through what Israel needs [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=339.67999999999995s)]
*  to be doing. For example, enabling a minimum of 350 trucks per day to enter Gaza through upholding [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=347.2s)]
*  its prior commitment to allow assistance to enter Gaza, consisting through all four major crossings, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=354.64s)]
*  as well as opening a new fifth. Allowing people in the humanitarian zone to move in before winter. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=358.96s)]
*  Instituting adequate humanitarian pauses, enhanced security for fixed humanitarian sites and movements [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=364.96s)]
*  Israel keeps bombing the police in Gaza, which are necessary to protect the humanitarian convoys with [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=370.64s)]
*  predictable consequences. Rescinding evacuation orders when there's no operational need. The [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=378.24s)]
*  constant evacuation orders, which cause massive displacement, obviously have a huge impact on the [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=382.64s)]
*  ability of the people of Gaza to meet their basic needs. Facilitating rapid implementation of the [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=388.72s)]
*  world program winter logistics plan to repair roads. I mean, this is the thing, the destruction [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=395.2s)]
*  of roads infrastructure can't get, can't get the aid around. Ensuring Israeli coordination, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=398.48s)]
*  liaison officers can communicate with humanitarian convoys at checkpoints. I mean, constantly [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=406.48s)]
*  blocking aid at checkpoints, aren't they? Removing restrictions on the use of contained and closed [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=410.64000000000004s)]
*  trucks. I mean, this is just another means they just keep coming up with these bureaucratic hurdles. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=414.16s)]
*  I mean, that's the, that's the point there to prevent food and aid from getting in. Provide [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=419.6s)]
*  expedited clearance processing at the port of Ashdod for Gaza bound humanitarian citizens. Well, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=425.04s)]
*  what they do is they keep process, they, they, they make processing dragged out. So it can be [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=429.68s)]
*  weeks and weeks of just aid, just sitting there without going through. I mean, they go through [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=434.32s)]
*  all of this again, end isolation in northern Gaza, ensure that there are commercial and Jordan armed [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=439.44s)]
*  force corridors, functioning at full, in continuous capacity, reinstating a minimum of 50 to 100 [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=446.08000000000004s)]
*  commercial trucks. Yeah, these are all talking about all the different means which Israel has [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=453.44s)]
*  used to stop aid from getting in and being able to be distributed in Gaza, which have been [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=459.04s)]
*  unbelievably obvious all the way through. The US is admitting that Israel has waged a deliberate [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=464.32s)]
*  and conscious attempt to deprive the Palestinian people in Gaza of the essentials of life, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=471.68s)]
*  including food. That is an attempt to commit genocide. Obviously, you're depriving an entire [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=476.4s)]
*  civilian population of the basics of life for a year. What is that other than genocidal behaviour? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=485.12s)]
*  So the only element of genocidal behaviour is a very important one. I mean, the destruction of [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=492.79999999999995s)]
*  the hospital system, the mass destruction of civilian infrastructure, the mass slaughter of [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=496.88s)]
*  civilians. Well, news slash US administration, the Israeli government has sought to do this [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=501.68s)]
*  all the way through this last year. You have addressed this letter to Yoav Galan, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=507.44s)]
*  the Israeli defence minister. On 9th October 2023, he declared Israel was imposing a complete [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=511.12s)]
*  siege on Gaza. No electricity, no food, no water, no fuel. Everything is closed. We are fighting [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=516.5600000000001s)]
*  human animals and we're acting accordingly. Do you know what? I think that was a bit of a clue [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=521.6s)]
*  in hindsight, just reading between the lines there. I know Galan was being very subtle, very indirect. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=525.52s)]
*  Truly, you have to be a linguistic expert to pass through those sentences to work out what the hell [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=530.08s)]
*  he was talking about. I think the defence minister does seem to have appeared to have announced a [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=539.6s)]
*  complete siege over Gaza and its population over a year ago. A population he clearly referred to as [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=544.1600000000001s)]
*  human animals in support of a policy of collective punishment. And just in case that wasn't clear [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=552.4000000000001s)]
*  enough, maybe he wanted what he said fleshed out a bit. On the same day, Major General Ghassan [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=557.84s)]
*  Alleyan, Israeli army coordinator of Koga, coordinator of government activities in the [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=563.6s)]
*  territories. That is the Israeli general charged with the occupied territories. He declared, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=568.96s)]
*  Hamas became ISIS and the citizens of Gaza are celebrating. Instead of being horrified, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=575.76s)]
*  human animals are dealt with accordingly. Israel has imposed a total blockade on Gaza. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=581.6s)]
*  No electricity, no water, just damage. You wanted hell, you will get hell. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=588.16s)]
*  I know you have to be some sort of mind reader to work out what this guy was saying, but it does [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=596.5600000000001s)]
*  seem to be the case that he was declaring Israel has imposed a total blockade on Gaza on the 9th [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=600.4s)]
*  of October 2023. This guy tries to be specific. Candid. I was going to say respect for him, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=607.6s)]
*  but let's not. Clearly saying no electricity, no water, but he does say there will be something. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=617.36s)]
*  He said just damage. You wanted hell, you will get hell. That's addressed to the civilian population. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=623.2s)]
*  If you are professionally choosy enough to pretend that Ghassan was not calling the [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=629.12s)]
*  Palestinian population human animals, Major General Ghassan Alleyan was awfully kind enough [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=632.4s)]
*  to make it clear the Israeli state absolutely did mean that Palestinian civilians were human [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=636.64s)]
*  animals who deserved collective punishment in the form of a total siege of the basic needs of life. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=641.76s)]
*  Last December, the UN Secretary General declared the conditions for the effective delivery [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=650.08s)]
*  of humanitarian aid no longer exist. That same month, South Africa filed a case alleging genocide [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=654.56s)]
*  against Israel at the International Court of Justice and guess what? Israel's siege of Gaza [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=660.72s)]
*  was a key plank of their entire case. In fleshing out their case of genocidal intent, they said, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=665.6s)]
*  that intent is also properly to be inferred from the nature and conduct of Israel's military [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=671.6800000000001s)]
*  operation in Gaza, having regarded into aliyah, to Israel's failure to provide or ensure essential [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=676.5600000000001s)]
*  food, water, medicine, fuel, shelter and other humanitarian assistance for the besieged and [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=683.28s)]
*  blockaded Palestinian people which has pushed them to the brink of famine. Indeed, as the occupying [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=688.64s)]
*  power, Israel has legal responsibilities, a legal duty to ensure the humanitarian needs of Gaza's [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=694.56s)]
*  population are met. The International Court of Justice, the world's highest court, then in January [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=702.4s)]
*  issued provisional orders to Israel. One of them demanded they take immediate and effective measures [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=707.4399999999999s)]
*  to protect Palestinians in Gaza from the risk of genocide by ensuring sufficient humanitarian [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=714.0s)]
*  assistance and basic services were enabled. All the way from the beginning, NGOs have repeatedly [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=719.92s)]
*  said Israel is blocking aid from getting into Gaza. In February, Amnesty International said Israel was [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=727.68s)]
*  failing to comply with the provisional order of the International Court of Justice to allow adequate [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=734.4799999999999s)]
*  humanitarian aid to reach Gaza. There's one example. Oxfam similarly condemned Israel for blocking aid. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=740.16s)]
*  Back in March, and repeatedly, Human Rights Watch repeatedly made this argument, declaring all the [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=749.92s)]
*  way back last year that Israel was using starvation, as they put it, as a weapon of war. In March of [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=756.4799999999999s)]
*  this year, the British Conservative Foreign Secretary, Lord David Cameron, published correspondence [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=763.68s)]
*  addressed at Lissie Kearns, the then Conservative Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=769.1999999999999s)]
*  United Kingdom. Again, him, himself, a Conservative Foreign Minister, outlining in detail how the [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=774.3199999999999s)]
*  Israeli state had deliberately prevented humanitarian aid from getting into Gaza. He goes through all [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=782.88s)]
*  sorts of ruses used by the Israeli state to prevent aid from getting in. And don't praise him for it. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=788.24s)]
*  Again, that's a confession by him. In May of this year, the ICC Chief Prosecutor, as I said, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=799.4399999999999s)]
*  issued those arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Yov Galant centring on Israel's policy [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=804.64s)]
*  of deliberate starvation. Crucially, we also know from last month, the US investigative journal [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=810.0s)]
*  ProPublica, that the US Agency for International Development and the State Department's Refugee [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=815.68s)]
*  Agency this spring gave detailed assessments to Secretary of State Blinken that Israel was [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=820.08s)]
*  deliberately blocking food and medicine from entering Gaza, necessitating the imposition [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=824.88s)]
*  of an arms embargo. But Blinken disregarded this and covered up what they said. This letter, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=830.16s)]
*  this letter from the US administration is a confession. Anyone who wasn't an apologist [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=838.72s)]
*  for Israel's genocide knew that Israel was deliberately starving the civilian population [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=845.12s)]
*  of Gaza of all the necessities of life as a conscious strategy. The US administration [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=851.36s)]
*  has officially confirmed this, but they still continue to arm and support Israel, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=858.4s)]
*  just as they have all the way through this genocidal rampage. That's why it's not just [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=862.8000000000001s)]
*  Israeli leaders who belong in the dock. This letter offers key evidence that US leaders knew [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=867.2s)]
*  what was happening. They knew what they were doing. They cannot claim ignorance. They knew [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=873.84s)]
*  what Israel was doing and they carried on with their complicity anyway. That is the basic fact. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=879.2s)]
*  That's what this letter says. It doesn't say anything meaningful and tangible. It says what [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=885.36s)]
*  we already knew, but it makes clear the US knows that Israel has attempted to starve [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=891.12s)]
*  the civilian population of the basics of life. And that is a central plank of a strategy of genocide. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vU7-Put288&t=897.76s)]
