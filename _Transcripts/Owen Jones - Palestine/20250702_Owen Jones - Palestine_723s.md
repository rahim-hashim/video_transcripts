# BBC Insiders: Weâ€™re FORCED To Do Pro-Israel SPIN
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [July 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk)
*  This is absolutely devastating. More than a hundred BBC employees have written a letter [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=0.0s)]
*  to the Director General, Tim Davie, complaining that the corporation has become a mouthpiece [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=5.76s)]
*  for Israel. It was also signed by 300 other journalists and media professionals, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=11.44s)]
*  one of them was yours truly. The BBC employees, as you would expect, all anonymous because [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=16.48s)]
*  otherwise they would face grave consequences in terms of their careers. Now the letter says [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=21.44s)]
*  we're writing to express our concerns over opaque editorial decisions and censorship at the BBC on [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=27.36s)]
*  the reporting of Israel-Palestine. We believe the refusal to broadcast the documentary Gaza, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=33.760000000000005s)]
*  Medics under Fire, is just one in a long line of agenda-driven decisions. It demonstrates once [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=38.8s)]
*  again that the BBC is not reporting without fear or favour when it comes to Israel. Now [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=44.72s)]
*  it goes on to note that the decision not to broadcast that investigation was taken by BBC [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=52.08s)]
*  management despite the content being signed off in accordance with BBC guidelines and editorial [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=55.92s)]
*  policy, which it says appears to be a political decision, adding that the BBC response shows the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=61.36s)]
*  organisation is crippled by the fear of being perceived as critical of the Israeli government. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=66.56s)]
*  I mean the decision not to broadcast this is a scandal. The BBC only broadcast one other [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=70.72s)]
*  documentary which actually looked properly at the war crimes being committed every single day against [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=78.08s)]
*  the Palestinian people in Gaza and then they pulled that documentary because the child narrator [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=84.56s)]
*  was the son of a deputy agricultural minister who's a technocrat which had no bearing on anything [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=90.08s)]
*  he said because he was a child narrator whose words were scripted for him rather than say his father. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=95.28s)]
*  And that was that they capitulated the BBC to the demands of the pro-Israel lobby. Here's another [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  documentary which passes all their checks which is past the channel four channel four taking it on. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=108.56s)]
*  They've gone through their rigorous process and the BBC refused to show a programme which [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=113.84s)]
*  documents the objective systematic attacks on the healthcare system, the destruction of the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=121.04s)]
*  healthcare system in Gaza. For what reason? For what reason? The letter emphasises that the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=126.4s)]
*  signatories are not asking the BBC to pick a side but just to allow BBC journalists to do their jobs [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=133.52s)]
*  in delivering facts transparently with due context. They note one striking failure. As an organisation [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=138.24s)]
*  we have not offered any significant analysis of the UK government's involvement in the war on [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=143.44s)]
*  Palestinians. We have failed to report on weapon sales or their legal implications. These stories [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  have instead been broken by the BBC's competitors. This is by the way one of many striking scandalous [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=152.32s)]
*  failures on the part of the BBC which is a public service broadcast in Britain which is duty bound [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=157.2s)]
*  to hold the British government to account. It has failed to do so in the most grotesque way possible [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  frankly. And this is a really crucial allegation or a really crucial allegation. The letter says [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=167.44s)]
*  this hasn't happened by accident rather by design. Much of the BBC's coverage in this area is defined [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=172.96s)]
*  by anti-Palestinian racism. That's exactly it and it is BBC journalists saying this. There hasn't [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=178.72s)]
*  even been a pretence by the BBC that Palestinian life has even the fraction of the worth of an [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=185.28s)]
*  Israeli life or those deemed westerners. When I did my detailed investigation into BBC coverage [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=189.6s)]
*  on Israel and Palestine for Dropsite News at the end of the last year, I worked with data journalists [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=195.44s)]
*  who showed having done rigorous analysis through objective and incontrovertible statistics [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=201.2s)]
*  how this is the case. Now the letter mentions a crucial name. It says [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=206.88s)]
*  the inconsistent manner in which guidance is applied draws into focus the role of Sir Robbie [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=212.39999999999998s)]
*  Gibb on the BBC board at BBC's editorial standards committee. We are concerned that an individual [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=216.72s)]
*  with close ties to the Jewish Chronicle, an outlet that has repeatedly published anti-Palestinian [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=221.44s)]
*  often racist content has assailed the BBC's editorial decisions in any capacity, including [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=227.2s)]
*  the decision not to broadcast gars and medics under fire. Sir Robbie Gibb is a striking, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=232.0s)]
*  disturbing case today. The brother of a Tory minister, he joined the BBC as a political [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=237.11999999999998s)]
*  researcher after he graduated from university before becoming chief of staff for the conservative [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=241.67999999999998s)]
*  shadow chancellor Francis Maude. He then returned to the BBC as deputy editor of the flagship [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=246.16s)]
*  current affairs program Newsnight, then became the editor for BBC live programming, for example, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=250.79999999999998s)]
*  Daily Politics, where he worked closely with its main presenter, Andrew Neil, the chairman of the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=255.68s)]
*  Hard Right Spectator magazine. He then went off in 2017 to become director of communications for the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=262.8s)]
*  Tory prime minister Theresa May. He then returned to the BBC, and you're getting dizzy by this [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=268.96000000000004s)]
*  revolving door by the way, just between the BBC and the Tories. He joined its board. He was later [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=272.64s)]
*  singled out by the likes of the former Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis, who described him as an [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=279.92s)]
*  active agent of the Conservative Party, who was shaping the corporation's news output by acting [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=284.4s)]
*  as the arbiter of BBC impartiality. In 2020, he led a consortium bid to buy the Jewish Chronicle, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=289.44s)]
*  a newspaper which rather than doing what is vitally important, offering media representation [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=294.88s)]
*  for Britain's Jewish community, has acted instead as a zealous cheerleader of the Israeli state, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=298.64s)]
*  and indeed that newspaper has published as the letter notes a hideously anti-Palestinian racist [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=303.28s)]
*  output. It's absolutely remarkable that this man has the power and influence he does at the BBC. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=307.12s)]
*  Can you imagine someone with left-wing and pro-Palestinian connections having this [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=311.2s)]
*  power and influence? There is more chance of the moon turning into a giant panda [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=315.84s)]
*  called Flipple than that ever happening. As the letter notes, this conflict of interest [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=320.08s)]
*  highlights a double standard for BBC content makers who have themselves experienced censorship in the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=325.03999999999996s)]
*  name of impartiality. In some instances, staff have been accused of having an agenda because [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=329.84s)]
*  they have posted news articles critical of the Israeli government on their social media. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=334.96s)]
*  By comparison, Gibb remains in an influential post with little transparency regarding his [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=338.64s)]
*  decisions despite his ideological leanings being well known. We can no longer ask license fee [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=342.8s)]
*  payers to overlook Gibb's ideological allegiances. The letter notes that the BBC's reporting on [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=347.12s)]
*  Israel and Palestine fall short of our own editorial standards with a gulf between the BBC's coverage [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=351.84s)]
*  of what is happening in Gaza and the West Bank and what our audience can see is happening via [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=356.56s)]
*  multiple credible sources including human rights organisation staff at the UN and journalists on [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=360.88s)]
*  the ground. Which is why the letter makes an incendiary claim. All too often, it is felt [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=366.56s)]
*  that the BBC has been performing PR for the Israeli government and military. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=372.16s)]
*  Note that over 100 journalists who spend their lives working for the BBC have stated their [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=378.0s)]
*  agreement with this. They state we have been forced to conclude that decisions are made to [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=383.12s)]
*  fit a political agenda rather than serve the needs of an audience. They go on to note the extreme [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=387.2s)]
*  concern about BBC reporting on the issue falling short of the standards our audiences expect, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=391.2s)]
*  adding that we believe the role of Robby Gibb both on the board and as part of the editorial [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=396.0s)]
*  standards committee is untenable. We call on the BBC to do better for our audiences and recommit [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=399.68s)]
*  to our values of impartiality, honesty and reporting without fear of favour. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=403.6s)]
*  Other than those BBC journalists, there are signatories like the actors Juliet Stevenson, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=407.84s)]
*  Cahid Abdallah, Zahri Ashton, Miriam Margoels. BBC insiders have some choice things to say. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=413.12s)]
*  One of them says, at the BBC the strength of feeling gets given is palpable. In corridors [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=420.08s)]
*  at the new broadcasting house, staff confide in each other about the illogical decisions [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=424.24s)]
*  reached by management and the role that Gibb has to play. We often feel we are in an abusive [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=428.16s)]
*  relationship with the BBC in which we are gaslit and pacified. They go on to say we are exhausted [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=433.52s)]
*  by the double standards and the suspension of editorial standards. For many staff this [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=438.88s)]
*  has shattered any notion of fairness. We feel we are going to console each other about how this [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=443.2s)]
*  has been allowed to happen. We believe the BBC will not be able to deliver on its commitment [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=447.6s)]
*  to fairness and due impartiality while Gibb is in post. Another note, for more than a year now, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=451.28s)]
*  we have been aware that the BBC's news output is out of step with reality. Audiences are being asked [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=455.91999999999996s)]
*  not to believe their own eyes and ears. Anyone with a phone has seen the footage coming out of [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=460.79999999999995s)]
*  Gaza and the West Bank yet BBC news has tied itself in knots with notions of complexity. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=464.55999999999995s)]
*  Why have we taken a clear position on Ukraine and Russia when we fail to confidently assert [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=469.91999999999996s)]
*  facts when it comes to the Palestinian people? Robbie Gibb is at least part of the answer. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=473.76s)]
*  We raise these concerns so many times and we have not been listened to. We are speaking out [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=478.08s)]
*  because we must serve audiences better. Well, downing yourself really isn't it from BBC [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=481.35999999999996s)]
*  journalists? Indeed, this is just another example of the biggest scandal of Western journalism of [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=485.44s)]
*  our time. What the BBC and other news organisations did is either completely erase the statements of [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=489.91999999999996s)]
*  genocide and criminal intent made by Israeli leaders and officials or bury them and indeed [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=494.64s)]
*  refuse to explain the genocide and criminal nature of these statements. These statements prove the [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=498.88s)]
*  most accurate roadmark predictor of what Israel would go on to do and yet the BBC completely [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=503.04s)]
*  misled the audiences about Israel's intent, treating these statements as though they were [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=508.32s)]
*  somehow being issued in a parallel universe, instead zoning in on deceitful statements issued [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=512.08s)]
*  by Israeli officials designed to mislead Western audiences. The BBC repeatedly framed their stories [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=516.24s)]
*  around the false statements and claims of the Israeli state, treating them as credible, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=521.6800000000001s)]
*  despite the overwhelming evidence of Israel lying over and over again, indeed as they are [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=525.9200000000001s)]
*  very obviously committing an unprecedented level of documentation, every single war crime or crime [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=530.56s)]
*  against humanity under the sun. Palestinian voices receive much, much less coverage and [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=538.2399999999999s)]
*  were prosecuted as though they were in the dock in a way pro-Israel voices are not on broadcast [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=542.7199999999999s)]
*  television. Atrocities and war crimes ignored, whitewashed. Studies exposing war crimes ignored [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=546.8s)]
*  or given precious little coverage. Palestinian life treated as having infinitely less worth [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=551.92s)]
*  than Israeli life, while emotive terms such as massacre will reserve Israeli victims rather [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=557.12s)]
*  than Palestinian victims. Humanising words proportionately use far more for Israeli victims [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=561.28s)]
*  than Palestinian victims. While sentences such as Hamas were in health ministry were woven in as [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=566.0s)]
*  standard in coverage to undermine faith in the death of Gaza, basic facts like the International [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=570.7199999999999s)]
*  Criminal Court issuing arrest warrants against Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence minister [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=575.76s)]
*  for war crimes and crimes against humanity were not. The fact that there was a consensus [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=580.0799999999999s)]
*  among genocide scholars including Israeli genocide scholars that Israel has committed [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=584.48s)]
*  genocide has been suppressed with those scholars being ignored. We could go on, honestly, there's [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=588.08s)]
*  an endless list. I mean, this really is the biggest scandal in Western journalism of our age. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=593.6800000000001s)]
*  And the BBC is not alone in this, but the BBC is paid by us, the license fee payers. It's a public [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=601.36s)]
*  service broadcasting organisation. And you know, I speak to BBC journalists and they really are not [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=607.36s)]
*  asking to take sides. They're not like, oh, these are activists who just want the BBC to bend to [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=612.4s)]
*  activist demands. They just want the BBC to actually apply what it says it is supposed to do to this [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=616.16s)]
*  topic where it has suspended the journalistic norms it claims to have. It's not a big ask, is it? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2UDidfcdnk&t=623.68s)]
