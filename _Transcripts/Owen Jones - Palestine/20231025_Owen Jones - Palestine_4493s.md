# Gaza: What Happens Next
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4)
*  Hello, hello, hello. Welcome to the show. Firstly, an apologies, bit delayed, slight [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=0.0s)]
*  tech cliches. Want to get this right, obviously, given the gravity of what we are talking about. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=16.66s)]
*  It's been 18 days now since the horrors of the 7th of October. And since then, we've [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=22.2s)]
*  seen horror upon horror as the collective punishment of the people of Gaza has been [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=29.1s)]
*  imposed by the Israeli state with the active support of Western governments. Thousands [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=36.7s)]
*  have now been killed, many of them, of course, children, the health infrastructure in a state [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=42.18s)]
*  of collapse, people drinking seawater and from IV drips because there isn't any clean [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=46.14s)]
*  water left, civilian infrastructure being destroyed, pummeled, including by bombs supplied [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=52.3s)]
*  by Western governments. We've heard the rhetoric of the Israeli state and Israeli officials [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=58.3s)]
*  reducing Gaza to a city of tents, talking of human animals, proudly boasting and cutting [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=65.58s)]
*  off everything or water, food, energy, basic supplies, which again contravenes Article [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=69.7s)]
*  33 of the Geneva Convention, as well as talk of eliminating everything and so on and so [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=75.97999999999999s)]
*  forth. We've not even, well, the thing's been forgotten is what's happening in the West [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=83.94s)]
*  Bank at the moment. We're seeing the killings of dozens of Palestinian civilians there by [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=87.26s)]
*  Israeli forces and Israeli settlers. Gruesome, to say the least. And what I tried to do ever [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=93.06s)]
*  since this crisis began is obviously off in my own commentary, but there's quite enough [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=101.5s)]
*  white guys in the British media currently discussing what's happening. So I've been [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=106.62s)]
*  trying to elevate the sorts of voices that we desperately need to be hearing, Palestinian [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=111.26s)]
*  voices, Muslim voices, both here and abroad, Jewish voices, Israeli voices, those brave [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=115.38s)]
*  Israelis fighting for peace, the likes of Bet Suleim and other Israeli peace activists. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=121.33999999999999s)]
*  Tomorrow I'll be discussing, I'll be talking to an Israeli academic who's just been fired [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=125.58s)]
*  from his job for opposing the crime being committed against the people of Gaza. So that's [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=128.9s)]
*  what we're trying to do as best we can. I'm very lucky actually to have some great guests [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=134.34s)]
*  today and I'll be bringing in imminently one, well, a fantastic guest. Many of you will [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=138.34s)]
*  know Iyad El-Baghdadi, who is a brilliant writer, activist, has many caps, Palestinian [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=145.26s)]
*  refugee. Before I begin, it's difficult. I have done my best to make an editorial decision. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=151.57999999999998s)]
*  I've not been showing some of the Gruesome Picked videos coming out of Gaza and that's [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=165.26s)]
*  difficult because part of the problem we're dealing with is Palestinian life has not been [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=169.98s)]
*  valued as having equal worth, of course, to Western life, Israeli life. It might as well [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=173.94s)]
*  just be said. That's clearly not what's happening. It's difficult because it is traumatising [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=180.62s)]
*  in video clips. Do you show people as best you can the reality of what's going on, knowing [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=188.14s)]
*  you're also sharing horrible trauma? Difficult one. I'm not going to do that today, but I [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=194.82s)]
*  will just show a couple of clips before we begin. One is taken by a very courageous journalist, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=200.9s)]
*  Mohammed Samir, in Gaza, just showing what we're talking about in terms of the horrors, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=207.98000000000002s)]
*  the ruins of Gaza at the moment. I do apologise. We've got a journalist here, sorry, a journalist [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=213.54000000000002s)]
*  who lost a medic, no, Israeli journalist who lost a loved one. That's as far as I'm going [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=219.18s)]
*  to go today. That's a journalist in Gaza who's just been informed that he's lost his [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=225.7s)]
*  wife and his children. And it is important, horrible to watch such a scene that we do [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=244.06s)]
*  show some of the human impact of what we're discussing. Now I'm going to bring in, but [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=249.5s)]
*  before I start, as ever, please press like and subscribe to share the video and keep [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=255.68s)]
*  showing the road at patreon.com. You can use super chat like Tad Cantwell. Not sure if [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=260.62s)]
*  you're aware, says Tad Cantwell, Wix employees in Ireland were encouraged to put pro-Israel [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=267.04s)]
*  views on social media. I'm actually aware of one. Wix is an Israeli software company [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=270.28000000000003s)]
*  and one Irish employee has been fired for their pro-Palestinian views. I know the Irish [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=275.96000000000004s)]
*  key shock has publicly suggested taking them to an employment tribunal. It's interesting [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=283.28s)]
*  Ireland's one of the few countries to actually call for ceasefire, which I would say isn't [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=287.28s)]
*  because they have a left-wing government, they don't, but because of the history of [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=291.28s)]
*  Ireland have been colonised by the British, which I think probably gives a different sort [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=294.28s)]
*  of flavour to the politics of this. Now I'm going to bring in the brilliant Ian Elbagdadi, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=298.28s)]
*  sorry, Elbagdadi, who is based in Oslo in Norway, you're a Palestinian refugee, of course. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=306.28s)]
*  I'm very grateful for your work, I know I have over the years, it's informed many of [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=311.28s)]
*  the views that I've had, so we're very grateful to have you here, particularly at a difficult [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=315.28s)]
*  time, very difficult time. Thank you for having me and thank you for doing this. No, no, it [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=319.28s)]
*  goes without saying, honestly. Can you just firstly tell, just tell us yourself, just [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=325.28s)]
*  that it's been 18 days now, it's kind of incredible to say that, it feels longer in lots of ways, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=329.28s)]
*  just tell us from your perspective, as a Palestinian who's obviously now living in, you know, in Oslo, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=335.28s)]
*  what's, just tell us, even from an emotional level, what, how you now look, if you were going to [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=344.28s)]
*  take a step back as best you can over these last horrible 18 days. Yeah, it is difficult because [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=349.28s)]
*  it feels like, like nobody has slept since then. We're exhausted, we're triggered, and it doesn't [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=357.28s)]
*  feel like just our triggers, I mean, it feels like it, like just another chapter, it feels like [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=367.28s)]
*  we're re-experiencing things that we experienced all our lives, the nightmares that I'm seeing [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=374.28s)]
*  whenever I try to go to sleep are all about other instances in history where we saw Palestinians [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=379.28s)]
*  being mowed down, being shot, being persecuted. It's, you know, our trauma is intergenerational, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=389.28s)]
*  and it's just so hard, just so hard to keep it together, especially when you're in diaspora and [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=397.28s)]
*  you're, you know, you're a missing community to be around. It's scary, it's really scary, and the fact [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=402.28s)]
*  is we're still, in a kind of standstill, we're still waiting to see just how bad, how much worse is going [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=412.28s)]
*  to get, and the worst of it really, Owen, is this feeling in your gut, like this feeling of impasse, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=419.28s)]
*  feeling like you know for sure that things are not going to get better from here. You know that even if [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=428.28s)]
*  we get the best-case scenario and there's a ceasefire and some kind of de-escalation, we're still [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=435.28s)]
*  back to no solution, you know, no end in sight, no settlement, you know, no end to the pain, just back [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=443.28s)]
*  to more relentless violence with no end. I mean, this is like, this is what feels the worst in my gut. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=454.28s)]
*  So powerful, thank you, Ed. Look, I haven't spoken to you about the events of 7th of October, I think maybe [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=461.28s)]
*  we should start just there, given it's been 18 days, I mean, lots of time to process and think about what [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=469.28s)]
*  happened that day, and just wondering, just, you know, in terms of, it's been obviously people are shocked, horrified [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=475.28s)]
*  by the atrocities committed, how you did a really interesting thread on Twitter, which partly discussed [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=482.28s)]
*  Hamas in the context of 7th of October, and how it needs to be understood. And I just wondered if you could [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=489.28s)]
*  just unpack some of the things that you've been thinking, because I know you've been thinking out loud, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=497.28s)]
*  been thinking, as lots of people have, just talk us through what you've kind of concluded so far. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=501.28s)]
*  Well, I'm just going to warn you first, this is going to be rambling a little bit. It's difficult for me to [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=506.28s)]
*  have kind of a logical plan of what I'm going to say, but I'm just going to go with the flow here. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=513.28s)]
*  The first thing that I felt post-October 7th, like once I realized what had happened, is fear. It's just fear [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=521.28s)]
*  because we know what's next. We know what's going to happen. There's this kind of brutal calculation, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=532.28s)]
*  because you know that a Palestinian life is not worth the same as an Israeli life, and you know that for every [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=540.28s)]
*  life that Hamas takes, that's going to be 10, 20, 50, 100 taken on the other side. The calculation immediately, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=546.28s)]
*  it's just terrifying. The other thing that really came, I tried to really just analyze it. Of course, my job is strategy, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=556.28s)]
*  and this is what I do, geopolitical strategy. So you're trying to understand what's going on, you're trying to understand [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=576.28s)]
*  what does the chessboard look like. I hate doing that, I hate to talk, I'm a human rights activist in the end, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=584.28s)]
*  and geopolitics sometimes dehumanizing, because you have to look at chess pieces instead of human beings, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=594.28s)]
*  but we still have to do it. The other thing that just sucks you, just feels like a black hole in your gut really is [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=598.28s)]
*  the endless escalatory potential over here, the endless ways that this can get worse. Because this region, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=610.28s)]
*  and I remember I was at an event, unrelated to events, it was an event about United States foreign policy, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=619.28s)]
*  this was like three weeks before October 7th, two or three weeks, and it was basically a bunch of foreign policy analysts, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=626.28s)]
*  etc., thinkers. And the point that I wanted to say at the time, and that's what I shared with the closed event, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=637.28s)]
*  and what I shared is this region is a box of grievances and trauma, it's a house of cards, and it could explode into crises [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=646.28s)]
*  any minute. And I remember even the faces, some people coughed, some people basically, there was this perception that [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=659.28s)]
*  actually the Middle East is managed right now. Actually, I believe it was, I can't remember who it was, but basically someone in the US [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=671.28s)]
*  administration had said just a few days before that this has been the quietest time in the Middle East for 20 years. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=681.28s)]
*  And the thing is we've been screaming, we've been screaming into the void for years now, saying that this is going to explode, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=687.28s)]
*  this is going to explode, this is going to explode. It's so terrible when you know you've been right, you know you've been, you've seen this coming, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=693.28s)]
*  you know it's been, it's inevitability, and nobody listened, nobody listened. You asked me about Hamas and how to see, how to view Hamas, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=702.28s)]
*  and this is also a change, you know, this is a point of inflection in Hamas's history as well. I think we have to acknowledge that we don't fully understand [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=714.28s)]
*  what happened. There are, I mean, a lot of what we have to do on a daily basis is just consume a lot of information, and I can tell you that it seems that [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=726.28s)]
*  the military wing of Hamas planned this on its own without even telling the political wing. It seems that the political wing of Hamas are actually like, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=738.28s)]
*  they're already informed, they weren't even in on the decision. It seems that Hamas itself has gone through, you know, a considerable radicalization. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=747.28s)]
*  This is a different kind of operation. We've never seen Hamas attempt something at this scale before, and what worries me the most is what their plan is beyond this, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=761.28s)]
*  because I don't think, I don't think whoever, whatever brain planned such a meticulous operation did not plan on the Israeli response. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=774.28s)]
*  I think they were actually counting, maybe even planning on a ground invasion, and that scares me, because the escalatory potential with, you know, Iranian, you know, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=788.28s)]
*  pro-Iran forces coming in, you know, the kind of language that's coming from the Israeli side about like ethnically cleansing Gaza, using this as an opportunity, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=798.28s)]
*  as Netanyahu said, to change the Middle East. In this case, it would be, you know, openly speaking about like moving all of these Timolian Gazans into Sinai, into Egypt. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=810.28s)]
*  This is a new level, the new level of risk and the new level of depravity. This is not something we've faced any time, at any point in our lifetimes, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=825.28s)]
*  probably not at any point since the original Nakba 1948. Even the original Nakba was not this, you know, it wasn't, it wasn't, there wasn't 2 million Palestinians at the time. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=836.28s)]
*  So yeah, I'll stop here, Owen. I don't know if you want to follow up, but I'm sorry for, I'm sorry again for not being able to organize my thoughts on this. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=846.28s)]
*  It's not happening at all. It's actually better that you just speak from the heart as you go along rather than, you know, just sanitize or carefully curate what you're saying in a way that doesn't convey what you're actually thinking, I suppose. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=859.28s)]
*  I have interest that, I mean, because it does strike me with Hamas as well, that, I mean, partly from the very different experiences that have been, have come out in terms of how people are treated. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=870.28s)]
*  We've heard basically of ISIS style atrocities, but also of Israelis talking about how, you know, they invaded their homes and treated kindly. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=881.28s)]
*  And it makes me, it comes across as though there was no discipline that this, there wasn't a sense, a centralized plan and there couldn't have been because Mossad presumably have spies all over the Gaza Strip and they didn't know that this was happening. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=891.28s)]
*  This is an absolutely astonishing failure of a security establishment, which is supposed to be second to none on earth. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=904.28s)]
*  And it was allowed, you had an invasion and a rampage which went on for a very, very long time unchecked. So I'm just wondering, I mean, is that, you know, because now it's popular as part of this to say Hamas is ISIS. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=911.28s)]
*  That's not true, is it? I mean, it's a bit more, it's more complicated than that and that in no way negates the atrocities that have taken place. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=923.28s)]
*  I mean, even if we accept, this is a thing that I was actually trying to write about today. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=930.28s)]
*  The fact is that the Israeli reliance on disinformation has really created a huge infocalipse, you know, because on my timeline, I see people, you know, tweeting in Arabic and I see people, you know, I have a very, very, very diverse kind of timeline. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=935.28s)]
*  And I can see that Arabs and a lot of Palestinians no longer trust anything that comes from the Israeli side. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=955.28s)]
*  They just no longer listen. So a lot of the atrocities, a lot of the reports of the atrocities are not even reported to those folks. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=963.28s)]
*  They don't, they're not even aware of it. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=971.28s)]
*  But the fact is that even if we accept the minimum, I mean, we have to accept that horrible atrocities have been committed by Hamas, horrible atrocities. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=976.28s)]
*  We don't know the full picture. Like, we don't know whether, like, again, these are commandos who have been trained for at least a year to do this. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=985.28s)]
*  I can understand them being ruthless. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=996.28s)]
*  I can understand them, but I don't understand them being undisciplined. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=999.28s)]
*  I mean, this is, there's a lot there that we don't understand in terms of what, how much of this was planned, how much of this was calculated, how much of this was basically a breakdown of discipline, how much of it was other factions we don't know yet. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1002.28s)]
*  But we still have to acknowledge that horrible atrocities have been committed by Hamas. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1018.28s)]
*  I mean, you mentioned the hostages, etc. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1024.28s)]
*  And, you know, a lot of the people who were killed by Hamas in this operation were actually, you know, peace activists, Jewish peace activists, Israeli peace activists who actually worked very hard for Palestinian rights, including, for example, the grandmother who was released a few days ago. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1029.28s)]
*  And, you know, the video of her shaking the hand of her abductor, etc. went viral. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1052.28s)]
*  So her and her husband, you know, dedicated many, many years of their lives to helping sick people in Gaza who, you know, very rarely are able to leave Gaza for medical treatment, helping them get medical treatment in Israel. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1056.28s)]
*  So she's basically a human rights activist. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1072.28s)]
*  One, you know, another person who also was murdered is a young man called Khayyam who, you know, this man used to be a protective presence for Palestinian farmers, Palestinian and shepherds who were being ethnically cleansed in the Masafir Yatta and other places in the West Bank. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1075.28s)]
*  So, even if you accept the minimum, minimum, I mean, even if you accept the minimum story that is portrayed from the Israeli side, then yes, there are horrible atrocities. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1098.28s)]
*  There's no question about that. I'm a human rights activist. I cannot not, you know, value all human life. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1108.28s)]
*  That said, this doesn't happen in a vacuum. I mean, this did not happen in a vacuum. And there is no moral difference here. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1117.28s)]
*  To me, there's no moral difference between someone who excuses the murder of innocent Israelis or someone who excuses and actively abets the genocidal, hysterical actions of the state of Israel in response or before. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1123.28s)]
*  I mean, again, this is a 75-year-old story. Palestinians, every Palestinian living today, most Palestinians living today are basically survivors of erasure. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1141.28s)]
*  They're survivors of ethnic cleansing. This is we don't only carry our own trauma and our own wounds. We try to carry the trauma of our parents, our grandparents. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1151.28s)]
*  And right now it feels like all of those wounds are open. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1159.28s)]
*  In terms of, I mean, there's a bit of a debate, by the way, about what happens. I've seen one Israeli peace activist suggest that a land invasion might not happen, which I thought was quite interesting. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1164.28s)]
*  And a lot of this depends obviously on, it shouldn't be reduced to a psychodrama involving Benjamin Netanyahu and his government. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1173.28s)]
*  He's very unpopular in Israel at the moment. And some are even suggesting he could be removed. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1179.28s)]
*  But I don't know, you know, there was one argument that, well, actually they weren't prepared for what happens on the 7th of October. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1184.28s)]
*  They're not actually prepared for a counteroffensive. And that what we might see is just airstrikes after airstrikes going on for a very, very long time with terrible suffering, of course. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1189.28s)]
*  I just wondered what you thought enters, if you had any thoughts on what you think might happen and what the reality of a ground invasion might actually entail. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1200.28s)]
*  We're talking of course about a tiny strip of land the size of East London, densely populated, 2.2 million people, of course. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1208.28s)]
*  But what's your thoughts and particularly the menace of a new Nakba? [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1215.28s)]
*  So, I mean, the menace is real and, you know, the fear is real. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1221.28s)]
*  And the intention is very clear as well. I mean, there's a whole, I mean, someone actually compiled them into kind of a thread on Twitter, you know, a whole list of genocidal statements, open intent to ethnically cleanse Gaza. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1226.28s)]
*  That said, I have a feeling that Netanyahu painted himself into a corner with setting up this goal of eliminating Hamas. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1242.28s)]
*  Hamas are dug in, they're prepared, they're well supplied, they're well trained, and they have the defensive advantage. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1254.28s)]
*  You know, and they have, you know, as far as I know from everything I read and everything, lots of reports about this, they have extremely well designed, extremely well designed tunnel systems designed exactly for this kind of invasion. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1262.28s)]
*  At the same time, the Israeli army has not fought this kind of battle ever. They haven't fought in an urban environment, like urban kind of real urban pitched battle or war since the Lebanese Civil War. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1280.28s)]
*  We're talking, you know, a generation. And it's very clear from, you know, like, I mean, I was following some Telegram posts, interviews with Hamas, you know, figures, etc. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1296.28s)]
*  And the message coming from them was essentially we, you know, on October 7th, the army collapsed before us. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1308.28s)]
*  I mean, I mean, it's like the attack was more successful than they expected. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1318.28s)]
*  And part of that, of course, is that a lot of the army was stationed on the West Bank, assisting, you know, extremist settlers, etc., harass Palestinians over there. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1322.28s)]
*  But that said, it seems to me that Netanyahu cannot afford not to have a ground invasion. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1334.28s)]
*  It seems that even he has communicated this to the Americans. The Americans seem to be setting, you know, putting things in order to manage such an eventuality. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1344.28s)]
*  I mean, I think a lot of what the Biden administration is doing really is trying to manage the escalation to make sure that Netanyahu can do whatever he wants in Gaza without an escalation. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1356.28s)]
*  I don't think that's ever possible. I think there's going to be an escalation. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1365.28s)]
*  I don't share that. Some people have almost blind faith that the idea of the Israeli Defense Force being able to carry out this operation was going to prevail. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1371.28s)]
*  I don't share that blind faith. In fact, there was a report that I read and shared also on my account that talks about this. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1381.28s)]
*  It's basically a retired Israeli general who was talking about the Israeli army and talking about how it has become, he described it as, if I remember correctly, a one dimensional, primarily aerial force that is not prepared and that cannot win a war on its own. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1390.28s)]
*  Of course, it's not on its own right now because we see the United States on its side. We also see the potential of other Western powers coming in. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1406.28s)]
*  We even have this kind of insane statement by French President Manon-Mabon talking about absolutely insane, absolutely irresponsible. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1416.28s)]
*  Really what we need right now is de-escalation. De-escalation isn't everybody's benefit given the chessboard, as I said, except for Netanyahu. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1429.28s)]
*  Netanyahu knows that he's gone. He's done. The only thing that can keep him in power longer is prolonging this war. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1441.28s)]
*  Just finally, if there isn't that de-escalation, there's this talk, obviously, Fahri, talk about the destruction of Hamas and all the rest of it. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1453.28s)]
*  Of course, people might remember what happened in Iraq. We had, as was predicted, because part of the justification for the Iraq war was the idea of Saddam Hussein was in co-incidence with Al-Qaeda, which was nonsense. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1462.28s)]
*  But we did get the rise of Al-Qaeda in the aftermath. Then you got a brutal war to suppress Al-Qaeda. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1473.28s)]
*  I think then those who lacked perhaps imagination couldn't think you could get anything worse than Al-Qaeda. We did get something worse than Al-Qaeda. We got ISIS. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1479.28s)]
*  Then we got the horrors of ISIS and the conquering of much of Iraq and Syria by ISIS. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1486.28s)]
*  I suppose the difference is this time, that was something which had, in terms of non-conflict and occupation, for relatively few years compared to what the Palestinians have gone through. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1492.28s)]
*  I suppose what do you think your warning would be there in terms of what could happen if this idea of Hamas can be defeated by military means and what that actually would mean in practice? [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1503.28s)]
*  First of all, we have to speak about the 2 million people, 2.3 million Palestinians living in Gaza. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1514.28s)]
*  The Israeli plan was initially to force and pressure Egypt to take them, to basically open the borders and empty out Gaza. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1521.28s)]
*  We don't know, of course, if they're ever going to be allowed back home. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1533.28s)]
*  I mean, Israel has a record in doing this, expelling Palestinians from their land and then taking it. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1540.28s)]
*  That would be fatally destabilizing to the country of Egypt. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1546.28s)]
*  We've seen Egyptian authorities very adamant saying that we cannot allow this to happen. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1554.28s)]
*  It's not because the Egyptians like Hamas. It's not because the Egyptian regime likes Hamas. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1561.28s)]
*  It's because the Egyptian regime wants to remain in power. This would be extremely destabilizing. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1568.28s)]
*  So that's the first factor to consider that. How are you going to fight if Egypt's not going to take 2.3 million Palestinians? [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1574.28s)]
*  How are you going to fight in such a densely populated urban environment without committing horrible atrocities amounting to genocide? [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1585.28s)]
*  The other question really is, to your point, how are you going to even destroy this organization? [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1594.28s)]
*  Keep in mind, it's very important to note that Hamas does not come from the same ideological genealogy as ISIS and Al-Qaeda. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1604.28s)]
*  I don't want to get into the weeds here, but ISIS and Al-Qaeda are basically Salafi organizations which oppose any idea of nationalism. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1614.28s)]
*  They oppose nationalism. Meanwhile, Hamas is explicitly a nationalist organization. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1624.28s)]
*  It's in their charter that they are a Palestinian nationalist organization. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1628.28s)]
*  In my view, and this is something I'm probably going to write more about in my Twitter feed, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1632.28s)]
*  Hamas is really a nationalist organization that wears Islamic garb. At its core, it's a nationalist project. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1639.28s)]
*  Even if you somehow destroy Hamas, how are you going to destroy the idea of armed resistance to Israel? [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1648.28s)]
*  That's not going away. That's definitely not going away. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1656.28s)]
*  In fact, if you have a large refugee population, disenfranchised population, traumatized population that just gives Hamas or anyone who would replace Hamas an even deeper pit of grievances to exploit and recruit. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1661.28s)]
*  This is a very busy time for you. Also an exhausting time, I would say physically and emotionally. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1679.28s)]
*  Really, really appreciate talking to you. The humanity, I think, really shone through of what you said as well as the insight. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1689.28s)]
*  I'm always grateful to be able to speak to you. If people don't follow you, which they should, please rectify that immediately. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1695.28s)]
*  I had lots of love and solidarity and I'll be reading on a daily basis everything you say and I hope others do as well. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1703.28s)]
*  Brilliant stuff there from Iyad. I saw that actually, Tad, I'm so sorry, Tad, you had a question there to Iyad. I will try to talk about that later. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1713.28s)]
*  Sorry about into the run and I'll go through the super chats at the end. That's my door going, but we will ignore that for now. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1720.28s)]
*  I did say I was going to show you some of the devastation in Gaza, which I've been avoiding doing for various reasons, but let me just play that clip again. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1728.28s)]
*  That was taken by Mohammed Amir, who is a Palestinian journalist, incredibly brave Palestinian journalist who is in Gaza. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1735.28s)]
*  Again, I am trying to avoid showing images which are too distressing for people, but we have to show the reality of what's happening in Anab. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1762.28s)]
*  I'm going to bring in our next guest because we're late, so huge apologies to brilliant Dr Omar Abdel-Manan. Huge apologies to you, Dr. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1770.28s)]
*  No problem at all. Pleasure to be here. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1779.28s)]
*  It's a huge honor to have you. Now, you've been to Gaza several times, I know that, and you've been involved with, maybe the organization, I wrote it down somewhere, but maybe you could just tell us the organization which helps and what you've been doing over the years. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1782.28s)]
*  First of all, it's a pleasure to be on. I've followed your work for a long time, so I really appreciate having you. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1798.28s)]
*  Sorry about that. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1804.28s)]
*  No, that's good. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1805.28s)]
*  So yeah, I'm a pediatric neurologist, so I deal with children with brain and spinal cord diseases based in London. I am Egyptian by origin but was brought up in the UK. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1808.28s)]
*  I have been going to Gaza and the West Bank since 2011. So I actually, as a medical student, in my final year of medical school, I set up an educational link between our university and the Palestinian medical schools and got involved with a team called the Oxford Teaching Initiative, led by Professor Nick Maynard, who many of you might have seen on BBC and Sky News and TalkTV over the last few days. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1822.28s)]
*  And this is a team, an informal team of doctors, surgeons, you know, a kind of a mix of these specialists who go out and teach medical students there. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1849.28s)]
*  Some of the surgeons also perform surgery, but they do that separately outside of this program with other teams. So our primary focus is teaching, collaborating, working together with the students and the junior doctors and training and also learning from them. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1861.28s)]
*  I've been out there numerous times to Gaza, I think four times in total. And the other thing I've been doing since this horrific war started is I am in direct contact myself and a team of mine with Gaza doctors on the ground. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1875.28s)]
*  So what we saw very early on was very little media interest in what's happening on the ground inside Gaza and in the hospitals especially. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1895.28s)]
*  So because of our unique position, we decided to set up a social media platform called Gaza Medic Voices. You can find us on Instagram at Gaza Medic Voices and Twitter and Meta and TikTok. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1905.28s)]
*  And we basically report firsthand eyewitness accounts from doctors, nurses, paramedics on the ground in Gaza anonymously to protect their identity and their future, even though they actually ask us every time for their names to be published, but we refuse most of the time. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1917.28s)]
*  And we've been doing that. We've kind of continued to do that since the escalation has happened. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1936.28s)]
*  So that's how we communicate with them directly. Most of that communication is through voice notes, messages, text messages, photos, videos. There's very little direct communication by phone because of the signal and communication issues there. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1943.28s)]
*  So that's my background and how I've come to where I am today. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1956.28s)]
*  So based on that, can you explain, tell us what you know about the situation in terms of the healthcare system in Gaza, where it's currently at after nearly 18 days now of war? [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1960.28s)]
*  So, interestingly, I was actually just going back and looking at a lecture that I had given delivered in 2015 to a group of interested audience on healthcare in Gaza. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1973.28s)]
*  And the sad truth is this is a healthcare system that has been on its knees because of an Israeli siege and blockade since 2007. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1988.28s)]
*  This is a healthcare system that was essentially on its last limbs. It was in dire need of resuscitation. It was struggling from a supply point of view, from a capacity point of view, from a basic sort of healthcare systems point of view. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=1998.28s)]
*  And this war has just pushed it over the edge. And as we are hearing from the UN, from Oxfam, from big external organizations and the Gazan doctors on the ground, the healthcare system has collapsed. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2015.28s)]
*  Now we talk, I work and live in the UK and I work in the NHS, and we talk about the NHS collapsing and the NHS struggling. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2028.28s)]
*  When we look back to COVID and we think about how close we were to a collapse of our healthcare system here, this is unprecedented. This is on another level. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2037.28s)]
*  If you thought COVID was bad, this is a completely new paradigm that we're in. These hospitals are overflowing with patients. They are ran out of electricity. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2046.28s)]
*  They don't have basic sanitation, basic infectious disease measures. I have seen videos, pictures, voice notes from doctors explaining to me how they've had to amputate children's legs with little to no anesthetic because they had to save the child, for example, from impending sepsis or impending infection. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2059.28s)]
*  And there was no choice but to do it with no to little anesthetic. I've seen and heard stories of women delivering in the maternity service and bear in mind in Gaza, there's 5,000 deliveries a month. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2078.28s)]
*  That's a pretty decent number compared to London, for example. Any large London teaching hospital will have a drop in the ocean compared to that. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2090.28s)]
*  These women are delivering babies in unsafe conditions with little to no sanitation. If they have a hemorrhage and they bleed, which happens in a percentage of people who give birth, they will not have blood to the transfusions. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2101.28s)]
*  On top of that, you've got children and patients who have cancer, who have chemotherapy on a weekly basis or a monthly basis, and they are not getting access to those drugs. Those drugs have ran out. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2115.28s)]
*  So there's a huge issue with a already very weak healthcare system that's been compounded by these atrocious bombings and attacks which have just decimated them. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2128.28s)]
*  And there's indirect effects of what's happening as a result. And not only that, but you have hospitals being targeted. You have Al-Hilal Hospital being bombed. You have an ophthalmology unit that was brought down to the ground. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2140.28s)]
*  So that's kind of the picture that I'm trying to paint to your audience. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2151.28s)]
*  It's not easy to listen to, but incredibly necessary to listen to. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2159.28s)]
*  I mean, we know obviously that people have been directly killed by missiles. But what we're talking about here is it could well be perhaps that the greatest death toll could be from, I mean, what is a horrible clinical term in these contexts, an excess death toll. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2166.28s)]
*  So we can see people directly being killed. But what we're talking about is a potentially much, much bigger death toll, which is hard to quantify because if you have a collapsing health system, then everyone from those who have pre-existing underlying health conditions to those who are pregnant, those who have various health needs can't be looked after. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2184.28s)]
*  And I'm just wondering without energy, without basic sanitation, all the rest of it, what health system can actually do and what human impact that will have when they run completely out of fuel? Hospitals are closing at the moment, of course. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2204.28s)]
*  So a third of the hospitals have shut down. They've said we can't operate. We can't work as hospitals. That's a figure I read this morning. That may be more now. I haven't caught up with everything that's developing, but that's the last figure I had. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2216.28s)]
*  In answer to your question, absolutely. The number of excess deaths result from mainly infectious diseases. And we're seeing cases of chickenpox. We're hearing cases of infectious diseases spreading between patients. And, you know, this is not just patients who are well. This is immunocompromised patients with cancer on chemotherapy who definitely do not need to be exposed to these sort of infections. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2231.28s)]
*  So when this happens and then you start getting cholera, typhoid, these diseases that you see in humanitarian catastrophes such as Haiti, when the earthquake happened, 100,000 people died or the Libyan Dam that exploded or broke a few months, maybe a month back now with 10,000 deaths. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2253.28s)]
*  This is a sort of humanitarian crisis that happens. What absolutely is shocking to me is that in this conflict, there is no push or there is very little push towards a ceasefire from our governments, from Western politicians. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2270.28s)]
*  There needs to be an immediate ceasefire, be able to allow humanitarian aid to go in to Gaza to help patients and not only to bring in humanitarian aid, but to help the doctors on the ground who are exhausted. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2285.28s)]
*  I know of at least 60 health care professionals who have been killed directly by Israeli bombing over the last 18 days. Some of them are close friends of mine. At least two of them I know well and would speak to on a monthly or, you know, every two or three months by WhatsApp. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2297.28s)]
*  And their whole families have been wiped out. They've died with an Israeli airstrike. And this is untenable. This is a situation that's unprecedented and something needs to change. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2319.28s)]
*  I just want to pass on just all my thoughts and condolences. And I know I can see from the comments people are very emotionally touched by what you're talking about, but to be able to talk about this when you've got your own degree to deal with. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2329.28s)]
*  Bear in mind, sorry, bear in mind, though, and this is not just a doctor, you know, a doctor friend of mine. This is an entire family. So a specific example that I want to mention because he was a dear friend of mine, Dr. Omar Farwana. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2345.28s)]
*  Omar Farwana, he was the head of the Islamic University in Gaza Medical School, a larger-than-life character who was an amazing physician. He was at home with his children, grandchildren, wife, and an Israeli airstrike led to the collapse of the building and all of them died. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2358.28s)]
*  There was not a single survivor from his immediate family. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2376.28s)]
*  Just finally, Omar, I just wanted to ask you, and I'm so sorry to hear that, of course, without getting into the politics of it all, I just wanted to ask you a straightforward question which just touches on something you just said there. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2384.28s)]
*  There are those who aren't in government and their argument is not for a ceasefire, they're not calling for a ceasefire, but instead they're calling for increased humanitarian aid into Gaza with no call for a ceasefire attached. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2397.28s)]
*  What does that mean in that context? Because some would argue that's a reputation or damage limitation on part of those who aren't calling for a ceasefire because how can you get humanitarian aid in any meaningful way if there are bombs raining down on a densely populated tiny strip? [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2409.28s)]
*  Absolutely. I think you've hit the nail on the head. So humanitarian aid corridors only work when you stop bombing. And that happened in Operation Cast Lead in every other escalation I've seen. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2426.28s)]
*  And there's been six major escalations since the siege of Gaza started in 2007. In every other time point, the Israelis have stopped bombing to allow aid in. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2437.28s)]
*  I'm not saying that was a situation. Currently, that is not happening. That's why only 20 trucks are going a day into Gaza. Previous to this, 200 to 500 trucks were going in daily to provide supplies to top up a struggling and crippled health care system. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2447.28s)]
*  20 trucks is a drop in the ocean, as the UN rightly said. They are not sending fuel in. That means no generators are working. That means no electricity. That means no ventilators for patients on intensive care. That means more and more excess deaths. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2464.28s)]
*  Frankly, how many more children need to die before our politicians wake up and start pushing for change? Is it 5,000? Is it 10,000? What's the magic number? Because half of the population of Gaza is under 18. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2479.28s)]
*  And since this escalation started, we've lost 2,360 children, as my last read of the statistics. And that's 2,360 souls, too many. And the ones that have not been killed have been orphans. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2493.28s)]
*  These are children and young patients who will have no family. They will grow up having lost their immediate family. And that will lead to psychological trauma. That will lead to poor educational performance. That will lead to socioeconomic shifts, which are going to... [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2508.28s)]
*  Gaza will bear the brunt of that for the next 20, 30 years. And actually, the world will bear the brunt of that because these same children will struggle. These same children will become refugees. And this is a continuing escalation. And it's frankly horrific and atrocious. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2527.28s)]
*  As I say, that was obviously incredibly powerful. Again, I'm just beyond sorry about your own losses. And I don't think anyone could could not have been incredibly affected by what you said and the scale of the horror that has been unleashed with the support of our government, it must be said. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2545.28s)]
*  But all my love and solidarity, I know from everyone who watches and listens to this. Thank you so, so much for joining us and I'll make sure that I include a link obviously to the brilliant work that your organization is doing. But thank you so much and take care. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2560.28s)]
*  Thanks so much for having me. Thank you. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2574.28s)]
*  Take care. Take care now. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2576.28s)]
*  Not easy to listen to, but important. That's the scale of the crime that is currently being committed. Now I've left Ali waiting too long. Ali Milani, who was the former... [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2580.28s)]
*  Always got many hats. Stood against Boris Johnson, I campaigned for him up in Oxford and South Ryslip, but also writer, involved in activism and is also in the Labour Muslim Network, which represents obviously Muslim members of the Labour Party and Muslim supporters of the Labour Party. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2591.28s)]
*  And that could not be more topical. I'm just going to quickly, Ali, if you don't mind just because I know we've only got 50 minutes or so before you got to scoot. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2610.28s)]
*  Just a little replay. Keir Starmer backed war crimes on national radio and then pretended he didn't. That's just a quick summary. Let's just to clarify, so we're not continuing this gaslighting charade, which apparently now we're supposed to buy into. Let's just do very quickly. Just sort that out. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2618.28s)]
*  I was not saying that Israel had the right to cut off water, food, fuel or medicines. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2633.28s)]
*  And yet people came to that conclusion. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2640.28s)]
*  I'm very clear. Israel must have that, does have that right to defend herself. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2642.28s)]
*  And Hamas bears responsibility. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2648.28s)]
*  A siege is appropriate. Cutting off power, cutting off water. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2652.28s)]
*  I think that Israel does have that right. It is an ongoing situation. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2656.28s)]
*  So what he did there, you see, is he claimed he never said something he did say. That was then called by several journalists a clarification. It wasn't. It was a lie. It was a straightforward lie. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2662.28s)]
*  He then, when lots of councillors across the country have resigned, many Muslim always have resigned, and many people have resigned from the Labour Party full stop, he visited an Islamic centre in South Wales saying, I was grateful to hear from the Muslim community, the South Wales Islamic Centre. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2672.28s)]
*  I repeated that cause for all hostages to be released, more humanitarian aid to enter Gaza, for the water and power to be switched back on, and a minute focus on the two-state solution. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2687.28s)]
*  People are outraged by the fact that he's starting a, doing a post talking about going to an Islamic centre where he's talking about his demand for hostages to be released by Hamas. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2697.28s)]
*  This caused, I have to say, a huge amount of anger amongst the Muslim community and beyond. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2707.28s)]
*  And the South Wales Islamic Centre has issued themselves a statement expressing their dismay at Keir Starmer and also for feeling that they were, that the purpose was basically abused by Keir Starmer. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2715.28s)]
*  They said that his social media post and images grossly represented our congruence and the nature of the visit, which is, I would say, pretty scandalous myself. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2732.28s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, let's just, just on that Ali, because we've got talks now. I mean, there's actually talk of people resigning from the shadow cabinet. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2742.28s)]
*  I mean, we'll see about that. I don't believe it. Shabab Khan from ICB talks about multiple, two shadow cabinet members considering resigning. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2748.28s)]
*  Just, I mean, so many resigned and I've interviewed Muslim councillors who resigned. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2756.28s)]
*  What's your take on, in terms of where Labour are at with, with, there are four million British Muslims and they're a huge part of Labour's electoral coalition. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2760.28s)]
*  But some would say they're treated as a voting fodder at the best of times by these people. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2770.28s)]
*  I mean, you went through a lot there. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2774.28s)]
*  Oh yeah, I know. I needed to recap. Sorry. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2776.28s)]
*  It's been quite a day. Earlier, I was at the door, by the way, you didn't pick up, you didn't answer the door. I was, I was buzzing earlier, but you didn't. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2779.28s)]
*  Oh, I thought I was wondering who that was. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2785.28s)]
*  So listen, it has been the toughest 10 to 12 days for me as a Muslim Labour party member, as the chair of the Labour Muslim network, just as a Muslim. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2787.28s)]
*  Because I think where we are now is, I said this on LBC the morning following Keir's LBC, you know, now synonymous LBC comment. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2800.28s)]
*  The call from the Muslim community is just very simple. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2811.28s)]
*  We just want Muslim Palestinian lives, Christian Palestinian lives, all Palestinian lives to be held in equal regard to that of all other people, including, including Israelis. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2815.28s)]
*  The loss of an innocent Israeli soul is tragic, and the attacks were tragic and horrendous. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2828.28s)]
*  And what we're saying is that the loss of Palestinian souls should be equally tragic, their life matters too. Muslim lives are also valuable. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2835.28s)]
*  And the feeling from members from councillors has been our humanity and our lives aren't given the same value. So it's been incredibly incredibly difficult. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2843.28s)]
*  At the same time, I have seen unbelievable levels of unity from within the Muslim community, passion, willing to campaign. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2853.28s)]
*  And so while we are, I think, in our most difficult moment perhaps ever in the Labour Party, now is the time to fight. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2863.28s)]
*  Because I'm not willing to give up. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2872.28s)]
*  And I know many are, I'm not. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2875.28s)]
*  So, for me, when I think of the Labour Party, I think of being stood on a box somewhere in Uxbridge and South Ryslip looking at a sea of people, young and old, of all different ethnicities, of all different backgrounds, all different stories, all of whom had a common goal. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2878.28s)]
*  We all believed in a better world. We believed in a more equal society. We believed in justice. That's the Labour Party. That's what I want to fight for. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2896.28s)]
*  And I'm desperately hoping that we can get there. But it has to begin at the top. I hope the PLP are listening to Muslim members. I'm told there was a very robust meeting today. I hope the leadership are listening to members. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2905.28s)]
*  And rather than equivocate and talk about what's come before, you've covered that very, very thoroughly. The call is now clear. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2917.28s)]
*  The Labour Party must adopt a position of an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. That's where we can go. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2924.28s)]
*  If we want to rebuild trust, not just with the Muslim community, yes, critically the Muslim community, but also all people who care about the over 1,000 children who have died over the last, I think, 12 to 13 days. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2930.28s)]
*  If we care about their life, of the innocent souls who are losing their life on both sides, then what we have to do is lead. And this is a thing I'm big on. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2946.28s)]
*  You might have heard me talk about it before. It's political courage. Anyone can sit in any position of political leadership and just espouse what their advisors or focus groups or whatever is telling them is popular to do. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2955.28s)]
*  But real political leadership, what real leadership is, is taking a stance and representing the most marginalised voices, the most vulnerable voices. And that's what we need to do. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2967.28s)]
*  We don't need to power up Conservative Party lines. We don't need to let them set our agenda or use their talking points. We need to lead. And real leadership, real rebuilding trust with the Muslim communities and getting us out of this pain, this pain that we're in, is calling for an immediate ceasefire. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2977.28s)]
*  Now, I did, as I said, I interviewed two former Labour councillors now who resigned, one in Oxford, sorry, Shia Stozi, who I've known for many years, organised with her, and another councillor in Manchester. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=2993.28s)]
*  Just so clear, so there's balance here because there's obviously an ongoing debate and discussion currently taking place. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3006.28s)]
*  I mean, David Bratter here says, Keir has shown that he'll support genocide and throw minorities under the bus for political gain, his spineless cabinet and the NEC support them no matter what. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3012.28s)]
*  Is it time to call Labour a lost cause? And I suppose, you know, a lot of people would go, a certain red line has been crossed here. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3021.28s)]
*  I mean, the guy lied to his teeth to become elected leader of the Labour Party. He said one of his pledges put human rights at the centre of everything Labour does in foreign policy. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3027.28s)]
*  And Labour ended up supporting war crimes, overtly, claimed it didn't and won't even call for a ceasefire, which is a precondition for ending the humanitarian catastrophe all the while, while insulting Muslim voters by doing an abusing a visit to an Islamic centre, dishonestly misrepresenting what happened there and clearly making it obvious that they're just panicking because they see Muslim voters as voting fodder who they think they can throw patronising banners at. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3035.28s)]

*  I don't believe Kirstama is the Labour Party. I believe the members of the Labour Party, all those good people that I spoke about earlier today. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3125.28s)]
*  And I feel a duty to fight for them and to fight for a better world. Unfortunately, also, you know, [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3132.28s)]
*  while the current position isn't where we want to be, we've called for an immediate ceasefire. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3139.28s)]
*  We're in constant negotiations and discussions on that. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3146.28s)]
*  But it really comes down to that definition of labour and the duty I think I have to continue to represent those voices and to make their positions incredibly clear. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3150.28s)]
*  I mean, just finally, on that, I mean, maybe try to be a bit more optimistic because, you know, I'm a socialist, I believe in collective pressure from below delivering results, you know, [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3164.28s)]
*  and power can seize nothing without a demand. It never has and it never will. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3174.28s)]
*  As Frederick Douglass so wisely put it in the 19th century. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3177.28s)]
*  And in terms of just in terms of pressure and maybe pressure paying off, I mean, we know 89% of Labour voters support an immediate ceasefire, according to YouGov. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3181.28s)]
*  250 councillors have signed a letter demanding a ceasefire. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3189.28s)]
*  23 Labour councillors so far resigned in protest at Kirstama's support for war crimes. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3193.28s)]
*  The British public also support a ceasefire, that poll showed. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3198.28s)]
*  The majority of the public, not just Labour voters. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3201.28s)]
*  Well, as I keep pointing out, only 3% oppose, say they definitely oppose an immediate ceasefire, which is the same percentage as believe the earth is flat. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3204.28s)]
*  That is the position of the Labour Party though. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3212.28s)]
*  And the position is literally 3%, it's the same as believe the earth is flat. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3214.28s)]
*  I've seen Yasmin Qureshi, a Labour MP speak out and she's actually on the front bench, call for a demand a ceasefire going against, I would say, the Labour's official position. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3218.28s)]
*  So I mean, I think she's probably thinking to herself, go on, go and sack me then. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3228.28s)]
*  And because if they sack her, they're going to suffer a world of pain for doing that. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3232.28s)]
*  But she has broken the broken discipline. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3237.28s)]
*  But I guess, do you see any, do you see the possibility? [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3240.28s)]
*  Because I think the problem I would say is that he's surrounded by crazed neocons who believe the Iraq war was great. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3243.28s)]
*  I think that's the sort of people who now surround Kirstama and who I think is armaphobic. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3251.28s)]
*  We've seen multiple briefings against Muslim voters, Fatline Sven, they talked about Muslim voters being a bunch of anti-Semites and homophobes and that's why they didn't like Kirstama. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3256.28s)]
*  So I mean, that's my, you know, do you think it's possible to shift these people? [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3265.28s)]
*  I definitely think it's possible to shift. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3269.28s)]
*  I don't know whether we'll get to the position we want to, but I think shifting is absolutely part of the political fight that I think we're engaged in. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3271.28s)]
*  There are some good people as well. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3278.28s)]
*  And I'm glad you've mentioned it, you know. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3280.28s)]
*  When people talk about Labour, there are some brave, brave people in the party, including, you know, Yasmin Qureshi stood up and spoke today. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3282.28s)]
*  Absanah Begum, in the face of absolute tirades of abuse and threats, got up on stage on a Saturday and spoke for Palestinians and for Palestinian rights, justice, human rights, international law. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3290.28s)]
*  The likes of Zahra Sultana have spoken, John McDonnell has spoken. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3306.28s)]
*  Ali today has said he believes Israel has committed war crimes. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3309.28s)]
*  So this is what gives me hope. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3313.28s)]
*  If I'm optimistic, you know, I'm eternally optimistic. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3315.28s)]
*  Remember, I'm the guy who thought he was going to beat the Prime Minister, so maybe I'm optimistic to a fault. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3317.28s)]
*  But, you know, as disappointed and as tough as the last few days have been, I still believe in those people again, that we both fought alongside in 2019. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3324.28s)]
*  And I think the party still exists. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3337.28s)]
*  And rather than just focusing on one individual, I want to fight for them. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3339.28s)]
*  Like I say, it's a very, very personal choice. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3344.28s)]
*  Some have made other personal choices, and I respect that. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3346.28s)]
*  And that is a personal place that you have to come to. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3348.28s)]
*  But there is enough here, guys. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3352.28s)]
*  That's all I'm saying, you know. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3354.28s)]
*  And the thing that we have to remember, I was listening to some of your interviews earlier. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3356.28s)]
*  You know, the real courage is those innocent people who have bombs raining over their heads. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3360.28s)]
*  We're going to go to bed tonight without knowing whether they're going to wake up tomorrow. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3365.28s)]
*  Three-year-old kids that I've seen who have lost their lives under rubble. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3369.28s)]
*  They bear no responsibility for what's happened in the last 10 to 12 days. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3374.28s)]
*  They bear no responsibility to what's going to happen in the future over the coming 10 to 12 days. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3378.28s)]
*  It's their courage and strength that I draw upon. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3383.28s)]
*  And if I can do my part, even if it's small to shifting the Labour Party a little bit, I'll fight as long as I can. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3387.28s)]
*  But I have to say, I've never seen anything like this in the party with the scale of anger, pain and hurt. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3393.28s)]
*  And I desperately, desperately hope that people are listening. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3399.28s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3404.28s)]
*  I know you have to go and we've got to wrap up very shortly. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3405.28s)]
*  But I really, really appreciate it. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3407.28s)]
*  And as I said, this is a live ongoing debate and I'll keep platforming very different diverse opinions. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3408.28s)]
*  I'll be speaking to other councillors who've quit and obviously all those who've made the decision not to. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3413.28s)]
*  And the argument must be whatever happens, putting pressure on the Labour leadership and of course the Conservative government to shift course. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3418.28s)]
*  But Ali really, really appreciate it. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3424.28s)]
*  Great stuff. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3426.28s)]
*  I'll get a haircut next time. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3427.28s)]
*  Do you know what? I think I think well with it. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3428.28s)]
*  I think I like it. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3430.28s)]
*  I mean, I keep not sure. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3431.28s)]
*  I'm not sure about mine. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3433.28s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3434.28s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3435.28s)]
*  Lots of love. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3436.28s)]
*  Lots of love and solidarity. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3437.28s)]
*  And I'll speak to you soon. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3438.28s)]
*  By the way, I just want to say you have been an ardent, ardent supporter in the fight against Islamophobia for everyone listening. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3439.28s)]
*  I want to thank you for that work because it's not always easy to support Muslims when we're under the barrage of abuse that we have been. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3445.28s)]
*  And I want people to know both in private and public, you've always been a huge supporter in the fight against Islamophobia. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3451.28s)]
*  I want to thank you for that. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3456.28s)]
*  That means a lot. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3457.28s)]
*  And that, you know, it goes without saying. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3458.28s)]
*  And to the very end, I will always stand uncompromisingly against the horror of Islamophobia and with my Muslim siblings. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3461.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3468.28s)]
*  Take care, buddy. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3469.28s)]
*  Take care. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3470.28s)]
*  Take care. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3471.28s)]
*  Great stuff there from Ali. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3472.28s)]
*  I really, really appreciate having him. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3473.28s)]
*  I do have something to say, by the way, before we wrap up. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3475.28s)]
*  I just finished going through some super chats. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3478.28s)]
*  Yeah, Tad mentioned about Wix employees. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3482.28s)]
*  I'm going to do a video. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3484.28s)]
*  I think I'll launch it tonight on the attempt to intimidate those who stand with the Palestinian people. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3486.28s)]
*  The real cancel culture, if you like. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3493.28s)]
*  FSM is a dog. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3496.28s)]
*  I hope you'll have Miss Riley as a guest. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3497.28s)]
*  I think you're talking about Rachel Riley. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3499.28s)]
*  That is a no. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3500.28s)]
*  I'm sure she'll be gutted to hear that. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3501.28s)]
*  Dorothy Liu, thank you. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3505.28s)]
*  Tad Campbell, I'm sorry about Iran. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3508.28s)]
*  I will put that next time. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3510.28s)]
*  I'll try and discuss that issue. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3511.28s)]
*  And Tad, I'm an idiot, so sorry about that. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3514.28s)]
*  Thank you to State Daft. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3516.28s)]
*  Thank you to Super Tasman. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3518.28s)]
*  Thank you to Josephine Cameron. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3520.28s)]
*  Aziz, they think it's their promised land. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3522.28s)]
*  They can take it from whomever they are. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3525.28s)]
*  However, politics is never going to solve this, I'm afraid, because of religious motives. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3527.28s)]
*  Well, look, the land belongs to Arabs and Jews alike. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3529.28s)]
*  There's never going to be a lasting settlement unless there's peace and security for Arabs and Jews. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3532.28s)]
*  And we have to fight for that. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3536.28s)]
*  None of them to be displaced. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3538.28s)]
*  No one who lives there. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3542.28s)]
*  It's about living together. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3543.28s)]
*  And that means ending an illegal occupation. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3545.28s)]
*  It means ending apartheid. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3549.28s)]
*  And it means ensuring that all citizens have equality, regardless of their religion or ethnicity. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3550.28s)]
*  A. Crawshaw. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3556.28s)]
*  Well, I'm going to come on to this, actually. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3558.28s)]
*  That's very sweet. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3560.28s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3561.28s)]
*  David Barata. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3562.28s)]
*  I mentioned, thank you again for that great question. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3563.28s)]
*  FSM is the dog. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3566.28s)]
*  Starmo routinely crosses red lines. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3567.28s)]
*  Yes, I think supporting war crimes is definitely crossing one red line. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3569.28s)]
*  David Barata. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3572.28s)]
*  Okay, I'm not going to read out all these compliments. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3574.28s)]
*  Very sweet, though. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3576.28s)]
*  Thank you, David, for being very sweet. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3577.28s)]
*  And to Megha Sumra as well. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3581.28s)]
*  Thank you so much to A. Cranshaw. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3586.28s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3588.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3590.28s)]
*  In terms of these comments, in terms of saying thanks, I don't want to sound ungrateful. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3591.28s)]
*  But, you know, those of us who've stood as best we can over the last horrible weeks against an unbearable criminal onslaught against innocent people have received thanks. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3596.28s)]
*  But we don't deserve those thanks. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3614.28s)]
*  And there is no point me having the platform that I have, unless I use it at a time like this. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3617.28s)]
*  I would never forgive myself. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3627.28s)]
*  Never. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3629.28s)]
*  Now, I mean, people say, oh, it must be hard. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3630.28s)]
*  It must be so hard to, you know, to those who use that platform in this way. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3632.28s)]
*  It is the easiest thing in the world to oppose a crime of historic proportions, the horror of which will scream through the ages. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3636.28s)]
*  I'm not a Palestinian civilian trapped in a densely populated area living amongst horror, wondering if every day or every night will be my last on Earth. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3646.28s)]
*  And every day for so many of them, it is their last day or night on the face of this Earth. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3656.28s)]
*  Thousands of them perishing, innocent civilians in the rubble of Gaza as a military superpower, its leaders showering the airways with genocidal rhetoric, [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3662.28s)]
*  just as their rockets shower that tiny strip with lethal fire. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3673.28s)]
*  The thanks we owe are to the medics and the aid workers and the journalists who are there telling the world the truth of what is happening to Gaza. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3678.28s)]
*  Many of them are doing so amidst unimaginable terror. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3688.28s)]
*  And they are doing so often as they lose their friends, their lovers, their children. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3692.28s)]
*  The screams unheard by the accomplices of war crimes who occupy the seats of power of a Western world drenched in oceans of blood of the past and of the present. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3699.28s)]
*  But they are heard by us. They are heard by us. And they will be avenged by history, I hope, with justice. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3710.28s)]
*  Now, yes, there are people. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3719.28s)]
*  There are people in these rich countries who aren't having bombs rained upon them, using their platforms to support the Palestinian people who faced victimization, their careers menaced, threatened. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3722.28s)]
*  But they can take your job and they can take your livelihood, but they can't take your conscience or your humanity. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3740.28s)]
*  That is on you. And to have a platform now and not to speak out, to use your voice, to do everything that you can, is to be complicit, is to be complicit with a crime of historic proportions, a crime which has been committed in the name of all of us. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3747.28s)]
*  Now, without the invaluable support given to the state of Israel by our governments, the weapons to diplomatic cover and support, not just in the current war, but over many decades of illegal occupation and apartheid, the Israeli state could not do what it is doing. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3767.28s)]
*  And I'd say this to those who have a platform. You know what is happening. You do know what's happening to the people of Gaza, even if you pretend you don't really know what is happening. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3785.28s)]
*  I've seen some of you reading your Twitter feeds saying, oh, it's all so complicated. It's not for me to say what's right or wrong. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3798.28s)]
*  That is an excuse for silence when actually sometimes things really are quite simple. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3810.28s)]
*  Almost all of us were united in revulsion when Hamas murdered innocent civilians on that dark day of 7th of October. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3815.28s)]
*  The question which then arises is, do you support collective punishment and the mass slaughter of far, far, far more civilians than died on that day? [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3825.28s)]
*  Because already far, far more civilians have been killed than were killed on that horrible day and many, many thousands will die. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3838.28s)]
*  That is one certainty. Now, park for a minute. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3849.28s)]
*  The longest belligerent occupation of modern times, the siege of Gaza, which goes back so many years, the theft of land, the illegal settlements, the mass incarceration of Palestinian civilians, including children who have been subjected to torture, to sexual abuse, according to Save the Children. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3853.28s)]
*  The killings, 96% of all of the deaths in the 15 years before 7th of October were Palestinian. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3873.28s)]
*  The apartheid, as defined by the likes of Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the Israeli human rights organization, Bezalem. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3883.28s)]
*  The question that I would simply pose to those with a platform is, do you believe that a Palestinian life has an equal worth to that of an Israeli innocent life and a British innocent life or an American innocent life? [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3891.28s)]
*  Do you? Do you really though? Because forgive me, I don't think most of my colleagues do. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3907.28s)]
*  You see, for commentators of a right-wing disposition, I expect nothing less. They have dabbed their hands in racism for many, many years. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3915.28s)]
*  But what of those who call themselves liberals and moderates? Some hung Ukrainian flags from their windows. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3927.28s)]
*  They tweeted. They fulminated. They denounced the brutal crimes committed by Putin's regime against the people of Ukraine, and they were absolutely right to do so. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3934.28s)]
*  So did I. I did so because you should always stand against the evil and injustices of this world. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3946.28s)]
*  Russia unleashed a brutal and unjustified invasion, and they killed so many innocent people as they did so. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3956.28s)]
*  And I spoke out, and I did so knowing though, and let me make this clear, knowing there was no courage involved whatsoever. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3962.28s)]
*  Our media isn't cheering on Russia and its crimes. Neither are our politicians. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3967.28s)]
*  All I did actually is repeat a national consensus, tweet how awful Vladimir Putin is. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3972.28s)]
*  Well, I did that over and over again, and that was correct. I've said it on television over and over again, and that was correct. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3978.28s)]
*  But I wasn't damning something done in my name, was I? [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3985.28s)]
*  Now, some of you with your platform spend your time pumping out, I would say, often pretty basic anti-conservative content. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3988.28s)]
*  And some of you may think you're taking a brave stand, but you're not because the Tories have collapsed as a political force and have collapsed for a very long time. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=3995.28s)]
*  They've destroyed themselves and they are disgraced. They didn't need any help as they did so. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4002.28s)]
*  If all the moderate, self-defined, uncritical Labour cheerleaders, the influencers and commentators stop churning out the anti-conservative content, do you know what would change in the next general election? [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4007.28s)]
*  I'll tell you what would change in the next election in terms of its outcome. Absolutely nothing. Zero zilch. No impact whatsoever. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4018.28s)]
*  Churning out content essentially for the hell of it. There was no bravery or courage involved. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4026.28s)]
*  They are kicking a football into a goal whose goalkeeper abandoned it a very long time ago. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4031.28s)]
*  But if more people piled on pressure over this historic crime and raised awareness amongst the public about the horrors being inflicted on the innocent people of Gaza, [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4036.28s)]
*  that would put pressure on our Conservative government and also pressure on the Labour opposition. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4046.28s)]
*  Because critical, critical to forcing the government to shift course is to get Labour to shift course. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4052.28s)]
*  Because at the moment the Conservatives know they don't need to put pressure on the Israeli state for the crimes it's committing because their feet are not being held to the fire of the Labour Party, [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4059.28s)]
*  leading and giving voice to public opinion which is increasingly angry about what is happening to innocent people. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4070.28s)]
*  But the point is if these commentators suddenly did this, they'll get yelled at. You will get yelled at. You'll get screamed at. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4077.28s)]
*  You'll get denounced by some of your own allies, some of your own base, the audience you've spent years curating, often quite lucratively. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4084.28s)]
*  You'll get yelled at by some of the people who pay for your content and you will be accused wrongly of terrible, terrible things you're not guilty of. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4092.28s)]
*  And you will get death threats. It takes some guts, doesn't it, after all? [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4098.280000000001s)]
*  But I've seen liberal commentators, self-described, moderate commentators, self-defined, either say nothing or say, oh, it's all so sad, isn't it? It's all so sad, so awful. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4102.280000000001s)]
*  Meaningless platitudes, where there were excoriating moral condemnation of Putin's horror and damnation for those deemed apologists of what Putin did, [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4111.28s)]
*  there is almost silence now, silence. The occasional retweet by some of a BBC report about Palestinian suffering and nothing more. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4121.28s)]
*  Where there was burning passion, and there is about the horrors of the Conservative government, there is almost nothing for its own critical support for what Israel is doing. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4130.28s)]
*  Now, some of you, in your attempt to show up your moral standing, knowing that like entire neighbourhoods in Gaza, it's been shredded by these Israeli missiles, [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4139.28s)]
*  are now spending a lot of your time, I can see, hunting down examples of this or that extremist who supports Palestinian solidarity, [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4147.28s)]
*  who in no way are representative of those who stand with the Palestinian people in their time of horror, [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4154.28s)]
*  trying to claim that it's those, therefore, who oppose this historic crime who are the real ones who are morally indecent and outrageous. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4161.28s)]
*  And that is a shield, but I'll tell you this, you are complicit in what's going on. You have no moral high ground. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4168.28s)]
*  There is no cost to the stands you take against Putin's Russia, like everybody else, or a Conservative government that long imploded. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4173.28s)]
*  There's no courage involved. That what there is now is a horror which is happening in your name, which most of our media supports and our political establishment supports, [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4180.28s)]
*  and you have made yourself complicit in a moral outrage by not speaking out or by trying to suggest it's all too complicated to take a stand. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4190.28s)]
*  You either speak now or you do deserve to be damned by history and you should never, ever be listened to on any moral question ever, ever again. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4198.28s)]
*  That's my view on that. Now, we have lots of content to come. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4207.28s)]
*  I'm going to give a platform to the voices we need to be hearing from, not least an Israeli academic who has been hounded out of their job. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4214.28s)]
*  I'm going to be listing some of the examples of those who've been hounded out of their jobs. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4228.28s)]
*  And I will be interviewing Palestinian voices, Arab voices, Muslim voices as well, and Jewish voices both in Israel and here who are fighting for peace. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4233.28s)]
*  So we have lots to do in the coming days and coming weeks. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4247.28s)]
*  And as you will be aware, I do this live show every or many of you will. I do this live show at five o'clock every week, but I also do, we put our videos, daily videos on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, podcast, all the rest of it. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4253.28s)]
*  And they're reaching a huge number of people, which is great because, I mean, just looking here on Instagram, last 30 days, over 2 million accounts reached. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4270.28s)]
*  We reached millions on YouTube in the last month, millions separately on Facebook and also on Twitter and also on the podcast. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4281.28s)]
*  So we are reaching people and we're going to be doing lots and lots more to reach people. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4289.28s)]
*  And because what's the point of having this platform otherwise? Press like and subscribe. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4294.28s)]
*  I'll clip some of the stuff, including clipping. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4300.28s)]
*  I mean, it's so important people hear from that brilliant doctor who was so glad to have just what people are going through and being able to speak so eloquently about what's happening. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4306.28s)]
*  But we need to get that one particular out. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4315.28s)]
*  Lots of love everyone. This is grim, but it's particularly grim, obviously, for those who are suffering this historic horror. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4319.28s)]
*  And also, I just want to say, I mean, probably what Ali said there, I mean, it's so important, again, those of us on platform particularly stand with our Muslim siblings at a time like this, because a lesson is being spelled out to a significant chunk of the British population that the British media and politicians do not care when people who are not white and people, for example, who are Muslim are being slaughtered en masse. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4328.28s)]
*  And that is telling Muslim citizens of this country something, which is the lives of people like you are not worth or not of equal worth. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4353.28s)]
*  I know it's really important we speak out and challenge the racism which defines this entire discussion, anti-Palestinian racism, anti-Muslim racism. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4362.28s)]
*  And we need to double down on that. We need to as well give that platform to the incredibly courageous Jewish voices, both here and in Israel. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4373.28s)]
*  And I've been trying to do exactly that. And I've got many interviews there to come and to take on always and always be vigilant against the evil of anti-Semitism. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4384.28s)]
*  Anti-Semitism is real. It does exist. Two thousand years of it embedded in European culture. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4395.28s)]
*  And, you know, it has to be taken on as an evil in itself. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4401.28s)]
*  But also the fact that so many Jewish people did come to conclude that their safety and security could only be bound up by the state of Israel was because of that persecution and that hatred and bile. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4407.28s)]
*  And that continues to be the case. And until Jewish people are made to feel safe wherever they live, then it will be difficult to end this horror. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4421.28s)]
*  And that has to be taken seriously. And I've always tried to take that seriously. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4432.28s)]
*  So I hope as well everyone takes that on board because we have seen a big increase of anti-Semitism in the aftermath of this, where people again try to blame Jewish people individually for the behavior of the Israeli people. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4435.28s)]
*  And that has to be fought. So we stand with our Muslim and our Jewish siblings. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4451.28s)]
*  And don't forget the march as well on Saturday. I'll be there. We'll be marching every week. All of us, I hope. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4456.28s)]
*  But yes, as I said, interviews tomorrow, video later and lots of love everyone. And press like and subscribe. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4463.28s)]
*  You can support the kitchen on their own, patreon.com. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4470.28s)]
*  Thank you so much to everyone who on SuperShot have gone through that. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4472.28s)]
*  So we'll do that again. Lots of love everyone and I'll speak to you soon. Take care. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY405o2xek4&t=4478.28s)]
