# I Defended Palestinian Kids - And Got Shut Down
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeNTmRXVMsc)
*  It should not be controversial to oppose the killing of both Palestinian and Israeli children and civilians.
*  It shouldn't be controversial to oppose war crimes.
*  But when I went on Sky News this week to calmly and gently do just that,
*  I was interrupted, heckled and lied about and my other guests did all they could to shut down any mention of Palestinian suffering.
*  This is a case study of what's happening now when there's any attempt at all to affirm the humanity of the Palestinian people.
*  Now, I'll share this clip, but for context, I was asked to go on Sky News last week before the Atrocity for Labour Party conference.
*  It was only a few hours before the programme that I was told that the Labour MP Margaret Hodge was on.
*  I'm not saying this to have a go at Sky News.
*  It's just firstly, we should be elevating other voices at the moment, particularly Palestinian voices,
*  and also, I think, for reasons which will become very evident when you watch this clip.
*  Now, I'll post the whole clip for context so you'll see why.
*  Well, let's bring in our panel now, shall we?
*  The former Minister of Senior Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge and the author and Guardian columnist Owen James.
*  I mean, I don't even know where to start.
*  I mean, the stories that are coming out and we're learning more and more about this, it is heartbreaking.
*  It is sickening, as President Biden was saying.
*  Margaret, you were talking earlier before we went on air about how you visited the kibbutz recently,
*  that we have seen some of these horrors emerging from.
*  Yeah, I've got a lump in my throat, Sophie, so I'm sorry about that.
*  But I was at Kafar Azhar in February.
*  We spent a day there.
*  And I spent the day with a third generation kibbutznik, so the kibbutz has been there for ages.
*  And as you walked the periphery of the kibbutz, you could hear the call to prayer from the Muslims on the Garthas side.
*  And you'd think, for goodness sake, why don't these two communities talk to each other?
*  But what was so awful, it isn't a rich kibbutz.
*  It sort of felt to me like an inner sort of, you know, inner council estate.
*  You know, the housing wasn't very well off.
*  They made their money from a plastics factory and every home had a covering.
*  Because they were used to bombs.
*  They had a minute to get to the shelters.
*  And the covering was supposed to protect their homes.
*  Now, what is so awful is the people I've traveled with had been in touch with the woman who'd showed us around,
*  spent the day with us and showed us around.
*  And she's been WhatsApping with us.
*  And what we now realize is that probably the WhatsApps that came back weren't from her.
*  They were from Hamas.
*  And the idea that 40 babies were killed there, some of them beheaded, that homes were ruined, that adults were killed.
*  We don't know how many are left of the people that we met there.
*  It's just beyond, beyond horrible.
*  And what is worse about it is I think it's going to get worse before it gets better.
*  And I just, you know, I haven't got relatives and friends there.
*  But, you know, obviously, as a part of the Jewish community,
*  everybody I talk to has got somebody they know there, a cousin, brother-in-law, you know, brother or sister.
*  Somebody is there.
*  And this absolutely horrific bit of terrorism is condemned over.
*  I condemn it.
*  I stand by Israel.
*  I was proud today that there was a standing ovation when Keir said he stands by Israel.
*  And I just, Israel has got the right to defend itself.
*  I hope they do that within the rule of law.
*  And what is particularly depressing for me, having been there in February,
*  I think this has pushed back for years, if not decades, the idea that we can never come to a peaceful solution.
*  It's pushed the agenda back.
*  The terrorists have managed that.
*  They're out, you know, maybe that's what they wanted.
*  But it's pushed that agenda into the background rather than bringing it forward.
*  Thank you.
*  I know it must be really difficult after you've been there.
*  You've met some of the people living there.
*  And so thank you for sharing, you know, your experiences of it.
*  It does bring it to life what some of those horrors are that we've seen.
*  Do you share that fear that things are going to get worse before they get better?
*  Yes, of course.
*  And obviously, firstly, it's so important to share the disgust and horror of what happened.
*  I was at a rave on Saturday with my friend who's an Israeli citizen.
*  And I was with him as he took a call from his family.
*  His niece escaped that rave.
*  Two of her friends were kidnapped and are now being held hostage by Hamas.
*  There's no cause on earth which justifies the slaughter of innocent civilians.
*  And, you know, the horror and disgust, you know, is wrong with so many people.
*  And the anguish of what those left behind are going for is indescribable.
*  Obviously, my concern about what happens next is partly informed by what's happened before.
*  When we talk about how Israel responds, already the Israeli government,
*  which is a far-right government, have made clear that they will institute a policy of collective punishment.
*  The defense minister said, I've ordered a complete siege in the Gaza Strip.
*  There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel.
*  Everything is closed.
*  We are fighting human animals and we act accordingly.
*  That is the language of war crimes.
*  It is illegal under international law to impose collective punishment on a people.
*  80% of those who live in Gaza, which is an open-air prison, depend on humanitarian aid.
*  But you're not acknowledging Owen.
*  You're not acknowledging Owen.
*  Margaret, I'll let you speak at the right length.
*  I tell you what I can't stand is that you're using the horrors that we've experienced in the last three days
*  to bang the drum about an issue that you've been banging the drum on for ever.
*  And what I think you should really think about is how the people of Israel, who have now been there for us,
*  have nowhere else to go.
*  They have nowhere else to go.
*  Is it possible for me to respond?
*  Right now, Palestinian children, whose life is as sacred as a child in Israel, are being slaughtered.
*  They are dying, okay?
*  Now, 50% of the...
*  Please let me finish.
*  I'll let you come in.
*  50% of the population of the Gaza Strip are children.
*  And those children are being bombed by a government which has said that we are fighting human animals and we act accordingly.
*  Benjamin Netanyahu demanded the civilians of Gaza Strip leave.
*  You cannot leave the Gaza Strip.
*  It is under blockade by air, sea and land.
*  Now, 96%...
*  Please let me finish.
*  Yeah, I will, but...
*  96%, because Margaret spoke at length, 96% of those who have died in the last 15 years are Palestinians.
*  And we cannot talk about what's happened because, you know, when I spoke to my Israeli friend, who took that call,
*  for him, what he wants is this to never happen again.
*  And that context for him was so important.
*  Because unless there was a lasting peace, which does mean ending the occupation and a policy of apartheid,
*  and ending the murder of Palestinian civilians, then this will never end.
*  Margaret.
*  Well, all I would say is that Owen is completely and utterly ignoring what has happened over the last few days.
*  I just ignore.
*  You haven't...
*  I'm just talking about it.
*  Owen, just wait.
*  All you've talked about, Owen, is your obsession, the obsession with so many people around the issue around Palestine.
*  It's been an obsession forever.
*  And you should just think, just think at the moment.
*  If you were an Israeli sitting there, if you had family, I mean, here I am, I'm sitting here, and the people I visited,
*  probably, I don't know how many of them are still alive.
*  Are you saying they have no right to defend themselves?
*  Are you saying they have no right to peace?
*  All you have argued is how...
*  I've never supported the Netanyahu government.
*  I've always been critical of that.
*  But at this moment in time, at this moment in time, at this moment in time, this is the most horrific,
*  this is the most horrific occasion of...
*  And you should...
*  You condemn it.
*  Do you even condemn it?
*  I just opened, in the strongest possible terms, condemning the atrocity of Ha'as.
*  I don't believe a military solution...
*  We don't think they have a right to defend their state of Israel.
*  The military solutions that have been pursued against the Gaza Strip have led to huge bloodshed.
*  You don't think they have the right to defend themselves?
*  A military attack on Gaza will lead to countless dead Israeli soldiers and huge numbers of civilians.
*  They should allow the hostages to die.
*  Don't have to allow the hostages to die.
*  Margaret, when you said...
*  When you said...
*  When you said...
*  It's very difficult to have a conversation if you just speak over each other.
*  Don't think it's that guy's fault.
*  You make me really angry because you're using this horror...
*  No, Margaret, Margaret, Margaret.
*  I am...
*  I'm going to come in.
*  I have to talk...
*  I am actually going to come in, okay?
*  I'm going to come in.
*  Sorry.
*  Thank you both of you for speaking...
*  No, no, we have to talk about the Palestinians being killed now.
*  That's the point.
*  That's not an obsession with the issue.
*  I get that.
*  But to say it's an obsession with Palestine when we're talking about Palestinian civilians who are being killed right now.
*  Thank you very much for coming on the program and having the debate.
*  It's...
*  Look, it is...
*  I utterly accept that with babies, children dying...
*  Both?
*  Both.
*  And they both matter the same?
*  With babies and children...
*  To say that controversial is...
*  I think it's pretty clear that with babies and children dying, emotions are running extremely high.
*  And I actually think that this just demonstrates this...
*  Well, the emotion that people are feeling, the anger that people are feeling now.
*  What do you even say here?
*  What do you even say?
*  Now, a few things here, and I'm not saying this because I'm some sort of victim.
*  Really important to talk about that in that context.
*  It's not about me.
*  This is about what happens to any attempt to affirm the basic humanity of the Palestinian people right now.
*  Notice how I listened at the beginning there in total respectful silence when Margaret Hodge spoke.
*  Notice how I spoke at length in condemnation about the sickening atrocity unleashed by Hamas.
*  Notice how Margaret Hodge immediately interrupts any attempt to talk about the killing of Palestinian civilians
*  or indeed any discussion whatsoever about Palestinian suffering.
*  Notice how Margaret Hodge frames any discussion of Palestinian people as arising from some sort of weird obsession
*  people like me have with Palestine, even though the killing of Palestinian civilians is happening right now as you listen to me speak.
*  Notice how Margaret Hodge then lies, flagrantly lies, by claiming I never condemned the horror Hamas was responsible for.
*  I don't say lying flippantly.
*  I just do not understand how it's possible to listen to what I said and then conclude at the end that I hadn't condemned Hamas.
*  How's that even possible?
*  Absolutely incredible wild behavior.
*  Now right now there is a systematic attempt to shut down the truth about what's happening to the Palestinian people.
*  That we can't talk about the brutal consequences of occupation of the siege of Gaza, of the apartheid described by multiple human rights groups
*  including in Israel itself or the huge Palestinian death toll that predated what's happened in this current horror show
*  or the mass murder of Palestinians right now.
*  Well that's what makes it even more important.
*  That's what makes it important for us to shout louder.
*  To not be drowned out and to never ever ever stop fighting for the only just settlement which will offer peace and security to Arabs and Jews alike
*  which is what we should all be fighting for and that's an end to the occupation of Palestine and a Palestine that is free.
