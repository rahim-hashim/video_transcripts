# Israeli War on Lebanon Looms - w/. Nasser Elamine
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [June 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE)
*  Now, since October, the focus has obviously been on Israel's genocidal rampage in Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=0.0s)]
*  But of course, that's only part of the story. For example, we've had the essentially a pogrom [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=6.0s)]
*  going on in the West Bank, which has been largely ignored. But we now have the possibility [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  of all-out war between Israel and Lebanon. There has been, it's been rumbling on for [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=16.72s)]
*  months between Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and Israel. But increasingly, there is speculation [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=24.16s)]
*  that this could explode into something much more devastating. There's a terrible history here in [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=32.96s)]
*  terms of horrible atrocities committed by Israel in Lebanon. So no better person to speak to about [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  this than Nasser El-Amin, he's the editor at Al-Quds al-Rabbi, and is a specialist in this whole area. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=46.16s)]
*  So that makes sense to talk to you. So I'm really honored to speak to Nasser. How are you doing? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=51.92s)]
*  Hey, thank you. And thank you for having me. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=55.440000000000005s)]
*  I just want to start, just because people might not know about the kind of broader context in terms [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=58.24s)]
*  of what happened with Israel and Lebanon, going back to the 80s and the invasion then. So I just [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=63.52s)]
*  wondering if you could kind of give a kind of praise here, I guess, of the kind of context and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=70.56s)]
*  also some of the atrocities, I guess, that were committed by Israel back then. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=75.2s)]
*  Yeah. So actually, the first invasion of Lebanon happened in 78 before the 80s. The Israelis at the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=78.32s)]
*  time invaded Lebanon under the pretense that it was a response to a PLO operation that killed, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=86.32s)]
*  I think, 30 Israelis. They advanced, reached the Lethani River, which is a river in the south. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=92.88s)]
*  It's also the same line they want Hezbollah to retreat north of now. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  At the time, the UN managed to mediate a deal, an agreement between the PLO and Israel to [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=105.19999999999999s)]
*  retreat, to cease fire. This happened two years after, or three years after the civil war in [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  Lebanon, which was fought largely between the LNM, which is the Lebanese National Movement, a group of [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  leftist and nationalist sort of political parties, and the right-wing Christian [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=130.4s)]
*  militias, which were led by the phalangists who had ties to Israel. Some say that they [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=141.6s)]
*  were trained by the Israelis. The phalangists obviously denied this. My point here is that [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=148.56s)]
*  Israel had a history of also meddling internally with Lebanon. They were obstructing deals [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=154.88000000000002s)]
*  between these parties that ended up striking or starting a civil war. This was also eight years [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=160.4s)]
*  after the PLO relocated its headquarters to Lebanon. In 1982 was the second invasion. That [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=167.04000000000002s)]
*  was the invasion in which Israel reached Beirut, Bezidj for two months, during which the Sabran [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=177.2s)]
*  Shatila massacre happened. It was committed by the phalangists, but under the support of Israel, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=186.64s)]
*  Ariel Charon at the time. Around 3,000 Palestinians and Lebanese Shias were killed during. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=192.56s)]
*  The siege ended with the expulsion of the PLO from Lebanon and the retreat of Israel back to the south [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=199.83999999999997s)]
*  of Lebanon, which they continued to occupy for many years afterwards. That was around the time [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=209.2s)]
*  when Hezbollah declared armed resistance against the Israelis and managed to expel them by the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=215.51999999999998s)]
*  year 2000, during which about 200,000 displaced Lebanese people in the south of Lebanon. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=223.28s)]
*  There were about 80-something villages that were partially destroyed, 10 villages that were [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=232.48s)]
*  completely destroyed, and obviously endless deaths. Then six years later there was the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=237.44s)]
*  2006 war. Israel completely demolished Lebanon, but strategically they lost that war because they [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=244.96s)]
*  couldn't achieve the primary goal they had, which was to end Hezbollah. Around 1,000 Lebanese people [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=250.96s)]
*  died during that war. I think it's really a brilliant exposition of that history. I mean, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=256.64s)]
*  with Shabran Shatila, Ariel Charon, as you mentioned, his defense, I just think it just [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=263.04s)]
*  underlines the kind of, at the moment, we'll talk about various Israeli politicians and leaders [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=266.96000000000004s)]
*  talking about collective guilt as the basis for genocidal ideation. Shabran Shatila, this is really [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=272.56s)]
*  grim thing to just throw into a discussion. So just people should prepare themselves. But [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=280.08s)]
*  there was an example of a pregnant woman having her stomach sliced open and the feet are taken out. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=286.47999999999996s)]
*  That was then, that happened, and that was alleged to have happened on the 7th of October, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=293.44s)]
*  it never happened. It was actually an example of an Israeli, an atrocity with Israeli complicity, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=297.84s)]
*  because Ariel Charon was held responsible by an Israeli commission and then became prime minister. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=302.32s)]
*  I just think it's quite striking about what's happened with Hezbollah since, because there's, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=306.8s)]
*  Hamas is one thing, and Hamas hasn't been defeated by Israel in Gaza at all. I mean, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=312.88s)]
*  US intelligence officials are briefing that not only have far fewer Hamas militants been killed [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=318.32s)]
*  than Israel says, then shock horror. Their ranks have been replenished, because it turns out, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=324.4s)]
*  if you wage a genocidal war on people, then they decide they have nothing to lose and [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=331.52s)]
*  they want to fight back. That kind of, I don't know, don't know why people are surprised. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=335.92s)]
*  But that's one thing, but Hezbollah just aren't Hamas, although there's just, they're in a different [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=339.12s)]
*  category. Yeah, I mean, one can only look, for example, the Hezbollah that fought in the 2006 [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=343.52s)]
*  war had, I don't have the number of how many missiles they had, but none of those missiles, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=351.52s)]
*  almost none of those missiles were precision missiles, precision guided missiles. And they [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=357.03999999999996s)]
*  still managed to cost Israel about $4.3 billion in damages. Since then, Hezbollah has acquired [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=361.2s)]
*  much higher amounts of missiles, a lot of which are precision guided. They now produce those [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=370.47999999999996s)]
*  missiles locally, but they also since, they also partook in the Syrian civil war. And during that [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=375.92s)]
*  war, they fought continuously, there was continuous guerrilla warfare, which is essentially training [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=383.76s)]
*  for 10 years. So not only are they now heavily armed, the Israeli estimates are around 200,000 [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=390.4s)]
*  missiles. Recently, a colleague, Ali Hershem wrote for Foreign Policy, and he cites an [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=397.35999999999996s)]
*  Revolutionary Guard, an Iranian Revolutionary Guard source that says they have a million missiles. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=405.59999999999997s)]
*  So the estimates are between the Israelis saying, their enemies saying 200,000 and their allies [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=410.32s)]
*  saying a million. So you can imagine the number is somewhere between those two numbers. And that's [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=414.79999999999995s)]
*  much more than most armies have. In addition, they have these immensely skilled fighters. So [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=419.92s)]
*  the idea that Israel might be able to invade Lebanon through land is just incomprehensible. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=425.52000000000004s)]
*  During 2006, they attempted it. They could not get past the first couple of villages. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=431.2s)]
*  So yeah, there's no comparison between Hezbollah and Hamas in terms of arms training and [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=436.08000000000004s)]
*  essentially the capacity for destruction within Israel. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=442.56s)]
*  What's been going on basically since 7 October? We've seen this escalation and that's to do with [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=445.52s)]
*  Israel's onslaught against Gaza. Essentially, that's why this has escalated. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=454.4s)]
*  Yeah, no, that's precisely why it escalated. I mean, Hezbollah has been very clear since then. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=459.59999999999997s)]
*  You end the aggression against Gaza, this ends, the war in the north ends. But precisely because [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=464.71999999999997s)]
*  of these capacities that Hezbollah has acquired over the last, I don't know, 18 years, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=470.88s)]
*  they've managed to sort of impose this equation, this sort of contained battlefield. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=478.0s)]
*  Immediately in the first month or two, the Israelis were forced to displace about 90,000 of [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=489.84s)]
*  the northern settlers. Hezbollah was also, Lebanon was also forced to displace about 100,000 or 90,000 [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=497.04s)]
*  of the people living in the south. So they immediately drew out these borders for the [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=503.68s)]
*  battle and the escalations almost always remained within these borders. Israel obviously transgressed [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=508.96000000000004s)]
*  on several occasions. They assassinated Hezbollah leaders, they assassinated the Hamas leader. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=517.2s)]
*  And but they've managed to contain it precisely because Hezbollah wants it to remain contained. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=522.8s)]
*  They have no interest in an all-out war. No one in the region has any interest in an all-out war. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=531.6800000000001s)]
*  What they want is a very specific thing to end the war in Gaza. So I'm wondering then in terms of [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=538.8s)]
*  could this just carry on indefinitely in that, you know, I mean, Israel's official position is [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=544.88s)]
*  this isn't tolerable. Northern Israel is basically becoming uninhabitable because of this [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=549.2s)]
*  ongoing escalation. But you pointed out the capacity, the capabilities of Hezbollah are [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=556.4000000000001s)]
*  way beyond anything of Hamas. But equally within Lebanese society, there isn't an appetite, is there, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=565.6800000000001s)]
*  for any form of war conflict? So what happens? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=571.5200000000001s)]
*  I mean, of course, there's no appetite for any conflict. But at the same time, I mean, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=577.0400000000001s)]
*  so I think what is likely to happen, it's all in Israel's hands, essentially. Israel have the [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=584.32s)]
*  problem. The problem is that they cannot convince the settlers in the north to return without real [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=593.6800000000001s)]
*  security assurances, right? They can't go to the settlers and say, you know, we've ended the war [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=600.08s)]
*  in Gaza. Now Hezbollah has decided to stop attacking us. You can come back. It's safe. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=605.76s)]
*  Because now those people, those settlers in the north know that Hezbollah can subvert the Iron [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=610.0s)]
*  Dome. They have drones. They have the capacity to attack them at any moment. And they have no reason [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=615.6s)]
*  to trust that Hezbollah will not do this. The Israeli government may have reason to trust them [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=621.52s)]
*  because they're aware of sort of the geopolitical constraints, but the settlers don't. And so they [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=627.68s)]
*  can't convince them to come back. And they have this plan to have the displaced people return to [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=633.12s)]
*  the north by the next school year, so October, I think. So they're stuck sort of in this in this [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=639.04s)]
*  deadlock. Either they approach Hezbollah, they approach Hezbollah, and they commit themselves [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=645.68s)]
*  to an all out war or some sort of, they like to call them operations, concentrated operations, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=652.16s)]
*  to sort of deal Hezbollah some sort of decisive blow, which is highly unlikely, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=658.56s)]
*  at least highly unlikely without leading to immense destruction in Israel as well. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=667.36s)]
*  Hezbollah has the capacity to attack Haifa, Tel Aviv, all these large cities, in addition to [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=672.64s)]
*  the settlements in the north. So yeah, the Israelis are stuck in this sort of deadlock. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=679.28s)]
*  They have to do something about it. And I think right now the Americans are trying to [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=686.0s)]
*  sort of avoid this all out escalation that to the Israelis, I think even to Gantt, who just left the [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=691.76s)]
*  war cabinet, which was then later dissolved, said he's committed to some sort of operation against [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=698.96s)]
*  Hezbollah. They find it to be inevitable. So unless the Americans are capable of convincing [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=705.6s)]
*  the Israelis that this is not an inevitability, that you can somehow negotiate with Hezbollah, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=710.0s)]
*  then it's likely to happen. On the other hand, almost immediately after the sort of talk became [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=716.24s)]
*  serious in Israel about escalating to an all out war, the second day, I think the deputy chief of [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=725.2s)]
*  Hezbollah, Naim Qasim came out and sort of reiterated the Hezbollah position. We do not want an [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=731.44s)]
*  all out war, but we're willing to sort of go through with it if the Israelis insist. And [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=737.76s)]
*  and immediately after the Americans came out and sort of reasserted the association between [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=744.48s)]
*  Gaza and the Northern Front, they said if the war in Gaza ends, the war on the Northern Front ends. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=751.8399999999999s)]
*  So yeah, it seems like to the Israelis, this seems like an inevitability. To Hezbollah, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=759.76s)]
*  it seems I think they can just keep going at this pace if they need it to. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=765.52s)]
*  S1 How serious do you think we should take, I mean really blood curdling statements from Israeli [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=770.88s)]
*  ministers, quite again genocidal information about basically just destroying, laying waste to [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=776.48s)]
*  Beirut and to Lebanon in general? S2 I mean, this depends on essentially on how [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=782.0s)]
*  unhinged Netanyahu gets. Because the thing about attacking Beirut is that there's no real reason [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=790.48s)]
*  for it. There's no Hezbollah infrastructure in Beirut. In 2006, the first place that sort of the [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=797.92s)]
*  first target they had was the airport. The reason being or the reason they said but also it was in [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=805.12s)]
*  a way valid is that Hezbollah would import their weapons through the airport. It's no longer the [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=810.7199999999999s)]
*  case. Hezbollah has, Lebanon has immense borders with Syria, and they sort of have an open line [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=816.88s)]
*  from Lebanon to Iran. They're capable of importing weapons without having to, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=823.52s)]
*  having them pass through Beirut. So to everyone, this would appear as an immense and unjustified [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=830.0s)]
*  aggression to attack Beirut. Plus it would entail, it would almost, it would intensify the possibility [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=836.72s)]
*  of there being a regional war. Hezbollah to Iran is the equivalent, well it's not the equivalent, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=846.48s)]
*  but you can make this parallel. It is the equivalent of Israel to America. While the, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=855.04s)]
*  sort of the war on Gaza was, there was the possibility of this becoming a regional war [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=862.96s)]
*  because of the war on Gaza, but it was contained for regional, the geopolitical interests that sort [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=867.04s)]
*  of intervened in the Gulf and Iran and all over. But if you attack Hezbollah, Iran will have to [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=873.36s)]
*  somehow become involved, whether it's through the militias in Syria and Iraq and the resistance in [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=882.48s)]
*  Iraq and Houthis or some other way. No one knows, but it is, it will sort of amplify that possibility. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=888.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm just also interested in terms of how Lebanon was a training ground really for, well, the [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=898.0s)]
*  Daha Doctrine 2006 of destroying civilian infrastructure in order to put pressure on [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=905.36s)]
*  movements which Israel obviously, well, hostile movements to Israel basically. And it did that [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=914.48s)]
*  with, that was tried out in Lebanon in 2006 and that was a training ground for Gaza, wasn't it? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=921.76s)]
*  That's, I mean, that's known as terrorism. When you destroy civilian infrastructure, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=926.64s)]
*  target civilian targets in order to achieve a political goal, that's just terrorism, isn't it? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=930.16s)]
*  But that's what they, that was their training ground, wasn't it, Lebanon, for what they've [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=936.4s)]
*  taken to the most extreme kind of positioning Gaza. Yeah. The only issue with that now is that you [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=940.4s)]
*  may be, like every time the generous, sort of the chief of Hezbollah comes out and speaks, Hassan [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=949.1999999999999s)]
*  Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam, he always says, you're capable of destroying Lebanon. And [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=955.12s)]
*  it's correct. They have, I don't think Hezbollah has defense capabilities that would be able to [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=958.88s)]
*  deter Israel from completely demolishing Lebanon in a matter of weeks. The only problem now is that [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=964.5600000000001s)]
*  Hezbollah is also capable of doing this to the Israelis. So mutually insured destruction. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=971.28s)]
*  Mutually insured destruction. It's also, it's meant to be mutual deterrence. So, but if, so [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=978.48s)]
*  Hezbollah is capable of attacking all these, all these major cities in Israel, it's capable of [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=984.8s)]
*  causing immense damage. And so the Israelis have to take that into account. It would be an [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=989.5999999999999s)]
*  unprecedented event for them to have Haifa and Tel Aviv attacked. Now the estimates are about 5,000 [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=995.8399999999999s)]
*  missiles a day over eight months. I mean, what, this is just, I think this is outside of the [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=1003.3599999999999s)]
*  comprehension, the imagination of Israelis, whether government, army or people. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=1010.32s)]
*  So finally, I mean, where do you, how do you think this will pan out? Would you think there's [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=1018.88s)]
*  a timeframe? Do you think this is just similar on for ages? Do you think, I don't know, maybe [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=1021.6s)]
*  the presidential elections is a kind of holding position? I mean, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=1025.6000000000001s)]
*  honestly, it's difficult to tell. It's, I think the next couple of weeks will be very decisive. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=1033.2s)]
*  The Americans are trying, I think, very hard not to allow this to escalate into a regional war, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=1037.6799999999998s)]
*  allow to sort of find ways for the Israelis to not have to go through with this war. And I don't [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=1043.76s)]
*  think the Israelis want to, I don't think the IDF wants to, I don't think Netanyahu really wants a [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=1050.7199999999998s)]
*  war like this. I mean, the options they've drawn out for themselves are almost ridiculous. They, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=1055.36s)]
*  I read an article, I can't remember when, Israeli newspaper, detailing what the Israeli options are [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=1064.08s)]
*  right now. The first option is that they somehow, in whichever way they end the war in Gaza, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=1070.7199999999998s)]
*  and they sort of, and that automatically ends the war in Lebanon. And so, you know, they just [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=1078.0s)]
*  compromise and have it that way. No one wants this specifically for the reason I said before, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=1084.8799999999999s)]
*  because they cannot ensure the security of the settlements, which means that the Northern [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=1089.2s)]
*  settlers will not return. The second option is that they strike some sort of deal with Hamas [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=1095.04s)]
*  to retrieve those detained by Hamas, and then they sort of, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=1101.2s)]
*  sort of go towards a war with Lebanon. And that is, I think, what they're looking to do right now. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=1110.88s)]
*  The third is that they just, they don't officially end the war in Gaza, but practically they do. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=1117.12s)]
*  The justification is that they've weakened Hamas enough for Hamas not to be able to sort of [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=1123.1999999999998s)]
*  enact a repeat of October 7th. And so, there is no real need to continue this war. They can just [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=1128.9599999999998s)]
*  sort of end it, whether, they can just sort of strike a deal or end it by, not really end it, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=1137.36s)]
*  only practically end it, and then sort of move all their sources towards a war in Lebanon. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=1143.44s)]
*  But in all three options, I just, I don't see how they're able to sort of achieve any goals, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=1150.16s)]
*  any strategic goals in Lebanon. Yeah, it seems, I mean, that's kind of the picket point, isn't it? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=1161.6000000000001s)]
*  A lot of these kind of saber rattling and quite disturbing rhetoric, mass the fact they've [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=1171.6s)]
*  suffered a terrible strategic defeat in Gaza, as is, and they would also suffer an even bigger [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=1179.76s)]
*  strategic defeat if they attempted to escalate this to Lebanon. So basically, there's a correlation [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=1186.08s)]
*  between how bad things have got for Israel in terms of this route and how kind of, you know, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=1192.7199999999998s)]
*  intimidating the rhetoric is, I suppose. So that was such a fascinating conversation, honestly. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=1201.2s)]
*  I learned a huge amount. I know everyone listening will have learned a huge amount, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=1207.76s)]
*  the context and in terms of why this is happening, what is plausibly could happen in the coming [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=1211.04s)]
*  weeks and coming months. And there hasn't been enough discussion about this, not least from [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=1217.8400000000001s)]
*  people who know what they're talking about. So I really appreciate your time, Nasser. Do you like [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=1221.52s)]
*  and subscribe? Do you leave your comments? Let us know your thoughts. Do you share? Make sure everyone [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=1225.3600000000001s)]
*  hears this as well as possible so they know what's going on. But Nasser, honestly, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=1228.72s)]
*  really appreciate it. That was great. Thank you. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD8WZw3p4gE&t=1231.6000000000001s)]
