# LIVE The Gaza Truce Explained
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [November 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEm0TfGBU4s)
*  Hello, hello, hello and welcome to the show. After 46 days of horrendous violence in which
*  many, many thousands of innocent civilians have been killed, we now have a truce which
*  has been established, brokered by Qatar, which is supposed to last for four days. We'll talk
*  about that between obviously the practice, meaning a cessation of Israel's bombardment
*  and ground attacks in Gaza. That's the basis of it for hostages taken by Hamas to be released
*  in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners who are women and children who are detained
*  by Israeli forces. What does this all mean? Well, that's what we're going to talk about
*  what happens next. We've got some brilliant guests as ever, very lucky always to have
*  brilliant guests who can talk. We have Israeli peace activists, we have a brilliant British
*  Palestinian leader and we have a brilliant doctor who can also talk about the humanitarian
*  catastrophe which is enveloping Gaza, which might even become even clearer now because
*  we'll talk about this because comments in the media suggest the US administration is
*  nervous, quote unquote, about this pause because they fear that it will now be easier to see
*  the impact if people can, it's things like retrieving bodies from under rubble, just
*  to be blunt about it, but the sheer scale of the horror which has been unleashed against
*  Gaza may become more and more clear. Now, I want to just move to my guests as soon as
*  possible, my first guest, just very quickly now because he is a very busy man, as I guess
*  are. As ever, if you're watching the video, press like and subscribe, click on the YouTube
*  link if you're able to do so and you can ask the guests questions and support the whole
*  channel on Super Chat and I'll read you out, everyone at the end, but also you can keep
*  the show on the road and all the videos we're doing and all the work we're putting in, we're
*  trying to do a video every single day at least on patreon.com forward slash Owen Jones 84.
*  Now I'm going to bring in the brilliant Uri Weltman who is, sorry, Veltzman, not Weltman,
*  Veltzman, do apologize, that should have been quite obvious, I would have mentioned. The
*  brilliant Uri Weltman from Standing Together, who are a grassroots political movement in
*  Israel, which bring together both Israeli Jews and Palestinian citizens of Israel. And if
*  there is hope, and there is always hope, for the future, then it will be the struggle of
*  people like yourself who will make that possible. So thanks for joining us, Uri. I just want
*  your quick response to what's your quick reaction to this, Tris?
*  It's very welcome that Israeli hostages held in the Gaza Strip for more than 40 days, some
*  of them elderly, some of them children, the youngest one being a 10 month old baby are
*  due to be released. It's a sigh of relief, a collective sigh of relief in Israeli society.
*  But I'm also incredibly angry, angry about my own government ministers, because the deal
*  that has been brokered and is soon about to take place, to be implemented, is a deal that
*  was already on the table for a long time ago. But the war cabinet was very hesitant, wasn't
*  willing to supposedly give Hamas a win by signing this decree, thereby condemning the Israeli
*  hostages to who knows what atrocities during these extra days that they have spent in
*  solitude in Hamas confinement in Gaza Strip. So while we are all very much relieved, it's
*  been also been incredibly cynical and disrespectful on behalf of the government, who
*  disregards the lives and well-being of Israelis inside Israel, but also Israelis kept
*  hostage in the Gaza Strip.
*  And just on that, we've got a quick clip here from the BBC journalist Jeremy Bowie, the
*  Middle East correspondent. Let's just hear this 30 second click and you'll respond.
*  And the government, the Israeli government has also said in statements that after this
*  pause, needed to secure the release of the hostages, quote, fighting will resume in the
*  Gaza Strip. The point you made, Nick, is a good one, that Netanyahu could have had this
*  deal weeks ago. I had it from three strong diplomatic sources that the deal was on the
*  table and the Qataris thought they were almost there on the eve of the ground invasion.
*  But the Israelis decided to go ahead with the ground invasion.
*  And in The Nation, an article makes this point, those thousands don't actually die, not just
*  because Israel could have refamed the targeting civilians, which clearly they used to do, but
*  because the contours of the deal announced Wednesday have been on the table for weeks
*  on October 26th, The Washington Post quoted Hamas leader as he laid out what Hamas had
*  pitched, et cetera, et cetera.
*  So, I mean, what's is quite interesting, the families of the hostages, the relatives of
*  the hostages actually have quite many of them quite a moderating impact, I would say, because
*  of what they're going through.
*  But what's the political impact?
*  Is there any political impacts likely?
*  It's incredibly infuriating that this is how the government been conducting business.
*  Haaretz Daily newspaper reported yesterday by Amos Sar-El, its military correspondent,
*  that the Minister of Defense, Yoav Gallant, rejected a very similar deal last week, but
*  now switched his position in support of it because of the public campaign, the struggle
*  being waged by the families of the people held hostage inside Israel.
*  There really is a major campaign happening with thousands of people demonstrating with a
*  march to Jerusalem by the families and friends of relatives of those kidnapped.
*  And this is a strong impact on public discourse in Israel, pressuring the government to move
*  about and to advance with the deal.
*  And the contours of this deal has indeed been around for many, many weeks.
*  And the government was saying at the time that is continuing to fight in order to pressure
*  Hamas into accepting better terms of the deal.
*  Weeks passed, fighting happened, terrible atrocities committed, terrible human loss of
*  Palestinians and also Israelis.
*  Yet we end up with the same deal.
*  This comes to show that the complete disregard of our government is not only for the lives
*  of Palestinians in the occupied territories, it also holds in contempt the almost 240
*  Israeli hostages held in the Gaza Strip.
*  And it is part of its utter contempt towards Israeli society.
*  Some of the partners in this government are extreme ultra-nationalists.
*  This government has for the first time in Israel's history, a Kahanist party, the most
*  right-wing extremist fringe part of the Israeli fanatic zealous settler elite, now in
*  power for the first time in its history.
*  And they find a counterpart in Hamas, which is a barbarous and disastrous and reactionary
*  terrorist organization. Both of them are a mirror image of each other's politics.
*  Both of them dabble in genocidal rhetoric towards the other people.
*  And both of them are an enemy of both Palestinians and Israelis and a cause of Israeli
*  Palestinian peace. Our government has been in contempt and
*  dehumanizes not only Palestinians with, for example, Minister of Defense Galan saying
*  we are dealing with human animals when justifying the tightening of the siege and the
*  cutting of electricity and water, but it also holds in contempt its own electorate and
*  its own people in its complete disregard for the lives of the hostages.
*  And indeed, its refusal to move forward with the only thing that can secure the well-being
*  and the safety of Israelis, which is a negotiated solution, which is advancing towards
*  Israeli Palestinian peace, which is implementing UN resolution.
*  Indeed, Netanyahu in a press conference last Saturday rejected the notion that there will
*  be any form of Palestinian sovereignty over Gaza Strip, Palestinian authority or otherwise.
*  This is him saying us, Jewish Israelis, the public in Israel, we are going to control
*  military, hold to have a military occupation of the Gaza Strip for months, perhaps years.
*  It has been 23 years since Israel withdrew from South Lebanon, in which there was a
*  military Israeli occupation since the early 1980s.
*  And the memories of the occupation of Lebanon are diminishing a bit in Israeli society.
*  But it was a bloody occupation in which Israeli soldiers have been dying every week.
*  And this is what he has in stock for Israeli society for the coming years.
*  And it is a very grim prospect and it needs to be replaced.
*  In terms of going forward, I mean, I'm going to ask as well just what happens next
*  broadly, but in terms of the you're part of what I would regard as quite a besieged
*  movement in the moment, which is those within Israel, I mean, your coalition, obviously,
*  as I said, of Palestinian citizens and Jewish citizens of Israel fighting for a lasting
*  just peace. But is there any hopeful grounds is that, you know, in terms of what you're
*  doing at the moment that that we can look to?
*  Well, October 7th was a paradigm shattering moment in Israeli politics.
*  We have had a political crisis going on since 2019 with five consecutive election
*  cycles. None of these elections centered on the Palestinian question because it was
*  deemed to be off the table.
*  Nobody's talking about it.
*  Netanyahu has been the most vocal proponent of the concept of managing the conflict, not
*  ending the conflict, not ending the occupation, not advancing toward Palestinian state
*  alongside Israel, but managing the concept.
*  Really, the concept of managing the conflict went bankrupt on October 7th.
*  And now there is a growing understanding among the people inside Israel that there need to
*  be some sort of diplomatic arrangement for us to continue to live here.
*  Even the release of the hostages was done not through military force, but through
*  diplomatic negotiations and diplomatic agreements.
*  This is the only way to go forward.
*  My own movement, Standing Together, which is a joint Jewish and Palestinian movement,
*  organizes both Jewish Israelis and Palestinian citizens of Israel, was organizing for the
*  past few weeks mass Jewish Arab solidarity rallies inside Israel.
*  It is very difficult to get permits for demonstration because there are new laws put
*  into place since the start of this war.
*  But we've been doing indoor mass rallies calling for Israeli Palestinian peace, with
*  700s attending in Haifa, 400 attending in Jerusalem.
*  Every three days there is a mass rally in a city somewhere in Israel, both Jewish cities,
*  Arab cities and shared cities.
*  And this is our way to build the political will inside Israeli society, to coalesce
*  the forces inside Israeli society that want to move forward in the direction of Israeli
*  Palestinian peace. And our message is very simple.
*  There are millions of Jewish Israelis here.
*  None of them is going anywhere.
*  There are millions of Palestinians here.
*  None of them is going anywhere.
*  If there's any way for us to live in safety and security, all of us, it has to come
*  through an Israeli-Palestinian peace, have to come towards advancing towards ending
*  the occupation. And we need to start now because otherwise we'll have war after war
*  after war with more innocent people harmed both in Palestine and inside Israel.
*  I mean, just quickly, because I know we don't have long with you because Labour's
*  in my hand. David Barat asked, what's the likelihood of a full ceasefire being
*  negotiated during the four-day truce?
*  Will the West put pressure on Israel to agree to ceasefire or will they keep arming
*  Israeli occupation forces?
*  So, I mean, the point there is, I mean, if we list, as you said, Benjamin Netanyahu
*  said that there will be full security control of Gaza, which just means a lot and a
*  permanent, permanent armed occupation.
*  I mean, plus, if you listen to the general rhetoric of the Israeli leaders and
*  officials, you mentioned human animals.
*  And we had, I mean, Israeli ministers approving of, for example, an article by a
*  former general using pandemics and the spread of disease to achieve peace, as
*  well as, you know, a leaked, you know, talk of ethnically cleansing Gaza and a
*  leaked intelligence ministry document.
*  I mean, people might say that the intelligence ministry doesn't have the
*  cut side of power. It should.
*  It sounds like it should.
*  But it's just the rhetoric is alarming.
*  So what do you think about any lasting, you know, in terms of that likely outcome,
*  I mean, in terms of stopping it?
*  The rhetoric is incredibly alarming.
*  Israeli politicians who come from the fringe of the Israeli extreme right wing,
*  but also from the ruling Likud party, have dabbled in genocidal rhetoric.
*  And it is a very dangerous development because the Israeli army, the biggest army
*  in the region, it has the capabilities to wreak terrible havoc on the civilian
*  population in Gaza, which is indeed currently doing.
*  I think that for Netanyahu, the continuation of the war is in his own
*  political interest.
*  Ma'arif Daily newspaper have been conducting public opinion polls since the
*  war began, showing a drop in support of Likud.
*  Around a third, between a third and a half of Likud voters say they won't vote
*  for Likud this time if headed by Netanyahu.
*  And the coalition partners, the current coalition partners lose their majority,
*  had new elections being called to date.
*  So for Netanyahu, rather than advancing from this four days truce into a complete
*  secession of hostilities, I think in his interest, his own narrow political
*  interest is the continuation of this state of war and emergency at the cost of the
*  life and the well-being of Palestinians and Israelis.
*  But Netanyahu being the cynical politician that he is, for him, it is a small price to pay
*  for his continued rule and to maintain his grip on the political power in Israel.
*  Yuri, grim stuff, but I think at least some, I mean, just your presence, the existence
*  of your movement offers, I think, hope.
*  And if there is a future of peace, then obviously, I think the movement to which you
*  belong to and champion will play a critical role.
*  So I really, really appreciate you joining us and especially when things are so busy
*  and difficult. So thanks so much, Yuri.
*  I really appreciate it. Thank you so much.
*  Take care. Great stuff.
*  Really honored to have Yuri and standing together.
*  We've interviewed others, I'm sure you've seen from standing together, both Jewish and
*  Palestinian members of standing together as they bring together both, which is
*  obviously desperately needed within Israeli society as well.
*  Now, sorry, later on, it's very important we talk about the humanitarian catastrophe,
*  which is enveloping Gaza.
*  We have the brilliant Mike Silva, who is a distinguished doctor, as I said, at Oxford
*  University Hospitals to talk to us about that.
*  But now I'm really delighted to have Amy Shallan, who is the director of MACAN and
*  the chair of the British-Palestinian Committee.
*  Committee? Did I write that down right?
*  Or have I written that down?
*  Committee is committee. Why is that?
*  It's like Panacu's council.
*  It's always committee or councils in organisational terms, isn't it?
*  Amy, I'm really delighted to have you to speak about, I guess, the horror
*  which is currently unfolding in Gaza.
*  I just want to start, in terms of your quick response, I suppose, to, or your just,
*  it doesn't have to be quick, your response to the truce, which has now been established,
*  supposedly, in Gaza.
*  And well, of course, the news of a truce is very welcome, but it can't just be a few
*  days pause before Israel's relentless bombardment of the people of Gaza begins
*  again, killing one child and injuring two every 10 minutes.
*  So the world really has got to do much more to stop Israel's collective punishment
*  of Gaza's 2.3 million population and wiping out entire families, neighbourhoods,
*  destroying Gaza's civic infrastructure.
*  And we've seen the horrific targeting of every aspect of life, of schools, of
*  universities, of places of worship, of homes, water, sanitation facilities.
*  We've seen the transformation of hospitals that are providing vital life saving care
*  into what's been called death zones and really the destruction of the health care
*  system there being a key part of Israel's military strategy.
*  So with just a pause on the table, there's a real danger that we're going to see what
*  actually happened in Bosnia in the 1990s when those that were slaughtered were dubbed
*  the well-fed dead.
*  No sooner did the United Nations convoys relieve Sarajevo with food and medicine, but we
*  saw Milosevic step up his brutal campaign of bombardment and ethnic cleansing.
*  So really, what hope is there if the international community doesn't learn from
*  history? So today, the situation is in fact even worse.
*  It's not just not learning from history.
*  We've got the UK, we've got the US and other governments being active partners in the
*  atrocities that Israel is committing.
*  And they really bear responsibility for getting us to this point.
*  I'm glad you raised Bosnia, actually, because I might ask you a bit more about that, because
*  I do think there were some striking parallels, by the way.
*  I've been to Sarajevo and taken on a tour by a former Bosniak Muslim fighter who talked
*  through some of the details and there's some striking parallels.
*  We'll come on to you. Just, I'm sorry to do this, put on a quick comment here.
*  This is on Sky News from an IDF spokesperson in terms of what that Israel is threatening
*  next, just to put that what you said in further context.
*  If, by any miracle, all of the hostages are released over the next few days, will you
*  still continue on with the war in Gaza after that?
*  I'm not aware of any change in our operational directive.
*  I don't think there's there's a decision not to dismantle and destroy Hamas as a governing
*  authority.
*  I mean, that's the point.
*  This, you know, they've made it clear.
*  Benjamin Netanyahu said there will be full security control in Gaza.
*  That just means a full military occupation.
*  I mean, obviously, Gaza was under occupation and international law before this, which people
*  often don't understand.
*  But that's the case. But and we've heard what is correctly described as genocidal
*  rhetoric by the Israeli government.
*  So, you know, for those hoping that this could be the stepping stone to a ceasefire,
*  doesn't seem any basis for that, does it?
*  Well, I think what we really have to do is look at the origins of the current crisis.
*  And essentially, it didn't begin on the 7th of October.
*  And in fact, it didn't go back to the election of one of the most extreme Israeli
*  governments ever.
*  It goes back to the Nakba or catastrophe of 1948 and the policies and practices that
*  Israel has carried out ever since to ensure its maximum control over the land of
*  historic Palestine and the minimum number of Palestinians.
*  So what we're witnessing is an acceleration of Israel's 75 year project of
*  colonisation, dispossession and apartheid.
*  So, you know, I think it's true to say that it's not just rhetoric.
*  The ongoing bombing campaign really does threaten to enact the largest mass expulsion
*  of Palestinians since 1948.
*  And its leaders are open about their policies and practices, not just this government,
*  but previous ones have been very clear that they see Palestinians as a demographic
*  threat. And what Israel has been carrying out is genocide in word and deed.
*  And Israeli leaders have been very clear about their intentions.
*  They've stated explicitly they want to pulverise Gaza to the ground and to ethnically
*  cleanse the population.
*  So we've heard from Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who said that at the end
*  of this war, not only will Hamas no longer be in Gaza, but the territory of Gaza will
*  also decrease.
*  And we've also heard Knesset members like Ariel Kalner, who said, right now, one goal,
*  Nakba, a Nakba that will overshadow the Nakba of 1948, Nakba in Gaza and Nakba to
*  anyone who dares to join.
*  So we have that happening.
*  And then also, let's not forget about the West Bank, because the mass displacement that
*  we're seeing in Gaza is also coinciding with increased settler and military attacks on
*  Palestinians in the West Bank, where Israel again is accelerating its colonisation of
*  Palestinian land.
*  We've seen armed settlers and Israeli soldiers attacking Palestinian Bedouin villages,
*  telling residents they've got one hour to leave or be killed.
*  And this has become the largest displacement of Palestinian Bedouins since 1972, with eight
*  entire Palestinian villages and over almost 500 people displaced in less than two weeks in
*  October, while other six villages were partially depopulated at the same time.
*  And even before all of this started in Gaza, we had in September 2023, the UN publishing
*  an alarming report stating that settler violence had displaced over a thousand Palestinians
*  from 28 communities since 2022, and that there were not only many more incidences of
*  settler violence, but that they were more severe in their violence and that this has
*  only gone on since the 7th of October.
*  So that is the context in which all of this is happening.
*  It's not just the current Israeli government, but it's successive Israeli governments that
*  have been enacting such policies over decades.
*  So it's a crucial context.
*  And I pointed out genocide in rhetoric, just in case people haven't seen.
*  I did an interview with Rez Segal, who's Israeli associate professor.
*  Though he's based in the US now at Stockton University in genocide and Holocaust studies he
*  sets out where he believes that a genocide, a textbook genocide is taking place.
*  Because I think one of the things I find so shocking, I mean, so many things are so shocking
*  about. But all of this is, for example, if there was a hypothetical war crime tribunal, which is
*  not going to happen as things stand in the current world order.
*  But if there was, you wouldn't need, I keep saying this, but it is important, I think you
*  need to sift through classified documents and secret documents in the Israeli secret files.
*  You would just have to read out what was said publicly by Israeli leaders and officials in order to
*  establish intent. It's not subtle.
*  It's actually in the point actually Rez Segal, associate professor just mentioned, there's
*  actually something quite unique about this situation in that it's rare for intent to be so
*  loudly communicated.
*  Because actually, if you look in things, places like Slobodan Milosevic did not say this is
*  cleansing, he pretended that it wasn't happening.
*  It's quite striking that there's no pretense.
*  I mean, I think that's what's so striking about this.
*  Absolutely. And if you look at the reasons why that is, I think it's because the world has been
*  quite happy for blatant violations of international law to go unaddressed and to greenlight
*  Israel to act with impunity.
*  It feels that Israeli politicians feel it's fine to make those statements.
*  So we had the UN warning years ago that Gaza was going to become unlivable unless urgent action was
*  taken to lift Israel's suffocating blockade and also to put an end to its repeated military
*  assaults on Gaza's people.
*  And by refusing to call Israel's actions for what they are in terms of genocide and ethnic
*  cleansing and by refusing to condemn blatant breaches of international law, by saying or not
*  saying really that its restriction of water and fuel and food is in essence collective punishment
*  and a war crime, or that Israel's so-called evacuation orders amount to forcible transfer, or
*  by refusing to call for a permanent ceasefire, UK politicians across the political spectrum are
*  really continuing to give Israel the green light to commit atrocities with impunity.
*  And they have got to start fulfilling their duties under international law to ensure the
*  protection of the Palestinian people and end support for Israel as it perpetuates crimes
*  against humanity.
*  I mean, I think we can all see not just the double standards, but the way in which international
*  law has been used as a tool to oppress people rather than actually as something to protect
*  people. It is clearly not working other than to really afford kind of imperial powers, further
*  than other countries around the world.
*  And it's very noticeable to countries in the global south that that kind of a double standard is in
*  existence and the failure of international law to really be something that is upheld for the
*  rights of everybody, whoever they are, wherever they are in the world.
*  And so governments really have got to start fulfilling their duties under international law to
*  ensure the protection of Palestinians.
*  And the international community has got a very immediate responsibility to intervene to stop
*  Israel's genocidal assault and ethnic cleansing once and for all.
*  And that any delay in implementing practical measures constitutes complicity and participation
*  in the ongoing Nakba.
*  And we know what the UK's historical debt is in terms of laying the ground for the Nakba of
*  1948. And now it is facilitating a further Nakba on the Palestinian people.
*  So we really need to see much better action in terms of a permanent ceasefire, unfettered access
*  for humanitarian aid, but also real political action to ensure a future for Palestinians that's
*  built on freedom, justice and equality for all.
*  Just returning quickly, brilliantly put by the way, to Bosnia, which you mentioned.
*  And Bosnia, I think, you know, I'm a geriatric millennial.
*  Bosnia, I can go over my childhood as a kind of exemplar of a kind of modern horror, I think.
*  And now 40,000 civilians are estimated to have been killed in Bosnia.
*  There is a higher death toll overall because of combatants.
*  So overall, about 100,000 were estimated to have been killed between 1992 and 1995.
*  Of those 40,000 estimated to be civilians, the large bulk of which were Bosnia and
*  Muslims. But I mean, in terms of parallels, I mean, firstly, the latest figures from EuroMed
*  Human Rights Monitor, who are a very extremely credible human rights independent organisation
*  based in Geneva, chaired by Richard Falk, who is a Princeton lawyer who used to be the UN
*  Special Rapporteur on human rights in the Occupied Territories.
*  They now currently estimate that there are the latest death toll just updated 16,396
*  civilians out of over 18,219 total killed in Gaza.
*  Now, Bosnia had twice the pre-war population of Gaza.
*  So already, the death toll in Gaza is well over two thirds the rate in six and a half
*  weeks of Bosnia in three years.
*  And I just think some of the parallels which I thought were striking was the Bosnians, the
*  Serbs suffered a genocide in World War Two.
*  And that was often part of the kind of the way that modern Bosnian Serb nationalism
*  presented itself as we face this existential menace because of what happened in World War
*  Two. The Serb civilians suffered atrocities in the Bosnian War.
*  I mean, the first big massacre was against Bosnian Serbs.
*  Nobody would look at that and think the Bosnians served nationalist leaders and what they
*  did to the Bosnian Muslims genocide was in any way justified.
*  But in this case, we're seeing an even a far greater death rate, far, far greater death
*  rate than happened in Bosnia.
*  And it's a worse death rate than happened in Iraq, in Syria.
*  And it has the direct open support of Western governments.
*  It's a crime which I just think is just it's quite difficult for people to process.
*  But that death rate and I did an analysis, I went I spoke to Iraq body count who
*  got experts in this. There is no comparison with the modern conflict.
*  Yeah, I mean, it is unprecedented.
*  What we're seeing is unprecedented in terms of scale, in terms of Gaza since since
*  in comparison to to Bosnia.
*  But it's also unprecedented in terms of, as you said, the justification of
*  and the exception that is put when it's Palestinians.
*  And there is a very clear racist
*  mindset that really doesn't believe that Palestinian lives are as important as others.
*  It's quite, quite simple.
*  It's not complicated. It's not subtle either.
*  It's not subtle. And it's a very also colonial mindset, which sort of feels that that
*  actually the Palestinians as a people don't deserve to have political rights, that they
*  don't deserve to have the right to self-determination.
*  And if you kind of just hear the kinds of convoluted
*  acrobats that politicians have been making in order to justify the actions that are
*  going going going on in Gaza and being undertaken by Israel and the
*  unconditional support for Israel, then it's very, very clear that those are the that's the
*  mindset that underlies that approach.
*  And I have to say, I mean, you know, I feel like I've been going mad watching watching this and I'm not
*  Palestinian. I just don't know.
*  I mean, the impact of watching a British media industry, not just British politicians, not even pretend
*  that Palestinian life has anything like the worth of a Western or Israeli life.
*  I mean, it's I mean, it must be just I don't know how you contain the rage.
*  Well, the thing that actually lifts the spirits is to see that despite the fact that that is the
*  approach in the mainstream media, actually, what we're seeing is that the British public and other
*  peoples around the world can see through that approach entirely.
*  They see see what's a core injustice.
*  They understand what's happening to the Palestinian people and they are horrified to hear those sorts
*  of justifications.
*  So, I mean, yes, it's appalling and we are grieving and there isn't a Palestinian who isn't affected
*  by this, who doesn't have friends and family or themselves are kind of living under those
*  experiences. And I have worked for many years on Palestine and have been to Gaza many times as
*  well and have been to the hospitals that have been under attack and have friends and colleagues in
*  Gaza. So, yeah, it's horrific to see people consistently demeaning Palestinians,
*  dehumanizing Palestinians in the mainstream media.
*  But at the same time, the voices of young Palestinians who are speaking out of people who are
*  standing up for Palestinian rights, those are the ones that are giving us hope.
*  And we know that the future is not going to be the same as this.
*  We know that in the end, freedom, justice and equality will be achieved.
*  And we can see the people who are coming out on the streets week after week who are calling for
*  that, who are supporting that, who don't believe the kinds of racist rhetoric that we're
*  saying otherwise.
*  I mean, I'm really glad that we could end on a very, actually, despite the horror, the atrocities,
*  the, you know, what many are describing as genocide, that you're able to see the seeds of
*  hope for the future. And you're absolutely right.
*  There's a sharp contrast between the way the media is reporting it and actually what many
*  millions of people across Britain and around the world feel.
*  And I think you can see the growing anger and hysteria of the apologists of the Israeli
*  offensive. And I think that's because they know they're losing the war for public opinion,
*  despite having everything stacked in their favour.
*  So thank you so much, honestly, Amy, for your voice.
*  And everyone do look up the British Palestinian Committee and also MACAN, which is a
*  Palestinian-led educational organisation.
*  She's chair of the British Palestinian Committee and director of MACAN.
*  But honestly, Amy, really, really appreciate it.
*  And your work is and voice is more crucial, obviously, than ever.
*  So we really appreciate you being here.
*  Thank you.
*  Take care. Good.
*  Brilliant, brilliant stuff there from Amy.
*  Really great, great to have her here with us.
*  I'm now going to bring in Michael Silver, who is the consultant.
*  He's a consultant surgeon at Oxford University Hospitals.
*  And you have put yourself forward, haven't you, for medical aid for Palestinians
*  sponsored team to enter Gaza when possible.
*  Firstly, can I just thank you for joining us, by the way.
*  A big honour to have you here.
*  And it's, you know, I think lots of people will be in all the fact that you put yourself
*  forward to go into a war zone, which by the time it's possible to be to enter,
*  I don't I mean, we can see what's happened to the Gaza already.
*  What's your just initial thought, I suppose, from as a from a medical perspective, a
*  humanitarian perspective, I suppose, on this truce, this pause in hostilities?
*  Thanks for having me on. And I'm delighted to be here.
*  The CISWA is essential to continue.
*  The pause is welcome, but it's not going to do much unless we make it sustained.
*  You know that we've had one point seven million people displaced from northern Gaza
*  into the south. They are without shelter.
*  They're homeless. They're exposed.
*  There's no food. There's no water.
*  There's no electricity.
*  There's no sewerage system that's managing any of that displacement.
*  And these people are exposed to the elements out there without any form of support.
*  And if you think about what's happened since the 7th of October, there has been less than
*  six percent of goods and essentials going into Gaza.
*  Or a duration of 46 days.
*  And you're looking at a population that's heading towards starvation, famine and.
*  Epidemics of of of illnesses like diarrhea and all the other contagious diseases
*  that will take over with time.
*  And this is notwithstanding the colossal loss of life that we've seen, like you've
*  eloquently stated in the conversation with Amy and your speaker before, Yuri.
*  I mean, we've got more than 14000 people killed.
*  And compare that to 1200 Israelis killed ten times the number.
*  I'm not detracting from the fact that what Hamas did on the 7th of October is deplorable.
*  That's a terrorist act that killed innocent people.
*  And that is not to be condoned at all.
*  But if you consider who is to blame for that, I don't blame Hamas.
*  I blame the Israeli military and the Israeli government for being complacent.
*  You know that you've got a fox next door to you.
*  You don't let a chicken.
*  Be attacked by letting your friends be unattended to.
*  And that's exactly what the Israeli government did.
*  I know in the context at the moment, Israeli society, whatever people think,
*  they there was a view that the southern communities were left undefended.
*  And part of the reason for that is because the IDF have focused their troops in the West Bank,
*  for example, to defend illegal settlements.
*  And obviously, there's a consensus in Israeli society.
*  It's not controversial to say that Israel left the southern communities exposed.
*  I mean, just in terms of you mentioned disease.
*  I mean, if a general wrote in a mainstream, a former general, Israeli general,
*  wrote in a Israeli newspaper in support of spreading disease in order to...
*  This is Israeli Major General Gilear Island.
*  And he said that disease and starvation will hasten Gaza's surrender.
*  What he said was, if I just bring it up, he said,
*  And, you know, that, yeah, the lack of food and the spread of disease
*  is something that should be encouraged, basically, because that will then mean their defeat.
*  And then that was endorsed by the Israeli finance minister who shared on Twitter his approval.
*  I suppose what I'd just ask you is, I mean, you know, I look at Yemen as an example.
*  That's a war that I've written about a lot, I think, to Yemeni refugee camp.
*  15,000 were directly killed by Saudi-led airstrikes in Yemen, it's estimated.
*  But far more people died of other causes.
*  And that's the point, isn't it, in war, that we obviously were focusing on violent civilian deaths.
*  But what often happens, and this is what happened in Yemen and other countries,
*  the health care system collapses and then lots of people,
*  A, injured in war, and B, people with underlying health conditions don't get treated and then they die.
*  I mean, is that your fear that you get this?
*  We're not even thinking about the broader death toll that comes outside of,
*  just for example, being killed by a missile.
*  I think we have been overtaken by the horror that they're seeing on our screens.
*  And that's the problem.
*  What you highlighted is the mindset of what Israel is trying to do,
*  and that is to ethnically cleanse this place.
*  The fallout from what's happened over the last four to six days is yet to come.
*  You've got people exposed, like I said before, to all the elements that one could think of,
*  with no recourse to any form of support.
*  There's no medical aid that can get to them.
*  There's no food. There's no water.
*  I have first-hand information as to how these people are managing with food.
*  I mean, there isn't enough to go around.
*  And it's been the case for days.
*  The water that they're drinking is not fit for human consumption.
*  They're using sources that are contaminated with sewage,
*  but they have to use it because that's the only way they can get this.
*  And like you rightly said, this is going to lead to a colossal amount of contagious diseases
*  that there is no infrastructure to manage or support.
*  If you think of any other natural disaster that has happened,
*  by now all the agencies that come together in this sort of circumstance
*  would be like a rash.
*  They'd be getting their field hospitals in,
*  they're getting their infrastructure in to support them.
*  There'll be tents to house these people.
*  There'll be blankets. There'll be food.
*  There'll be field hospitals that will be looking after the ill.
*  I mean, you've got children, elderly, you've got pregnant women who are out there.
*  I mean, my colleagues who I've worked with, they are now homeless in Raffa.
*  They haven't a place to go to, and they're just out exposed to the elements.
*  And that's what hasn't been taken into account.
*  We are only seeing the killing.
*  Yes, that's happening.
*  And that's happening at an industrial scale.
*  We're not having any plans as to what happens later.
*  On that, can I bring in actually just quickly,
*  I've got a quick clip here from a UNICEF spokesperson that I want to put to you.
*  It's about the question of premature babies.
*  We heard, for example, obviously, you know, about premature babies
*  who energy was obviously cut, electricity to hospitals,
*  and they were taken out of their incubators.
*  Let me just put this clip to you.
*  I just want to hear your response.
*  We have been talking a lot about 31 premature infants evacuated from one hospital
*  in a huge event that has been catching public attention.
*  But again, 180 born every day and more than 20 of those on average
*  need specialized care every day, just like the 31 evacuated
*  from Al-Shifa.
*  I think that's the thing.
*  It's just the enormity of this.
*  The more you think about it, it really does start to sink in, doesn't it?
*  Because we saw just those premature babies in one hospital.
*  As though that's a self-contained number.
*  But every day, babies in the exact same position are born.
*  And you have obviously, you know, huge numbers of pregnant women
*  who can't get, you know, obviously medical treatment,
*  people with cancer, heart condition.
*  I mean, it's just it becomes difficult.
*  I mean, just on that point about babies, I just, you know, I mean, what scale?
*  I mean, if this goes on for weeks and weeks, what happens?
*  I mean, we're just talking about how because the medical,
*  the health care system is essentially collapsed.
*  So it's not going on.
*  If we stop now, it's still a huge calamity.
*  We still can't cope.
*  There were about 30 hospitals that were functional in this trip.
*  And at present, there are less than 10 that are functional,
*  even the 10 that are functional are having rudimentary services.
*  They're not being they're not looking out to the day to day patients.
*  They're looking out for the trauma patients.
*  They're trying to cope with what's coming through the door all the time.
*  And they cannot cope with anything
*  that one would consider mundane.
*  So how do we even
*  comprehend and start to rebuild all of this?
*  So it's not a pause that we're looking at.
*  We should be we should be asking for a sustained ceasefire.
*  And and I guess instead of going around in circles,
*  what we should should be looking to is is who is going to make the difference?
*  Who's going to who's going to make that that call to to make Israel
*  stop doing what they're doing?
*  And the only only real power that can do that is the United States.
*  And who who can make them do that?
*  It's it's the Western governments who are propping
*  that concept of condoning with the genocide
*  and the war crimes that are happening here.
*  I mean, yeah, just just finally on that, because you'll be one of those doctors
*  who'll be entering Gaza.
*  I mean, that's that's what you signed up to do in any case.
*  What in terms of what?
*  How large scale of operation would that involve?
*  We don't know, obviously, where Gaza will be at,
*  but what will you be expecting to do in those circumstances
*  if you don't have a health care system that's after you know, you've got injured people.
*  You've got people who have all these underlying health conditions.
*  Where how does a health an emergency health operation like that?
*  How does it what does it even begin to do?
*  So we've not seen a similar situation like this before.
*  I've been in touch with some of my MSF colleagues
*  who who managed to get 15 of their members into into the strip today.
*  Notwithstanding that two of them were killed yesterday,
*  a strike on the third floor of a hospital
*  that they've they've been functioning in as MSF for the last five years or so.
*  The WHO is not supporting any sort of
*  medical aid going in there with personnel because they cannot guarantee safety.
*  And the only way that medical aid for Palestine is trying to get people across there
*  is without the guarantees that the WHO usually offers.
*  And that would then require a lot more planning.
*  The the other issue at present is that they cannot guarantee
*  how long you are going to stay there and and how you're going to exit.
*  So in those circumstances, you'll find that people like myself,
*  who got day jobs here in the UK, cannot cannot sign up to going in there.
*  So until there is a huge change in the hostilities and and and the ongoing
*  violence that's that's apparent to everybody,
*  you're not going to see a functional rescue operation
*  that that would that would make even a dent to what's happening there.
*  And and and what I fear is that the post for five or four or five days and.
*  They won't stop with the north
*  because you cannot get rid of Hamas, Hamas Hamas will be in the south
*  or and all over all over the strip.
*  So so then the excuse will be that they have to persevere and continue.
*  And the only way that they will stop is if they are told to stop by the United States,
*  even that one one doesn't know whether they'll do that.
*  Might really appreciate you joining us and really appreciate it.
*  And, you know, doctors like yourself, you know, in whatever.
*  Well, obviously, you have to see what happens in terms of will Gaza be made
*  accessible by the Israeli forces as well.
*  We just don't know in terms of what a medical rescue would look like.
*  But the fact that there are doctors like yourself signing up to do anything
*  you can is obviously just just.
*  Can I also let you know that we we as a as a group of doctors have set up
*  a network and we've been having
*  vigils vigils we've been downing straight last Friday
*  and we're doing one this Friday as well.
*  And these are now spreading to all all other to many other countries.
*  So so so health care workers are are protesting and asking for more
*  sustain sees for.
*  So what we're trying to do is to make everybody an activist.
*  Not to be too pessimistic or optimistic about what the outcome is,
*  but do something to to to show that the rest of the world
*  forget our leaders because they have failed are
*  are are trying to come together to make a difference
*  and make it an obvious choice that there has to be something more sustained here.
*  Absolutely. And that collective action is absolutely crucial.
*  Thank you, Mike.
*  And obviously, as well, people should look up medical aid for Palestinians
*  and support them as best or anything they can do to support their work.
*  But Mike, I really appreciate it.
*  Thank you for speaking from the medical.
*  Yeah, you to take care, Mike. Really appreciate it.
*  Take care of yourself. Great stuff, everyone.
*  Well, we have covered a lot of ground today.
*  Now, what we'll be doing over the coming days is
*  we've got lots of interviews planned and lined up
*  to obviously talk to people with the voices that we need to be hearing right now,
*  and as well as trying to just deconstruct as ever
*  the narrative, which has been woven by
*  apologists for this massacre.
*  And we've been doing that every day.
*  I mean, I don't know if people if you've been following on the video channel,
*  but just as an example, what we've been doing is
*  and I mentioned that we interviewed this brilliant
*  Holocaust and genocide scholar, Rez Segal.
*  We've been doing
*  pieces just deconstructing the false claims made by the Israeli states,
*  of which there are abundant examples and putting guys in perspective
*  compared to other conflicts.
*  And I think that's extremely important.
*  I'm not quite sure people are aware just of the gravity of this,
*  even those of us who oppose it.
*  And so anyway, we've got lots of videos to come.
*  To try our very best to offer
*  an alternative to the narrative, which is being obviously peddled.
*  Let's just go through some of the comments. Sorry here.
*  Which is David Broward,
*  so can we get your thoughts on the new Red Square going on in Hollywood?
*  They are going after those who show solidarity to Palestine
*  or disappoints about Noah's Shatface, nothing, Yimikartheism.
*  Yeah, well, I mean, you know, it's interesting this kind of, you know,
*  because you've got the so-called cancel culture people who claim that
*  those who make often bigoted and racist
*  and comments about voiceless and marginalized minorities
*  which lack representation in the public domain or the rate of being canceled.
*  And that often for them means they've been criticized
*  by some teenage on Twitter.
*  I'm not saying teenage in a disparaging way.
*  It's just often these are young people who humiliate them
*  by having more knowledge and insight
*  who push back on the bigotry and that's they've been canceled,
*  as they say, from their newspaper columns and their TV appearances
*  and book deals, how canceled, how very canceled they are.
*  You know, what we've always had is, as David correctly describes,
*  is McCarthyism, the target of progressive voices.
*  You first got the first Red Square after the Russian Revolution,
*  actually after World War One, and in which in the United States,
*  you got a mass arrest, deportations, incarceration
*  of those deemed to be subversive.
*  McCarthyism was known as the second Red Square for that reason.
*  And you got there the mass targeting of progressives,
*  including in Hollywood and elsewhere.
*  And that has a strategy which has been deployed against those
*  who stand with Palestinians and who oppose things
*  like the mass slaughter of Gaza.
*  So it's absolutely right.
*  You know, there was an attempt to intimidate anyone
*  with a public platform from speaking out,
*  because, you know, they know that public opinion
*  is actually shifting against this horror.
*  And they're keenly aware that, you know, for example,
*  the Israeli government, that if that happens,
*  then there will be big pressure on governments to stop arming
*  and supporting Israel in the way that they currently do.
*  So they don't want that to happen.
*  So you get, you know, those who defend,
*  the unquestioning cheerleaders of Israel
*  will, and the Israeli state in its behaviour,
*  attempt to make examples of people to try and prevent,
*  you know, to fight another people from speaking out,
*  including obviously conflating what is the genuine horror
*  of anti-Semitism, which needs to be taken on,
*  because anti-Semitism is an evil.
*  It is responsible in living memory for the Holocaust.
*  We are seeing rise in genuine anti-Semitism at the moment,
*  for example, people who will,
*  in a completely unacceptable way,
*  try to collectively punish and blame Jewish people
*  for the actions of the Israeli state, for example, in Gaza,
*  to conflate that with genuine, obviously,
*  well-founded opposition to the horrors being unleashed
*  against the Palestinian people, and that then, you know,
*  people feel scared to speak out.
*  As a consequence, it ought to be labelled
*  as a stooge for Hamas, for example.
*  I mean, I note, actually, because I mentioned that
*  I did this interview with Raz Higal,
*  which has gone viral on Twitter.
*  I mean, it's got millions of views on Twitter,
*  and it got shared by Gary Lineker,
*  who's obviously, what, the most famous sports personality
*  in the country.
*  He quote-treated it with, you know,
*  this is worth 30 minutes of your time,
*  well, worth 30 minutes of your time, which it is,
*  because it is a detailed, academic,
*  factually grounded, scholarly presentation
*  from an Israeli associate professor
*  of genocide and Holocaust studies.
*  I think we can all agree, that guy knows his stuff.
*  And he is now, if you look up,
*  because he shared my interview,
*  he is now being dogpiled, attacked,
*  by newspaper after newspaper.
*  He's, I can just look it up.
*  In fact, let's just do a quick search.
*  He's been attacked in the Times.
*  He's been attacked in the Times.
*  In the Telegraph, he's been attacked in GB News.
*  He's been attacked in the Express.
*  He's been attacked in the news Chronicle,
*  Benny Mail, I mean, he's, I mean, you know,
*  LBC, The Sun, oh, I think The Sun
*  are attacking for something else there, actually.
*  Anyway, I'm sure they'll be on it.
*  Yeah, so he's being attacked, you know, by the media,
*  because it's not just to attack him,
*  it's to make an example of other people,
*  to stop them from speaking out and using their platforms.
*  We need everyone with a platform
*  to speak out now, given the horrors being unleashed.
*  But yeah, it's a really important point, basically.
*  Tad Katwell, years ago, an Israeli general
*  predicted democracies will fall in the next 50 years.
*  It made me think they would be less and less
*  accountable over time.
*  Well, I mean, I don't know the Israeli general,
*  got a point, haven't they?
*  Yeah, I mean, yeah, even if you look at Israel,
*  I mean, Israel, when people say it's a democracy, obviously,
*  that isn't true in the sense that,
*  if you look at the Israeli occupation of the West Bank,
*  that was a despotism, that was a form of despotism,
*  it's an autocratic rule over the West Bank,
*  that's not democracy, is it?
*  But also the attempt to gut the Supreme Court in Israel,
*  which caused a massive protest movement,
*  was correctly turned by opponents within Israel,
*  and support of Israel from without,
*  was an attempt to essentially set up an authoritarian state,
*  and that's the direction Israel's heading in.
*  But it's also the danger of where it's heading
*  in other Western countries,
*  and I think we could basically call Israel Western State,
*  it's an outpost of Western civilization, really, isn't it?
*  Which is why it is defended in the way it is.
*  If you look at the United States,
*  if Trump wins the next election,
*  which I think there is a big chance now,
*  a significant chance,
*  not least because of Joe Biden's position on Gaza,
*  means that many young people, and many Muslim Americans,
*  many Arab Americans are just not gonna vote for Joe Biden,
*  they'll either sit on their hands or vote for a third party,
*  and people go, well, how can they do that?
*  They're gonna let Trump win,
*  he's much worse on this issue, which he is,
*  and they have to just vote for the Democrats no matter what.
*  Well, yeah, you can't just force people to do that,
*  you can't just scream in their faces and go, well,
*  we might, the Democratic president might be supporting
*  the mass slaughter of thousands of Palestinians,
*  the mass destruction, wiping Gaza off the face of the earth,
*  but it could be worse, so you're gonna have to vote for him,
*  and if you don't, you're a disgrace, you're a moral disgrace.
*  I don't think that's gonna work, guys,
*  so I think the dangers facing American democracy,
*  as cariated as it already was, are profound,
*  and I think you can see that in other states,
*  I mean, you can see Hungary, I always look at as a template
*  for what could happen because it was ruled
*  by a supposedly central right party, Fidesz,
*  and then became that party, basically turned it
*  into an authoritarian autocracy,
*  and you can see that happening elsewhere.
*  I do wanna defend my guess from it earlier,
*  because Zach says, based on what you already said,
*  he only seems to care about the safety of the Israelis,
*  he's not saying a word about the Palestinians killed
*  or the security, he did talk about the Palestinians
*  being killed, obviously, what he was trying to do,
*  and he's trying to do is make a case within Israeli society
*  at a time when, as he said, after the 7th of October,
*  there's been a paradigm shift, and it's become very, very hard
*  to make the arguments in support of peace and justice
*  than it was before, it's just that's a fact,
*  and he's pitching his arguments in that sense,
*  which is, many of you might not like
*  that narrative or perspective, but for example, saying,
*  this is counterproductive and will lead
*  to more Israelis dying, and the reason he's saying that
*  is he's pointing out to Israeli public opinion,
*  well, actually, if you think this is gonna keep
*  Israeli safe, then you're wrong, it will do the opposite.
*  Now, obviously, that standing together,
*  which he represents, that movement brings together,
*  as I've said, Jewish and Palestinian citizens
*  of Israel together, and they do lots on Palestinian rights,
*  both within Israel, but also from the occupied territories.
*  So I just wanted to make that quick defense,
*  but he did talk about Palestinians being killed
*  in the atrocities committed against Gaza,
*  so I just wanted to defend him there.
*  Yeah, anyway, thank you for all those,
*  thanks for the brilliant guests, and yeah, as I said,
*  for what we're doing with the content at the moment,
*  is we're doing it, I'm saying this just as a thanks,
*  because we're doing these videos on YouTube,
*  they're going on Twitter, they're going on Instagram,
*  they're going on Facebook, they're going on the podcast,
*  and collectively, we are reaching millions of people.
*  I mean, at the moment, the audience,
*  for the stuff that we're doing collectively is vast,
*  I mean, on YouTube alone, we've got millions,
*  and collectively, in terms of the videos,
*  and that's also true on Facebook,
*  and that is true on Instagram,
*  one video on Instagram alone got 1.4 million views.
*  So it's reaching a lot of people, so we're gonna keep,
*  I hope we're doing something important,
*  which is to try and offer an alternative.
*  The reason it's doing well,
*  as much as, you know, I'm glad of all the efforts
*  that we're doing, is that there is a huge appetite out there
*  for an alternative in terms of
*  the way the media has presented this,
*  which is to dehumanize Palestinians,
*  treat palatine life as meaningless,
*  and to support one of the great atrocities of our time.
*  It is the most disgusting thing I've ever seen in my life.
*  I will never not be shocked, you know.
*  I'm not surprised, I'm not completely stupid and naive,
*  but I will never get over the shock of watching the,
*  people who like to describe themselves as moderates
*  and liberals and censors,
*  who don't give a fuck about Palestinian lives,
*  and I will never get over my anger, my disgust,
*  at this episode, never gonna get over it.
*  It's absolutely nauseating.
*  It is the most sickening display
*  of unapologetic racism imaginable.
*  Not even a pretense that Palestinians matter.
*  Not even a pretense.
*  It is fucking disgusting, and I'm sorry to swear,
*  but I really am beyond angry.
*  And I'm not trying to sense my own emotions there,
*  because if I feel like this,
*  what message is being sent to the world?
*  You know what, they're listening.
*  People, it's the thing,
*  I think people in the West often think to themselves,
*  they don't realize that the things that are said and done
*  are watched by people in other countries,
*  including minorities within their own country,
*  who are being loudly told,
*  we don't care about human life
*  unless we consider that life to be of our own people
*  in some loose sense.
*  And that message is being listened to,
*  it is being processed,
*  and I think we should fear the terrible,
*  terrible consequences for a very long time to come.
*  This is not gonna be forgiven.
*  It won't be forgiven, not just by the Palestinians.
*  Of course, I mean, you know,
*  I would never forgive, sorry, forget,
*  ever forget this horrible nightmare.
*  But what message, the message being screamed at the moment
*  to the world by these bunch of racists
*  who dominate the media organizations of the Western world,
*  which is what they are.
*  And by the way, I mean, I'm not gonna, just an example.
*  You know, one of these supposedly, you know,
*  a self-regarding, self-describing,
*  moderate, centrist pundit,
*  quote-tweeted a random Palestinian citizen of Britain,
*  who just questioned this individual's description
*  of from the river to the sea as being genocidal
*  and tried to, you know,
*  and accused that person of tone policing.
*  And then, quote-tweeted and calling them
*  a sniveling little apologist.
*  And when I confronted them about it,
*  Private Eye have now done a big story about it
*  as though the real bully in all of that was me.
*  The reason I just bring that up is what Private Eye did there
*  is they looked at that exam, this is Private Eye
*  I'm talking about in this whole saga.
*  Private Eye looks at that and thought the real victim
*  in all of that wasn't a random Palestinian,
*  he's not a public figure who got quote-tweeted
*  in a moment of horrible trauma for his people
*  and described baselessly as a sniveling little apologist.
*  It was someone challenging that commentator
*  for using that language.
*  I mean, it's just the lack of any sense
*  of Palestinians being treated as, you know,
*  having, you know, as being fellow human beings.
*  By Private Eye is just a really striking example.
*  Anyway, I'm just gonna end there.
*  Thank you to Sonic Norkotic for, oh, AK,
*  sorry, I missed your question.
*  What does Post War Gaza look like?
*  UN controlled, hard to see how things go back
*  to concentrate style status quo.
*  Well, David Cameron describes Gaza
*  as the world's biggest prison camp back in 2010.
*  Well, by the looks of things,
*  Israel will occupy it militarily
*  and the dangers of the mass ethnic cleansing
*  of the Palestinian population,
*  which Israeli politicians and leaders and journalists
*  keep openly saying they will do.
*  It's not good.
*  Thanks there, Barata, Tad Kamwell, Zach, Rafik, Aziz.
*  Thanks to all of you.
*  We've got lots of stuff to come, as I keep saying,
*  and you keep the show on the road
*  on patreon.com, four slash, ungearly84, as ever.
*  And I'm gonna just keep asking,
*  I'm gonna do a shout out to ask
*  who we should be talking to in your opinion,
*  what sort of questions we should be asking.
*  Yeah, so I will put that to you.
*  I will do a shout out after the show.
*  All right, lots of love, everyone.
*  Really appreciate it.
*  Take care, and I'll speak to you all soon.
