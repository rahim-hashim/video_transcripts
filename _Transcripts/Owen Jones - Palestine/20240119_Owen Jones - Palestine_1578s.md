# Israeli Teen JAILED For Refusing Army Service Over Gaza Tells Devastating Truths - w Tal Mitnick
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_g7c8hZAFA)
*  This is courage. Tal Mitnik is an 18 year old Israeli citizen and he's refused to serve in the
*  Israeli army in protest at the onslaught against Gaza and the oppression of the Palestinian people.
*  Now given the political atmosphere in Israel right now, taking that stand takes a huge amount of
*  guts. What we've been trying to do on this channel is elevate Israeli voices who support peace and
*  justice. Without those voices there is no hope. Now Israeli law dictates that other than with
*  exemptions on religious or health or legal grounds, all young Israelis must serve and
*  conscientious objectors face imprisonment. Now Tal's been sentenced to 30 days in military prison,
*  but he's been temporarily released and speaks to me before he's back behind bars. I start by asking
*  him about that mandatory military service and his decision to become a conscientious objector.
*  Yeah, so the Israeli society is very militarized. Yes, there's also the
*  mandatory service that every child when he reaches the age of 18 has to go through the process of
*  enlisting and serving for two years and eight months for men and two years for women in the IDF.
*  And this mandatory service also goes into civilian society where a lot of society is
*  centralized around the army and coming out against the mandatory service can be scary
*  in Israeli society and especially today after October 7th. So I'm Tal and I'm from Tel Aviv.
*  I'm a part of the Meselavot network which is a network of conscientious objectors
*  that oppose the mandatory draft and oppose the occupation of the Palestinian people.
*  And we try to aid other people in coming to the decision of not enlisting in the IDF if it's from
*  pacifist reasons or more political reasons. We do this, there are all kinds of exemptions that we
*  support, we help get which it could be a mental health exemption or it's called the
*  pacifist conscientious committee and also some of our conscientious objectors go to prison which is
*  what I have chosen to do. So just tell me when did you decide that you were going to do this?
*  I used to think that we're kind of just humans in this world and we don't have much
*  we can't really make a statement because only the people I see on TV can change.
*  And kind of when this whole the protest movement started against the judicial reforms
*  I kind of realized that we do have a voice and that people can see us and that's when I found
*  Meselavot network and that's kind of when I started realizing that this is the right thing to do.
*  Is this something, can I ask, does your kind of family heritage inform this? Is there a tradition
*  or in a way is this just you came to your, I mean I saw someone who's very influenced by my family,
*  lots of people are but others aren't, or is this something that you just because of the world
*  around you politicized you because of the events you spoke about? So my family immigrated from the
*  U.S. to Israel before I was born so both of my parents did not serve and I grew up in a house
*  where we were, I was told that we should always question what people are telling us. I'm not going
*  to come out and say that my parents told me to refuse service because that's not true and I
*  talk with my mom a lot and we have discussions and we have disagreements about my opinions and her
*  opinions but she fully supports me in taking a stance with my opinions.
*  When you made the decision that you weren't going to serve, what was the kind of responses,
*  some of the responses that you got maybe from your peer group or wherever?
*  Responses were mixed. I think I've, with a lot of my peers they knew my political opinions and they
*  kind of didn't really expect for me to serve. They, well after conversations about the occupation
*  and the Jewish supremacy, they kind of understood and because they are my friends and because I
*  know them and they know that I don't mean any violence, I don't support any massacre and I
*  don't support Hamas. They know that I'm doing the thing that I believe in and they respect that.
*  Before I ask you about the politics of it, obviously I'm interested just in terms of,
*  because this is a sacrifice and it's important to make that point, just tell me about, I mean you
*  must have had a lot of apprehension, you're a young man, you've only just turned 18, you've only
*  just become an adult, legally speaking. Going to prison is a lot and that's a big thing to have to
*  go through. So I mean tell me, were you scared and what's your experience so far being in prison
*  and how long is it likely that you, because at the moment, just explain, you're out of prison
*  obviously but you're going to go back. So just tell me, what was your kind of sense, your maybe
*  your fears, your apprehension, what's the reality been like and how much longer are you going to
*  be behind bars? Mostly when conscientious objectors object, the first sentencing period
*  is usually seven or ten days because the army tries to kind of show their strength and then
*  try to make conscientious objectors come back and say okay I'll serve but with me either they knew
*  me or something and when the sentencing, the whatever commander sentenced me to 30 days,
*  it was a little bit of a shock and also getting to the actual prison was a little bit of a shock.
*  It was very different from anything I've ever known. Having to stand for 15 minutes, having to
*  always answer with the correct names of commander or sergeant or I mean everything in Hebrew
*  obviously and having to wear the army clothes. Yeah so it was a pretty big shock but I got used
*  it pretty quickly and I'm not going to come and say that this is the worst experience a person
*  could have had because just like me there were probably 200 other people there who are also
*  going through this experience and thousands of Palestinians that are going through a much
*  worse experience of torture and beatings in the West Bank or inside Israel so this is a sacrifice
*  that I'm willing to take. Can you tell me just in terms of because obviously refusing to serve in
*  the army for those you're there surrounded by soldiers who are in charge of you, what's
*  that attitude like towards you? Do they express that kind of content towards the stance that you take?
*  The other prisoners, first of all everyone is called soldier. It's not, it's kind of the
*  commanders there are not the prison guards or the commanders, it's like a military unit
*  so we are all called soldiers and the other prisoners they didn't love my opinions but
*  I kind of only showed my real opinion. I peeled back like more and more layers as they got to
*  know me more and they also like kind of like friends from home they realized that the things
*  that I'm saying are not radical and like are not this are not crazy they're just non-violent and
*  pro-peace and they actually not only respected my opinions they defended me when other people
*  talked about my opinions. The prison guards can't talk about politics they're not allowed to
*  but I have a suspicion that they didn't really love my opinions.
*  In terms of the other prisoners can you explain why are they there because they're not conscientious
*  objectors? A lot of the other prisoners are deserters which means that they were in a military
*  unit and then on one of their when they got sent home for a little bit to rest they just
*  didn't come back. A lot of this is from socioeconomic reasons which means they need to work
*  to help their family or take care of their baby brothers when their mom has to go out to work
*  so yeah it's really heartbreaking to hear all these stories about how they had to go back
*  work day and night and then after the army kind of forced them to come forward they get sentenced to
*  like huge amount of days they could be deserters for three months and they could be sentenced for
*  half a year in prison. It's really heartbreaking. Before I ask you more about just about the politics
*  of it I mean I put some I told people in advance I was speaking to people who were very excited
*  and for example Febzi Hussain says ask what the bigger picture is in Israel in terms of conscious
*  objectors we know there was a strong and brave movement inside Israel that says not my name but
*  Wounded of Tal was an isolated case so if there are many more taking the same brave path as he did
*  and I'm wondering in that context I interviewed as I said Gideon Levy who's I think a really
*  courageous Israeli journalist and the point he made to me is actually unlike previous wars there is
*  very very little opposition which kind of emphasizes the courage of you and other peace
*  activists I speak to and that the atmosphere is very suffocating and actually is it true that
*  basically there has been very few I mean you're the only conscious objector that I know who's
*  refused to serve in this particular war is that true and what do you think that says?
*  I think I'm the only public conscientious objector which means that there are a lot of people that
*  object to mandatory service to the period that you're 18 and also object to the reserve to
*  go back to the reserves they get exemptions in different ways and they don't go out publicly but
*  there are people there are other people except for me I'm not the only one. In terms of I guess
*  kind of how you got to this kind of position because it's striking in these you know how
*  throughout history occupations always corrupt the occupiers of a dehumanizing experience where
*  you know the humanity is taken away from those who are occupied but also it's corrosive to
*  those who are occupiers you know I always bring up the history as a Brit what the experience in
*  Ireland and the way the Irish people were brutally dehumanized in order to justify the huge
*  oppression that the British inflicted on Ireland for such a huge period of time and I'm just
*  wondering in terms of yourself because you speak I mean you clearly there you were very clear you
*  clearly there you were very clear you wanted to say look whatever I went through it's not as bad
*  as say what Palestinians were detained in the West Bank go through but what you've done there is you've
*  you've you're talking about the humanity of Palestinians that has been stripped away so much
*  and because of the occupation which has gone on for so long so how how have you got to that place
*  where you know I'm interested in what you think about that dehumanization how strong it is
*  and how you've got to a point where you you you have humanized the Palestinian people in that way
*  I feel like a lot of the reason for the dehumanization is because growing up in
*  Israel even in the liberal Tel Aviv we don't really hear any Palestinian voices this is
*  because of maybe a language barrier but also we don't hear any translated any Palestinian history
*  anything and reading stuff written by organizations that translate Palestinian voices
*  or directly from them writing in English or Google translated Arabic it's it's kind of it
*  made me realize that yeah there are other people and they have a there they have a plight and they
*  legitimately deserve to live here and to live in freedom yeah I mean on top of that you know
*  that kind of that backdrop October 7th would always be a huge trauma for any society I mean
*  for people like myself I would always say please don't start the clock on October 7th you've got
*  to talk about decades and go back to the Macba the mass expulsion of Palestinians apartheid as
*  diagnosed by Betzalem the Israeli human rights organization occupation seeds of Gaza and so on
*  that's true but it doesn't stop October 7th obviously going to be that will be a huge trauma
*  so I'm just wondering in that context because a lot of people within Israel that that trauma has
*  ended we're taking them to a place where they they they you know a large majority support the
*  horrific onslaught against Gaza which is obviously killing a huge number of people I'm just wondering
*  what your thoughts are on that given that context I think October 7th was a terrible event a terrorist
*  attack that was totally unjustified and I think harming civilians is is never the way to go and
*  I think that Hamas is not going to bring peace and is not going to bring security to the people
*  here not to the Palestinians and not to the Israelis and yeah the Israeli society is traumatized
*  has always been traumatized I think and this is only making the trauma bigger and bigger
*  but the the we need to take this trauma and not let it turn into revenge we need to take this
*  trauma and with the trauma realize that the only way that we're going to get security the only way
*  that this is not going to happen again and that is not holding people under siege and is ending
*  the occupation and is giving freedom to the Palestinian people because they're also humans
*  it's not that they're robots born to kill Jews when you see I mean it's also quite interesting
*  because I know speaking again to people like Gideon Levy that a lot of the Israeli public
*  aren't even seeing what's happening in Gaza that that reality isn't being shown but you know I know
*  you must be aware of the catastrophic death toll and how so many children have been killed
*  but as well as that you know the the collapse of the structure of the medical system
*  Professor Debbie Svidhar at Edinburgh University thinks that a quarter of the population could die
*  within a year on current trajectory just because of the collapse of the medical system let alone
*  anything else there's thirst the hunger I mean when you see that what what's your kind of thoughts
*  and do you think there's any way of how you feel about that how can that how can other people
*  within Israeli society feel the same anguish that I would hope that you would feel about it
*  yeah I've been seeing horrible videos and pictures and text written about what's
*  what's happening in Gaza as a part of the Israeli campaign there I feel like the only
*  the only way that we can really make other Israelis see what's happening here is make them
*  like not make them sorry is say that these people most of these people just want to live
*  they want to live they want to live and let live just like most I believe most Israelis want to
*  but they have been corrupted by the system they've been corrupted by the system to think that the only
*  way that they can live and let live is by killing and the the the guys the the sorry
*  and showing the humanity of the gossan people and how these babies don't deserve to die
*  I believe in the end will the humanity will come out but on that just a few of the things this is
*  by the way it's brilliant to hear because like your humanity really does I think really does
*  shine through which is something you should be very proud of one of the kind of horrifying things
*  that I you know it's not just the atrocities committed against Palestinians it's videos by
*  soldiers from the IDF uploaded to TikTok where they'll kind of gleefully go through possessions
*  of Palestinian homes laugh about them joke about you know blowing up homes
*  chants about amelek from the scriptures and how there were no innocents or involved civilians in
*  in in Gaza and I just I suppose one of the reasons kind of shocked by that is
*  if you're in a place where you're willing to just gleefully boast about it and then upload it to
*  TikTok you know what are you doing off camera um but I'm just wondering what you think about
*  that mentality how widespread is it do you think and what does that say about
*  the way that the Israeli army functions sadly it is very widespread talking in prison to these
*  soldiers that some of them were in Gaza a couple weeks ago the the regular opinion the the the
*  center opinion is that we need to kill all of the Arabs in Israel in Gaza in the West Bank all Arabs
*  it's it's sad it's I mean I see these videos too and they they sadden me and I think uh
*  I it really shows how systems can corrupt humans so just to be clear then your sense was actually
*  like the kind of centrist kind of view the kind of the relatively moderate view amongst
*  the soldier you speak to is actually to kill all Arabs yes I was told this exact sentence that
*  here in prison the moderate view is to kill all Arabs
*  wow what do you think that says in terms of how the conduct of the Israeli army must be
*  in Gaza itself if that's the view that that's seen as the moderate view
*  I think with all this talk about how there are no civilians um and how no one is innocent
*  this bringing to this huge death though that we're seeing and also it's hitting back against
*  Israeli society because we're seeing a huge amount of soldiers dying from IDF fire and also
*  hostages dying from IDF fire so not only I mean to to stop the massacre of the Palestinian people
*  and also um to to to stop more and more pain to Israeli families I think we need to stop with this
*  mentality so just on that you know I suppose that's I mean what you've just made there is
*  such an important point which is about the rhetoric from the top where you hear Israeli
*  ministers saying there are no innocents no involved people in in in Gaza and talking about
*  all but you know Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza being Nazis that kind of thing
*  do you think that there was a direct link between the rhetoric deployed by ministers at the top and
*  what soldiers therefore see as acceptable
*  yes I think people think that until now uh the the strategy of siege and also occupation in the
*  West Bank has failed I think everyone recognizes that and what a lot of the these people are trying
*  to uh to pull to pull the public opinion to the strategy has failed now we need to kill them all
*  because it wasn't enough to put them under siege what we're trying to say is yes the strategy has
*  failed but it's we don't need to kill them all we need the only way forward is to give them freedom
*  I guess what worries me that there's a lot of this isn't it um if that is such an entrenched
*  view where you got to the point where soldiers basically think mass extermination of the Palestinian
*  people is the way forward then what what hope do you think how how could the the incredibly courageous
*  how how could the incredibly courageous and I think everyone now listening really can hear just how
*  courageous you actually are how how can that win do you think how how is that because that's such
*  an extreme view I mean that's it's a genus argumentality isn't it how how do you think
*  it's possible to kind of win over that with that with that kind of approach which is clearly the
*  right approach but again such an extreme view how could it succeed I think I'll always stay hopeful
*  um with every person that I hear that has that I've talked to um and now doesn't want to join
*  the army I become more and more hopeful it's the little things it's the little steps that we can
*  get um and yeah I don't think I don't think we can lose hope I just couple a couple finer points on
*  that because I always like to end on a hopeful note uh which is difficult uh given the world in
*  which we live um and we have to work with the material that we've got but there is always hope
*  and you're an example of that so um yeah I'm just wondering you know in your generation uh because
*  one of the things that sometimes worried me is you know if I think about Britain or the United
*  States younger people are just a lot more progressive than older people um and I saw a video
*  in Israel with a um a school teacher who had shared an article from the Israeli newspaper
*  Haritz uh which I think was just basically a moderate kind of kind of peace-orientated article
*  and it looked like he's gonna get lynched by his students it was just like hundreds of school
*  students it was I was kind of shocked by it so but is there I mean is that I kind of have younger
*  people become even more militarized militaristic and and hardline or are there younger people like
*  yourself who see things differently that we can be hopeful about yeah in um in the US or in Europe
*  I think the younger the the child is going to be more progressive than their parent
*  and here it's looking like um the the young people my age are more right-wing and more
*  fascist than their parents I don't have anything I think that I hope that they grow and they realize
*  that uh there's another way and just finally on that I did see what I was very inspired by was
*  a protest yesterday in Tel Aviv where thousands took to the streets and that included Jewish and
*  Palestinian citizens of Israel marching together and obviously the only way we'll get a peace is
*  an acceptance that the land belongs to both Jews and Palestinians and there has to be an acceptance
*  that of a shared future and you could see it on those streets that's what those people believed
*  do you see that peace movement do you see that there is prospects of that of that growing
*  because we see throughout history people like yourself are isolated at the time but who who's
*  who's uh who's gonna get the better judgment from history um so do you see that and think well
*  actually there are seeds here which which which are growing and maybe you've seen that from the
*  response to you because you've taken a high profile position so you must be in a position where you
*  do as well as probably a lot of bad responses you must be hearing from people in Israeli society
*  who feel emboldened by the stance you take yes I've gotten a lot of hate but also a lot of support
*  not just from the international community but also from from Israeli from Israel from people in
*  Israel um I like like I said before I think the the catastrophe that was October 7th kind of left
*  this vacuum of who will be able who is gonna present the better alternative to what was happening
*  and a lot of people went to the right wing right wing's idea of genocide and massacre but I feel
*  like I feel like a lot of people are also now trying starting to realize that maybe it's not
*  the way and maybe there there there is another way um of living together and that's what we saw
*  yesterday with this uh with the protest um well I'll say I am in awe of you um I mean I think what
*  you've done is shown leadership I think your leadership skills really I think come across
*  in the interview you've got wisdom beyond your years if you don't mind me saying and and I think
*  always the judgment of history I think is is um it's something I think about a lot and I know it's
*  not automatic it's not not as though not as though always you know there's always this sense of you
*  know is history written by the victors it's often more complicated than that but throughout history
*  people like yourself do take very courageous stances which at the time feels often quite lonely
*  and difficult but I do hope you know that all around the world huge numbers of people are in
*  awe of what you've done um I'll I'm sure I hope you'll read through the comments on the video
*  when it's posted and I think you'll see a lot of love and support uh for the inspiring um thing
*  you've done and given the atmosphere in Israeli society which you've set out very clearly in a
*  way which people find quite scary but it really does emphasize the courage of the stance you've
*  taken so I just want to say well done to you and I know you're going to go back to prison but I hope
*  you're there you know that so many people are behind you and will be ready to stand by you in
*  any way so thank you thank you thanks for having me on for those watching or listening please as
*  ever uh share the video press like subscribe and thanks so much thank you
