Video Description: Will the mainstream media ever recover? With honourable exceptions, there has been an abject failure to cover Israel's onslaught against Gaza. Double standards, minimising horror, refusing to attribute responsibility for crimes, a failure to frame reality as it is, deferring to Israeli and US claims - we could go on.

I'm joined by Middle East scholar and author Assal Rad, who has been going viral with her expos√©s of media bias.

# How Gaza Destroyed The Media's Legitimacy? - w/. Assal Rad
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [February 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY)
*  Hello, we've heard over 18 weeks now of the horror which has been imposed on Gaza by the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=0.0s)]
*  Israeli state with the active support of Western states who have armed them back Israel. Its [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=6.08s)]
*  leaders in the process have made a series of statements which I think if they were issued [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=10.8s)]
*  by any other state we wouldn't have any problem having a consensus on calling them genocidal [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=17.2s)]
*  in nature. Israel of course now has been placed on trial by the highest court on earth, the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=21.92s)]
*  International Court of Justice for alleged genocide because of the case presented by South [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=28.56s)]
*  Africa. Why am I stating these facts? I think it's important to state these facts because [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  there has been quite the gulf between the reality of what has happened to Gaza, the blood, the death, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=37.36s)]
*  the mayhem, the mass destruction, mass displacement and the huge numbers of quite obvious war crimes [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=45.12s)]
*  which are often posted by Israeli soldiers for the amusement of Israeli domestic opinion on TikTok [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=51.68s)]
*  and the way the media has framed what has happened. And someone for me throughout this has been like [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=58.0s)]
*  coming up for air just in terms of shining a light on the double standards of the media, the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=63.599999999999994s)]
*  failure to frame what's actually happening and to hold perpetrators to account. No one's done a [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=70.8s)]
*  better job than Asal Raqqa who is a Middle East expert and also an author for example of State [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=78.72s)]
*  Resistance Politics Culture and Identity in Modern Iran. And the reason Asal's tweets keep [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=85.44s)]
*  going viral is that excellent but she's put in a huge amount of work, she must take a quite a lot [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=92.8s)]
*  of emotional labour of looking at often headlines and how they're often completely misleading and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=98.56s)]
*  how they don't assign responsibility for horrors which are happening and how they contrast for [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=107.12s)]
*  example with coverage of other atrocities for example Russia's invasion of Ukraine. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=113.28s)]
*  So with that extremely long and rambling introduction, hello Asal, it's great to see you, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=118.16s)]
*  how you doing? Thank you, thank you so much for having me. I just want to start with I suppose [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=122.64s)]
*  just one point which has just been bugging me from since this began I suppose. And I've said [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=128.48s)]
*  this a lot, I've worked in the British media for a very long time and I'm not naive about the British [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=134.8s)]
*  media either here or elsewhere. I've studied horrors in the past and how they were often [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=139.04000000000002s)]
*  represented in media outlets. There is something in my mind which is still uniquely quite shocking [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=146.8s)]
*  about this, it might not be surprising but shocking, which is the scale of the horror, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  the sheer level of mass death including quite objectively just huge numbers of [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=161.76000000000002s)]
*  people who are not combatants, for example over 13,000 children, the sheer level of destruction, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=168.48s)]
*  the rhetoric from the leaders of the state perpetrating this horror and the way this is [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  framed particularly how the lives of those who are victims, the Palestinian people in this case, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=182.64s)]
*  are devalued. And I'm just wondering just in a historical context what do you think? I mean is [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=188.32s)]
*  this actually quite unprecedented just in terms of the scale of the crime and how the media has [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=193.28s)]
*  portrayed it? Absolutely, I think it's unprecedented because I mean I haven't, I'm someone who's [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=198.08s)]
*  studied the region extensively and I've followed it, right? Like I have followed, I'm of a generation [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  that came of age during 9-11, the war on terror, you know the invasion of Iraq and I remember the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=211.12s)]
*  anti-war sentiments of that time and seeing those atrocities play out, seeing those war crimes play [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=217.04s)]
*  out. And I think what is unique about the situation we're looking at right now is the level of [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=222.4s)]
*  destruction, the, you know you mentioned Israeli soldiers that will share war crimes on TikTok. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=229.76000000000002s)]
*  I've never seen anything like that. I've never seen that level of impunity and that's all it is, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=237.20000000000002s)]
*  right? The knowledge that nothing will happen to them, they will face no consequences that they [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=241.44s)]
*  can actually boast rather than try to cover up war crimes. They post it themselves and these images [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=247.68s)]
*  will go viral and these videos will go viral and everyone will see them but they will still face [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=253.76000000000002s)]
*  no consequences within the state of Israel. They will face no consequences in terms of their support [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=258.32s)]
*  from their number one backer which is the United States government and they will face no consequences [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=263.6s)]
*  on the international stage because of the support of the US which basically prevents any kind of [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=268.08s)]
*  consequences for our own war crimes as well as those committed by our allies like Israel. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=274.56s)]
*  So when you look at the history, you know a lot of people talk about October 7th, yeah if you're new [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=279.92s)]
*  to this, if you've never heard of Israel or Palestine then maybe something happened, maybe [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=286.64s)]
*  this started for you on October 7th. But the reality of it is, is the horrors that Palestinians [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=292.32s)]
*  have faced have existed for decades. The occupation itself is more than five decades old and that's the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=298.56s)]
*  context that we have to understand if we are actually to resolve a conflict where Palestinians [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=304.56s)]
*  and Israelis can live with security and I think that's a key point, right? We want everyone to [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=309.84s)]
*  live with security but that can only happen in the case where the state that actually has power [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=313.84s)]
*  ensures security for the people who don't have power and that asymmetry of power is completely [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=318.4s)]
*  lost in the coverage, right? The way that it's covered is as if there's two equal sides that [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=323.04s)]
*  are in some kind of conflict and that is nothing could be further from the truth. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=328.08s)]
*  The simplest way of understanding that is from the very beginning you hear Israeli officials saying [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=332.56s)]
*  things like we're going to cut off food, water and electricity. Can Palestinians do that to Israelis? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=338.0s)]
*  Of course they can't, they don't have the power to do so. But why can Israel just shut off levers [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=343.04s)]
*  at the moment that it chooses to? Because it has the power to do so and without understanding that [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=348.8s)]
*  asymmetry we'll never really have a situation where we can resolve that conflict and that has [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=353.36s)]
*  been the biggest problem in media presentation. A combination of just not presenting the facts the [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=358.0s)]
*  way that they are and also the absolute double standards in which facts when they are presented [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=364.08s)]
*  are finally talked about, right? So even when you have news media covering something like [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=369.84s)]
*  a Palestinian child that's killed, the language that is used to describe a Palestinian child, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=376.48s)]
*  sometimes not even the word child, right? Sometimes the word children is not even [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=381.28s)]
*  associated with children. So there's the double standard in language and then there's the double [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=384.56s)]
*  standard and then there's the issue of how misleading the entire conflict is framed. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=390.16s)]
*  I mean that point you make just in terms of the clock beginning on 7th of October and how [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=396.0s)]
*  that essentially media coverage and the way politicians have clearly talked about [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=400.32s)]
*  this particular horror, that's obviously always been very striking to find that approach. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=405.2s)]
*  Because obviously the obvious point is to go back decades in terms of not even 1948 but even [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=410.64s)]
*  if you go back to 1948 you have mass ethnic cleansing, the Nakba, you have then more mass [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=418.56s)]
*  displacement in 1967, apartheid, ethnic cleansing, mass slaughter, we could go on, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=424.0s)]
*  occupation, illegal settlements. Even if for example this whole rhetoric of the ceasefire ended [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=428.64s)]
*  on the 7th of October, even if you just looked at last year in the West Bank, 240 Palestinians were [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=434.32s)]
*  killed by Israeli security forces and settlers, dozens of them were children. So in my view even [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=441.28s)]
*  discussing the idea of a ceasefire has a racist, a very striking racist component to it because [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=448.64s)]
*  if 240 Israelis had been killed, dozens of them Israeli children by Palestinian militants last [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=456.96s)]
*  year before October 7th, nobody would have called that a ceasefire, would they? That just wouldn't [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=463.52s)]
*  be a thing anyone would even dream of calling it. Yeah absolutely because look the only way [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=467.2s)]
*  you can, and I'm using the phrase get away with, this level of atrocity, 13,000 children, like that [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=473.2s)]
*  should just be something that we all sort of agree on but that should not be a debatable conversation. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=481.59999999999997s)]
*  Is it wrong to have killed 13,000 children in four months? Yes, no one will argue at this point. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=487.52s)]
*  So how then do we enact policies that allow that to happen? How is the US government, how is the [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=494.96s)]
*  Biden administration bypassing Congress twice in this period of time to send weapons to Israel in [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=501.2s)]
*  order to kill those children? How is any of this justified? It happens through dehumanization, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=506.96s)]
*  the only way to justify that in anyone's mind, and I will say that that's a minority by the way, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=512.0s)]
*  so one of the things I think we should be very clear about is this conversation is taking place [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=516.96s)]
*  in the West and it is taking place within the framing of a Western discourse, but the overwhelming [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=522.0s)]
*  majority of the world does not agree with this framing and that's clear from the institutions [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=526.96s)]
*  that are international and how they have voted. A UN ceasefire resolution was overwhelmingly [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=532.64s)]
*  supported, the Security Council voted for a ceasefire, it was the US that vetoed it, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=538.1600000000001s)]
*  the World Health Organization, NGOs like Doctors Without Borders, Committee to Protect Journalists, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=543.0400000000001s)]
*  every institution including the International Court of Justice, every international institution [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=549.2s)]
*  has made it clear what Israel is doing is wrong, what Israel is doing is illegal, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=554.88s)]
*  and it is an injustice to Palestinians. There's no question to this. So the fact that we even [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=559.5200000000001s)]
*  have these conversations is part of that asymmetry of power again, right? Why is this conversation [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=564.0s)]
*  taking place? Why is this even a debate? It's a debate because the Western world, especially [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=568.08s)]
*  the United States, has overwhelming power and by having that power it can change the framing of an [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=572.32s)]
*  entire conversation that the rest of the world understands and what's happening also is with [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=580.1600000000001s)]
*  social media, with the fact that these atrocities are being live streamed for us to see every day, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=584.72s)]
*  the conversation within the Western world, at least within its own populace, is also changing. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=590.0s)]
*  There's a significant shift in the way that Americans are thinking about this, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=594.88s)]
*  and imagine the amount of propaganda that Americans get, right? The amount of, and by propaganda I [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=598.16s)]
*  mean exactly what we were talking about, how this is framed, how politicians talk about it, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=603.4399999999999s)]
*  how policy is enacted, how our news media talks about it, the fact that the word killed, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=608.0s)]
*  you just had the story of Kin Dja Dja, a six-year-old child, a six-year-old child [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=613.52s)]
*  who was stuck in a car with her family who had already been killed by Israeli forces, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=620.16s)]
*  calling dispatchers, hoping for someone to come rescue her, talking about being afraid of the [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=629.04s)]
*  dark only to have been killed herself. This is a horrifying story and what frustrates me is that [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=636.0799999999999s)]
*  if that story was the story of a white child, the way that it would be framed in the Western media [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=645.52s)]
*  would be 180 degrees different, but they could not bring themselves, all the major Western news [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=652.64s)]
*  outlets, the New York Times, CNN, BBC, Washington Post, none of them could even bring themselves to [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=659.04s)]
*  use the word killed in describing her. I've got examples which you highlighted here, for example, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=665.28s)]
*  so Hind Rajab, this is BBC, Hind Rajab found these in Gaza days after phone calls for help, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=670.3199999999999s)]
*  found dead, there we go, and the Washington Post, the body of Hind Rajab, the six-year-old missing [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=677.04s)]
*  for 12 days since losing touch with rescue workers, trying to save her after the family car was fired [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=682.8s)]
*  on, no description there who fired upon her, at CNN, five-year-old Palestinian girl found dead [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=686.64s)]
*  after being trapped in a car with dead relatives. I mean, if that had been an Israeli girl who had [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=692.48s)]
*  been in a six-year-old, been in a car with her dead relatives after her 15-year-old cousin had called [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=701.6s)]
*  pleading for help and then you heard her being killed by Hamas militants, which is what the [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=709.2s)]
*  equivalent was here, and then you hear the cries of this girl to the emergency services [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=714.16s)]
*  and then an Israeli ambulance was sent and was blown apart by Hamas militants. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=721.9200000000001s)]
*  I mean, it would be regarded as an absolutely off-the-charts atrocity and by the way I'm saying [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=729.0400000000001s)]
*  it's not the value attached to Israeli life, I'm not saying it should be devalued as correct, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=734.96s)]
*  it's just not applied to Palestinian life, but that's the point, isn't it? We would be told [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=739.6800000000001s)]
*  that this shows the utter barbarism and depravity of Hamas, that's how it would be framed and it [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=745.0400000000001s)]
*  would be framed on the basis of we have to wipe these people off the face of the earth, no entity [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=750.64s)]
*  capable of that kind of horror has any legitimacy and that is how it would be talked about. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=757.6s)]
*  Absolutely, oh the language of barbarity, exactly how you're describing it, the fact that they would [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=762.48s)]
*  have to be eradicated, the fact that you would have to extinguish Hamas basically from the earth [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=768.16s)]
*  if you had the reverse kind of a story and we don't even have to imagine, right, because in [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=773.4399999999999s)]
*  fact when the October 7th attacks were carried out and there were horrifying stories of what [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=780.16s)]
*  happened to Israeli civilians, we know why we know those stories because they were told, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=784.7199999999999s)]
*  they were told over and over and over again, they were told in gruesome detail, they were told [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=788.9599999999999s)]
*  by naming who carried out those atrocities, they were told by naming the details of those [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=794.3199999999999s)]
*  atrocities and no one minced words in how we describe the perpetrators of those atrocities, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=799.4399999999999s)]
*  but when those same things happen to Palestinian children, suddenly the language becomes tame, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=804.3199999999999s)]
*  suddenly no one is killed, they're just a dead body of a child that's found, suddenly there's [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=808.88s)]
*  no perpetrator. In some of the framing you wouldn't even know that this child had died at the hands of [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=812.88s)]
*  an attack of any kind, you would think she dropped dead of her own accord, she was in a car accident [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=819.6s)]
*  maybe, if you didn't know what was happening, if you didn't understand the context and that is [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=824.48s)]
*  absolutely intentional because they don't want people to see every day Israel killed another [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=829.12s)]
*  child, Israel killed another child because that happens, what happens to the minds of people who [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=834.72s)]
*  are watching this, there's only so much that our minds can process, there's only so much trauma [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=839.52s)]
*  and atrocity that we can process and when we see that every day it changes the way that people [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=845.0400000000001s)]
*  think, not only about the actions of the state of Israel but also the actions of our own governments [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=849.28s)]
*  that are supporting arming and making those atrocities possible, we cannot get away from [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=855.6800000000001s)]
*  the fact, and I say this as an American, someone who's sitting in the US, without US support what [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=861.12s)]
*  is happening in Israel could not be happening right now, what is happening in Gaza could not [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=865.68s)]
*  be happening right now, it would not be possible if not for the unconditional support of the US and [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=868.8s)]
*  even that phrase by the way has been used, it's bipartisan, democrat, republican, they all say [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=875.36s)]
*  unconditional support, that is a fanatic point of view and we never talk about fanaticism in our [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=881.6s)]
*  states, we always talk about fanaticism somewhere else but we don't talk about the fact that the [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=886.8s)]
*  idea that anything should be unconditional is a zealous point of view, why should something be [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=890.64s)]
*  unconditional, what does that mean, that means they can do anything they want, even commit genocide [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=896.72s)]
*  and we still say we're going to give you our support, we're going to give you our weapons, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=902.24s)]
*  this could have ended months ago and the reason it is going on is not only because of the actions of [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=906.3199999999999s)]
*  the state of Israel but the backers of the state of Israel and that is also why these news outlets, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=911.12s)]
*  the discourse that we're seeing is framed the way that it is because these states don't want to [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=917.76s)]
*  become, don't want to show so obviously their own complicity in those crimes. I mean on that I have [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=922.4s)]
*  to say if a state hostile to the west committed a fraction of what we're seeing in Gaza, these same [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=927.92s)]
*  media outlets would be loudly arguing for US military intervention let alone, I mean what [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=937.44s)]
*  we're talking about is, I mean you know in terms of how they're framing it but that I mean that [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=944.0s)]
*  would be the case wouldn't it, you would be saying look look at these horrendous crimes the US has [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=948.96s)]
*  to intervene, I mean that's the sort of media coverage we'd be having. Well just you know we [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=952.08s)]
*  have to think back to how did the media cover Ukraine and Russia and what were the policies [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=957.7600000000001s)]
*  after Russia invades Ukraine in February of 2022, almost overnight, I mean within days [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=964.4s)]
*  Russia becomes the most sanctioned country in the world right. Now let's say that's to expect [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=973.1999999999999s)]
*  a country like the US or the UK or France or Germany to actually sanction Israel is asking for, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=980.24s)]
*  we'll say a lot, I mean I don't think it is but let's assume that that's the case. How about a [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=986.0799999999999s)]
*  basic step, how about the US doesn't veto ceasefire resolutions, that doesn't require anything, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=990.48s)]
*  you can still provide all of your support, all of your aid and just not veto what the international [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=996.96s)]
*  community was created to do, to prevent atrocities, to prevent the scourge of war, that's why those [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1003.2s)]
*  institutions even exist but what the the Biden administration has done in the last several months [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1010.24s)]
*  is to gut the meaning of those institutions in a way that I think have that has created a moment [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1016.88s)]
*  that we have to really think do these institutions work and if they don't we have to change them [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1024.48s)]
*  because if they don't do anything, if essentially you can have one power that comes in and can [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1029.84s)]
*  undermine the entire basis for why they exist, if the international court of justice says yes [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1035.2s)]
*  Israel's actions are plausibly genocidal which is why Israel is now on trial for genocide [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1040.24s)]
*  but these governments will not stop arming a country that is plausibly committing genocide, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1045.9199999999998s)]
*  then what's the point of those institutions? So it really draws this whole conflict, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1051.76s)]
*  I mean we can just focus on the human impact of Palestinians, that should be enough, that should [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1056.8s)]
*  be enough to draw the line and say listen this, the killing, the mass murder of children should be [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1062.56s)]
*  enough for us to take action but there are layers of implications to what is happening right now, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1071.2s)]
*  not only for Palestinians but also for the entire concept of international law, if that no longer [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1077.1200000000001s)]
*  exists then we're inviting states like Russia to say if this state doesn't have to abide by any [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1084.4s)]
*  set of rules then why do we? And that happens through the double standards that we impose, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1091.04s)]
*  if you look at early in 2022 there was western media talking about Ukrainians making Molotov [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1095.84s)]
*  cocktails right and that was champion, that was celebrated as Ukrainian resistance against Russian [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1104.56s)]
*  occupation, now imagine that happening in this case, it will never happen, it will never happen, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1111.6799999999998s)]
*  Palestinians have no right to self-defense, ask bluntly, no one in the western world in terms of [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1117.4399999999998s)]
*  officials will say that Palestinians have the right to self-defense despite the fact that they [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1123.6s)]
*  have been an occupied power for, they've been occupied people for over five decades, despite [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1128.3999999999999s)]
*  the fact that they, their entire state was colonized more than eight, more than seven decades ago, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1134.24s)]
*  despite the fact that you know they'll use Hamas as this idea but Hamas is a terrorist organization, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1140.24s)]
*  Hamas didn't exist until 1987, what about the occupation that existed decades before that? [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1147.6s)]
*  So everything comes up to these talking points that are used to diminish that history, to ignore [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1151.84s)]
*  that any of these things exist and the attempts in the western world especially in the US have been [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1158.48s)]
*  to normalize regional relations with Israel right, so the Abraham Accords are celebrated as these [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1164.8799999999999s)]
*  peace accords, how can you be, how can they be peace accords with states that were not in a conflict [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1170.3999999999999s)]
*  while ignoring the actual conflict, while ignoring the actual problem which is millions of people [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1175.52s)]
*  who do not have control over their own lives under a military occupation for more than five decades [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1181.84s)]
*  and we're just pretending like this is not happening and that this problem will go away as long as we [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1188.8s)]
*  ignore it and there are armed deals painted as peace agreements. One of the other elements of [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1193.76s)]
*  the framing that I wanted to put by you is again intent and I keep mentioning this with people I [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1201.76s)]
*  speak to just because I think it's just so striking when I interviewed Professor Raz Segal, sorry [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1207.6799999999998s)]
*  Associate Professor Raz Segal, Israeli American scholar in genocide and Holocaust studies, he, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1211.6s)]
*  one of the reasons he called it a text with genocide is he said intent is rarely so openly spoken [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1216.48s)]
*  and so in South Africa's submission to the ICJ they have nine pages and in that they say, I mean [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1221.6799999999998s)]
*  just an example, Yoav Galan at the beginning imposing a complete siege on Gaza, no electricity, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1227.84s)]
*  no food, no water, no water, everything is closed, we are fighting human animals and we act [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1232.6399999999999s)]
*  accordingly, announcing he'd released all the restraints on the army, Gaza won't return to [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1238.0s)]
*  what it was before, we will eliminate everything and then it goes on and then he also said he'd [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1245.36s)]
*  removed every restriction on Israeli forces. The reason I bring that up is [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1250.64s)]
*  if that was a state hostile to the West and there were pages and pages of the president of Israel, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1257.44s)]
*  the prime minister of Israel, the defense minister, members of the war cabinet, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1264.0s)]
*  members of the government, other politicians, media outlets, journalists, generals, soldiers on [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1267.84s)]
*  the ground, all speaking in overtly genocidal and murderous ways stating their intent, it would [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1273.6s)]
*  frame the coverage, I mean the coverage would actually revolve around that, it would be seen as [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1280.16s)]
*  this is the aim of the operation, just listen to what they're saying, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1286.64s)]
*  that is not how this is covered at all and actually when I said for example Yov Galan, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1290.24s)]
*  he said he's removed all the restraints on Israeli forces, you have to struggle to find that on [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1294.72s)]
*  Google before, it actually ended up being said in the ICJ ruling because it's such obvious evidence, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1299.6799999999998s)]
*  it doesn't appear in any Western media outlets that declaration before that judgment, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1306.3999999999999s)]
*  I just find that astonishing actually if you think about it, how you can have intent spoken [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1311.36s)]
*  by a government, the apparatus, but it doesn't frame the coverage of what they're talking about [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1316.64s)]
*  as though what they're saying isn't to be taken literally at all, it's just to be ignored. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1321.44s)]
*  Yeah, what they're saying, so don't believe what they say, don't believe what they do, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1326.4s)]
*  essentially don't believe any, don't believe your eyes, don't believe your ears, just believe us [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1331.68s)]
*  when we say we've talked to our Israeli counterparts and they're doing their best to [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1336.16s)]
*  protect civilians. I mean these are questions and I'm talking about Western media and one of [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1341.68s)]
*  the things to keep in mind is a lot of times reporters don't actually, not a lot of times, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1348.4s)]
*  they do not have control over what the headlines are, right? So there's- [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1352.16s)]
*  I can testify. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1355.44s)]
*  Yeah, I don't want to just sort of blame journalists because there's also within these [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1356.48s)]
*  states, there's a lot of pushback happening, if you look at the US you have cables, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1363.92s)]
*  going from State Department to the President saying, hey, we don't agree with what you're [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1371.6s)]
*  doing, these are people who work for the State Department, you have White House aides protesting [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1376.8s)]
*  in front of the White House saying, hey, we don't agree with what you're doing, you have within [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1381.52s)]
*  these press briefings, you see journalists that are pushing back and I want to give credit where [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1388.32s)]
*  credit is due, there's a lot of people who are saying the things that we are saying, but those [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1392.48s)]
*  in positions of power are simply not listening to any of those things and so you've seen the [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1398.24s)]
*  frustration of reporters as well internally talking about their frustrations because there [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1402.72s)]
*  are levers of power that they do not have control over and so when they have these headlines come [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1409.28s)]
*  out too, sometimes if you read the headline and then you read the story, the story is better than [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1413.1200000000001s)]
*  the headline but the problem is a lot of people see the headline and that's what frames the entire [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1417.28s)]
*  issue and that is what continuously becomes the problem, the fact that what Israeli officials are [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1423.28s)]
*  saying is not being taken seriously is mind-blowing to me, how can you not listen to what they're [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1430.16s)]
*  telling you what their intent is, they are telling you their intent, now if it was a US adversary, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1437.84s)]
*  they could have said something in 1982 and we would say, look they said this in 1982 so that's [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1443.28s)]
*  probably what they mean today, but you have Israeli officials saying things in real time [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1448.08s)]
*  and it's almost entirely ignored and when you actually see some kind of coverage outside of [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1453.76s)]
*  independent press and social media and all these other people who are doing the work, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1461.9199999999998s)]
*  it's because of the amount of pressure, right, CNN for instance on the original post that they had [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1467.04s)]
*  for Hind Rajab, they updated the language because possibly because of the amount of backlash, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1473.76s)]
*  because of how horrible the first iteration was and still in the second iteration, they still [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1481.36s)]
*  couldn't bring themselves to use the word killed as if that would paint Israel with too harsh [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1486.96s)]
*  a brush to say they are killers, they are killing these people, they are killing these children, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1494.24s)]
*  they are responsible for what is happening and you don't see the same kind of framing when you [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1499.52s)]
*  deal with a conflict like Russia and Ukraine, it's actually really interesting, horrible on [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1506.16s)]
*  one hand that we have these two wars going on at the same time, but because these large-scale [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1511.76s)]
*  invasions and wars have taken place relatively close to each other, that's why it's so easy to [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1521.44s)]
*  juxtapose the way that it's being talked about, the way that it's being framed, we're not talking [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1526.16s)]
*  about conflicts that happened many years ago, we are talking about two ongoing conflicts and the [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1530.24s)]
*  fact that they are simultaneously being treated differently. So you can see, I mean just in terms [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1536.48s)]
*  of just some examples I've got here in terms of just how it's framed in terms of what Israel's [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1542.3200000000002s)]
*  doing to the people of Gaza, so here this is CNN, their original was Netanyahu directs Israeli [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1546.72s)]
*  military to draw a plan to evacuate more than one million people from Rafa as offensive loons, [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1553.2s)]
*  completely framed on the terms of what Israel would argue and as you corrected it, it's just [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1557.76s)]
*  got some marker pen and put ethnically cleansed Palestinians from Gaza and another example, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1564.8s)]
*  New York Times, displaced Gazans wonder where to go, Israel vows to keep pushing south and you've [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1570.64s)]
*  particularly pushed Palestinians to Gaza but to keep bombing anywhere they go and the point there [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1575.6000000000001s)]
*  is if that we know actually from previous examples, I mean I don't know, Kosovo for example, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1579.84s)]
*  when Sabudon Milosevic was, you know you had the Milosevic regime in Belgrade, they didn't say [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1584.6399999999999s)]
*  drew a plan for to evacuate Kosovo, they talked about ethnic cleansing, they did in the Balkans [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1592.56s)]
*  consistently. So I mean you know and actually that's quite an interesting example because again [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1599.1999999999998s)]
*  you could say there, I mean the Bosnian Serb army could point to atrocities committed against Bosnian [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1605.2s)]
*  Serb civilians, in fact you had a huge number of atrocities, 7,000 Bosnian Serb civilians were [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1610.0800000000002s)]
*  killed in that war but they were still found guilty, the Bosnian Serb army of genocide, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1616.56s)]
*  but you still clearly they spoke about the purpose, you know they spoke about ethnic cleansing in [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1621.52s)]
*  headlines, you would not have got those sorts of headlines, it's not even thinkable if I had a [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1626.56s)]
*  headline like that. Nor should it be, that's the thing right, nor should it be thinkable, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1631.84s)]
*  this should be covered for what it is and it's based on and this is why you know this isn't [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1637.36s)]
*  about me and you coming to this conclusion, this is why the International Court of Justice came to [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1643.12s)]
*  this conclusion and even that by the way, even the way the ICJ decision was framed in and of itself [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1648.3999999999999s)]
*  was problematic because the importance of that decision right, the ICJ was not deciding whether [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1654.32s)]
*  or not Israel was committing genocide because they cannot make that decision. We've got here, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1660.56s)]
*  this is it, UN court declines to demand Israel stops its military campaign, that's the New York [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1663.84s)]
*  Times. Rather than saying UN court finds that Israel's actions are plausibly genocidal, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1668.3999999999999s)]
*  that's your headline, that's the most important takeaway from the ICJ decision but what they put [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1675.2s)]
*  is this, where if you looked at the six provisions, if you looked at what the decision actually said, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1680.08s)]
*  it required Israel to basically stop doing everything that it's doing but no action has [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1685.84s)]
*  changed on the ground, no action has changed on the ground because the court does not have the [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1692.0s)]
*  ability to, doesn't have a mechanism to enforce those things, all it can do, it's a court, it has [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1696.2399999999998s)]
*  to have these other countries, countries, third party countries understand that ruling and make [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1701.9199999999998s)]
*  decisions based on that ruling so now if you're the UK you don't send weapons to Israel, if you're [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1708.3999999999999s)]
*  the US you don't send weapons to Israel because you know they are pending a genocide case, you know [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1713.2s)]
*  that the court has decided that the evidence is sufficient, the evidence that South Africa presented [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1719.3600000000001s)]
*  is sufficient to make a case. Israel wanted that case dismissed from court, Israel lost that day [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1724.32s)]
*  but that was not what the headlines were, the headlines were twisted in a way and it was really [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1730.16s)]
*  interesting because you saw the reaction from Israeli officials and Israeli officials on one [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1733.76s)]
*  hand celebrated it as a victory and on the other hand called the court anti-Semitic [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1738.64s)]
*  well if it was a victory then why are they anti-Semitic? Why is that the framing of this? [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1743.68s)]
*  Because it's a sort of desperation because everyone sees it and the shifts in the narratives [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1748.4s)]
*  and what's happening, I mean you see attacks on people's attire, people who call you know [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1755.68s)]
*  wearing a sweater with a watermelon not an anti-Semitic, you see attacks on just these [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1762.0s)]
*  platforms themselves like TikTok is the problem not the genocide that is being carried out, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1768.0s)]
*  TikTok the platform is the problem. Well interestingly enough actually you could [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1773.52s)]
*  argue that TikTok is partly radicalising people partly because RDF soldiers keep posting war crimes [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1778.32s)]
*  on TikTok, I can't think of a better you know in terms of material that radicalises people I think [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1783.68s)]
*  often the very material posted by those soldiers is probably more effective than those posting [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1790.08s)]
*  content opposing the horrors in Israel's inflicting. I'm just wondering actually... [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1795.44s)]
*  Sorry I just want to just because we brought those up some of the videos I'm you know there [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1800.64s)]
*  are videos of Israeli soldiers playing with children's toys in places where children have [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1804.88s)]
*  been killed they're looking through the the private like drawers of like they're taking out [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1810.0s)]
*  women's lingerie I mean the amount the way that they are treating the situation as if it is a joke [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1817.6000000000001s)]
*  30 000 people killed is somehow funny. That should be something that we are talking about [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1825.6000000000001s)]
*  every day beyond everything that's happening it's like what is happening in a state how far [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1832.24s)]
*  to the right I mean we know that this is the most right-wing government that Israel has ever had [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1836.56s)]
*  and you hear in the US and in Europe you hear this rhetoric of the fear of the rise of right-wing [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1841.44s)]
*  fascism right this is like a big issue that that western governments have right now and yet we are [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1848.8s)]
*  supporting the most right-wing government in Israel's history with no issues with no qualms [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1854.48s)]
*  we're sending them the weapons that they need and there's no question to what is happening in [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1862.24s)]
*  Israeli society part of it is because of the impunity with which they've been able to act [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1867.3600000000001s)]
*  when there is no consequence to your behavior ever it keeps moving to become more extreme [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1872.72s)]
*  See Justin because actually for a long while a lot of the often quite extreme statements made [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1879.76s)]
*  by Russian pundits on Russian television stations framed quite a lot there was a huge amount of [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1885.36s)]
*  coverage about it and it was given as examples of intent and I interviewed the Israeli, very courageous [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1890.24s)]
*  Israeli journalist Gideon Levy and he said that Israeli television is more extreme than Russian [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1896.56s)]
*  television and there's been countless examples of people openly calling for genocide I mean it's [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1902.8s)]
*  not subtle it's literally like burn the whole of Gaza everyone should die including women and [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1907.76s)]
*  children I mean it's not even that doesn't you know there's not a kind of what is happening to [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1912.56s)]
*  this society you know and obviously they are great I've just named the courageous Israeli example [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1918.32s)]
*  I do wonder one of the things I want to ask you though I've been thinking about this a lot I [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1923.84s)]
*  wonder if this could I'm a little in the middle of it's difficult to know how things will pan out [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1926.8s)]
*  but if this could be actually actually a moment of real crisis for a lot of these media outlets [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1931.12s)]
*  it was interesting the polls come out today in Canada showed a plurality of Canadians think [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1938.24s)]
*  there's genocide happening and that's not something they're being fed by the Canadian media which is [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1944.0s)]
*  overwhelmingly extremely actually very partisan in favor of Israel so there are obviously a lot [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1948.24s)]
*  of people getting it from social media they're getting it online they're seeing these absolute [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1954.96s)]
*  unbelievable horrors and I wonder if there's a crisis with the media because partly they've [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1959.6s)]
*  they've been so partisan in support of Israel for so long but also they latched on in support of [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1966.5600000000002s)]
*  what Israel was doing from the very beginning even though you had all these examples of intent [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1973.04s)]
*  and now this clearly look we're not the journalists I know a lot of them they're not sociopaths [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1977.3600000000001s)]
*  they're not you know they may be a lot of them they've dehumanized Palestinians they've allowed [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1982.96s)]
*  racist dehumanization to set in they don't see Palestinians quite like them I get all of that [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1988.4s)]
*  but a lot of people now it's so extreme what's happened and what's happening it's just so extreme [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=1993.68s)]
*  that it is very difficult to not think to yourself this is way beyond anything which is tolerable [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2000.5600000000002s)]
*  but it's difficult to actually frame your coverage differently because it would mean [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2010.0800000000002s)]
*  challenging the whole way you frame this from the very start and that itself would lead to a crisis [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2015.44s)]
*  of your own integrity and your own position I just wonder what you think about that they basically [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2022.6399999999999s)]
*  they're dug in a hole so however bad things get it's actually quite difficult for them [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2028.72s)]
*  to shift the narrative even though there has been a slight shift just because the US is doing some [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2034.32s)]
*  pointless handling I think that's a really interesting point because it but in terms of [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2039.1999999999998s)]
*  integrity what I would say is you can always get your integrity back right you can there's there [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2043.84s)]
*  is the space to be redeemed so the idea that they would have to maintain this line because [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2050.72s)]
*  it's been this line all along I understand because to a certain extent it undermines the their own [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2055.04s)]
*  you know their own sort of institution in a way but I think you come out of it the other end [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2064.9599999999996s)]
*  with more validity than you had before I mean I in a lot of these headlines that I take and I edit [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2070.64s)]
*  I see people's comments that people will comment things like why are you even worried about this [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2077.52s)]
*  like no one no one watches no one watches the news no one reads CNN or the New York Times anymore [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2080.88s)]
*  and so that that comment here's two issues with that comment one is it's indicative of the fact [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2086.72s)]
*  that that is somewhat true right there are people who are moving away from these mainstream media [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2091.52s)]
*  sources because of exactly what we've been talking about it's so partisan it's so biased [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2096.48s)]
*  that people are just sort of sick of seeing the amount of dehumanization that's taking place [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2101.6s)]
*  under this like lens of media and we're supposed to be you know we boast so much in the west about [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2106.96s)]
*  having this free press and and how that media and this is actually a really important point how that [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2111.44s)]
*  media is linked to our democratic institutions it's a very important pillar of a democratic [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2116.72s)]
*  society to have an informed citizenry and you only have that through this consumption right [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2122.24s)]
*  everybody is not a specialist so how do people get information they get information through the [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2126.64s)]
*  media and if the media is not giving them real information you can't blame people for reaching [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2131.44s)]
*  the conclusions that they do they reach conclusions that they do sometimes a factual conclusions [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2136.4s)]
*  because they are not being given correct information but the the other part of that [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2142.0s)]
*  is that yeah a lot of people are getting away from this a lot of people are not really paying [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2148.88s)]
*  attention to to mainstream media anymore and that's the great part of having social media [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2153.36s)]
*  and having independent journalists and having so many alternatives to it but ultimately to your [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2158.88s)]
*  question i think redeem yourselves and we've done that historically right there have been [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2163.52s)]
*  atrocities in human history there have been you know horrible policies from from slavery to the [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2169.6s)]
*  holocaust and yet and and those atrocities those horrifying chapters in human history were supported [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2177.52s)]
*  by the very institutions that we're still talking about right the same levers of power [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2184.0s)]
*  but there was a way of redeeming yourselves by deciding hey we were wrong we were wrong about [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2187.84s)]
*  you don't even have to say that just change the coverage just be honest you don't even have to [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2191.52s)]
*  have this great moment of epiphany that you have that's self-reflected on just cover it truthfully [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2195.68s)]
*  and then maybe you'll actually get people back to wanting to read your platforms but they've these [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2201.84s)]
*  platforms for a lot of people have become a joke and i think that this is putting pressures in i [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2206.88s)]
*  mean if you say the work you've done and it goes viral it doesn't just go viral on twitter people [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2213.2s)]
*  actually pick up talk about tiktok you know on other platforms they whatsapp each other they text [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2217.6s)]
*  it with with it is is you you do have a very clear generational divide as well because people who [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2222.8799999999997s)]
*  watch cable television tend to be much older and i think i saw msnbc i think it's like the average [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2227.7599999999998s)]
*  age is 58 younger people tend to get it from tiktok etc and twitter and instagram and i saw a very [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2233.3599999999997s)]
*  revealing comment actually which was the biden unit is from a source of the biden administration [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2240.88s)]
*  complaining about the fact that younger people aren't getting to see that joe biden is privately [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2246.5600000000004s)]
*  behind the scenes doing everything he can to pressure netanyahu because they're not watching [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2252.32s)]
*  out these claims on cable news and in the and and in various newspapers and i thought that was [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2256.88s)]
*  quite funny and revealing because clearly you know he the levers he has his military aid and [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2263.04s)]
*  diplomatic and political support and general aid to israel and he can choose to use that or he [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2268.96s)]
*  doesn't and him getting you know pointing his finger at benjamin netanyahu and sounding a bit [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2273.84s)]
*  heated and hanging up it is it makes no difference but that's fed to older viewers perhaps as signs [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2278.64s)]
*  that actually he is doing something and the fact younger people aren't seeing that instead they're [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2283.84s)]
*  seeing lots of children being blown apart on twitter on social media yeah there is a so there [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2288.32s)]
*  is a shift and i wonder if that is going to end up putting pressure on the legacy media because [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2294.72s)]
*  a lot of younger people are living in a different parallel in a sort of parallel universe and you [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2299.12s)]
*  can argue it's a lot more accurate because being told that joe biden is actually trying to put [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2304.7999999999997s)]
*  pressure on netanyahu that is not something which should inform your view of what the us is doing [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2308.72s)]
*  in its relationship with israel at all it shouldn't the it's more accurate to look at what us weapons [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2313.04s)]
*  are doing on your phone to children isn't it so i just wonder if that will have an impact eventually [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2318.56s)]
*  because it's going to cause a crisis of legitimacy well i think we're already in a crisis of [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2322.72s)]
*  legitimacy both for the press and for um these governments right they are in a crisis of legitimacy [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2327.68s)]
*  because because what they're saying is just insulting to a person's intelligence like for [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2334.16s)]
*  for any official in the biden administration to say we're having these tough and they say this over [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2339.68s)]
*  and over and over again we're having frank conversations with our israeli counterparts [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2344.8799999999997s)]
*  we're having tough conversations with our israeli counterparts [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2347.92s)]
*  the place that we have the most leverage is with our friends right and the u.s has no problem using [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2351.76s)]
*  coercive measures to get states that are participating in actions that they don't like [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2357.84s)]
*  to change that behavior right we use military action we use uh sanctions we use diplomatic [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2362.96s)]
*  pressure we use every lever at our disposal to make sure that states that are adversarial to us [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2369.12s)]
*  change their behavior so it's much more difficult actually to change the behavior of a state that [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2376.16s)]
*  you have no real lovers with right but with with israel there are so many things that the biden [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2381.12s)]
*  administration can do don't veto un resolutions support the icj uh stop arms at least conditionally [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2387.4399999999996s)]
*  to israel stop military aid to israel unless it's conditioned on israel's actions none of that is [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2395.7599999999998s)]
*  even coercive measures those are just we're not going to give you all our stuff until you listen [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2401.52s)]
*  to something that we're saying we haven't even gone to actual punitive measures that can be used [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2406.64s)]
*  as well so the biden administration is doing nothing nothing to actually pressure israel [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2411.28s)]
*  nothing has changed in terms of the death toll i mean you have uh decisions right now the rafa [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2417.76s)]
*  has already been bombed 1.5 million palestinians in gaza are now in rafa in what is the equivalent [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2423.2000000000003s)]
*  of the size of heathrow airport right it isn't it is the most densely populated refugee camp in [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2430.0s)]
*  the world basically right now and you still saw bombing and attacks during the super bowl not [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2435.76s)]
*  coincidentally very intentionally so these people were distracted and you still see the u.s take [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2443.04s)]
*  absolutely no action besides we're you know we're talking to them about it what are you talking [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2448.48s)]
*  about every again every institution that we tried to use against russia is now saying israel's actions [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2453.28s)]
*  are a catastrophe this is going to be a humanitarian catastrophe but when they say it about israel those [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2460.6400000000003s)]
*  very same institutions we reject it outright and when they say it about russia we boasted and create [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2466.32s)]
*  a platform for it one of the most interesting things is that uh the a lot of the evidence [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2471.76s)]
*  that for war crimes that russia is committing is coming from the u.s because the u.s has participated [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2477.6800000000003s)]
*  in collecting evidence of war crimes in order for russia to be held accountable not only is it not [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2482.56s)]
*  doing that in the case of israel every time a u.s official has been asked about possible war crimes [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2486.96s)]
*  committed by israel even though we're looking at them right when we say possible war crimes at this [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2492.56s)]
*  point yeah it's almost it's nonsensical we are seeing war crimes occur in real time but when [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2495.84s)]
*  they are asked the response is well that's a process it's a legal process we're not lawyers [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2501.36s)]
*  we can't talk about it we had no problem talking about it when it was russia so how the media [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2506.96s)]
*  plays a role in this is vital and we know that we know that for instance if you look at the lead [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2514.88s)]
*  up to the invasion of iraq in 2003 right let's say right now the details are still murky about [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2521.36s)]
*  what's going on they're not but let's just pretend for a minute they are the details of 2003 are not [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2526.16s)]
*  murky we now know as a fact that the public was lied to that there were no weapons of mass [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2530.96s)]
*  destruction and that iraq was invaded illegally by the united states under a false pretense this is [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2536.32s)]
*  these are all facts we know these but the media played a significant role in that lead-up because [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2542.0800000000004s)]
*  it didn't question anything yeah right it just sort of parroted whatever talking points the [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2546.88s)]
*  government the state officials the bush administration was putting out and if they continue to do so in [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2550.7200000000003s)]
*  this moment then i think it's absolutely a crisis of legitimacy there's no validity to a press that [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2555.52s)]
*  just parrots whatever the state is saying that's not a free press i mean that's going to end by [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2561.52s)]
*  basically in terms of what the legacy of this could actually be because i think the tragedy [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2566.4s)]
*  of those who have opposed military interventions which are direct you know western military [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2570.8s)]
*  interventions in the 21st century is always being right in the worst possible way being demonized [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2576.88s)]
*  at a time getting no obviously why you can't get any satisfaction indication because the horror is [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2584.16s)]
*  so great and and those perpetrating it there's no accountability and they just walk from one crime [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2589.36s)]
*  scene to the next so you you know you get that afghanistan ends in catastrophe iraq catastrophe [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2596.2400000000002s)]
*  libya catastrophe and and you get gar i mean every single one has been you know vindicated those who [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2603.52s)]
*  were everything that was said actually actually ended up worse and i just think this perhaps [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2612.32s)]
*  because they got away with all that this is too great a crime but crucially the media is under [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2618.08s)]
*  far more pressure because of things like social media and maybe this is going to last this is [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2623.2799999999997s)]
*  going to be such a lasting impact that the reputation of the media will not recover and [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2628.72s)]
*  that has not an impact not an impact to the likes of israel because actually that makes it much harder [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2633.92s)]
*  for them to keep western public opinion on their side and they need western public opinion because [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2639.04s)]
*  if they shift they're not going to get the weapons well i agree with you and i would take it a step [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2645.04s)]
*  further i would say it's not just the media as an incident this isn't just a an inflection point [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2650.0s)]
*  for the media it's an inflection point for these governments it's a reflect instant inflection point [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2655.2799999999997s)]
*  for international institutions right basically it's like the entire system that was created by [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2659.6s)]
*  the western world is right now in a very tenuous position because of the sheer hypocrisy the [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2664.96s)]
*  obviousness of that hypocrisy and the level of atrocity that we are being told to ignore [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2672.64s)]
*  people cannot ignore it that's that's the problem is it's it's too overwhelming to ignore they cannot [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2679.2799999999997s)]
*  see parents picking up the body parts of their children in plastic bags they cannot see children [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2685.2s)]
*  being amputated without having limbs amputated without anesthetic they cannot see you know [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2692.0s)]
*  fathers rummaging through you know rubble to try and find their children and see if they're still [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2698.88s)]
*  alive these images have haunted people now for months and that is that is i think what is somehow [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2705.6800000000003s)]
*  either lost on these institutions or they feel themselves to be so immune to anything to any [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2713.36s)]
*  accountability that that doesn't matter maybe it's not lost on them maybe they're fully aware of it [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2722.2400000000002s)]
*  but assume that things can continue in the way that they have because they still wield power that they do [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2727.68s)]
*  i think that's a very eloquent way to end it and also gives us some possible i mean i mean i say [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g_-byRqNxY&t=2736.3199999999997s)]
