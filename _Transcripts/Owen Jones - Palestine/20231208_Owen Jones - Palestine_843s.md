# Israel's Massacre of Gaza's Journalists Where's The Outrage?
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [December 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLQmmvCSi2M)
*  This is a massacre within a massacre. Gaza's courageous journalists have been wiped out by
*  Israeli weapons, often with their entire families. Now, without them, the world would be completely
*  blind about the fate of Gaza. They're risking their lives, many paying the ultimate price
*  to bring the truth. 56 Palestinian journalists have now been killed in Gaza in two months,
*  and to put that in perspective, in the whole of last year, around the whole world,
*  a total of 68 journalists and media workers were killed. But where's the outrage? Where's
*  the solidarity? Where are the prominent journalists and media workers denouncing this hideous attack
*  on their colleagues, like Mohammed Muin Aya, journalist and freelance photographer killed
*  with 20 members of his family when an airstrike demolished his home. Ala Taha Al-Hasanat, killed
*  alongside her family. Mohammed Abu Hasira, a news agency reporter, killed alongside 42 members of
*  his family three weeks ago. The least we can do with so many Palestinian journalists being killed,
*  often alongside their families, as they try to bring the truth about Gaza to the world,
*  is to speak out. So I've interviewed Sharif Mansour, Middle Eastern North Africa program
*  coordinator of the Committee to Protect Journalists, and began by asking him to put the killing of
*  journalists in Gaza in perspective. So we're already at 63 journalists killed, the absolute
*  majority, 90% of them are Palestinian journalists, 56 and four Israeli journalists and three Lebanese
*  journalists. This is unprecedented compared just to last year, we counted 68 journalists killed
*  over the course of 2022, only 42 of them were confirmed for their work. We haven't seen anything
*  like this in 30 years, this is the most dangerous assignment we have seen to be a journalist in Gaza
*  right now. The majority are local Palestinian journalists who have been killed in Gaza because
*  they have no safe haven or exit from day one. The first few were killed near the only entry and exit
*  points into Gaza near Rafah crossing and near Erez crossing. Since then they've been killed
*  everywhere in between, including in the south where they were told they were going to be safe.
*  Of course there were cases of concerns, including the one we recently saw strong evidence provided
*  by news organizations and human rights groups in Lebanon confirming that the Israeli army
*  tank was behind the killing of a Reuters correspondent, Isam Abdullah, in Lebanon and injuring
*  six other international journalists. But a lot of other cases in Gaza that we're watching was
*  concerned include journalists who have been threatened, harassed, have their family killed,
*  their employer threatened or bombed or having their office destroyed. And we see a pattern here,
*  a deadly pattern that we already documented before the war had started. In May we issued
*  a special report on the first anniversary of Shereena Abu Akhla's killing and we called it
*  deadly pattern in which we counted 20 journalists killed by IDF fire over 21 years. Three of those
*  journalists were classified as murder, including Shereena Abu Akhla last year, but also Yasser
*  Murtaza Mahmoud Abouhassin in Gaza five years ago. Of those 20 before the war, also 90%, 18 were
*  local Palestinian journalists. And of the 20, 13, we said that they had press insignia and that
*  the Israeli government did not respect their press insignia. And we see that pattern continue
*  this time with 90% of journalists killed Palestinian and also no respect of press insignia.
*  There are other cases where we also have seen more than just casualties,
*  outright censorship by the Israeli government in the West Bank and in Israel. So far, according
*  to our count, at least 19 journalists, Palestinian journalists in the West Bank, have been arrested,
*  put in military prosecutions under administrative detention, and even those who have been released
*  were put under house arrests in conditions that does not allow them to operate. We've also expressed
*  concern about Israel's recent emergency legislation that allowed the government for the first time
*  to stop broadcasting of foreign news media, and they've already used it against local Palestinian
*  radio and media outlets in the West Bank. They have used it against Al-Mayadeen TV channel,
*  Hezbollah affiliate in Lebanon, who also had two of their journalists killed by IDF fire. And now
*  it's even Israeli journalists who can be prosecuted under this emergency law and be put in jail for
*  up to a year under vague and suspicious accusations of harming national morale and national
*  security. Put all together, these are all constituting news blackout. If you add to it,
*  the communication blackout that we saw happening in Gaza at least four times because of bombardment to
*  communication facilities and shortage of fuel needed for them to operate.
*  In terms of Israel itself and its position, at the end of October it told several news organizations
*  that it couldn't guarantee the safety of journalists. What's the view of the committee
*  to protect journalists in terms of when Israel made that clear?
*  So this is why we see that this war, we see the deadly pattern become more deadly. We've documented
*  20 journalists before this war killed by IDF fire over 21 years. We've seen 63 killed and
*  as many days. So from one journalist per year to about one journalist per day.
*  And the time we released our special report, we saw one good sign, the Israeli army spokesperson
*  apologizing for the killing of Shireen Abou Aqla and saying commitments like Israel is a democracy
*  and we should respect the right of journalists to do their job even, he even said especially in
*  time of war. But we have seen the opposite of those commitments. The Israeli army is not allowing
*  international journalists accessing to Gaza and have already told international news outlets,
*  some who have lost people in Lebanon like Reuters and APU, also journalists injured in Lebanon,
*  that they cannot guarantee the safety of journalists. The Israeli army cannot evade
*  responsibility under international law to protect journalists. The exercise of lethal force has to
*  be warranted and has to be disproportionate. And if there were cases where they did not
*  take these responsibilities or exercise this kind of use, this would constitute possible war
*  crimes. Just before I ask just finally about that as well further, Alex Crawford from Sky News,
*  who is a special correspondent, has covered many wars, for example in Libya, and she tweeted,
*  it's absolutely farcical to try to peddle the view that foreign journalists are not entering Gaza
*  because it is dangerous. International journalists have been deliberately blocked from entering Gaza
*  by primarily Israel, who doesn't want them seeing the war crimes aided and abetted by Egypt as well
*  and makes it clear every single journalist, a Gaza journalist is being hounded and hunted,
*  struggling to stay alive, clean themselves while seeing family, friends and colleagues killed,
*  lose their homes or suffer terrible deprivation. And notes that embeds, those embedding themselves
*  with the Israel Defense Force do not count, in her opinion. Yeah, I mean, this is the part,
*  I mean, what do you say about this in terms of how Israel's particularly is blocking foreign
*  journalists from being able to enter Gaza and report what's going on? Well, we have seen a
*  dwindling number of international journalists and international media having facilities in Gaza
*  over the years. Gaza was always dangerous for journalists. We said 13 out of the 20
*  journalists who have killed before this war were killed in Gaza, but also in every past Gaza war,
*  media facilities were bombed, journalists were killed, and we just, two years ago, we saw the
*  Assiuted Press building and Al Jazeera Tower, including 18 local Palestinian outlets being
*  bombed by Israeli army strike. Of course, no one was held accountable to, no one was held
*  accounted in the past 20 journalists being killed, which made the level of danger for
*  this international organization a high risk. This is why many of them rely on local freelancers
*  and stringers who are Palestinians, and this is why Palestinians have basically
*  bore the brunt of the casualties so far. They didn't choose to be there. They were on the
*  front lines. Many of them had to flee with their families and risk their, not just their lives,
*  the lives of their loved ones after losing the media facilities and homes, and some of them even
*  been killed with their families. So we're counting all of these threats. The reason why there is an
*  exponential risk, particularly to journalists in Gaza, but the rest of the occupied territories
*  and in Israel, we're also seeing unprecedented censorship combined with both, we see very alarming,
*  the most risky environment and the most deadly we've ever seen over 30 years.
*  Just my final question. I mean, you've already touched on this, but we know, for example,
*  Human Rights Watch have said that the strikes and journalists in Lebanon in which journalists were
*  killed by Israeli strikes were apparently deliberate. So we're talking about the deliberate
*  targeting of journalists. You've already spoken about in the past, for example, Shireen Abuak,
*  lady Palestinian American Al Jazeera journalist who was shot in the head by Israel, which denied
*  involvement and later was found by investigations that she was deliberately targeted. And there are
*  many other examples, you said 20, 20 years or so. I mean, to what extent do you think journalists
*  are actually being specifically and deliberately targeted by Israeli forces, as well as the fact
*  many, given the level of bombardment, everyone in Gaza is at risk, frankly, of a violent death,
*  along with their families. And we're seeing that obviously in many cases. But do you think there
*  is deliberate, does the Committee to Protect Journalists think there is deliberate targeting
*  of specific journalists, including with their families in Gaza? We're investigating all of the
*  cases, all the 63 cases. And there are many cases in which we said from the beginning that we wanted
*  independent investigation, not just an Israeli investigation. And some we supported and continue
*  to support the International Criminal Court to look into, because they constitute unwarranted
*  and disproportionate use of lethal force. That includes the case of Osama Abdullah, for example.
*  But there are other cases in Gaza, including someone who worked with CPJ in the past on this
*  report, Deadly Pattern, Bilal Jadallah, who is a press advocate who offered the press house as a
*  refuge for journalists in this war to do their work, to have internet and electricity, and
*  provided them with protective equipment. And he was killed with an Israeli shilling to his car.
*  There are, of course, other examples of shows that are past threats that justify the journalists
*  were killed. And those who will find this determination and the evidence, as we see
*  in very details in the case of Osama Abdullah's investigation, would, of course, recommend to be
*  looked at and divintedly investigated. In the case of Shereena Baakla, we've called for the FBI
*  to do and announce the result of their own investigation. It's been now more than a year
*  that we learned that the investigation has started and that this could be one of the very few avenues
*  of justice that we can see a journalist murderer is being held accountable. But, of course,
*  other numerous independent investigations, including by news organizations, by the UN
*  committees, have concluded similarly like us in the past that in some of these cases, it was
*  premeditated and targeted attacks.
*  Shereef, really appreciate you talking to us about this horror amongst so many of the different
*  horrors, of course, but this is a particular horror that needs to be focused upon. Those
*  journalists on the ground in Gaza are the only ones who can actually, at the moment, provide a light
*  on actually what's happening and they're risking their lives, and many of them are paying with
*  their lives to make sure the world knows exactly what is happening in Gaza. The committees protect
*  journalism, crucial work, so I hope everyone goes and supports them. Please like and subscribe and
*  de-share this video to get this message across, but, Shereef, really, really appreciate your time.
*  Thank you. Thank you very much, Royal. Thank you. Thank you, audience.
