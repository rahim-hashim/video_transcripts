# This Doctor's Gaza Testimony Will Never Leave You - w/. Dr. Ana Jeelani
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE)
*  So it's been over a year now of some of the worst atrocities committed in the 21st [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=0.0s)]
*  century, the mass slaughter and maiming as well. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=4.84s)]
*  Really important, unfortunately to have to make that point of huge numbers of [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=9.0s)]
*  Palestinian people in Gaza, as well as all the trauma, the forcible repeated mass [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=13.0s)]
*  displacements, the basics of life being besieged, the destruction of the healthcare [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=19.96s)]
*  system, which is a point which a UN commission report has just made. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=25.44s)]
*  That is a concerted attempt, deliberate attempt to destroy the healthcare system, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=29.72s)]
*  which they say is tantamount to the crime against humanity of extermination. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=34.2s)]
*  Now, in the context of all this, we know, of course, that Palestinian doctors, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=39.96s)]
*  nurses, paramedics have been doing the most incredible work in the most [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=43.92s)]
*  unimaginable circumstances. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=49.0s)]
*  Many of them have been killed. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=50.36s)]
*  There has been a mass slaughter of Palestinian medics, often, all too often [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=51.44s)]
*  with their families and also their incarceration and doctors have been killed [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=55.839999999999996s)]
*  in Israeli incarceration, torture, you name it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=61.8s)]
*  As well as that, there have been large numbers or significant numbers of [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=68.32s)]
*  doctors, medics, nurses from around the world who have gone to Gaza to try and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=74.4s)]
*  help the Palestinian medical system in the state of collapse. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=79.88s)]
*  During apocalyptic conditions. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=86.72s)]
*  And one of them is the brilliant Dr. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=88.36s)]
*  Anna Gilani, who is a consultant pediatric orthopedic surgeon, who's currently not [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=90.72s)]
*  far from where I grew up, but was in Gaza twice this year, March 2024, this year [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=96.52000000000001s)]
*  for two weeks at Al Aqsa Hospital, which people will know about because it has [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=102.84s)]
*  just been bombed by the Israeli state. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=107.2s)]
*  And we saw horrifically a young Palestinian being burned alive or attached [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=109.96s)]
*  to an IV drip and then another month in September at Nasser Hospital. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=116.67999999999999s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  Thank you for having me Owen. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  Thank you for listening for what I want to say. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  That's the most important part of what I do. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=130.76s)]
*  So thank you. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=132.51999999999998s)]
*  I'm just gonna start actually in terms of those, I guess, maybe still in [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=135.72s)]
*  denial after a year of this, who maybe say, well, is it really a genocide? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=139.52s)]
*  Yes, maybe Israel's been disproportionate. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=144.60000000000002s)]
*  But what do you say? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=146.96s)]
*  What do you say to those at this point, having witnessed Gaza firsthand and [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=148.4s)]
*  having had to care for Palestinian civilians who suffered hideous injuries [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=153.24s)]
*  and who have died as consulates, what do you say to people who say, well, is [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=162.04000000000002s)]
*  this really a genocide, for example? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=164.4s)]
*  I have to take the biggest deep breath of my life. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=166.12s)]
*  Because I am fueled by rage when someone asks me that. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=169.44s)]
*  And I think that's why people don't ask me actually, because I think from people [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=174.12s)]
*  who have been on the ground, it's very difficult to disagree with us and argue [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=179.28s)]
*  with us because we have seen it firsthand. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=183.84s)]
*  And I actually think that people will not ever encourage that conversation [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=187.0s)]
*  because they know that all the propaganda and all the things that they see can just [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=192.0s)]
*  pale in significance to when we start talking and say, well, if it's not a [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=196.96s)]
*  genocide, then what about the fact that I've seen someone die or be murdered [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=201.84s)]
*  of malnutrition? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=207.68s)]
*  OK, so how about the scores of videos that I have on my phone of children [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=209.04000000000002s)]
*  running with cans of water to try and get water in the morning? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=214.4s)]
*  You know, how about all the destruction that I've seen, the infrastructure? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=218.88s)]
*  How about my friends who some of them have been tortured and taken away in [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=222.56s)]
*  two Israeli prison camps and they tell me what's happened to them? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=228.56s)]
*  So I think what people struggle with is, you know, disputing that because I can [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=232.6s)]
*  give you a name, I can give you a story, I can give you where they were. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=239.28s)]
*  So I actually don't have that conversation with many people because and it's really [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=242.96s)]
*  interesting because I was speaking at a protest and there was a counter protest [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=247.72s)]
*  at the same time and the counter protest was pretty quiet. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=251.28s)]
*  But then when I got up as a doctor who's been in Gaza, suddenly the music went on. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=254.36s)]
*  Everyone was trying to drown out what I was trying to say, because that's what [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=258.92s)]
*  the eyewitness account is. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=263.2s)]
*  And that's why they don't want independent press in there. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=264.44s)]
*  They don't want outside agencies going on, going in, because you can't argue [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=267.8s)]
*  with our testimony. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=274.0s)]
*  And it's a really sad situation. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=275.32s)]
*  I'm a surgeon. I'm used to being in an operating theatre, giving medical [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=277.32s)]
*  lectures. I did one this morning about my subject topic. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=280.64s)]
*  I am not used to talking to journalists and giving my side of a witness to war [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=284.2s)]
*  crimes. Right. And you thrust a population of people who have been in to Gaza, into [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=290.28s)]
*  this position. And actually, it's like a moral duty to speak up about what we've [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=296.64s)]
*  seen. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=300.84s)]
*  Now, according to World Health Organization, between 7th of October, 20, 23, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=302.59999999999997s)]
*  July 20, 24, Israel carried out nearly 500 separate attacks on health care [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=307.12s)]
*  facilities in Gaza. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=311.84s)]
*  They report between 7th of October and 23rd of June. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=315.4s)]
*  So that's many months now ago, unfortunately, but in that period, 500 medical [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=318.8s)]
*  staff were killed. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=322.4s)]
*  They talk of 113 ambulances being attacked. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=324.76s)]
*  They say 20 of the 36 hospitals in Gaza are now completely non-functional, with [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=328.71999999999997s)]
*  16 partially operating. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=333.24s)]
*  Can you just give us a picture? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=335.2s)]
*  And then there's the siege of medicine. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=336.44s)]
*  Can you just give us a picture of what it's like, what the medicals and you saw in [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=339.64s)]
*  those two different periods, what is the hospital system? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=343.16s)]
*  So there was a difference, definitely. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=345.84000000000003s)]
*  And I think the difference is rougher and the invasion of rougher when that happened, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=347.72s)]
*  the siege. So in March, when we went, I went in the first two weeks of Ramadan [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=351.96000000000004s)]
*  and we had a mass casualty every evening coinciding when people were opening their [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=357.48s)]
*  fast, because that's when families are together. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=362.8s)]
*  The hospital had 200 beds at the time. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=365.56s)]
*  It was a capacity of 700 patients so that we were crawling over patients to get [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=369.28000000000003s)]
*  to other patients. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=374.92s)]
*  Theatres were, you know, it was never empty. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=376.52000000000004s)]
*  It was all and, you know, everyone asked me, what's the one image that you remember? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=379.88s)]
*  I can't. I just remember standing in the middle of theatres and just looking at this [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=384.08000000000004s)]
*  incredible destruction and chaos. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=388.72s)]
*  And to operate in that, it's testament to the Palestinians to do that, because [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=392.16s)]
*  I can tell you, I was a trainee when the Manchester bomb happened in [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=399.04s)]
*  Manchester. And, you know, if they had to deal, if the NHS system had to deal [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=404.36s)]
*  with the amount of mass casualties that were coming through the door in Palestine, in [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=411.28s)]
*  Gaza, they would not, you know, all work would stop in the whole hospital, because [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=415.6s)]
*  I've seen how mass casualties work in the UK. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=420.6s)]
*  And it's testament. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=424.36s)]
*  So people have this misconception that, you know, Palestinians might not be as good [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=426.04s)]
*  doctors or not. They are better than all of us. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=429.04s)]
*  We are helping them. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=431.96000000000004s)]
*  They know how to run a mass casualty. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=433.32000000000005s)]
*  They know how to operate on this. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=435.08000000000004s)]
*  And the whole thing of this aggression is Israel are taking out the most senior [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=436.88s)]
*  people in hospitals, the most senior people have been evacuated themselves. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=442.56s)]
*  You know, fair enough. You have to make a decision to in your security and your [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=449.12s)]
*  family's security. So you have like this massive gulf of inexperience, because [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=452.32s)]
*  medical students are now being doctors. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=458.56s)]
*  You know, everyone that I've met who's a resident in orthopaedics have said, you [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=460.8s)]
*  know, we've done so many so much training, like you can never get this out of a book. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=465.48s)]
*  Like they're just being thrust into dealing with all these mass casualties. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=469.76000000000005s)]
*  And some of them are their own family members. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=474.24s)]
*  So one of my colleagues, I thought he'd gone home and he came back. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=476.8s)]
*  And the guy that I was dealing with, who had both legs amputated and an arm amputated [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=480.68s)]
*  is his brother-in-law. And, you know, the trauma of having to deal with your own [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=486.24s)]
*  population that this is happening to, horrific, absolutely horrific. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=492.6s)]
*  And that's just the people. Right. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=498.36s)]
*  So if you talk about supplies, there's no supplies this time that we went because [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=500.84s)]
*  Israel purposely do not let us take in medical aid. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=506.84s)]
*  There's been as well documented about how aid is not getting into Gaza. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=510.0s)]
*  You know, they're running out of swabs to like stop bleeding to a point where they [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=514.52s)]
*  were cutting up clothing and sterilizing that and trying to use that as swabs. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=519.84s)]
*  Simple, basic, life-saving stuff is not there anymore. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=525.76s)]
*  You know, ultrasounds gone. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=530.56s)]
*  And there's videos that you see then on Instagram of Israeli soldiers, like bashing out, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=532.64s)]
*  you know, ultrasound scans. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=537.92s)]
*  And you're like, that is if that's not a destruction of the health care service, what is? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=539.12s)]
*  I was at NASA the second time and that had been sieged. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=545.1999999999999s)]
*  So when we walked in, the weirdest thing I saw was all the doors had this like mark on them. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=548.36s)]
*  And it's where the Israeli army had gone systematically through the whole hospital and [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=554.64s)]
*  cleared the rooms and they're still on the doors. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=558.96s)]
*  And, you know, then we walked out into our accommodation and there was this balcony. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=562.28s)]
*  We were on the fourth floor. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=567.08s)]
*  And the weirdest thing is that's quite high in Gaza because everything else has been [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=568.12s)]
*  destroyed. And you look out and you looked out into the mass graves, like where they [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=571.52s)]
*  found 300 medical workers and patients, some of them with little catheter bags attached [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=575.96s)]
*  to them in a mass grave. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=581.44s)]
*  And they're living in this. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=583.12s)]
*  That this is they're continuing to serve their population in this. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=584.84s)]
*  It's just everywhere you turn, they have thoughtful way to destroy it. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=589.96s)]
*  And it's heartbreaking. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=595.9200000000001s)]
*  I can't describe to you the pain that you feel when you see all of that, because and [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=598.5200000000001s)]
*  they're still going and they're still continuing and this show up to work. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=604.2s)]
*  It's just horrific. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=609.44s)]
*  Sorry, I don't know if that was the right way to describe, but it's just horrific. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=611.5200000000001s)]
*  It's exactly the right way. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=614.6800000000001s)]
*  I've been well, it was it was, I don't know, it's difficult to know how to [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=615.5600000000001s)]
*  respond to it. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=620.08s)]
*  And I think the other thing is when I saw Aluxa this week, I've spent two weeks in [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=620.5200000000001s)]
*  that hospital. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=625.8800000000001s)]
*  I knew every bit of that hospital because, you know, we were as a when you go out with [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=626.84s)]
*  the charity with MAP, you're not allowed to kind of leave the hospital. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=631.4000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=634.4000000000001s)]
*  So you're in the hospital for two weeks while living in on the end of a ward in a [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=634.6800000000001s)]
*  room. And as soon as you open your room, this patient's in front of you. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=638.96s)]
*  And those tents, I've walked through those tents because you wanted to get a bit of [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=642.5600000000001s)]
*  exercise to get out a bit of fresh air. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=648.0s)]
*  So and, you know, a lot of the family members who work in the hospital live in those [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=650.0s)]
*  tents because it's difficult for them to live far away because it's treacherous them [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=654.36s)]
*  getting into the hospital. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=659.8000000000001s)]
*  So after I left a week after, it was the first time they bombed Aluxa. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=661.52s)]
*  And that was the worst day when I got back because I text everyone I knew being like, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=666.8s)]
*  are you safe? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=670.8399999999999s)]
*  Are you not safe? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=671.68s)]
*  And the fact that they feel that by being a British citizen, by having a British [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=673.1199999999999s)]
*  passport, we are protective to the hospital. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=679.1999999999999s)]
*  And then when we leave, because every all of our movements are coordinated with [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=681.8399999999999s)]
*  Israel. Right. So they know when we're in the hospital and when we're not. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=685.64s)]
*  So when we leave, there's this theory that, you know, that's when they'll attack the [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=688.64s)]
*  hospital. A week after I left last time, the World Central Kitchen workers were [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=694.4s)]
*  attacked and then they had a British passport. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=699.96s)]
*  Right. So then that took that theory out. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=701.8000000000001s)]
*  But I can't explain those hospitals are communities. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=703.92s)]
*  There are children. There are so many displaced people living in the hospital. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=709.08s)]
*  And to attack a hospital repeatedly and to attack patients because they're [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=713.76s)]
*  overflowing. I was stunned. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=719.24s)]
*  Can you talk through about the demographics of the patients you were dealing with? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=724.76s)]
*  I mean, who were they? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=728.92s)]
*  So so it's a really horrible way to say it. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=730.32s)]
*  But if you're dead on arrival or you're pretty much not going to make it, then you [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=733.32s)]
*  never really made it to my bit of like treating because I was in theatre most of [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=738.0s)]
*  the time. And so a lot of children, a lot of children, a lot of children with [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=743.28s)]
*  shrapnel injuries, some horrific, horrific burns that I saw this time. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=748.48s)]
*  And a lot of young males, OK, because they are the people who will go out to [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=753.4s)]
*  get the water, will go out to the shops to go and get stuff for their families. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=760.52s)]
*  And then elderly, so many elderly. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=765.04s)]
*  And the saddest thing is with medical evacuation, the elderly were not the [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=767.88s)]
*  priority to get evacuated. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=771.56s)]
*  So you saw people who probably lived a really difficult life with now amputations, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=773.7199999999999s)]
*  losing their whole families. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=779.28s)]
*  And it was the I know we concentrate on women and children, but the elderly was [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=781.04s)]
*  where my heart really sank because you just thought that, you know, towards the [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=785.92s)]
*  end of your life or you should be having a restful life, you shouldn't now be [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=791.0s)]
*  dealing with an amputation. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=795.68s)]
*  All your family members killed, your generations, my other people have been [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=797.56s)]
*  killed. And so actually, it doesn't distinguish. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=802.0s)]
*  We dealt with all people of all ages. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=805.92s)]
*  And for me, I saw a lot of amputation wounds in my first trip as a team. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=808.44s)]
*  We did 30 amputations. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=818.08s)]
*  And this time it was less because we were trying to do more limb saving [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=820.12s)]
*  operation because we had availability of a little bit more kit. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=825.6s)]
*  And but yeah, it doesn't discriminate. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=830.4s)]
*  It doesn't discriminate. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=833.12s)]
*  And I mean, so the sorts of injuries you were dealing with were often from [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=834.84s)]
*  explosive impact. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=838.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=840.04s)]
*  And some kind of so burns were a lot of stuff that we saw burns, dressings. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=840.96s)]
*  I dealt with limb injuring, limb threatening injuries, so open fractures. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=849.88s)]
*  Everything's pretty much open. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=854.24s)]
*  And what you don't realize is shrapnel gets everywhere. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=855.8s)]
*  So, you know, and it's shrapnel so hard to like dig out of a person. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=858.72s)]
*  And amputations. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=864.12s)]
*  One of my cases that I spoke to my friends about was there was a guy who was [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=867.24s)]
*  walking with his friends in his 30s. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=871.8s)]
*  He's walking in Rafa and then a quadcopter hits him and his friends as four of them. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=875.48s)]
*  Two of them die or killed, I should say. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=880.64s)]
*  One survives with minor injuries. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=884.32s)]
*  Then he came in with an amputation of his one arm above his elbow and amputation of [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=886.0s)]
*  his other leg. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=892.28s)]
*  And, you know, this guy was just walking with his friends and I just thought [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=893.56s)]
*  there's nothing different between me and you. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=898.1999999999999s)]
*  And yet you have been gunned down and slaughtered and you just don't know when [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=900.8s)]
*  who's the next person who's going to be that that happens to. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=906.9599999999999s)]
*  I mean, for those who don't know, quadcopters are armed drones, which are [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=910.8s)]
*  remotely piloted by the IDF. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=914.8399999999999s)]
*  I spoke to another doctor who'd been in Gars and spoke of the very distinctive [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=918.4399999999999s)]
*  kind of pellets that you know, you know, when it's a quadcopter. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=925.48s)]
*  And that's included, but, you know, a bomb would go off or a missile attack and then [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=930.0s)]
*  the quadcopters come and then... [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=934.64s)]
*  Yeah, afterwards they got them. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=936.12s)]
*  So interestingly, we found that a lot of the quadcopters were groin because that's [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=938.04s)]
*  quite high. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=943.24s)]
*  So it dictates the level of your amputation. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=944.12s)]
*  And if they hit you below at the March of Great Return, I know there are a lot of knee [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=947.52s)]
*  injuries because that was the aim, right? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=953.04s)]
*  So they wanted you to have an above knee amputation. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=956.3199999999999s)]
*  For those who don't know, there was protests in 2018 where Palestinians from Gaza came [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=958.92s)]
*  to the fence to protest for the right to return against the occupation and then were [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=963.8s)]
*  often massacred and shot by these women for some reason. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=968.56s)]
*  So this is groin and higher leg. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=972.2s)]
*  Yeah, but the quadcopters were probably... [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=978.08s)]
*  One of my friends, he had about 30 people martyred from his family and he said that [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=981.2s)]
*  the airstrike hit his house and then other family members ran to help and to get the [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=986.08s)]
*  martyrs or to try and see if anyone's alive. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=992.5600000000001s)]
*  And then a quadcopter followed and then shot them. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=995.24s)]
*  And so everyone was killed. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=997.9200000000001s)]
*  From what you have experienced and witnessed, what would you say in terms of just about [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=999.08s)]
*  the overall death toll? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1005.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean, obviously, you know, there are different estimates. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1006.8000000000001s)]
*  The official death toll is very widely regarded to be a severe and drastic underestimate, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1008.76s)]
*  partly because it excludes those who are missing under the rubble. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1013.44s)]
*  For example, thousands of people, they're just excluded altogether. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1016.8000000000001s)]
*  But then there's the reporting system collapsing, the hospital system collapsing, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1019.36s)]
*  civilisation collapsing. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1023.32s)]
*  You can't really... [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1024.24s)]
*  You know, entire families just wiped out and no one to report them, indirect causes. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1025.0800000000002s)]
*  What do you think in terms of... [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1030.48s)]
*  Because you just mentioned there, and this is a recurring theme, and when I speak to [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1031.24s)]
*  Palestinian girls, they just had 30 members of the family killed. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1033.96s)]
*  She's just talking about one person, 30 members of his family is then in front of him. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1036.68s)]
*  And it's just from your experience, just, you know, the Palestinian you speak to, how [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1039.64s)]
*  many relatives they've lost. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1043.48s)]
*  What would you say? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1044.96s)]
*  Because the official death toll is 42,000. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1045.44s)]
*  And to be honest, it hasn't... [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1047.2800000000002s)]
*  I mean, you know... [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1048.1200000000001s)]
*  It hasn't changed. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1048.96s)]
*  It hasn't changed. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1049.72s)]
*  There's no reporting system. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1050.44s)]
*  Like, we can't even track a patient. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1051.72s)]
*  I don't know how you track. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1053.44s)]
*  Like, the destruction that has happened. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1054.72s)]
*  So you're right. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1057.0s)]
*  Like, we don't know how many have been killed. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1058.1200000000001s)]
*  When we were in Nasser, the 80 unidentified bodies arrived that Israel had sent in a... [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1060.5600000000002s)]
*  kind of in a truck. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1066.5200000000002s)]
*  You know, you don't know whether that is 80. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1068.96s)]
*  They've said that's 80, but they were so unidentifiable that no one will ever know [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1071.96s)]
*  who those bits were or people were. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1077.88s)]
*  So, you know, there could be a hundred for all we know. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1081.2s)]
*  Are we trusting their figures? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1083.76s)]
*  Are we trusting their numbers? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1085.4s)]
*  So I think you will never understand the actual death toll that is there. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1086.6s)]
*  But what it doesn't take into account is how many people will die from pneumonia now, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1092.2s)]
*  because, you know, winter is coming. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1098.76s)]
*  There's no antibiotics. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1101.12s)]
*  Nutrition is low. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1102.48s)]
*  How many people will die from, you know, sepsis? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1103.8799999999999s)]
*  Because you can't tell. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1107.84s)]
*  It's just impossible to know the death toll. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1110.28s)]
*  But I know that 42,000 is such a mis-underestimation that I cannot explain to you, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1112.24s)]
*  because, yeah, and we all focus on the death toll. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1120.64s)]
*  But the people who are surviving, you know, I'd like to see how many of those survive the year, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1124.64s)]
*  because they might have survived initially, but the consequences of their injuries that they've [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1129.92s)]
*  sustained will eventually, you know, I've seen so many patients who have got infected stumps. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1135.4s)]
*  OK, and they keep going back to theatre, to theatre. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1141.56s)]
*  They're getting sicker. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1145.24s)]
*  Antibiotics are not working. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1146.56s)]
*  They will eventually not survive a whole year, right? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1148.1999999999998s)]
*  But they will not come up in a statistic because, you know, you can't count that. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1151.36s)]
*  It's worth pointing out, for example, back in July, three health experts, academics, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1158.32s)]
*  sent a letter to the Atlantic, for example, suggesting it could be 186,000. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1164.32s)]
*  I mean, one thing I often think about, things like cancer patients, people with heart conditions, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1169.88s)]
*  I mean, this is a health system which is every day, which has been destroyed in so many ways. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1175.1200000000001s)]
*  So it's interesting to bring up cancer, because in our team, there was a cancer surgeon, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1183.72s)]
*  Mr Tassin Qureshi, great guy, works in Poole, and he went out there to do cancer surgery, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1187.88s)]
*  and they couldn't let his kit in. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1194.3999999999999s)]
*  So he had no way of getting his kit to do his cancer operations. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1196.76s)]
*  And everyone he was consulting on, you know, if that cancer had been treated six months ago, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1201.72s)]
*  it was survivable. But now it's not survivable. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1206.8799999999999s)]
*  There's two with any kind of mass that you have, you need to get histopathology. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1210.72s)]
*  So to work out what cancer is, they've killed two histopathologists. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1214.52s)]
*  There's no staining. So you can't do the samples. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1219.32s)]
*  So you don't even know, like, kind of what cancer there is. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1222.64s)]
*  There's no radiotherapy. There's no chemotherapy. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1226.24s)]
*  So everything he's doing now is kind of life that he did was kind of life protecting, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1229.5600000000002s)]
*  as in, you know, stenting the cancer so they can still eat. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1237.0400000000002s)]
*  But it's not curative because there's no curative means now because they've destroyed all of that. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1240.72s)]
*  And so he found it incredibly frustrating being out there because he was seeing all these cancers that have leached. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1248.28s)]
*  And this is the thing, someone would have a cancer, but they're going back to a tent. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1255.56s)]
*  How are you going to do a big operation on them? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1260.24s)]
*  And their recovery is a tent and their malnutrition, you know, that everything about it, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1262.72s)]
*  you know, when we go into hospital, the first thing our parents will say is, have you eaten? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1269.6s)]
*  Have you slept well? They're sleeping in a tent with bombardment and the threat of [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1273.52s)]
*  displacement and you're going to try and recover from any kind of cancer intervention. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1277.72s)]
*  It's huge. It's absolutely huge. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1282.04s)]
*  The devastation they've caused and it's systematic. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1284.76s)]
*  They've done it in a systematic way. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1287.6000000000001s)]
*  They've everyone has lost psychological security there. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1289.52s)]
*  They have lost actual security there. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1293.32s)]
*  They have lost food. They have lost water. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1295.96s)]
*  They have lost every kind of component of a health care system that you need for it to thrive. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1299.2s)]
*  So even if you brought in all the aid, your population is in a place where it's not meant to thrive [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1306.52s)]
*  because they've they've done that. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1313.48s)]
*  We drove past the biggest desalination point. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1315.32s)]
*  So to make safe drinking water, if you look opposite it, there's the biggest sewage tip. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1318.68s)]
*  It's cholera is waiting to I know people talk about polio, but cholera will be the next thing [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1324.3999999999999s)]
*  that will appear in Gaza because there's no way you can guarantee clean drinking water. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1330.48s)]
*  I mean, public many public health experts point out that and I hesitate to use the word [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1337.0s)]
*  conflict because it's too one sided. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1342.6s)]
*  And also this is so extreme. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1344.44s)]
*  It's difficult to compare to what we would describe as conflicts in other cases. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1346.48s)]
*  But that in the end, it's not the direct violence that would kill majority of people in these [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1349.96s)]
*  sorts of circumstances. Do you think that's true? [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1358.72s)]
*  Yeah, agreed. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1360.6399999999999s)]
*  100 percent. The direct violence is what everyone focuses on, correctly so, because we have to stop [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1361.5600000000002s)]
*  that. But we talked a lot about if a ceasefire comes, what does the day after look like? [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1368.52s)]
*  And the day after looks like a population that has no infrastructure, whose health care has been [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1374.3600000000001s)]
*  purposely taken out. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1379.8400000000001s)]
*  That does there's no way of recovery of that. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1382.24s)]
*  Now, if there's one set of people that can recover, it is the Palestinians. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1385.52s)]
*  I will put that as a footnote. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1389.0400000000002s)]
*  We just even little things like the how they get around the barriers that are placed in front of [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1390.72s)]
*  them is incredible. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1397.88s)]
*  And so if there is a population that can do it, it is them. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1399.8400000000001s)]
*  But it's going to be a big job. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1403.16s)]
*  So, yeah, I'd agree. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1406.3600000000001s)]
*  Before I ask you about that, because I know it's really important we talk about that before I [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1409.0800000000002s)]
*  ask you that I just because I referred to this UN Commission of Inquiry, which was recently [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1412.68s)]
*  published on the 10th of October, in fact, a week ago, and they said that Israel has [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1416.84s)]
*  implemented a concerted policy, a deliberate policy to destroy the health care system Gaza and its [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1421.1999999999998s)]
*  forces deliberately killed, wounded, arrested, detained, mistreated and tortured medical [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1426.3999999999999s)]
*  personnel and targeted medical vehicles. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1430.12s)]
*  And that this constitutes a the war crime of willful killing and mistreatment and B the crime [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1432.32s)]
*  against humanity of extermination from your experience. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1438.6399999999999s)]
*  When you hear that, what do you say? [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1442.6s)]
*  When you that it's a deliberate attack, they go out of the way to destroy it. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1443.84s)]
*  100%. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1447.6s)]
*  I think when you talk to people and you say what's different about this time compared to [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1448.44s)]
*  others, when they bombed Al Ahly hospital, the Baptist hospital, that was the first one, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1453.52s)]
*  they thought this is different. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1459.28s)]
*  This is, you know, they have gone after a hospital and and 100%. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1460.84s)]
*  So NASA Hospital, the amount of anesthetists that I met had been arrested, detained. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1466.12s)]
*  They told me about their time detention and they are picked out because they are wearing [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1471.04s)]
*  scrubs. So one of my really good friends, he was evacuating from Schiffer hospital and [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1475.28s)]
*  he was arrested, detained. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1483.24s)]
*  He was in captivity for 52 days, I think. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1485.48s)]
*  He was released before I met him for the first time in March. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1488.76s)]
*  And, you know, he was beckoned by the soldiers because he was wearing scrubs. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1492.44s)]
*  So they people who were there would change out of their scrubs before they walked out of [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1497.8s)]
*  the hospital grounds because you are a target. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1503.8799999999999s)]
*  And the way they tell their detent, they tell their stories of their detention, it's [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1506.96s)]
*  very deliberate. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1513.04s)]
*  And that's what you do, because taking out Schiffer, one of the doctors said it's the [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1515.36s)]
*  beating soul of Gaza. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1520.08s)]
*  And what is the best way to crush someone's spirit is by taking out the beating soul. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1522.72s)]
*  And that was Schiffer hospital. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1528.44s)]
*  So the destruction that happened there with the burning of the buildings, that was not [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1530.0800000000002s)]
*  just a target of the people there, but a target of the infrastructure and the target to [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1534.68s)]
*  the soul of Gaza. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1539.96s)]
*  Before I ask you actually about the point about the humanities, or just that final [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1542.24s)]
*  point on the destruction of the health care system. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1547.96s)]
*  I mean, when you mentioned Schiffer hospital right near the start of this, which I'm not [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1550.48s)]
*  going to go into, there's this big discussion about the big bombing of Al-Shifa. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1554.24s)]
*  Who did it? Was it misfire? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1557.3600000000001s)]
*  Was it as well? The point about that was it was the reason it was such a big discussion [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1558.52s)]
*  was it was seen as a completely depraved and grotesque act to have a hospital being [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1563.0800000000002s)]
*  bombed. But since then, you've now seen the relentless bombing of hospitals and their [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1569.16s)]
*  destruction and medical personnel. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1575.0s)]
*  Just so you know, it's just the kind of like moral decline we've kind of witnessed [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1576.68s)]
*  where this is normalised, where the health care system of a society can be violently [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1581.76s)]
*  dismantled. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1586.0s)]
*  It baffles me. And you know what baffles me the most is that medical institutions are [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1586.92s)]
*  not calling this out and not saying, come on people. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1592.16s)]
*  Like we go into medicine, majoritivly to, I know it sounds corny, but help people and [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1596.5600000000002s)]
*  be, you know, be that very neutral voice for people because we would treat anyone. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1605.48s)]
*  Right. But the fact that these people are being absolutely targeted, hospitals are [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1611.28s)]
*  being bombed. We've witnessed this week, Shaban, his name burning with an IV drip in [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1618.6s)]
*  his arm and the silence that that has around the world. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1626.36s)]
*  Why are not all medical institutions being like, this is wrong? [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1632.56s)]
*  And you just have to breathe really deeply and sigh. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1637.08s)]
*  But 100 percent, I went like, we met the health minister and I asked him, I said, I'm [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1643.36s)]
*  a health worker and I'm going to go back to the UK. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1650.36s)]
*  What do you want them to know? [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1653.2s)]
*  And he said plain and simply after saying they need a ceasefire, which they do. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1654.9199999999998s)]
*  But he said, tell them that this is a target on our health care service. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1659.84s)]
*  And I've done that for Dr. Yusuf. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1664.9599999999998s)]
*  This is a target on health care. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1667.56s)]
*  Yeah, we've seen multiple examples of the lack of solidarity, speaking as a journalist, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1670.48s)]
*  the silence of British journalists about the biggest slaughter of journalists in [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1673.9199999999998s)]
*  recorded history. Would there be that response if there was a consensus that [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1677.7199999999998s)]
*  Palestinians were human beings of equal worth? [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1682.9199999999998s)]
*  And that's what I want to ask about now, about the humanity you saw there in [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1684.7199999999998s)]
*  impossible circumstances. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1688.04s)]
*  I mean, even though you're talking to us and it feels vivid and all the rest of it, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1689.48s)]
*  there's only a tiny kind of real sense of what it's actually like that we could ever [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1694.88s)]
*  possibly imagine. Let's just be honest about that. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1700.68s)]
*  But we know, I think people understand, the apocalyptic conditions, how you think [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1702.76s)]
*  people would just be so broken and destroyed and just hopeless. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1708.04s)]
*  What was the kind of what did you see the human response that really stuck with you? [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1713.24s)]
*  You know what? They are people who just want to live. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1718.08s)]
*  And one of the guys said to me, which was like such a poignant thing, he said, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1723.48s)]
*  animals in the UK have more rights than we do as Palestinians. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1729.4s)]
*  And he said to me, Anna, do they not see us as people? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1734.4s)]
*  And, you know, that's why I am an advocate for them, because they are people. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1737.88s)]
*  They have hopes and dreams and the same problems that we have, right? [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1742.52s)]
*  They're not getting on with their wife. They're not. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1749.56s)]
*  Their brother is annoying them. It's all the same stuff. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1751.2s)]
*  It's I think there's so much discussion in the media and on social media and everything [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1754.24s)]
*  about, you know, statistics, but they are people at the end of it and they are so [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1760.6799999999998s)]
*  welcoming. Right. So, you know, when we got there as medical workers, the minister [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1766.28s)]
*  of health of Gaza came to meet us and he came to meet us when he was leaving as [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1772.24s)]
*  well. You know, and he remembered stories about us. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1777.1200000000001s)]
*  And they're so. They're so just want to live. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1779.04s)]
*  The the the the want to survive is is so strong. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1785.44s)]
*  And I was there for the October the seventh. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1790.6s)]
*  And I hate using the word anniversary because it always seems to have like a good [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1793.1200000000001s)]
*  connotation anniversary. But I was there on October the seventh. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1796.64s)]
*  And, you know, the only thing that I could think was existence is resistance. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1799.4s)]
*  And that's what they do. Like my friend that I told you who'd been arrested and [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1803.88s)]
*  and detained and has had unspeakable things done to him in detention, which has [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1808.88s)]
*  been documented while while, you know, has been documented in the media of how [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1814.6000000000001s)]
*  they've treated prisoners. He got married whilst we were there. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1821.68s)]
*  Right. And I met his wife and he brought me a candle that they'd made from their [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1824.8799999999999s)]
*  wedding. And it's like he's had unspeakable things happen to him. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1831.36s)]
*  But he's getting married and he's, you know, trying to to combat the [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1835.9599999999998s)]
*  extermination that they're facing with love and hope. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1843.56s)]
*  And he works at Alexa and that day when Alexa was bombed, he lives in Nusarath [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1847.4s)]
*  camp and he sent me an audio of quadcopters shelling outside his house. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1855.24s)]
*  And he said, this might be my goodbye to you. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1861.16s)]
*  And he was always remember me, you know, and I don't know how we humanize these [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1863.52s)]
*  people because they are. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1870.08s)]
*  And it saddens me that when media say 10 killed or 10 dead, because those 10 [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1873.64s)]
*  people have names and they deserve to be said. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1881.68s)]
*  I mean, when you see media coverage, which so blatantly treats Palestinian life [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1888.3600000000001s)]
*  as having so little worth or, you know, we saw, we talked about that young [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1893.68s)]
*  lad about 19 years old being burned alive in an ivory drip. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1899.08s)]
*  You know, Sky News did a segment where they mournfully listed the names of [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1903.24s)]
*  Israeli soldiers who'd been killed. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1907.6399999999999s)]
*  They were just 19 years old. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1909.92s)]
*  Their pictures up and all the rest of it. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1911.24s)]
*  They've never done that for Palestinian civilians. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1913.12s)]
*  How does that make you feel when you've been up and close on a daily basis to see [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1914.8s)]
*  that humanity granted in that case, more humanity to combatants who are Israeli [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1918.52s)]
*  than kids, ordinary people in the past? [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1924.12s)]
*  I want to scream inside. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1926.56s)]
*  I feel like I've come back and I'm just screaming internally. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1929.1200000000001s)]
*  And I just don't know where we went as a society that has allowed that to happen. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1933.1200000000001s)]
*  Where was the point when these people were not named, you know, and people say, [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1940.4s)]
*  you know, there's too many of them or there's loads of them. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1947.64s)]
*  That doesn't minimize their worth. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1950.32s)]
*  That doesn't minimize who they are and what they've achieved in their life. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1952.68s)]
*  You know, I, I, oh, and I spent most of my week since I've been back. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1957.3200000000002s)]
*  Holding my breath and internally screaming. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1965.0800000000002s)]
*  Because I just really wish someone else was allowed into Gaza. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1970.3200000000002s)]
*  I really wish that an independent person that people would listen to [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1976.4s)]
*  could be allowed because you'd think they'd listen to us. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1982.12s)]
*  We've written to the prime minister. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1985.0s)]
*  We've written to David Lammy. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1986.48s)]
*  We've told them everything that, you know, you've mentioned before the [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1988.0s)]
*  the New York, New York Times article. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1992.24s)]
*  We have told people what is happening. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1994.6s)]
*  We have tried to humanize these people as best as we can. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=1997.36s)]
*  And no one listens. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2001.2s)]
*  And the new cycle continues. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2003.04s)]
*  And it's going to Lebanon now. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2005.8s)]
*  The most surreal bit of this trip was sitting in Gaza, watching Lebanon [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2007.56s)]
*  burning, you know, and thinking, how can they've destroyed this place? [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2011.32s)]
*  Why are we as a society letting this happen in another place? [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2016.92s)]
*  And and Palestinians genuinely, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2023.68s)]
*  one of one of the guys I remember from my first trip [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2027.12s)]
*  came to say goodbye to me as a necetist. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2030.4s)]
*  And he's had a child that's been killed. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2032.8s)]
*  And he said to me, you know, Dr. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2035.48s)]
*  Anna, you didn't have to touch a single patient when you came here. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2036.9199999999998s)]
*  You didn't have to do anything in the operating theater. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2040.24s)]
*  The fact that you left the security of your family [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2042.56s)]
*  and your bed in the West and came here and showed solidarity [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2045.56s)]
*  is more important to us than anything that you've operated on. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2050.52s)]
*  And that's what I'd say is like solidarity cannot be underestimated [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2054.0s)]
*  in these situations, and they see it right. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2059.36s)]
*  So when I was there, I would show them and because I'm [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2061.52s)]
*  a scouser by heart, I showed them the Liverpool March. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2065.56s)]
*  And, you know, they're like, people know this. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2068.72s)]
*  People the first time I went, people they were like, [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2070.56s)]
*  do they know what's going on about us? [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2073.44s)]
*  Because if they know, why is it not stopped? [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2074.92s)]
*  And that was heartbreaking. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2077.24s)]
*  Trying to answer why we're not being able to stop this. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2079.24s)]
*  And now they're just like, oh, they're still seeing us being killed. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2082.84s)]
*  But, you know, there are good people there. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2087.24s)]
*  And you show them the the videos and the marches and [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2089.04s)]
*  that I showed them videos of the National March. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2093.32s)]
*  I read them Jeremy Corbyn's words that he'd he'd said. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2096.4s)]
*  And, you know, they feel that they feel they know this. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2100.2s)]
*  They've all got social media. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2104.2s)]
*  They see everything that's going on and the conversations. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2105.68s)]
*  And they still ask, do they not think we're human? [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2109.88s)]
*  I mean, I know you've written along with the doctors to the government [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2114.08s)]
*  and had a response. I'm just wondering about that. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2117.36s)]
*  But also how you feel when you hear [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2119.88s)]
*  British politicians sometimes they'll talk about, you know, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2123.88s)]
*  how terrible it is in Gaza and they'll, you know, hand wring about it. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2126.52s)]
*  And like it's some sort of natural disaster. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2129.76s)]
*  It is screaming. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2132.92s)]
*  That's the only thing you'll get from this is pure and total rage. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2135.52s)]
*  So we had a response from the government. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2138.96s)]
*  It wasn't even David Lammy. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2140.92s)]
*  It was Folkner, MP Folkner. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2143.7200000000003s)]
*  And and it was a stock answer. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2148.32s)]
*  We were very specific in the things that we said needed to happen, [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2151.2400000000002s)]
*  mainly the assistance of humanitarian aid and humanitarian [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2156.6s)]
*  workers going there. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2161.28s)]
*  I don't think that is, you know, we're asking for the world in those things. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2163.36s)]
*  And the response that you've also read, it was a stock answer to anyone. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2168.7200000000003s)]
*  It was very much, well, we are trying and everything is, you know, [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2172.6800000000003s)]
*  it's very complex. It's not complex. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2177.12s)]
*  I've driven past like about 100 trucks [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2179.7200000000003s)]
*  at the Raffa Crossing when we went in March that are stopped at the border. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2184.2000000000003s)]
*  I have a video that's 10 minutes long of trucks waiting with aid. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2187.88s)]
*  It's not that complicated. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2192.44s)]
*  You apply the pressure to open up aid to these people. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2194.04s)]
*  And the fact that the government cannot even make that concession. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2199.36s)]
*  And then also there's the thing of well, aid is getting through. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2204.1600000000003s)]
*  It's not every body UNICEF, UNRWA, UN, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2207.6000000000004s)]
*  everyone is saying aid is not getting through. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2212.92s)]
*  Even the US government. But I should make this point. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2215.04s)]
*  I mean, the US aid, their official international agency [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2216.88s)]
*  and the State Department's refugee agency have all said that Israel [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2221.44s)]
*  is deliberately blocking aid. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2225.8s)]
*  And now even the US government has sent a letter making clear that Israel [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2227.7200000000003s)]
*  is deliberately blocking aid, not what they're doing. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2230.92s)]
*  I mean, just so we know, we shouldn't have to like, the fact we even have to [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2233.12s)]
*  debate this as though it's like a contested issue is that, you know, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2237.08s)]
*  it's like debating the sky being blue, except talking about the siege of Basie. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2240.3599999999997s)]
*  I mean, yeah, I mean, it must be. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2244.48s)]
*  It's just I just don't know where humanity went wrong. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2246.2799999999997s)]
*  I just don't know where where where it all went wrong. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2250.64s)]
*  I mean, Hamish Folkner, you mentioned the minister of the Middle East, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2253.8399999999997s)]
*  North Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2256.44s)]
*  And he said, but please rest assured that the foreign secretary [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2258.8399999999997s)]
*  and his entire ministerial team will continue to do all they can to secure [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2261.2s)]
*  lasting peace in the region. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2265.24s)]
*  And it's important to say they suspended eight percent of arms sales, but 92 percent. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2266.3999999999996s)]
*  But they also continue to supply crucial components for F-35 jets, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2270.16s)]
*  which are raining down and the explosives and then causing the sorts of injuries [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2274.08s)]
*  you personally had to tend to. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2278.64s)]
*  How do you think? So I mean, it just seems the world turned upside down. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2280.68s)]
*  We want to hear what happens. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2283.64s)]
*  You know, Owen, it's so interesting because this week I was on BBC [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2285.3999999999996s)]
*  News on Tuesday, I think, and [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2289.64s)]
*  they wanted to talk to me about the polio vaccination campaign. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2293.24s)]
*  And I said to them, what is the point in vaccinating children [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2297.04s)]
*  and then killing them in the evening with bombs [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2301.96s)]
*  and quadcopters that you're supplying? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2305.7999999999997s)]
*  Like, it makes no sense. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2308.6s)]
*  Is that not a dystopian world where, you know, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2310.3199999999997s)]
*  I stood on the balcony and I remember seeing the aid drops, you know, those parachutes [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2314.6s)]
*  with the thing. And it's so weird to see in real life. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2318.6000000000004s)]
*  It's like you're living in the Hunger Games. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2322.0800000000004s)]
*  And even today, that's killed someone, a Palestinian. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2324.1600000000003s)]
*  And several people have been killed by them. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2328.48s)]
*  Yeah. Hundreds. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2330.0800000000004s)]
*  And the thing is, it's like just open a border and do aid properly. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2331.04s)]
*  Why you make it's like they do tokenism, the tokenism, sending in some aid. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2337.6800000000003s)]
*  The one truck has gone in when Gaza prior to October 7th [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2343.28s)]
*  had 500 trucks going in every day. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2346.8799999999997s)]
*  It's it just. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2349.3999999999996s)]
*  I just can't I can't reconcile with the narrative that is happening right now. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2353.2s)]
*  And just finally, if there's one thing that you saw witness thought [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2359.12s)]
*  while you were there, which if there was someone, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2363.68s)]
*  I mean, we're talking about people who just aren't speaking out. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2366.48s)]
*  I mean, this is the problem, actually. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2368.6s)]
*  If you look at the polling, most people think Israel is committing war crimes. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2370.68s)]
*  Most people think Benjamin Netanyahu should be arrested for war crimes. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2374.16s)]
*  Fifty five percent, according to you, Govind Grint. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2377.04s)]
*  So in that sense, the battle for public opinion is is won on the kind of headline [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2379.16s)]
*  figures, but that doesn't mean people are speaking out or doing what they could. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2383.2799999999997s)]
*  So if there's one thing that you just in Gaza, your experience, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2386.88s)]
*  you know, that you know, I know a lot of this is just I can't even. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2391.04s)]
*  I feel constant rage and, you know, I haven't been there. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2395.52s)]
*  So what would you say to people to kind of like, please, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2399.44s)]
*  just grab them by the labels? [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2402.48s)]
*  This is what I went through. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2404.04s)]
*  This is what I saw. This is what I heard. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2404.92s)]
*  Even if it's about reminding people about the humanity of the people [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2406.68s)]
*  who are suffering unimaginable horror. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2409.52s)]
*  I don't I don't I don't know, because it's so big. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2414.16s)]
*  It's so, so big. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2419.12s)]
*  But all I'd say is. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2422.0s)]
*  I used to wake up every morning and stand on the balcony [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2426.0s)]
*  and it overlooked onto the morgue. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2429.88s)]
*  And I know how the night had been by how many people were at the morgue. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2433.2400000000002s)]
*  And every day for 30 days, I saw at least 10 to 15 funerals. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2437.7200000000003s)]
*  And some of the shrouds were very, very small and little. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2444.2000000000003s)]
*  And people were carrying it. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2448.8s)]
*  And that was every day. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2450.2400000000002s)]
*  And I can't explain what seeing that. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2453.2400000000002s)]
*  Those children would be alive. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2460.28s)]
*  And actually, there's one story, and I've said it. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2461.92s)]
*  One of my friends, his family were killed. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2464.92s)]
*  He's a surgeon. He's operating. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2467.44s)]
*  His family were completely [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2469.36s)]
*  a strike hit their house. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2472.4s)]
*  He lost his wife, lost his two children. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2474.44s)]
*  That happened in July. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2476.84s)]
*  If we'd had a ceasefire in January, his family would be alive. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2478.4s)]
*  And I just think if we had [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2482.36s)]
*  if someone had listened to us, if someone if we'd [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2486.28s)]
*  worked harder, if we'd done more and we'd had a ceasefire earlier, [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2489.2s)]
*  how many lives would we have saved? [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2492.8s)]
*  And I and I and I just think every day. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2496.12s)]
*  And that's why we talk to journalists, right? [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2499.76s)]
*  Because we think that who's going to be the one person [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2501.76s)]
*  that listens to one story from us and makes this all stop. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2504.96s)]
*  And I can't give you one story because that would be disservice [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2510.32s)]
*  to the whole population. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2513.8s)]
*  Anyone you speak to has had hurt and pain. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2515.48s)]
*  Our security guy was in an airstrike. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2519.36s)]
*  He woke up 48 hours later with a rat trying to eat his ankle [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2523.04s)]
*  because they thought it was dead. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2527.88s)]
*  And his two friends were being eaten by dogs. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2529.84s)]
*  My friend has been arrested and. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2532.76s)]
*  Horrifically treated, he's got marks on his arms. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2536.84s)]
*  He doesn't sleep now. He can't sleep. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2540.56s)]
*  So, you know, the psychological terror of what he's gone through. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2543.52s)]
*  One of my friends and if it's all right with you, [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2547.6s)]
*  I just want to read one text that one of my friends [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2549.56s)]
*  sent me yesterday. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2553.24s)]
*  And he said this. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2555.2s)]
*  So I am not afraid for myself more than I'm afraid for my mother, father and family. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2556.96s)]
*  This war is devastating, full of stories and tales. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2562.7599999999998s)]
*  If we stay alive, we will need global libraries to record [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2565.7599999999998s)]
*  what we saw in this devastating war. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2569.08s)]
*  You feel like there's a rock on your heart because you feel death every moment [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2571.32s)]
*  and you think about the unknown every moment. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2575.44s)]
*  How will I die? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2578.1200000000003s)]
*  Will the stones of the house fall on my body? [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2579.4s)]
*  Will I become pieces? [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2581.88s)]
*  Will the rescue teams be able to find my body? [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2583.6000000000004s)]
*  How will I die? [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2586.32s)]
*  We ask ourselves these questions every day, not because we're afraid of death. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2587.92s)]
*  On the contrary, because we when we want to die and become a martyr [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2592.0s)]
*  in an ethical way. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2596.6000000000004s)]
*  You know, and he's a 20 year old guy [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2599.7200000000003s)]
*  who was a displaced person who was just living outside our room [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2603.84s)]
*  and helped look after the bathroom when we needed to go. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2609.0800000000004s)]
*  But that's just just one person, right? [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2611.76s)]
*  And that's what they're asking. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2616.0400000000004s)]
*  How will I die? [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2617.96s)]
*  Just beyond words. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2622.1200000000003s)]
*  Well, those words of his certainly eloquent. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2624.2400000000002s)]
*  Beyond, you know, I don't know, the horror you've seen, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2628.4s)]
*  but that they experience on a daily basis is almost just impossible [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2632.48s)]
*  for us here to fully realize. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2637.64s)]
*  But but we have to and we have to we have to act on what you've said so eloquently. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2639.36s)]
*  I mean, you say, you know, you have to do your best speaking to journalists. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2643.96s)]
*  And the truth is, the Western media across the board [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2647.6s)]
*  have facilitated this from day one. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2651.32s)]
*  They have failed to accurately present what is a great crime. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2653.44s)]
*  They failed to. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2657.8s)]
*  They've whitewash atrocities. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2659.8s)]
*  They've ignored atrocities. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2661.12s)]
*  They've ignored often the declared intent of Israeli leaders and officials from day one. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2662.4s)]
*  And it is a disgusting travesty that you go there and you see unspeakable horrors. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2667.96s)]
*  And then you get a pathetic letter in response from your own government, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2674.28s)]
*  which can't even engage in the reality of what you've seen. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2677.7200000000003s)]
*  But you spoke and just go on, so. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2681.72s)]
*  No, so one of my friends, Tanya Haj Hasan, she was on my first trip with me [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2683.8399999999997s)]
*  and she's recently been on CNN. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2688.92s)]
*  And what she said rings true that one day [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2691.2s)]
*  Western media will have to reckon about their place in this and misleading people. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2694.48s)]
*  And I don't think anyone could have said it better than her. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2701.4s)]
*  She she says that truly. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2704.4s)]
*  And I agree with you. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2707.04s)]
*  Well, I'll be honest. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2709.6s)]
*  I promise you this. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2710.6s)]
*  There's some of us to have a grave who make sure that we pursue the Western media [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2711.7599999999998s)]
*  for what they've done, because as Palestinian after Palestinians told me, [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2716.4s)]
*  this would not have been possible, including the sort of their families [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2719.88s)]
*  without what the Western media have done. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2723.24s)]
*  And they have to be held to account. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2725.72s)]
*  I would note that journalists in the Rwandan genocide were prosecuted. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2728.6s)]
*  And anyone should, I think, very carefully read the UN [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2732.4s)]
*  genocide convention of 1948, which has five crimes. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2735.72s)]
*  And that includes complicity in genocide and public incitement of genocide. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2739.0s)]
*  But yeah, I can assure you for those few journalists who actually did speak out, [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2744.04s)]
*  the Western media has to be pursued, the guilty men, women of this genocide. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2747.64s)]
*  That includes the Western media, includes people here. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2752.32s)]
*  And they have to be held to account. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2754.44s)]
*  And your testimony is crucial to that. So important. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2755.44s)]
*  So, you know, to all those listening, please share this video. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2759.04s)]
*  Make sure it gets out. Press [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2761.84s)]
*  leave comments because that's good for the algorithm is more people. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2764.44s)]
*  And press like more people than watch the video. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2767.28s)]
*  Share. That's what we need. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2769.2s)]
*  And I just want to say on behalf of everyone who would have watched or listened to this. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2770.88s)]
*  It's been such a privilege. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2777.6s)]
*  Thank you so much for sharing this with us. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2779.2s)]
*  And I hope listening to this, this encourages people to speak up more. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2780.68s)]
*  So thank you so much. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2783.8s)]
*  Thank you. Very kind. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwMXoRLYtCE&t=2785.2s)]
