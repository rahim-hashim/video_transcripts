# Jewish Writer Exposes Antisemitism Truths - And Destroys Lies Of Pro-Israel Far Right
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [February 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I)
*  So, I mean, how do we have that kind of New York's conversation where we talk, for example, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=0.0s)]
*  about the pros of a lobby without falling into those tropes? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's something that we are still figuring out how to navigate that, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=6.2s)]
*  because it is really hard when there is APAC operating in such an overt way, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  in such an anti-democratic way. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  So this is an interview which is way overdue. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=19.8s)]
*  I've been meaning to do this for a very long time with the brilliant Rachel Shabney, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=23.52s)]
*  who really is such a great voice of moral clarity, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=27.44s)]
*  someone who, well, just one of these people I kind of look to, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=32.08s)]
*  I guess, for guidance, leadership, no pressure, don't mess up. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=35.52s)]
*  And she's written a brilliant book, which is called Off White, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=40.6s)]
*  The Truth About Anti-Semitism, which, frankly, could not be more timely in so many ways. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=44.2s)]
*  It's such a book of, you know, it's sharp. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  It's full of nuance. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=54.88s)]
*  It's challenging. It's educational. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=59.080000000000005s)]
*  It's obviously deeply informed. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=62.040000000000006s)]
*  And it's a really, really brilliant, excellent book in so, so many ways, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=64.64s)]
*  which I think if everyone needs to read, and I think everyone will be so educated [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=69.8s)]
*  and, I guess, armed, you know, I think that's the best a book of this sort can do, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=75.16s)]
*  kind of arm people with the ability to understand the world, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=81.08s)]
*  better. And that is particularly important. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=84.72s)]
*  The times we live in, the age of the rise of fascism, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=87.28s)]
*  fascism's back, I'm afraid, guys, of genocide. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=90.88s)]
*  Of course, Israel's genocide against the Palestinian people and of, you know, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=94.2s)]
*  and growing, the general growing of all different forms of racism, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=98.36s)]
*  including anti-Semitism, including, of course, Islamophobia. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=104.16s)]
*  We could go on. It is a gruesome time we live in. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=107.44s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=109.88s)]
*  Hey, Rachel, with that cheery introduction, that was a roller coaster. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=112.67999999999999s)]
*  How are you? So cheerful. How are you? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=115.6s)]
*  It's really great to see you and thanks for having me on. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=118.32s)]
*  It is always great. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  We were talking before about my ADHD and dopamine, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=122.28s)]
*  and I would say you're a dopamine hit. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=125.36s)]
*  So thank you for seeing you, my dopamine. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=127.52s)]
*  If you could see a graph of my dopamine. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=130.16s)]
*  Whoo, that's you. So thank you. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=132.28s)]
*  That might be one of the nicest things anyone's ever said. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=135.84s)]
*  Thank you. That's lovely. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=138.72s)]
*  I need to call people. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=140.32s)]
*  Maybe you got a dopamine hit out of that. So it's contagious. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=141.44s)]
*  It's like a virtuous circle, isn't it? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=143.84s)]
*  It is. It's a big dopamine feedback loop. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=146.72s)]
*  I want to start. Let's start with you, because the personal is political. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=150.4s)]
*  And I want to talk about the fact that you're the daughter of Iraqi Jewish parents. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=153.4s)]
*  You were born in Israel. You grew up in Britain. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  That brings together quite a lot of interesting experiences, I would say. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=164.56s)]
*  So I want to know how do you think your heritage has and your upbringing [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=169.36s)]
*  and those different experiences, how do you think that's influenced [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=174.32000000000002s)]
*  your understanding of anti-Semitism and of racism? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=176.72s)]
*  Yeah, thanks for the question. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=181.8s)]
*  I did. I'm really grateful to my parents because I did learn a lot about [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=184.88000000000002s)]
*  the world and geopolitics and lots of other things [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=192.32000000000002s)]
*  through them and through hearing their experiences. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=197.84s)]
*  So exactly as you say, they both Iraqi, reached adulthood in Iraq. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=200.88s)]
*  And then I don't think they would self-define as Zionists. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=207.6s)]
*  We can get to definitions, but they didn't arrive to Israel in that context. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=211.76s)]
*  They were part of a mass exodus of Jewish people who left Iraq in the early 50s. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=217.35999999999999s)]
*  And that was a time where Israel was formed and pioneered, if you like, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=223.04000000000002s)]
*  by European Jewish people who are escaping or fleeing or responding to [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=230.88000000000002s)]
*  anti-Semitism that was rampant and continuous in Europe, but also brought with them [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=238.08s)]
*  European concepts of essentially a nationalism premised on superiority. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=243.68s)]
*  And obviously the impact for Palestinians of that has been, from the start, utterly devastating. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=249.52s)]
*  And at the same time, for Jews who came from Muslim and Arab countries, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=256.48s)]
*  which actually is the majority of Jewish people in Israel, they experienced that also [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=260.64s)]
*  as a discrimination, as an erasure of cultural identity in a country that wanted to be European. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=265.68s)]
*  It's like, yeah, we're in the Middle East, but we're European. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=272.8s)]
*  In fact, we're a vanguard of Europe, as so many Israeli leaders described. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=275.44s)]
*  And it produced a sort of whitewashing, an erasure of Arab Jews, like my parents, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=282.64s)]
*  and consigned and created a socioeconomic class of Arab Jews that were lower as a product of all those [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=289.36s)]
*  low expectations premised by prejudice that resulted in unequal distribution of economic resources. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=301.2s)]
*  So on top of that, they then came to the UK in the 70s. I was born in Israel, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=309.67999999999995s)]
*  arrived in the UK as a toddler, and was raised in a market town where, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=317.2s)]
*  I mean, there wasn't really much of anyone who wasn't white, sort of Anglo-white. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=323.6s)]
*  And so we just showed up as some kind of category error. It's like, well, you're Jewish, but you're [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=331.12s)]
*  Iraqi, you speak Arabic, but you're Jewish, don't know what to make of you. So that was my experience [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=336.8s)]
*  in my formative years to the extent that, you know, I look back now and I don't know what it is that [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=345.28000000000003s)]
*  people responded to. I can say that for other members of my family, yeah, they did experience [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=350.48s)]
*  antisemitism. I think my parents experienced, you know, anti-Arabism. And it's hard to know what [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=354.88s)]
*  that, what people were responding to when you have that many hyphens in your name. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=364.56s)]
*  So I'm a product of all of that. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=370.16s)]
*  I mean, it's interesting because your book is called Off White. And what that, I guess, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=373.6s)]
*  what that does tap into is what is whiteness and how whiteness is constructed. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=379.12s)]
*  And it's quite interesting because I think a lot of people, particularly younger generations, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=384.56s)]
*  would find, for example, this kind of quite a crazy concept to get their head around, which is, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=388.15999999999997s)]
*  as an example, Irish people. And Irish people were once racialized as being excluded from the [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=394.0s)]
*  concept of whiteness. And obviously you had British colonialism, which inflicted horrors on the [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=399.76s)]
*  Irish people. And colonialism always justifies itself as the inferiority of the colonized. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=404.88s)]
*  And Irish were often portrayed as subhuman. And, you know, but then now the Irish people, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=412.64s)]
*  I mean, again, it's complicated, but often absorbed into whiteness. And I think a lot of people would [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=418.15999999999997s)]
*  find the concept of Irish people not being white completely. But that shows, doesn't it, is how [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=421.92s)]
*  whiteness is constructed. And I'm interested because obviously with Jewish people, antisemitism [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=426.15999999999997s)]
*  very much excluded them from the concept of whiteness. And now today, you'll often, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=431.44s)]
*  you know, you'll get Israel presented as, as you mentioned, but Israel's found us by the far right, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=437.6s)]
*  which will come onto you, but as a kind of vanguard of European white civilization. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=443.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=447.12s)]
*  I'm just interested, so tell me about the Jewish experience of whiteness and what that tells us [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=447.84s)]
*  about how whiteness is constructed. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=452.08s)]
*  I mean, what it tells us about whiteness, first and foremost, is that it's a nonsense. Because [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=454.72s)]
*  the idea that Jewish people kind of were, for most of history, categorized as not white. And in [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=460.96s)]
*  the post-World War, Second World War, post-Holocaust period, categorized as white and actually [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=468.32s)]
*  absorbed into whiteness, welcomed into it, and invited to uphold its structures, including [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=474.4s)]
*  racism against other people. What that tells us, that whole story, is that the categories are bunk, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=481.44s)]
*  right? And we can see that as well. In the experiences of Irish people, we can see the [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=487.68s)]
*  nonsense of those categories quite explicitly also. When you look at the history of [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=495.36s)]
*  Jewish people, I mean, it's not the same racism. Racism against black and brown people, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=502.08s)]
*  the whole idea of race was invented by Christian Europeans in order to [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=510.0s)]
*  enslave and colonize and demonize and persecute and treat people, justify treating people in the most [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=516.64s)]
*  horrendous ways for centuries and continuing into this day in structural racism. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=524.0s)]
*  It was a different category that Christian Europeans invented for Jewish people being not [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=531.04s)]
*  white. And that's where we get into the difference of what antisemitism is, which is essentially a [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=538.72s)]
*  conspiracy about powers, elevating some people within a group of Jewish people and giving them [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=543.6800000000001s)]
*  just enough status, just enough power so that they can be used as a punch bag in moments of crisis by [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=549.6s)]
*  those actually in power. It's a giant misdirection device. But when you look at the histories of [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=555.28s)]
*  racism and antisemitism, what you see is that one influences the other, that it's always Christian [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=561.44s)]
*  Europeans who are inventing these structures of prejudice for different reasons at different times, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=568.56s)]
*  but they're actually cribbing notes, like racism cribs notes from antisemitism and then it gets [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=574.16s)]
*  passed back and forth. With colonialism, it's quite interesting, well, with slavery as well, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=579.4399999999999s)]
*  it's quite astonishing when you think about it, that slavery in the United States ended only two [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=587.4399999999999s)]
*  lifetimes away. It's not actually that far. But the sense of antisemitism, which goes back [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=590.64s)]
*  2000 years in Europe, how it laid the foundations for, it was a foreshadow of, or it was taken, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=596.64s)]
*  the concepts for colonial forms of racism, the othering that took place because there was already [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=605.68s)]
*  a prototype. Exactly that. There was already a prototype long before people would be talking about [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=611.76s)]
*  even labeling antisemitism as such, or even talking about race and racism. They created [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=618.88s)]
*  an architecture of racism in medieval Europe in the way that they persecuted and demonized [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=625.52s)]
*  Jewish people. The architecture essentially by which they did that traveled across the oceans [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=631.68s)]
*  to the Americas, where it was used, the exact same sort of premises were used to create racism [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=642.56s)]
*  against black and brown people for this horrendous enslavement and colonialism that, as you say, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=650.4s)]
*  I mean, it's carried on for generation after generation after generation and has only in [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=656.48s)]
*  recent history come to a halt. And then it bounces back again. So you can see when Hitler was trying [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=661.76s)]
*  to find a third Reich, were trying to find ways to demonize Jewish people. They looked to the Jim [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=668.48s)]
*  Crow rules of essentially maintaining white supremacy post slavery in the U.S. They looked [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=675.04s)]
*  at those rules and went, Oh, maybe we could use those because America is a supposedly a democracy, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=680.56s)]
*  but it's still racist. So maybe we can use that same system. In the end, they went for something [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=686.64s)]
*  slightly different, but you could see the way that one is constantly drawing influence from the other [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=692.3199999999999s)]
*  throughout history. It's just showing kind of nature of again, of I guess, you know, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=699.76s)]
*  what is white, what is not, because the Nazis were in alliance with Imperial Japan. So they sent [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=708.64s)]
*  pseudo scientists to establish the Japanese as a long lost Aryan tribe. It's quite interesting. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=713.28s)]
*  Yeah. So I mean, in terms of, yeah, I guess, you know, when the left today often talk about [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=719.84s)]
*  systemic racism, it's often this idea of prejudice plus power and this look at systemic racism in [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=730.08s)]
*  terms of who is more, who is arrested, who is more in poverty, unemployed, suffering because of the [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=736.08s)]
*  economic system, who is more likely to be incarcerated. And that can therefore, you know, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=741.84s)]
*  exclude the idea or a lack of understanding of antisemitism. So can you talk about that and why [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=749.12s)]
*  that can lead to blind spots, but actually why obviously it's important to build that solidarity [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=756.16s)]
*  against all forms of racism? Yeah, I think that's a really important question precisely so that we [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=763.28s)]
*  can actually understand and tease out that there are differences. And there's huge caveats. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=768.48s)]
*  Jewish people, black and brown and Jewish people of color will have a very different experience. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=777.2s)]
*  People who are visibly showing up as Jewish for either religious or cultural reasons will have a [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=783.2s)]
*  very different experience. And there was a survey a few years ago that was the most sort of widespread [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=788.32s)]
*  survey about racism that did find that Jewish people were coming high in categories of structural [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=794.64s)]
*  discrimination in areas like education and housing and health. However, all of that is true. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=802.72s)]
*  And at the same time, I think it's fair to say that by and large, you know, Jewish people who [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=809.76s)]
*  show up look like me are not going to be dealing with structural and systemic discrimination from [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=816.72s)]
*  the moment they leave their house. We're not going to encounter discrimination in things like [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=823.28s)]
*  housing and health care and all the systems, policing. I'm not going to get followed around [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=830.72s)]
*  a store. All the systems and including all the weird prejudices that people are projecting onto [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=837.04s)]
*  black and brown skin all the time, every day, all day, every day. That's not going to be the [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=844.56s)]
*  experience with all those caveats that we looked at in the beginning. But that's largely because [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=850.72s)]
*  of two things. First of all, Jewish people were absorbed into the category of whiteness [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=858.4s)]
*  post-second world war. We can look into why and how that happened, i.e. it was just as much about what [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=863.0400000000001s)]
*  Western powers needed from that equation. Well, the other thing is that [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=870.96s)]
*  the whole point of antisemitism is that it is a conspiracy about power. So it's not going to show [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=875.36s)]
*  up in the same way. The whole point of it is a misdirection. It's a conspiracy of who actually [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=882.5600000000001s)]
*  is pulling the strings, controlling the world, controlling governments. And so by its nature, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=889.76s)]
*  actually, Jewish people would need to be privileged. You would have to be privileged in order to be [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=898.48s)]
*  privileged in order to be running some sort of conspiratorial power racket. So that accounts for [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=904.32s)]
*  why it looks different and why a binary black-white analysis of racism, which we absolutely need to [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=910.96s)]
*  understand structural and systemic racism that continues to play out to this day, it only gets [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=918.56s)]
*  us so far. And it does disconnect antisemitism from our understanding of racism and our [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=924.48s)]
*  a potentially universal approach to anti-racism. I mean, this is what is interesting with, I mean, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=932.0799999999999s)]
*  we'll talk obviously more about Israel and Palestine, but you sometimes get this, it [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=937.92s)]
*  circulates online, like Israel owns America, and it kind of taps into that. When it actually [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=943.92s)]
*  completely gets it the wrong way around. So Joe Biden, when he was a senator, famously said in [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=948.16s)]
*  1986, if there were not an Israel, we'd have to invent it. And he talked about how it was the best, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=952.3199999999999s)]
*  however many billions the US spends on Israel, the best investment the US could make. I mean, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=957.52s)]
*  the point is, that's the point. The US is the hegemony, the US is a superpower that is largely [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=962.64s)]
*  run by white Christians. And it sees Israel as a useful strategic vehicle, rather than the story [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=968.8s)]
*  here about the relationships between the US and Israel being somehow, you know, it's Israel and [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=975.76s)]
*  the United States. You know, that's such a great point. I'm really glad you mentioned that, because [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=980.24s)]
*  I think, you know, this is a big part of what we're seeing today. And we know that criticism of [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=984.64s)]
*  Israel is not, you know, by definition, anti-Semitism, anti-Zionism does not equal [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=991.6s)]
*  anti-Semitism. And we can, we can go into that a little bit as well. At the same time, when it does [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=997.76s)]
*  show up in criticism of Israel, it's showing up because of those embedded [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1004.88s)]
*  conspiratorial thinking that is part of anti-Semitism, that is just a feature of Christian [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1012.08s)]
*  European societies. It's deeply wired into our societies, because it's been around for, you know, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1018.08s)]
*  as you say, thousands of years, 2000 years. So when it shows up, that's why it's showing up. But [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1022.88s)]
*  absolutely, when you look at Joe Biden, and also the UK, you know, they could just say, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1029.44s)]
*  you know what, we're supporting Israel in this extreme way. We're giving them financial, military, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1036.32s)]
*  and diplomatic cover all the way to do the most unspeakable things to Palestinians, up to and [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1043.1999999999998s)]
*  including a war that leading human rights organizations and genocide experts have described as [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1049.1999999999998s)]
*  genocide. We're doing all that because Israel is an ally. It's geopolitically useful to us. It's a [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1054.72s)]
*  foothold in the Middle East. There's military, security, intel, all kinds of advantages in that [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1061.36s)]
*  alliance, and that's why we're doing it. They're not going to say that for the same reason that [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1068.7199999999998s)]
*  they're not going to say, hey, guys, imperialism is alive and well, thanks for the reality check. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1073.52s)]
*  They're not going to say that. But instead, they say, you know, right to self-defense, and [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1078.32s)]
*  and it does, therefore, fuel this idea of, wait a minute, why does Israel get to do whatever the [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1084.8000000000002s)]
*  hell it wants? Why is Joe Biden saying, boo hoo hoo, I tried to stop Israel, but I just can't, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1090.5600000000002s)]
*  as though he couldn't have stopped it with a phone call. Why is Jewish safety deemed to come [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1097.0400000000002s)]
*  at the expense of not just Palestinian safety, but the right of Palestinians to not experience [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1102.64s)]
*  this ongoing daily violence? And those questions are going to potentially feed into conspiratorial [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1110.0s)]
*  frames of understanding, a misdirection of where the power lies, and this idea that Israel is [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1118.56s)]
*  somehow directing Western foreign policy, as opposed to being a client state, first and [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1124.8s)]
*  foremost, of the US. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1132.96s)]
*  So, I mean, how do we have that kind of New York's conversation where we talk, for example, about, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1134.16s)]
*  take AIPAC, AIPAC being the main pro-Israel lobby in the United States, which is obviously very [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1137.6000000000001s)]
*  well funded and is spoken about thereby, obviously, they try to get rid of, you know, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1144.48s)]
*  Congress people who are Democrats who have shown solidarity with the Palestinian people. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1148.5600000000002s)]
*  We talk about the pro-Israel lobby without falling into those tropes. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1154.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's something that we are still figuring out how to navigate that, because it is [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1157.4399999999998s)]
*  really hard when there is AIPAC operating in such an overt way, in such an anti-democratic way in the [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1162.6399999999999s)]
*  US, where it is actually taking out candidates, taking out like from the election, but in a [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1170.7199999999998s)]
*  gangster way. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1177.9199999999998s)]
*  Well, the way things are going, who knows, eh? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1178.9599999999998s)]
*  They're using sometimes funding that's coming from Republicans, Republican donors, in order to do [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1181.2s)]
*  that. And if that's not anti-democratic, I don't know what is. Our complaint there is with the idea [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1187.1200000000001s)]
*  of any lobby, the Israel lobby, the farmer lobby, any lobby, having the ability to, you know, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1194.56s)]
*  to exert that much influence on democracy in a fundamentally undemocratic way. That's about [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1203.2s)]
*  money, any money, distorting politics. But at the same time, you know, we do have, I think we do [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1206.72s)]
*  need a frame of analysis that says actually, who is the right person to do that? And I think that [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1214.56s)]
*  is something that we need to be able to do. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1222.16s)]
*  And at the same time, you know, we do have, I think we do need a frame of analysis that says [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1224.72s)]
*  actually, who is it that holds the power in this dynamic? Whatever AIPAC is actively doing and or [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1232.16s)]
*  boasting about doing, why is this still carrying on? Why is American foreign policy such as it is? [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1238.96s)]
*  And, you know, I do think many people who talk about the Middle East, who talk about Israel-Palestine, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1246.3200000000002s)]
*  do have this important geopolitical context of, you know, Israel is the client's day. But I don't [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1251.04s)]
*  think we do it enough. I think part of the reason we don't do it enough is precisely because [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1257.44s)]
*  there's such an urgent, the anti-democratic nature of it is so urgent. I think the other reason is [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1263.92s)]
*  that so many people are being hit in real material ways by accusations of anti-Semitism and, you know, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1270.8s)]
*  AIPAC and these other organizations are at the heart of the source of so many of these accusations. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1280.24s)]
*  And people are losing like careers and livelihoods and reputations by these fake accusations of [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1286.16s)]
*  anti-Semitism, like the stress of having to deal with these claims, sometimes legally. And that's [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1294.0s)]
*  taking up all of our bandwidth because we have to push back at that to the extent that there's [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1301.2s)]
*  actually nothing left over to talk about anti-Semitism in a constructive way and also [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1306.0s)]
*  bring in much more of this geopolitical analysis that we need that will build a firewall against, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1313.2s)]
*  you know, anti-Semitism coming into our movements. Which is why we need systemic analysis, not [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1319.44s)]
*  conspiratorial analysis. And conspiratorial analysis always ends up anti-Semitism. Just [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1324.08s)]
*  something to pick up on. So you mentioned this about how anti-Zionism is construed as anti-Semitism [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1329.2s)]
*  up to and including an attempt which has clearly accelerated since the genocide began to exclude [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1335.04s)]
*  anti-Zionist, non-Zionist Jews from the category of Jewishness altogether. And you saw there was a [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1342.0s)]
*  quite, I think it was the former editor of Jerusalem Post, something like this, who wrote a [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1347.36s)]
*  hideous editorial which attempted to basically excommunicate Jewish people who objected to [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1353.76s)]
*  murdering Palestinians. What's your response to that when you hear anti-Zionism, and that is, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1360.96s)]
*  the people will put it as bluntly as that, anti-Zionism is, I can't speak, anti-Zionism is [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1366.56s)]
*  anti-Semitism. That's what they'll say. And they'll include that, they'll include Jewish people in that. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1371.12s)]
*  What's your response to that? Yeah, you know, you raise such an important area here and all that talk [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1376.08s)]
*  always reminds me of Rudy Giuliani, who's like the, who's the former attorney to Trump. And at [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1383.2s)]
*  one point he said about George Soros, the Jewish billionaire philanthropist, Giuliani, the Roman [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1390.56s)]
*  Catholic said, well, Soros isn't really Jewish. I'm more Jewish than he is. And I'm like, oh, wow, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1398.48s)]
*  that's like the peak. That's the peak of where this goes, where Jewish is essentially an ideology [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1403.76s)]
*  that a Roman Catholic can have, but a Jewish person is denied. You know, that's really sort [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1410.64s)]
*  of through the looking glass. The thing about it is that it doesn't actually reflect the polling. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1416.88s)]
*  So when we look at the latest from the Institute for Jewish Policy Research, it is true that a [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1423.36s)]
*  majority of British Jews do still describe themselves as Zionists, self-describe. We don't [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1428.56s)]
*  really know for certainty what is going on there. I mean, when a Palestinian talks about Zionism, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1436.16s)]
*  clearly they're talking about a European Jewish ideology of settler colonialism. This is [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1442.5600000000002s)]
*  settler colonialism and their experience of that has been from the start, ethnic cleansing, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1450.4s)]
*  dispossession, exile, violence, ongoing daily violence of a military occupation, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1457.2s)]
*  the ongoing daily violence of an apartheid system of rule, so described by leading human rights [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1466.0800000000002s)]
*  organizations, including Israeli ones, and now a horrific genocidal war. It's not clear, and it's [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1472.0s)]
*  probably worth checking that people who are self-defining as Zionists in the UK [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1481.28s)]
*  are basically saying, oh yeah, I'm okay with all of that, right? We don't know what's going on [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1486.24s)]
*  there in self-definition. It could just mean I support a Jewish homeland or the Jewish right [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1492.3999999999999s)]
*  to self-determination. However, it does leave 30% of the population in Britain of Jewish people who [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1497.92s)]
*  self-define as anti-Zionist or non-Zionist, and that figure goes up to 51% amongst younger cohorts, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1506.08s)]
*  so 18 to 29-year-olds, I think it is. Now, that is not a fringe, right? That is a huge political [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1512.96s)]
*  constituency that is not given really adequate or commensurate representation. It's certainly not [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1520.96s)]
*  represented by British Jewish communal organizations who do not reflect that, and it absolutely is not [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1529.28s)]
*  reflected in our mainstream political and media conversation, where this huge percentage are just [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1536.0s)]
*  not showing up in a way that you would expect, given the percentage. And it's interesting, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1544.64s)]
*  in America, what's happened, I mean America's got a much bigger Jewish population, I mean there's [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1552.0s)]
*  same number of Jews in the United States as there is in Israel, basically, and there, I mean a poll, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1556.88s)]
*  which was done, I should say, by a right-wing think tank in the middle of last year, so a long [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1563.6s)]
*  time ago actually now showed 30% of Jewish Americans thought Israel was committing genocide, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1568.0s)]
*  which rose to 40% amongst those under 45. So there's a shift going on, isn't there? [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1573.6s)]
*  I think it's a really significant shift for British populations in the diaspora, generally. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1580.9599999999998s)]
*  We see it in a pronounced way in the U.S., as you say, the Jewish population there is larger, more [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1588.72s)]
*  confident, very much absorbed into whiteness in a very overt way in the post-World War era. I think [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1595.68s)]
*  there are specificities that make that story slightly different in the UK and also other [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1605.1200000000001s)]
*  parts of Europe, but the point remains, as you say, we are looking at a significant fracturing [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1609.68s)]
*  of diaspora Jewish communities because, I mean, it was happening anyway, it was certainly happening [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1615.92s)]
*  over the last couple of decades as Israel has become more and more overtly right-wing, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1623.2s)]
*  ethno-nationalist, more and more violent in its manifestation of that, violent towards Palestinians, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1631.6s)]
*  so that has been a trend, but the last 15 months have really accelerated it, obviously, because [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1639.68s)]
*  people are so appalled by what's happening in Gaza, by this genocidal war and the terrorizing [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1646.0800000000002s)]
*  of Palestinians that we've been seeing on our screens, and that has had a significant impact. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1652.64s)]
*  And again, I don't think that discussion is particularly being reflected or the way that [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1658.8s)]
*  it's not really showing up in our political mainstream. There's something I want to ask [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1663.3600000000001s)]
*  before I talk about Israel and Palestine at the moment, and the far right and their relationship [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1668.24s)]
*  there, but I think it's such an egregious example, which I guess has wider implications and things. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1674.32s)]
*  I just want to hear your thoughts on it, which is Germany, the German state, and my favorite, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1681.44s)]
*  I'm disentangling the German people, the German state here, just to be clear, but [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1687.76s)]
*  they can sit down. So just shut up. But in Germany, there's this phenomenon where [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1691.52s)]
*  Jewish Germans have been disproportionately targeted for speaking out against the genocide in [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1700.32s)]
*  Gaza, and in fact, you've got, I'll just give you two examples, one of an Israeli German who said [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1706.24s)]
*  that I'm literally being called anti-Semitic by the grandchildren of SS officers. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1715.6799999999998s)]
*  Another is Yuval Abraham, for example, who is a brilliant Israeli journalist who's done so much [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1721.52s)]
*  to expose the horrors that are already taking place. People should read Plus 972 Magazine, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1726.1599999999999s)]
*  which is an Israeli-Palestinian outlet, which has done incredible stuff on the horrors going on at [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1730.24s)]
*  the moment. And he's done this film with a Palestinian about the West Bank, the Israeli attacks [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1734.32s)]
*  on his community. And he went to Berlin, did a speech, and then German politicians, [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1742.24s)]
*  who were not Jewish, called him anti-Semitic, to the extent where he was enveloped in death threats. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1747.1200000000001s)]
*  It's just so Orwellian, you know, it's like the world turned its head. So I'm just interested in, [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1751.76s)]
*  yeah, just that as an example. Good old Germany. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1756.24s)]
*  I mean, it's horrific. It's horrific. And the lack of self-reflection in reaching that point, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1760.64s)]
*  right, where the German state has reached that point where that's the outcome for an Israeli [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1767.8400000000001s)]
*  Jewish person, and just the lack of self-reflection over that. I mean, it seems to me that [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1774.4s)]
*  there is a great irony going on here. And this is something that the far right taps into because [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1782.88s)]
*  it ticks all their races and boxes all at the same time, which is, you know, part of the absorption [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1788.0800000000002s)]
*  of Jewish people into whiteness as it's, you know, that absorption into whiteness has become a term. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1795.2s)]
*  Part of that in the Second World War period was premised on this thing of Judeo-Christian values. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1802.0s)]
*  It was something that was spouted a lot. The US president at the time, Eisenhower, talked about [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1808.96s)]
*  it a lot. And then in the decades since, everybody talks about it. You know, Macron has talked about [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1813.44s)]
*  it. Tony Blair used to talk about it. And where we come to Germany, it's like two German chancellors [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1820.16s)]
*  also talked about how Germany was founded on Judeo, built on the foundations of a Judeo-Christian [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1826.48s)]
*  heritage. Which, you know, you're like, you're seriously going to say that, Germany. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1833.92s)]
*  Martin Luther's got one of three things to say about that, hasn't he? Anyway. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1839.68s)]
*  One of a few things to say about that. But it's like, what exactly is the heritage and the tradition [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1842.5600000000002s)]
*  that we're talking about in Germany, right? For Jewish people. And so, but that sleight of hand [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1848.0s)]
*  has enabled all kinds of things, not least the demonization of Islam and Muslims. But what it [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1855.68s)]
*  also enables is for Germany to be able to say, well, we're not producing antisemitism. Where it [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1864.4s)]
*  happens, it comes from the immigrants who are from Muslim countries, predominantly. They're [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1871.12s)]
*  importing it into Germany. And I just feel like that spectacular lack of self-reflection and [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1878.2399999999998s)]
*  self-awareness is only going to fuel the far-right. You look at the popularity of the far-right AFD [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1885.12s)]
*  party in Germany, it's only going to go in that direction. And it just seems to me that that whole [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1891.12s)]
*  hyphen of Judeo-Christian not only is demonizing Islam, not only is erasing a centuries-long [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1898.0s)]
*  tradition, which is Judeo-Islamic, but is actually facilitating a lack of self-examination and a real [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1904.4s)]
*  connection and understanding of the legacy of antisemitism that Christian Europe produced. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1915.12s)]
*  And a real reckoning and accountability with that in a way that doesn't knee-jerk translate [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1924.0s)]
*  into support for Israel. That's not helpful for a gazillion reasons, but it's also not helpful [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1930.8s)]
*  when it comes to understanding antisemitism and the legacies of it and the imprint of it [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1938.0s)]
*  in Christian Europe. I mean, it's just, you know, a German-Iranian guy got in touch with me. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1944.72s)]
*  He fled Iran, he's gay, and he said he posted in support of a ceasefire and then was targeted by [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1951.52s)]
*  non-Jewish Germans who subjected him to horrendous racist abuse, go back to your shithole country, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1956.88s)]
*  saying Islamophobic, horrible stuff, and tried to pin an Israeli flag on the door of the shop he [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1961.92s)]
*  worked in. And it's just interesting because I spoke to a Jewish-German journalist, he said [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1967.3600000000001s)]
*  German nationalism, unlike, I mean, this is just, I'm just hearing you think about this, [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1973.6000000000001s)]
*  German nationalism, unlike other forms of nationalism, because it's base has got so [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1976.64s)]
*  discredited. It gets almost a permission slip from Israel to act out in ways which, [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1981.2s)]
*  you know, in France are seen as far more permissible, including kind of what you talk [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1990.88s)]
*  about, the kind of racist disciplining of, for example, Islamophobia, so which is, they're all [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=1997.0400000000002s)]
*  a bunch of antisemites, they're Muslims, which is why. I'm just interested in your thoughts on [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2002.0s)]
*  that, that just general thought of what he was talking about there. I mean, that sounds horrendous [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2006.16s)]
*  for him on a personal level, that just sounds absolutely appalling, that whole trajectory and [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2011.44s)]
*  where that ended up. And actually, I think there's a lot of Muslim and Arab communities in Germany [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2015.92s)]
*  who would have similar experiences in terms of just the racist way in which they're treated and [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2025.52s)]
*  how almost antisemitism is used against them because they're Muslim and Arab. And I think [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2033.68s)]
*  primarily, that is a horrendous situation for people experiencing it. At the same time, [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2042.4s)]
*  it produces this horrendous division between Muslims and Arabs on one side and Jewish people [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2048.0s)]
*  on the other side, notwithstanding the category of Arab Jew, of course. And it makes it look as though [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2056.32s)]
*  the end result of that is, if you are speaking out about antisemitism, if you are claiming [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2062.8s)]
*  performatively to tackle it, as the far right does, as Germany does, as Western leaders do, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2068.96s)]
*  and you're using it alongside your Islamophobia and your racism and your rampant anti-immigration [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2076.1600000000003s)]
*  policies, as we see across the board in the West, including Germany, if that's the case, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2085.2000000000003s)]
*  then what you've done is you've made tackling antisemitism actually look racist. You've made [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2090.24s)]
*  it look like a racist thing because it's not actually connected to a sort of universalist [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2097.6s)]
*  understanding of racism. It's also being used, claims of antisemitism, to give cover to the [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2103.68s)]
*  most appalling anti-Palestinian racism of Israel. And so we have to deal with that. We have to deal [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2112.24s)]
*  with that as progressive anti-racists. And what do we do in that environment where tackling [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2119.12s)]
*  antisemitism performatively is challenged by the right wing to the extent that it looks like a [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2125.2799999999997s)]
*  right wing thing and it is used to attack other racialized minorities? How do we operate as [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2132.08s)]
*  anti-racists who also want to tackle antisemitism? How do we operate in that space? [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2138.16s)]
*  I mean, Donald Trump's a really good example there because he said lots of clearly antisemitic [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2143.92s)]
*  things, including suggesting Jewish Americans are disloyal, and not least because Jewish [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2147.36s)]
*  Americans don't support Donald Trump overwhelmingly. Jewish Americans have never voted for a [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2154.0s)]
*  Republican candidate, a majority, and disproportionately it would be more progressive. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2159.1200000000003s)]
*  And at the same time, he will then denounce, for example, progressive politicians who have spoken [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2166.6400000000003s)]
*  out for Palestine as antisemites. And that is an interesting phenomenon because you get, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2173.36s)]
*  I mean, I sometimes get, as soon as I'm on Twitter, you get attacked by people as an antisemite and [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2178.6400000000003s)]
*  then you look at them, they've got stuff about like, save the whites and denounce Islam. And [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2181.76s)]
*  they're kind of like, war is happening here. But I mean, there is that phenomenon, isn't it, of [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2188.08s)]
*  the far right being both antisemitic. And there's a long tradition of antisemites for Israel. I mean, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2194.4s)]
*  Richard Nixon was a really good example of that, clearly pathologically antisemitic. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2199.84s)]
*  Kissinger, of course, who was Jewish, was his Secretary of State, but Kissinger would [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2206.08s)]
*  speak privately, kind of like, well, I'm not one of those Jews. It was really just grim stuff. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2211.2000000000003s)]
*  So what do you think about that? The kind of use of the way the far right talks about antisemitism [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2216.96s)]
*  when they are the heirs themselves of the people who are obviously extremely, well, antisemitic, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2220.6400000000003s)]
*  define them and they're still riddled with antisemitism? [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2224.96s)]
*  I mean, yeah, it's a grotesque affront and should be resisted in every way. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2227.84s)]
*  And at the same time, you look at it and you think, right, well, you've found yourself a perfect wedge, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2238.4s)]
*  haven't you? This pro-Israel antisemitism that they're doing essentially allows them to, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2244.0s)]
*  you know, it's the perfect cocktail of racism. It mobilizes every bit that they need to mobilize. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2252.3199999999997s)]
*  It places Israel in this clash of civilizations narrative that they absolutely love, where Israel [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2258.8799999999997s)]
*  is this European construct. And it has to be said that Israeli leaders in the past have certainly [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2266.08s)]
*  articulated past and present, certainly articulated in these terms, like a villa in the jungle, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2271.68s)]
*  the jungle being the supposedly uncivilized Arab world. So for them, it's like perfect clash [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2277.36s)]
*  of civilizations narrative. And it means that they get to demonize Islam and Muslims and migrants, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2286.4s)]
*  and at the same time, pretend to care about antisemitism and thereby rehabilitate their [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2297.28s)]
*  political fortunes by saying, hey, we're not antisemitic anymore. Look at us. Here's the [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2302.64s)]
*  picture of us shaking hands with Benjamin Netanyahu. We love Israel. Here's the Israeli flags. How can [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2309.04s)]
*  we possibly be antisemitic? So it rehabilitates these far-right antisemitic parties who have not [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2314.8799999999997s)]
*  just an antisemitic past, but contemporary versions, Holocaust revisionism, massive antisemitic [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2321.92s)]
*  election campaign run by Victor Orban involving George Soros, who we spoke about earlier. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2328.56s)]
*  They get to rehabilitate themselves, mainline their primary ideology at the moment, which is [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2334.88s)]
*  Islamophobia, racism, and migrant bashing. And they get to do it all while performatively claiming [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2341.04s)]
*  to speak for Jewish people and to care about Jewish people. And the whole thing is just such [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2348.72s)]
*  a disgusting cocktail. It has to be said that some Jewish people, notably you look at communities in [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2353.04s)]
*  France, are attracted to that. And we have to look at that and look at the reasons why. But at the [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2360.24s)]
*  same time, we also have to remember that the far-right who are claiming to care about Jewish [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2369.6s)]
*  people are not actually tackling antisemitism either. They're just pretending to. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2375.84s)]
*  I've got some empathy there, which is, I think, I can't remember which election it is, but a third [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2381.52s)]
*  of gay French couples, married gay couples or something, voted for the far-right in France. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2388.7200000000003s)]
*  You just look at that. There's lots of differences, but there's clearly similarities. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2392.6400000000003s)]
*  Just in terms of, just again, just talking about Israel in terms of, you mentioned of course how, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2399.04s)]
*  I mean, you've got the majority of Israeli Jews are actually Mizrahi, as you pointed out, [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2403.92s)]
*  from Arab countries, but then there are others who've obviously fled European persecution. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2408.08s)]
*  And that just the concept, I mean, this is a slightly cliched question maybe, but how [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2413.12s)]
*  people whose history has been one of persecution, how they then, how people can exact tell [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2416.7999999999997s)]
*  what persecution is and others. I just want to read this from Israel's communication minister, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2423.8399999999997s)]
*  Shlomo Kahi yesterday. And he was referring to in support of Trump's ethnic cleansing [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2428.7999999999997s)]
*  horror. And he tweeted it, and oh, and no, sorry, specifically let hell rip loose if it sees [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2439.2s)]
*  foul-fools. And he tweeted this, when dealing with a Nazi terrorist organization, one must be prepared [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2446.3999999999996s)]
*  for such violations. Hamas thinks it can gamble on the lives of our hostages with great mistake, [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2451.12s)]
*  no more games. The response must be exactly as President Trump has suggested, completely halt [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2455.12s)]
*  humanitarian aid, cut off electricity, water and communications, and use brutal and disproportionate [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2458.96s)]
*  force until the abductees return. At the same time, clear Gaza of all uninvolved, in quotes. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2464.0s)]
*  The immigration plan must begin immediately. It's time to open the gates of hell on Hamas. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2469.12s)]
*  And this time without any restrictions on our heroic fighters. And it's just interesting [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2472.88s)]
*  because he's there, you know, just look at it, the kind of, that rhetoric is so extreme. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2476.24s)]
*  Yeah. And just, just, I mean, it's just, just the horror of that. And he's invoking deliberately [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2483.04s)]
*  the experience of Jewish people at the hands of the Nazis in order to kind of justify just [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2491.68s)]
*  unbelievable horror. And I'm just interested in that because that's what's, I mean, you even [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2498.7999999999997s)]
*  got that, you know, you got Holocaust revisionism from Netanyahu, which was along the lines of [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2503.2799999999997s)]
*  Hitler was convinced by Palestinians to commit genocide against Jewish people, that kind of thing. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2508.0s)]
*  But I mean, that's it, that is invoked in Israel. I mean, that's tapping into, [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2512.24s)]
*  tapping into collective trauma in order to justify just unbelievable barbarism. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2516.7999999999997s)]
*  It's, it's horrendous. I mean, that's such a chilling thing to say for what it actually [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2523.3599999999997s)]
*  means in practice. This is one of the things that I think is particularly difficult because [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2528.48s)]
*  we're looking at the way that that Holocaust trauma, which is real, obviously, has been [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2537.12s)]
*  used for political ends in Israel. And that has been ongoing. We're seeing very extreme and overt [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2547.44s)]
*  examples of it now in the last 15 months, post October 7. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2557.12s)]
*  Those parallels are constantly made as though Jewish Israelis are still, you know, in Russia, [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2561.12s)]
*  pale of the settlement and face and don't have any power and are experiencing regular pogroms, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2570.16s)]
*  as opposed to living in this hugely powerful nuclear armed key ally of the West that is [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2575.52s)]
*  backed to the hilt diplomatically and militarily. And is therefore, it's not the same. The idea that [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2586.2400000000002s)]
*  it's the same is so outrageous. It's so offensive to every single person involved in that equation, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2593.52s)]
*  Palestinians, but also people who did actually have family histories of persecution in Europe. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2599.92s)]
*  But I think our work then becomes, what do we do? How do we take care of those feelings of trauma [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2608.56s)]
*  that come from, you know, being a child of, or, you know, having generations in your family that [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2618.4s)]
*  were wiped out in the Holocaust and having that experience for European Jews? How do we deal with [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2626.56s)]
*  that sentiment, which is genuine, but at the same time has been politicized to such a horrendous [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2633.52s)]
*  degree, to the extent that Palestinians are now experiencing a genocidal war? How do we deal with [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2642.8s)]
*  that? How do we tend to the personal reality, despite the fact that that personal reality writ [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2650.56s)]
*  large, is being used by Israel to commit all these appalling atrocities against Palestinians, [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2660.64s)]
*  and is used by Western governments who are allied to Israel to explain away the alliance or to [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2668.24s)]
*  justify the alliance? And I think that is a really difficult question. You know, I think that that's [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2678.0s)]
*  something that, you know, people are not doing or are struggling to do, but that is the terrain that [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2683.68s)]
*  the progressive anti-racist left could look at going into and reclaiming in some way, because if [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2690.4s)]
*  we don't, then it will just keep giving oxygen to the far right and to, you know, the rampantly [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2697.6s)]
*  pro-Israel supporters as well. Final question I just want to ask you, I'm always interested in [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2706.8s)]
*  this. I mean, the left, as we understand it today, would not exist without the contribution of Jews [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2712.8s)]
*  throughout history. And didn't the anti-Semites know it? I mean, they, you know, particularly, [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2717.68s)]
*  you know, the whole idea of the Jewish-Polish conspiracy. I mean, it was this, you know, [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2723.7599999999998s)]
*  there was, and it's a fact that Jewish people disproportionately contributed to different strains [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2726.72s)]
*  of the left, the revolutionary left and the reformist left. And, you know, it strikes, you know, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2731.44s)]
*  the way kind of the ever source of anti-Semitism against the Jewish diaspora, that rootless [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2737.68s)]
*  cosmopolitan was tapping into the kind of internationalism that a lot of the Jewish [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2743.2s)]
*  people felt because they understood their lived experience of nationalism was when nationalism, [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2748.0s)]
*  particularly ethno-nationalism became strong. That was obviously a very dangerous moment for [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2753.3599999999997s)]
*  often the Jewish populations of those countries. You know, the Dreyfus affair in France being a [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2757.6s)]
*  striking example of that. Obviously Germany, I mean, the most integrated Jewish population in [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2762.72s)]
*  Europe were the German Jews. And we all know what happened there. But I mean, but in terms of just, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2768.96s)]
*  you know, what Zionism, what the Israeli state said was kind of, look, well, actually, the [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2777.04s)]
*  problem is in nationalism and ethno-nationalism, the problem is we don't have one. And that obviously [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2780.8s)]
*  then went to war with that tradition. But that tradition is never, I mean, that tradition, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2784.7200000000003s)]
*  you can see is very strong and you can see that, you know, the US, the pro-Parsian movement, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2788.88s)]
*  the number of American, particularly younger Jewish Americans involved and actually with [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2793.12s)]
*  leading positions is very striking indeed. So I'm just interested in that tradition and how it, [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2797.2s)]
*  you know, for the left, it really is such a central tradition. And it was always one of [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2802.96s)]
*  humanism, of empathy, of solidarity, of revulsion, injustice, and just how you're very much part of [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2808.8799999999997s)]
*  that tradition. So just interested in that, in that tradition, the strength of that tradition, [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2816.7999999999997s)]
*  how it endures and actually in lots of ways how it's resurgent, I think. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2820.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, the resurgence is really interesting. I do want to talk about that. I think one of, for me, [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2825.12s)]
*  one of the things about the whole erasure of the experience of Jews from Arab and Muslim countries [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2829.2s)]
*  is the erasure of the political organizing of those groups. So when you look at, you know, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2836.56s)]
*  Iraqi Jews, for instance, at that time of nascent nationalisms where, you know, Zionism was being [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2844.16s)]
*  formulated as an ideology in Europe by European Jews as a response to European anti-Semitism. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2852.48s)]
*  At the same time, we saw Arab nationalism. So when we look at it in Iraq, it was trying to [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2860.16s)]
*  shake off the yoke of British colonialism that was, you know, in that sort of colonialism by [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2866.8s)]
*  remote in the shape of a mandate. So it was mandate Iraq. And, you know, Iraqi Jews at that time [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2873.12s)]
*  would look at Zionism, Jewish nationalism, and look at communism and socialism in Iraq, [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2880.64s)]
*  which were about Iraqi nationalism, and go, yeah, do you know what? We're Iraqi. We pick Iraqi [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2886.7200000000003s)]
*  nationalism. And so there were more of them who were communists and socialists than ever were [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2893.6800000000003s)]
*  attracted to the Zionist movement in those early decades. And I feel like that whole history, [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2900.2400000000002s)]
*  we see iterations of that in North Africa as well, where the colonial power was French. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2906.0s)]
*  That whole narrative is something that has been pretty much memory holed about Arab Jews and [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2913.04s)]
*  their lives and their experiences in those countries. I think what you say about the [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2920.64s)]
*  current iterations is really true in the sense that one of the things that I and a lot of people [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2925.68s)]
*  that I and a lot of people really found a rare moment of hope in in the last 15 months is to see [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2930.8s)]
*  Jewish leftists, particularly we saw this in the US with groups like If Not Now, [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2939.28s)]
*  and Jewish Voice of Peace, but we also see in the UK with Naat Amod, they would integrate their [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2944.8s)]
*  anti-racism and their Palestine solidarity with Jewishness, with Judaism and Jewish values, [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2951.44s)]
*  and seeing them do that, seeing them synthesize all that into a way of being Jewish leftists with [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2959.04s)]
*  all their values, coherent and consistent and interwoven. I found that incredibly inspiring, [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2968.8s)]
*  and I know a lot of other people did too. Amen to that. Well, you're very much part of that [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2976.96s)]
*  tradition. And your book is part of that tradition. It's a brilliant book. It's so educational. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2981.2s)]
*  Everyone needs to read it. And it really will sharpen people's understanding of racism, [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2985.44s)]
*  of anti-Semitism, of solidarity, which I think is so key to your politics and fundamental to [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2991.52s)]
*  what the book talks about, about not allowing those who suffer racism to be divided to the benefit, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=2998.48s)]
*  of course, not least at a time of the ascendant far right, they would love nothing more than that. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=3005.84s)]
*  And so do everyone do get a copy of Off-White. It really will, I think, be so eye-opening and [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=3012.16s)]
*  educational for so many people. It really has been for me, as Rachel has always been. So do press [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=3020.0s)]
*  like and subscribe and leave comments. Good for the algorithm. Therefore, we'll hear Rachel's [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=3024.32s)]
*  brilliant wisdom. But Rachel, honestly, it's always an honor. Thank you so much. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=3028.96s)]
*  It's so nice to speak with you as always. Thanks for having me on. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=3032.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5e_H1jPp9I&t=3041.44s)]
