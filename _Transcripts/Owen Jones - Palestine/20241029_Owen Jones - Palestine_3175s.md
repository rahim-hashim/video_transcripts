# TERRIFYING Truth On Why Palestine Is Laboratory For Humanity's Future - w/. Antony Loewenstein
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo)
*  Now, so many elements of Israel's genocidal onslaught against Gaza are dystopian, as is. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=0.0s)]
*  I suppose, notwithstanding the utter horror and depravity being unleashed against the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=7.2s)]
*  Palestinian people, the lesson of our age is things can always get much, much worse. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=12.8s)]
*  And something I've definitely been thinking about, and I know others have been talking about [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=19.84s)]
*  far more eloquently myself, is how what we're seeing could be the harbinger of a very, very dark, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=24.159999999999997s)]
*  dystopian future for humanity as a whole, that Palestine could be a laboratory for far, far, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=32.32s)]
*  even more hideous, if you like, forms of violence and control. And there's no better person to speak [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=41.76s)]
*  about that with than the brilliant Anthony Lohenstein, who is just on the back of his [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=49.44s)]
*  brilliant book, The Palestine Laboratory, done a new podcast series with DropSite News, a brilliant [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=55.04s)]
*  new project launched by Jeremy Scarhill and Ryan Grim, really brilliant American investigative [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=61.92s)]
*  journalist. And that site is doing incredible, some of the best investigative journalism, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=67.44s)]
*  I would say, of our time, not least at the moment in terms of the genocide in Gaza. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=72.08s)]
*  And this series looks at, in terms of the past, Israel's role in developing new [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=76.64s)]
*  technologies, sorry, military technologies, exporting them and that model being exported [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  around the world. And that has very much accelerated and is accelerating. And it could [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  have some very terrifying lessons. We need to sit up and listen here, I'm afraid, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=97.2s)]
*  because it's not like we weren't warned. Anyway, what a cheery introduction for you, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=102.08s)]
*  Anthony. How are you doing? I'm good. Thanks for having me, Owen. That was [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=106.88s)]
*  joyful, but appreciated. Thank you. Yeah, work with the material that we've got. Brilliant work. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=110.4s)]
*  I mean, all your work has always been brilliant. And it's kind of been linked in terms of the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=117.04s)]
*  work you've been doing on disaster capitalism, which is, do check out Anthony's books, everyone, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=122.08s)]
*  by the way. I just thought before we talk about this, I mean, in terms of your history, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=126.96s)]
*  and in terms of your kind of, I guess, your, you know, how you developed in terms of how you saw [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  Israel. I mean, that's it, because let's talk about your family. I mean, your family are Holocaust [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=139.2s)]
*  survivors. Tell me about your family history. Yeah, I was born in Australia in the mid 70s. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=142.4s)]
*  And my parents, not Holocaust survivors, but my grandparents had escaped Nazi Germany. Most of [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=148.95999999999998s)]
*  my family were killed in the Holocaust. I'm Jewish. And I was brought up in what I would call a [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=155.68s)]
*  liberal Jewish home, which then, and I would argue still now in many so-called liberal Jewish homes, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=159.6s)]
*  people said that you should support Israel. I was told when I was growing up that God forbid [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=166.32s)]
*  something happened again to us as Jews, there was somewhere for us to go. And some viewers might [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=170.4s)]
*  know this, but those who don't as a Jew, I can go to Israel tomorrow. And if I can prove that I'm [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=174.88s)]
*  Jewish, namely, my mom is Jewish, I can become a citizen, an Israeli citizen with an Israeli past, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  but now I've never got that citizenship, just to be clear, but I could theoretically. And [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=185.36s)]
*  I, you know, when you're 10, you don't really understand the politics and, you know, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=192.56s)]
*  you and I are roughly the same age, give or take. I think people's knowledge. Thank you. Yes, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=195.84s)]
*  I'm actually 50 yesterday. Would you believe? But yes, there is kind of a sense, I think that [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=201.76000000000002s)]
*  the knowledge of what was going on in the Jewish community 30, 40 years ago was minimal. Now that's, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  I use that as an as a as a, I guess, an excuse of sorts, no justification for it. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=214.32s)]
*  I got into my teenage years and started hearing this profound racism. I started noticing racism [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=218.88s)]
*  against Palestinians, against Arabs, was constantly told that yes, Arafat, who was then [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  the leader of the Palestinians was essentially Hitler, very familiar language, what we hear today. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=228.95999999999998s)]
*  Palestinians were, it was essentially was a zero sum game. It's us all them. Now, I've never been [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=233.84s)]
*  to Israel. Most of my family had not been to Israel, but Israel was this, it was almost like [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=238.96s)]
*  a fiction. There was an idealized country that I was being told existed. It was a democracy. It was [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=244.8s)]
*  striving for peace. The Arabs hated us because we were Jewish. There was going to be another [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=251.84s)]
*  Holocaust unless we were strong. I didn't really hear details about the occupation or what that [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=256.24s)]
*  meant. I had no idea. And then got to university and started learning much more about the reality. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=260.64s)]
*  Fast forward to the, I guess, 20 or so years ago when I started being a journalist professionally [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=266.32s)]
*  and started writing about this issue critically at the time. Look, I was writing as someone [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=271.03999999999996s)]
*  Jewish saying, back then I supported two state solution. I believe in a concert of a Jewish [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=276.56s)]
*  state. My views have changed on both of those quite a lot. But 20 years ago, that was that, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=282.32s)]
*  I mean, that's a mainstream position, by the way, the Jewish community in Australia, the Jewish [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=287.03999999999996s)]
*  establishment, I was condemned in parliament. I had my first book in 2006 called My Israel Question, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=291.92s)]
*  which was a critical look at the conflict and the role of the Israel lobby in the US, UK and [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=297.52000000000004s)]
*  Australia. And the established Jewish community lost their mind. I mean, it was almost like I was [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=303.2s)]
*  this radical when, if you read the book, it was really moderate and mild anyway. And I think by [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=309.68s)]
*  that point, I started being, I'd lost, I was never religious, but I had felt profoundly disillusioned [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=314.64s)]
*  with Judaism. Now, obviously Judaism and Zionism is not the same thing. I'm obviously very well [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=322.64s)]
*  aware of that. However, for many Jews and the Jewish community and Jewish synagogues, there is [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=326.96s)]
*  no difference. In other words, if you're a Jew, you're a Zionist. If you're a Zionist, you mostly [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=333.68s)]
*  have to be a Jew or evangelical or probably right wing. Years ago, it's funny to think now, right, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=338.47999999999996s)]
*  that years ago, the left celebrated Israel as a socialist paradise, which was always nonsense, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=343.36s)]
*  of course. But I found, I was disillusioned with the fact that if you were in the Jewish community, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=348.72s)]
*  I was living in Melbourne then, which is one of the biggest cities in Australia. And you go to a [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=354.40000000000003s)]
*  synagogue, you go to a Jewish New Year, you know, you'd been with Jewish colleagues. Israel was a [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=359.84000000000003s)]
*  religion. Israel has replaced religion for many Jews who don't have a religion. In other words, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=366.24s)]
*  they might go to synagogue once or twice a year, but Israel is that religion. That sort of difference [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=372.64000000000004s)]
*  to an Israel that I would argue doesn't exist. A thriving democracy, you know, in the heart of [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=377.92s)]
*  the Arab hordes. I heard the most hideous racist language. So yeah, I've had a journey, I guess. I [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=386.16s)]
*  was never a mad pro-Israel zealot, you know, in the streets with the Israeli flag, not at all. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=392.56s)]
*  But, you know, 40 years ago, 30 years ago, I was, I guess, ignorant and started becoming [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=398.79999999999995s)]
*  aware because of the racism that I heard in the Jewish community, which by the way, has not changed. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=407.2s)]
*  There is a growing number of Jews who do not support this view. Undoubtedly, that has radically [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=411.76s)]
*  changed in the last decades. But the racism that I see and hear in the mainstream Jewish community, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=416.47999999999996s)]
*  Jewish leadership, pro-Israel lobby, many Jewish synagogues, is profound and ubiquitous and has [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=424.0s)]
*  arguably got worse since October 7. Let's talk about how Israel was founded. And, you know, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=431.2s)]
*  there has been more education awareness now given the horrors of the last year in terms of the [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=439.04s)]
*  Nakba. People often aren't aware, of course, the insurgency of the period. You've got the [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=443.84s)]
*  likes of the Ergun who committed obviously terrible atrocities, but you've got this [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=450.8s)]
*  obviously notion of militarization being very much core and all the Palestinians who [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=454.64000000000004s)]
*  weren't driven out had to live under military rule, didn't they? But can you just tell us about [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=461.44000000000005s)]
*  in terms of how Israel was founded and how that links to, I guess what later became known as the [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=467.04s)]
*  military industrial complex, how the kind of nature of Israel's foundation is birthed, well, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=473.28000000000003s)]
*  birth is not the way to describe it, but how it was founded and what that how that linked together. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=478.88s)]
*  Tell us about that. Yeah, I think it's central. I think the ideology of Israel today actually is [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=483.52s)]
*  pretty similar to what it was at the beginning. And what I mean by that is it was forged really [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=488.15999999999997s)]
*  in the belief David Ben-Gurion, who was the first prime minister of Israel, he believed that the [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=493.68s)]
*  only way the state could survive in what was perceived by early Zionists as a hostile Arab [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=500.15999999999997s)]
*  region, which wasn't really untrue, of course, was through arms, through frankly, mass violence, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=506.96s)]
*  that even before 1948, there were, as you said, Jewish Zionist militias that was beginning [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=513.68s)]
*  even before, frankly, World War Two, it certainly massively increased during World War Two, it [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=521.6s)]
*  increased more, of course, afterwards, and it was almost an inevitability of sorts, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=526.4s)]
*  because of the makeup of the world, because of the role of Britain had suddenly disappeared, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=530.56s)]
*  or reduced at least, the US, of course, was the now the global premier power. And there was a [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=535.28s)]
*  massive pressure from elements of the Jewish community in the US and elsewhere for a Jewish [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=542.0799999999999s)]
*  state. And obviously, this Palestinian existence was seen as secondary at best. And the whole [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=547.12s)]
*  question of how Israel was founded using military means, and one level, not dissimilar to many other [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=553.52s)]
*  settler colonial states, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, all deeply violent, deeply hostile to [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=560.56s)]
*  indigenous populations. Israel in that way was not dissimilar to that. The difference was that, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=567.68s)]
*  like, it's in a much more modern era, there's still profound denial about what even happened [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=573.52s)]
*  back then, by the way, by many Jews in the Jewish community to this day. But the sense that right [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=578.0799999999999s)]
*  from the beginning, Ben-Gurion realized that there needed to be an active domestic arms industry. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=584.16s)]
*  Now, of course, back in the day, it was guns, it was very basic weapons. But by the 1950s, Israel [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=590.7199999999999s)]
*  was selling weapons to other countries, particularly West Germany, which was obviously only a few years [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=595.8399999999999s)]
*  after the Holocaust. By the 1960s, fast forward to after 1967, the Six-Day War, Israel takes control [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=600.88s)]
*  of the West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights. Many in the world didn't accept the [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=608.3199999999999s)]
*  occupation. They said, give the land back. But Israel, what it's done since then, so 56-odd years, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=612.96s)]
*  is use the experience of that occupation, the idea that we, the ideology is we as Jews, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=621.76s)]
*  Zionists, can only thrive in this region and this world by essentially trading on the experience of [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=629.6s)]
*  controlling and separating Palestinians to the world. In other words, we are testing and trialling [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=638.0s)]
*  a multitude of techniques to control Palestinians. And since 1967, when the occupation was in its [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=645.2s)]
*  early days, there were very few Jewish settlers. Palestinians were always treated as second-class [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=652.72s)]
*  citizens. And even then, the countries that publicly opposed what Israel was doing were [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=658.0s)]
*  often secretly partnering with them to get that experience to manage their own insurgencies, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=664.0s)]
*  their own wars, their own wars on dissidents or critics. And I show in the book that, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=669.92s)]
*  and the podcast, that in the last 50, 60 years, Israel has essentially sold [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=677.36s)]
*  a forms of weapons, drones, spyware to the majority of nations on the planet. And they're [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=684.96s)]
*  not just selling weapons. Yes, it's probably to make money, but it's more than that. It's selling [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=691.44s)]
*  an idea. And it's probably the idea of getting away with it, which is a very compelling idea [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=696.6400000000001s)]
*  for many other states, because Israel is arguably the ultimate state apart from the US and maybe [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=702.48s)]
*  the UK and maybe Australia that can get away with it and does get away with it, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=707.6800000000001s)]
*  each being endless occupation, whether it's war in Gaza. Again, this was existing long before October [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=712.24s)]
*  7th. So the ideology from the beginning, from 1948, David Ben-Gurion, this idea that we need to, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=719.2s)]
*  as a new state, forge friendships with pretty much anybody and sell weapons to pretty much anybody, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=726.32s)]
*  which they have done. It doesn't matter if it's dictatorship, democracy, including, I might add, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=732.5600000000001s)]
*  which is always insane to me, Owen, some of the most anti-Semitic regimes on the planet. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=737.6s)]
*  Now, as a Jewish state, the idea of doing that seems to me so incomprehensibly amoral. And yet, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=744.0s)]
*  Israel's had no hesitation doing that in the past and frankly, to this day. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=752.24s)]
*  It's interesting, actually, Argentina, just quite a striking example, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=756.88s)]
*  in that that had a far-right junta. And actually, it's quite interesting because there are, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=761.76s)]
*  you'll see Israelis with Argentine names and obviously, they fled that period. But [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=768.16s)]
*  it's not like Israel was taking a stand against the Argentines. Just so people are aware, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=775.84s)]
*  what that junta did is round up, obviously, leftists, but they disproportionately rounded up Jews [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=779.28s)]
*  and they killed and tortured huge numbers of Jews. And there's huge amounts of evidence of those [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=785.4399999999999s)]
*  soldiers and doing Nazi solutes and praising Hitler and all the rest of it. And so I would say [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=790.3199999999999s)]
*  that was itself the biggest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, in terms of the number of [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=795.04s)]
*  over a period were killed. And Israel would say, were this bastion to protect Jews wherever they [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=802.4s)]
*  are around the world, we need the state to protect Jews wherever they are. But they were arming [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=808.3199999999999s)]
*  Argentina, didn't they? They provided weapons to Argentina, including, not amusingly, but [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=814.48s)]
*  when Britain, for example, was at war with Argentina over the Molvenas, let's call them that. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=820.64s)]
*  What do you, I mean, tell us about that. I mean, that's interesting. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=824.96s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, that's one thing that should be said about Argentina was when Israel was partnering [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=827.5200000000001s)]
*  with them decades ago, Argentina was known to be sheltering literal Nazi war criminals. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=832.32s)]
*  It's not like it was a secret. I mean, not that Argentina was promoting it to the world, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=839.9200000000001s)]
*  but Israel knew this. Like literal Nazis who had fled Europe after World War II, fled Germany, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=843.9200000000001s)]
*  and were being given protection. And that was no impediment to Israel selling weapons, giving [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=850.4000000000001s)]
*  training, knowing that Jews are being rounded up, some were being killed, some were being tortured. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=856.48s)]
*  As you say, often there's testimony from Argentinian prisons at the time of posters of Nazis, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=863.0400000000001s)]
*  as you said, hell, Hitler's just the most gross behaviour imaginable. There was no impediment to [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=872.56s)]
*  that. Now, another regime that often comes to mind in terms of anti-Semitism was Romania. People often [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=880.4s)]
*  don't think about Romania much these days in terms of being anti-Semitic regime, but Ceausescu was [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=886.24s)]
*  deeply anti-Semitic. He wasn't killing thousands and thousands of Jews, no, but he was obviously [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=891.52s)]
*  a gross dictator for decades. Openly anti-Semitic, and is what Israel does with these [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=896.24s)]
*  partnerships. It's not just weapons. Yes, that's part of it. It's trying to, for example, get votes [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=901.36s)]
*  to the United Nations because it comes from an awareness that so many countries, at least publicly, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=906.96s)]
*  did not support the occupation of Palestine. But privately, and I would say the arms industry is [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=914.0s)]
*  central to that, they are able to so-called make friends, so to speak. That has been in the past [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=921.12s)]
*  and frankly to this day. I often see the Israeli arms industry as the ultimate insurance policy, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=928.24s)]
*  that if you're selling, as I estimate, to about 140 countries on the planet, Israel is now the [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=934.5600000000001s)]
*  ninth biggest arms dealer in the world, which for a tiny nation is just unbelievable. The US is number [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=940.08s)]
*  one. It's 45% of the world's weapons comes from the US. Just an extraordinarily insane number. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=946.08s)]
*  Israel is never going to be number one. It's number nine at the moment, based on the figures [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=951.76s)]
*  from 2023 that we have. But the idea that you promote yourself globally for decades as one of [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=956.08s)]
*  the key leaders in weapons and spyware and surveillance to anyone who will buy it under [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=964.4000000000001s)]
*  the guise of saying the only way we as Jews can survive is by selling to despots really questions [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=972.16s)]
*  what the ideology of Israel is. Now, some people have said to me, well, Russia sells all four weapons. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=980.0s)]
*  France does, Germany does, the UK does. Absolutely true. So does the US. I'm not denying that for a [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=985.92s)]
*  second. But the difference is that Israel has on its doorstep for decades an occupied population. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=990.9599999999999s)]
*  Literally on their doorstep. People often don't realize if you haven't been to Israel or [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=998.48s)]
*  Palestine, if you're in Jerusalem or Tel Aviv, it's not hours and hours and hours to Palestine. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1001.36s)]
*  It's literally 15 minutes away, 20 minutes away. You're a neighbor, essentially. So to me, the idea [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1007.76s)]
*  of a Jewish state, which claims to be born in the ashes of the Holocaust to provide protection for [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1019.36s)]
*  Jews, actually is endangering Jews far more by selling and promoting weapons to the worst regimes [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1026.4s)]
*  on the planet. And this has been the case for decades. And in fact, in some ways, as it will [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1034.0s)]
*  get to, it's ramping up since October 7. I mean, another really striking example is Chile as well, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1037.76s)]
*  the Pinochet. So my father took in Chilean refugees and he was always impressed and made the horrors [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1044.72s)]
*  of that regime. But apartheid South Africa, I think that's particularly relevant. At the moment, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1049.2800000000002s)]
*  of course, post apartheid South Africa is leading the charge at the International Court of Justice [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1055.12s)]
*  to obviously promote the case that Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1063.6799999999998s)]
*  people. And obviously they cite their own history in terms of knowing what apartheid is, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1069.04s)]
*  knowing what the religious regime is. But clearly they also have made it clear that Israel was an [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1075.52s)]
*  ally of that oppressor. I mean, what do you think about what that says in terms of the, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1081.28s)]
*  I guess, the solidarity that was forged there against, I would say notably, Jewish South [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1085.84s)]
*  Africans who were very prominent in the anti-apartheid struggle, who didn't have the [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1091.84s)]
*  solidarity of Israel. They were arming the state that actual Jewish South Africans were fighting [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1096.16s)]
*  against. I mean, yes, it's worth saying that there were some prominent Jews who were very much in the [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1100.96s)]
*  anti-apartheid movement, but it's also worth saying the majority of Jews in South Africa [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1107.12s)]
*  supported the apartheid movement as the majority of white South Africans did. And I mean, this is [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1110.8s)]
*  the relationship between Israel and apartheid South Africa, I think is the classic relationship, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1117.6s)]
*  which is not just about weapons. Yes, Israel was selling weapons to South Africa. They were assisting [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1122.8s)]
*  South Africa in its nuclear program, which would have been, which was successful. South Africa [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1128.32s)]
*  didn't thankfully ever use those weapons, but it was more than that. This is where it comes down [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1133.36s)]
*  to the ideological alignment between the states, that you have all this correspondence. I talk [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1138.6399999999999s)]
*  about it in the book and the podcast of leaders, both political leaders and military leaders, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1143.76s)]
*  writing to each other in the seventies and eighties, particularly talking about how much they admire [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1150.08s)]
*  the other's regime. We are fighting against the hordes of the world. We are in Africa, of course, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1155.44s)]
*  that men against the blacks and of course, in Israel, Palestine, that meant Arabs and Palestinians. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1164.16s)]
*  We are brothers in arms. I mean, this language is used explicitly and right at the end, oh, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1169.2s)]
*  and by 1994, when the regime essentially collapsed, the only country really, even after the US, by the [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1175.2s)]
*  way, had essentially cut ties, which took a long time, and the UK, Israel was right there at the end, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1181.6s)]
*  and not publicly, but privately. And its correspondence where they are concerned, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1187.12s)]
*  which is sort of insane in hindsight, that the change in regime might mean that their relationship [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1192.24s)]
*  with the part of South Africa might change. Now, as you say, fast forward to the last year or so, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1197.1999999999998s)]
*  there's no doubt that South Africa is pursuing this case for a variety of reasons. I don't want to [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1203.76s)]
*  speak for them, of course, but one key reason, as they explicitly have said, is we, being black [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1208.56s)]
*  South Africans, have not forgotten what you as Israel did to us and supported decades ago, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1214.24s)]
*  and by backing our oppressors, essentially. And that ideological alignment, to me, the modern [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1221.84s)]
*  equivalent of that is Israel and India. This, to me, is the modern equivalent. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1230.72s)]
*  Let's talk about this. How this military model's been replicated, and you cite, for example, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1236.56s)]
*  Myanmar and India. Let's talk about India, which is obviously what we've seen there is, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1242.8s)]
*  there was, I mean, it always had problems, but there was supposed to be a secular nation. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1248.24s)]
*  Hindu nationalism, clearly massively on the rise, the BJP party, we saw, you know, the leader of [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1253.36s)]
*  India who was implicated in anti-Muslim pogroms and the treatment of Muslims in India as second [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1259.44s)]
*  class citizens and the rest of it. And obviously Kashmir, which is particularly striking in terms [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1266.0s)]
*  of a parallel. Just talk us through that. What's happening in India? How has it been replicated? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1272.64s)]
*  So Israel and India were friendly of sorts for decades, but it's massively changed since 2014 [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1277.68s)]
*  when Modi became prime minister. Modi is a Hindu fundamentalist. As you said, he's implicated in [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1284.16s)]
*  hideous anti-Muslim rights about early part of this century. And since 2014, this relationship [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1290.24s)]
*  between Netanyahu particularly and Modi, yes, it's partly been military. India is the biggest [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1296.8000000000002s)]
*  purchaser of Israeli weapons every year, about 40 to 50%. So it's a massive part, actually, of the [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1302.88s)]
*  Israeli arms industry. But it's so much more than that. It's an ideological alignment. You have [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1307.68s)]
*  Netanyahu and Modi, you have Indian, Israeli officials openly saying, but also privately, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1312.96s)]
*  how much they admire the other's war, essentially. You have Hindu leaders, military figures, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1319.52s)]
*  prominent Hindu commentators, deeply admiring Israeli actions in Palestine. You have them [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1328.08s)]
*  deeply admiring what Israel's doing in Gaza, saying this is akin to the war that we're fighting [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1333.92s)]
*  against awful Muslims in Kashmir or elsewhere. There is definite parallels between what's [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1339.84s)]
*  happening in Palestine and Kashmir, not the same, of course, but similar. And that ideological [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1345.04s)]
*  alignment's concerning because India is the biggest country in the world, the biggest population. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1350.48s)]
*  Modi, although the last election, his wings were slightly clipped, but still he's prime minister. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1355.04s)]
*  And the model for me that worries me is that both nations see the other [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1360.56s)]
*  as inspiring other nations around the world. So I have in the book and the podcast, lots of examples [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1368.08s)]
*  of far-right parties in Europe, Sweden, France, Germany, and elsewhere, who don't particularly [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1374.08s)]
*  like Jews or Hindus, but love what both nations are doing and in their view, proudly promoting [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1381.84s)]
*  their own people. They say it openly, it's not even a secret. Victor Orban's regime in Hungary [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1388.56s)]
*  is quite a striking example of that, isn't it? I mean, that is probably, in terms of the most [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1393.12s)]
*  openly anti-Semitic kind of tropes deployed by the regime. And yet, Orban Netanyahu are very [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1396.96s)]
*  best of friends. And Hungary has bought lots of Israeli spyware to spy on dissidents, critics, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1403.6799999999998s)]
*  human rights activists, et cetera. As you say, deeply anti-Semitic, not least against George [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1410.3999999999999s)]
*  Soros, amongst others. He's portrayed as the puppet master of the opposition, the classic. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1416.08s)]
*  Indeed. Absolutely. And that ethno-nationalist model is something I think that has got [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1419.28s)]
*  shamefully far too little coverage in the last decades, that Israel is ultimately seen by many [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1426.88s)]
*  people on the right and the far right as that model. Now, if you speak to often people on the [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1434.72s)]
*  far right in the US, they don't like Jews. I mean, they're often quasi-Nazis, often not actual [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1441.04s)]
*  Nazis, but they often openly love what Israel is doing because they want to create in their country, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1445.76s)]
*  the US or elsewhere, a Christian ethno-nationalist state. And they deeply admire what Israel is doing [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1452.32s)]
*  for Jews. And it's interesting that you have in the last few years, a number of prominent Israeli [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1460.48s)]
*  government ministers going to conferences in Europe, far-right conferences with far-right [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1465.44s)]
*  leaders, some of whom are directly tied to neo-Nazis, talking about a shared battle. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1471.8400000000001s)]
*  What's the battle against? Muslims, multiculturalism, the left, feminism, women, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1478.56s)]
*  whatever you want to call it. The idea that you have prominent Israeli ministers [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1486.0800000000002s)]
*  partnering, palying around, hugging people who are literal anti-Semites, not least selling weapons. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1492.08s)]
*  But again, this is where I was trying to explain, this is not just about weapons. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1500.0s)]
*  To me, the Palestine Laboratory is not just about weapons, although it's obviously partly that. And [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1504.7199999999998s)]
*  yes, it makes huge amounts of money for Israel. And as Israel's economy has some issues because [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1508.8s)]
*  of the war, they are more likely to look to that industry. But it's so much more than that. It's [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1513.4399999999998s)]
*  that inspiration, that ethno-nationalist model that I fear, that finally, that as the right and [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1518.4s)]
*  the far-right is in the incendency in many countries, if we think on the left that Israel [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1524.48s)]
*  is very isolated, it is in some parts of the world. But in fact, the right and the far-right [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1530.96s)]
*  admires Israel even more because of its behavior since October 7. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1536.0s)]
*  Right? I mean, Richard B. Spencer, the American [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1541.0400000000002s)]
*  neo-Nazi, is quite a striking case in point, who's repeatedly said, well, he's a neo-Nazi, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1543.44s)]
*  there's the clue, isn't it, really? And obviously has used the same sort of hateful speech against [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1548.32s)]
*  Jewish people as you'd expect a neo-Nazi to say. He also claims to be a white Zionist who has praised [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1554.56s)]
*  Israel's Jewish national state law, which cements the idea of Jewish supremacy in Israel, saying, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1559.8400000000001s)]
*  you know, and then to create a white homeland for a dispossessed white race, calling for [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1567.92s)]
*  peaceful ethnic cleansing to halt the destruction of what we call this white culture. I suppose [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1572.4s)]
*  that's one example. But we come on more to the here and now. I just, after 9-0, well firstly, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1575.44s)]
*  just quickly, something that might come in people's head is go, hold on a minute, if Israel's this big [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1579.8400000000001s)]
*  arms exporter, then the claims that the West, that Israel is reliant on the West and arms from the [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1583.76s)]
*  West in order to sustain its occupation and all the rest is a nonsense. So just quickly, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1590.88s)]
*  because that will come up. Yeah. So Israel does produce a lot of weapons, to be sure, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1600.5600000000002s)]
*  for its domestic use, but also globally. But when it's, for example, needing to, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1605.1200000000001s)]
*  well, I say needing, when it has been fighting in Gaza, say, without the US and frankly, Germany, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1609.44s)]
*  Israel could not fight this war. Germany was the second biggest [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1614.88s)]
*  sender of weapons to Israel since October 7. The US, of course, is number one. I read a study a [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1619.68s)]
*  few days ago from Brown University in the US that said that roughly 70% of all Israeli sort of [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1624.96s)]
*  military means since October 7 has come from the US, which on one level doesn't surprise anyone, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1630.64s)]
*  I guess. But Israel is desperate to produce more weapons, more drones, and which is why, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1635.68s)]
*  increasingly, they're partnering, in fact, with other countries, particularly India. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1642.56s)]
*  So often you have big Israeli companies, Elbert, IAI, and others, increasingly building factories [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1646.08s)]
*  in places like India to produce drones and other weapons, which they then sometimes send back [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1652.56s)]
*  to Israel or to sell to other countries. So for example, there are drones that allegedly have been [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1658.32s)]
*  made in India since October 7 that India has sent to Israel to be used over Gaza. So again, you see [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1663.12s)]
*  the complicity of not just Israel, which is bad enough, but other states that are openly [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1670.48s)]
*  happy to assist. So yes, Israel, if the US, for example, stopped the flow of weapons tomorrow, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1675.44s)]
*  would the war in Gaza stop the next day? No, but it wouldn't last that long. That is the [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1683.2s)]
*  bottom line. It just wouldn't. Just in terms of after 9-11, we got the so-called [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1687.6s)]
*  war on terror announced. And Israel was very, obviously, opportunistically, was like, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1693.68s)]
*  hi guys, we're the frontier here. We were doing this already in order to reconfigure how their [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1698.0s)]
*  occupation was seen in the eyes of much of the world. In terms of how the Palestinian people [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1705.52s)]
*  really were treated as lab rats by the Israeli state after that, can you just talk us through [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1713.44s)]
*  how the defense industry of Israel exploded and the source of, for example, surveillance [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1718.8000000000002s)]
*  technology, how this was tested on the Palestinian people? Talk us through that. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1724.4s)]
*  So Israel's arms industry, of course, existed long before 9-11, but 9-11 happened. There's [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1729.8400000000001s)]
*  an interview which I quoted in the book and it's in the podcast. I think it's September 11th or [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1734.24s)]
*  12th, 2001, Netanyahu, who was not prime minister then, was giving an interview and essentially he [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1738.72s)]
*  was asked what he thought about the events of the attack. And I'm not using his exact words, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1744.3200000000002s)]
*  something like, oh, I thought they were great. In the interview, I said, oh, sorry, what are you [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1750.3200000000002s)]
*  talking about? And he goes, oh, no, no, I don't mean great, but essentially now the world will [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1753.68s)]
*  understand what we're going through. That Israel, basically the world will get us. And in some ways, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1757.8400000000001s)]
*  he was right because here we are 23, 24 years later and Israel's arms industry has never been [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1764.0800000000002s)]
*  bigger. Israel essentially solved itself, as you said Owen, as the solution to your problems. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1771.2s)]
*  You've got a problem with terrorism, you've got a problem with dissidents, you've got a problem with [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1778.5600000000002s)]
*  troublemakers. Come to us. We've been doing this for years against Palestinians. Let us show you [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1782.24s)]
*  how to do it. So Israel's sort of homeland security industry explodes. They are able to promote their [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1786.24s)]
*  wares to everything from providing security for major sporting events to selling drones. Israel [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1794.6399999999999s)]
*  started, for example, testing many more drones over Gaza in about 2007 and eight. Some of those [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1801.76s)]
*  drones now are used by the European Union over the Mediterranean. Those drones aren't armed, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1808.4s)]
*  but they are essentially being used to so-called monitor refugees. And the fact that the European [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1813.1200000000001s)]
*  Union has made a decision in the last, I'd say, seven or eight years to let people drown deliberately, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1817.8400000000001s)]
*  who are brown or black, that's essentially the unofficial EU policy. The eyes in the sky that is [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1822.88s)]
*  making that decision is coming from an Israeli drone. And the reason the EU are using those drones, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1828.48s)]
*  they openly say, is because they were battle tested in Gaza. That's one example and there are so many [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1833.6000000000001s)]
*  others. So 9-11 became this massive marketing opportunity essentially for Israel. Yes, everything [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1839.1200000000001s)]
*  from Pegasus, the Israeli spyware, to sophisticated drones, killer drones, various other forms of [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1848.88s)]
*  surveillance, massive amounts of a so-called startup. The startup nation ideology, which I [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1855.3600000000001s)]
*  discussed a lot in the book and the film. The whole concept of that when it was released about [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1860.48s)]
*  15 or so years ago was Israel is so innovative. And often you even still see today media reports [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1864.72s)]
*  saying Israel's got a relatively small population, all these super innovative people developing the [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1870.16s)]
*  most sophisticated weapons and ways to deal with, say, climate, for example. Okay. What's ignored [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1875.84s)]
*  deliberately in that thinking is all these people are getting that experience in the occupation. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1883.2s)]
*  Their job is to be in the military day after day after day, monitoring, surveilling, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1891.28s)]
*  imprisoning Palestinians. That is their job. They do that for years, then there's a pipeline into [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1898.32s)]
*  the private sector. So many of the tools and weapons and spyware and surveillance that Israel [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1904.56s)]
*  has been developing and selling and promoting comes from that experience. And that key point [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1909.84s)]
*  was deliberately left out of the so-called startup nation propaganda. So 9-11 has been important to [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1915.76s)]
*  crystallize that because the language that Israel used then, and frankly they're still using now is, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1924.8799999999999s)]
*  we are on the front lines of a war for civilization. I mean, there's been lots of comments [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1930.48s)]
*  that I remember one that is in the podcast, Naftali Bennett, who's a former Israeli prime minister, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1936.96s)]
*  has ambitions to be prime minister again. And essentially he's said for years, but including [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1942.3200000000002s)]
*  since October 7, words to the effect of Israel needs to become a high tech sparta. We need to be [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1948.24s)]
*  essentially a, we were asleep with the wheel on October 7, we got attacked by Hamas terrorists, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1955.6000000000001s)]
*  this is his language. And we need to essentially be a stronger, tougher, high tech sector. In other [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1962.4s)]
*  words, we need to develop these weapons and tools more. And the irony of all this, coming back to [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1968.16s)]
*  the history briefly, Owen, is that when Zionism was founded, the argument always was we as Jews [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1973.2800000000002s)]
*  can never be safe in Europe because of anti-Semitism. We need to have our own homeland. Now you fast [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1978.88s)]
*  forward 120 or so years since Zionism was officially created in the late 1800s. And [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1983.68s)]
*  the only way Israel, I would argue, can survive is high walls and essentially ghettoizing themselves [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1990.24s)]
*  within the middle East. That's the only way. I'm not talking about 100 years, I'm talking about in [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=1996.56s)]
*  the foreseeable future, Israel is literally ghettoizing themselves with literal walls around [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2001.36s)]
*  themselves, high walls, more surveillance, more high tech security. And there's something sort of [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2007.1999999999998s)]
*  deeply depressingly ironic and grim about that, that they're promoting themselves as somehow on [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2014.56s)]
*  the front lines of this civilizational struggle, so they claim. And the Ness Bennett and many [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2023.52s)]
*  others, Netanyahu himself has said, we're fighting the war here, so you don't have to fight the war [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2029.76s)]
*  there. And what that means is we're fighting all the awful terrorists here, so they're not going to [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2035.04s)]
*  come onto the streets of London or Paris or New York, which is exactly, by the way, what the [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2038.96s)]
*  US started saying after 9-11. We've got to fight all these awful terrorists there, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2044.48s)]
*  there being Iraq, Afghanistan, and not on our own streets, the US. So the idea of that civilizational [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2049.2s)]
*  rhetoric, what I fear is that many nations actually find that very attractive. Now when I say nations, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2058.4s)]
*  I mean leaders rather than necessarily populations. And I worry that even with the genocide in Gaza, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2064.72s)]
*  that so-called appeal has actually not decreased for many nations around the world. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2070.8s)]
*  Will Barron I mean before, because that's finally what I want to end up just talking about. I mean, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2076.0800000000004s)]
*  in terms of this genocidal onslaught, I mean, I have sometimes thought about Black Mirror, the [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2082.8s)]
*  TV series developed by Charlie Brooker, which kind of looks at dystopian uses of technology, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2090.0s)]
*  with a big, big caveat because nothing in Black Mirror is as depraved and monstrous [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2095.04s)]
*  as what we're seeing. So I think that's quite an important caveat, as dark as Black Mirror can be. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2101.52s)]
*  And not yet. Well, exactly. Well, I mean, that's often the problem. A lot of TV shows and series [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2106.64s)]
*  end up becoming redundant. But we have a thick of it in Britain, which kind of satirized kind of, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2113.68s)]
*  you know, political. And here we are. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2119.28s)]
*  Yeah, but the thick of it is pointless now because everything that's happened since is just so mad [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2123.04s)]
*  and deranged. I think it just looks too tame. But in terms of, for example, the use of artificial [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2127.2000000000003s)]
*  intelligence and PLOS 972, an Israeli Palestinian media outlet have done brilliant work exploring [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2133.1200000000003s)]
*  the use of artificial intelligence and how it's used to select targets, how they know exactly [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2140.88s)]
*  who's at home, how many children at home before they blow it up, including when they select [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2145.44s)]
*  basically low-level targets. But AI is used itself to automatically select the targets. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2149.92s)]
*  And it includes such programs as kind of computer models called Daddy's Home, which is based on [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2156.7200000000003s)]
*  the... Where's Daddy? Sorry, where's that? I got it wrong. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2165.04s)]
*  Yeah, because it's even worse. Yeah. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2167.76s)]
*  It's weird. And because it's the notion of a so-called militant who's then got back to his [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2169.04s)]
*  private home and then you blow him up, including with his own family, and you accept, you put a [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2174.0s)]
*  level of what collateral damage is acceptable. And that's been massively heightened, including [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2178.96s)]
*  for people. Clearly, you're just, you badge anything, Hamas, basically, even if they've got [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2182.64s)]
*  no military value at all. Just talk us through that because it is just, it's so scary. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2186.48s)]
*  Look, one of the things that Israel has done in Gaza beyond the obvious horrors is to give [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2192.4s)]
*  so-called justification to mass slaughter. There was never the point of pinpoint targeting. I mean, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2199.36s)]
*  even putting aside the morality of doing it like that, the point was mass destruction. That was the [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2205.2000000000003s)]
*  point from day one. And some of the reporting from 972, some people I've spoken to as well, many [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2210.6400000000003s)]
*  have said that so much of what Israel has done is infused with this deep sense of anger and grievance [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2217.04s)]
*  and revenge and racism and dehumanization. Anyone who spends any time in Israel or reads Israeli [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2224.32s)]
*  press, in general, with some exceptions, there are no Palestinians, but don't exist. They only [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2231.52s)]
*  exist as either a security threat or as people who deserve to die. You don't hear their stories, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2237.6800000000003s)]
*  you don't hear their narratives, you don't see their tears. I mean, it just doesn't exist. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2243.2000000000003s)]
*  And that's important to understand because so much, I think, what Israel has done from [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2247.04s)]
*  the hundreds, if not thousands of soldiers who are posting day after day after day of their [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2251.6800000000003s)]
*  destruction and dehumanization of Palestinians, which continues day after day after day, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2258.2400000000002s)]
*  that can only happen in a society which supports it. It dehumanizes Palestinians so successfully. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2262.88s)]
*  So when we talk about AI and the use of that in Gaza, I've written and spoken a lot about it. And [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2268.88s)]
*  yes, essentially, Israel is now able to create huge numbers of so-called targets, often people [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2276.64s)]
*  who have maybe some tangential connection to Hamas or not, or not. Justification is then given, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2282.72s)]
*  according to Israeli lawyers, God knows how they make this justification, that we can kill [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2289.8399999999997s)]
*  huge numbers of people who are in the wrong place at the wrong time. Sorry about that, but it's not [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2294.56s)]
*  like there's any global accountability anyway, so why change it? But one of the things that I [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2300.3199999999997s)]
*  always say when I discuss AI is that AI does not operate in a vacuum. AI can only survive and thrive [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2305.36s)]
*  with certain kind of ideology. It's an ideology of extermination. That's the only way to see it. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2312.6400000000003s)]
*  AI is a tool. AI is not sort of politically neutral. AI is infused, in Israel at least, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2317.6800000000003s)]
*  with this concept of mass revenge, mass destruction. So yes, Israel can create huge [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2325.6800000000003s)]
*  numbers of so-called targets from some random person who may have once spoken to a Hamas guy [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2331.84s)]
*  because he had his number on his WhatsApp. And it's important to note that there's massive big tech [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2337.92s)]
*  complicity in this. Amazon and Google are providing huge amounts of cloud services, [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2342.96s)]
*  longer for October 7th, but certainly since. So deep complicity of big tech in what Israel is doing. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2348.2400000000002s)]
*  Israel has been testing and using killer drones, so-called quadcopters, mass surveillance, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2356.0s)]
*  huge amounts of biometric tools. They've been playing with Google Photos, which is an off-the-shelf [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2364.0s)]
*  product which they've been playing with to be able to access huge amounts of data from Palestinians [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2371.76s)]
*  in Gaza and store that information on the cloud provided by Amazon and Google. So this dystopian [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2376.7200000000003s)]
*  future is now, it's here. And I know that there are many governments around the world, despite [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2382.24s)]
*  what they say, publicly are looking to what Israel has done in Gaza with profound admiration. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2389.4399999999996s)]
*  Because ultimately, as I said it before, it's finally over and Israel's got away with it. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2397.2799999999997s)]
*  No one's stopping them. No one has stopped them. Now I can't predict the future. No one can. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2402.16s)]
*  But they've gotten away with it so far. And I don't really see in the short term how that's [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2407.04s)]
*  going to change. Tell us about how the pager attacks in Lebanon, which were described by a [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2412.08s)]
*  former CIA director, terrorism I might add, how do Israel's pager attacks fit into this dystopian [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2417.6s)]
*  future? Yeah, I mean the pager attacks were disturbing. There's obviously been examples of [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2423.68s)]
*  supply chains being screwed with by the US, by China and others. But the first thing I thought [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2430.56s)]
*  of when that happened a few months ago was you've now got a proof of concept that what I feel will [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2436.64s)]
*  happen in years to come, although obviously there was a degree of sophistication to pull that kind [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2443.12s)]
*  of attack off, it takes years to do it. I can readily imagine in years to come, any home appliance [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2446.8799999999997s)]
*  or device, a phone, a fridge, a heater, a TV, anything we have in our homes becomes a weapon. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2455.52s)]
*  And I think that can be blown up. And you'll never know. This could be done by your own government, [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2464.16s)]
*  by a critic, by an enemy, by God knows who. And I know since this pager attack that there are many [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2472.96s)]
*  global intelligence services that saw what Israel did. It's both fear, but also real excitement. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2480.24s)]
*  Now a lot of countries wouldn't be able to get away with that or wouldn't be able to even pull [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2488.56s)]
*  sense that I feel real fear. I'm not talking about, hopefully me personally, I'm talking about what [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2491.92s)]
*  this heralds for the future. That is to say, if your home devices, your personal devices, [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2498.7200000000003s)]
*  not even just your phones, I mean, no, so I start to use pages, right? But fridges, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2504.7200000000003s)]
*  like anything in our modern home can become a weapon. And I think in years to come, like a lot [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2509.28s)]
*  of what Israel does, they will deeply regret it. Israel has really only got away with it because [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2517.84s)]
*  essentially most it's not done back to them. But karma happens. And what I mean by that is that, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2523.44s)]
*  you know, when, how do I say this, that there is something about the laboratory, which the pages, [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2534.32s)]
*  by the way, are a perfect fit with that model. And it's important to say, I'm not arguing everything [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2540.6400000000003s)]
*  Israel's doing is simply to sell it. It's not that Israel's going into Gaza, screwing with pages [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2545.52s)]
*  for its own perceived justification. Not that I accept them, of course, I don't think they're [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2553.12s)]
*  simply doing it to sell it. But I do know when it comes to say AI in Gaza, that there are many [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2557.36s)]
*  countries that look to that with admiration. They say, we could also work, for example, with Google [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2562.4s)]
*  or Amazon and Google or Amazon are also using Gaza as a laboratory because they can also say, [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2568.16s)]
*  you see what we can do in Gaza, we could do that for you as well. In I'm just thinking, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2573.04s)]
*  insert other conflict here. This is the danger of it. And without any kind of regulation or [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2577.92s)]
*  break on what Israel is doing, this laboratory becomes so deeply alluring to many other countries [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2585.92s)]
*  and frankly also allows Israel to imagine a world where in their, I would say, deluded thinking, [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2594.88s)]
*  they are somehow omnipotent. And it's just, I mean, what's crazy about this whole thing, [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2601.2799999999997s)]
*  Owen, is that all this behavior by Israel in the last year, or frankly, the last 80 years, [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2607.6s)]
*  but the last year particularly, has made all of us more unsafe. When I say us, I'm talking about [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2613.2s)]
*  Jews, non-Jews, this delusion somehow that by killing every Hamas leader and Hezbollah leader [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2618.08s)]
*  and God knows how many other people and tens of thousands of civilians and destroying Lebanese [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2624.64s)]
*  villages, all that somehow makes you as Israel safer or Jews safer is just the height of hubris. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2630.64s)]
*  And it's so depressing to see mainstream Jewish leaders around the world in your country, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2638.8799999999997s)]
*  in my country, in the US, claiming that's what Israel has achieved. It's just a deluded lie. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2644.96s)]
*  I mean, I did just in terms of the pager attacks, I was lying awake, I'm sure we've all lost sleep [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2652.72s)]
*  about all sorts of elements of the last year, but just thinking of a future where everyone could be [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2660.88s)]
*  under permanent surveillance where it's immediately knowing what you say and what you do. And any [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2666.0s)]
*  critic, any potential dissident can just be immediately killed just by the press of a button. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2671.44s)]
*  And I just wanted to just finally ask in terms of where, I mean, as if people aren't depressed [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2676.96s)]
*  enough, but we see at the moment, obviously we've seen anti-migrant and anti-refugee politics become [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2685.6s)]
*  very powerful. We've seen the rise of far right authoritarian movements, including of course, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2694.08s)]
*  the Trumpian movement in the United States. And 10 years ago, could a lot of people, would they [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2700.48s)]
*  have taken that kind of politics seriously? I'm not sure. It happened here, the kind of rise of [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2704.64s)]
*  fascistic type movements. And we can see it across Europe at the moment. I mean, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2714.08s)]
*  Hungary is a model that a lot of, in Austria, the far right freedom party came top of the elections. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2718.64s)]
*  I just went there in the aftermath of that. And anti-fascist activists in Austria say, actually, [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2724.64s)]
*  if anything, they're more extreme than Orban. And by the way, and sorry, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2729.2799999999997s)]
*  by the way, those parties he just mentioned love Israel and the feeling is mutual. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2734.32s)]
*  Yeah, I know. I know that Israel is about, Israel, I mean, you saw that in terms of the statements [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2739.12s)]
*  after those parties, how well they did in their response in Israel in terms of politicians and [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2744.0s)]
*  media outlets. Well, I mean, you could just, what do you think? How do you think, you know, [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2749.36s)]
*  we're looking at that in terms of, and also I didn't even mention the climate emergency [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2754.0s)]
*  and the impact, well, the emissions, which were overwhelmingly the global North is guilty of, [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2757.68s)]
*  but will be felt most catastrophically in our already. That's reality in the global South, [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2764.4s)]
*  but how that has an impact in terms of, you know, population movements, all the rest. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2769.2s)]
*  How do you see this in terms of the danger of what the global North could look at what Israel's and [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2773.8399999999997s)]
*  basically look at the rest of the world like that? And we're going to [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2781.2s)]
*  protect ourselves from the mob outside. I mean, this is what I call the Palestinianization of [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2784.8s)]
*  the world. And what I mean by that is that many first world nations or global North, whatever [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2791.28s)]
*  tentative you want to use, US, UK, much of Europe, Australia, my country and others, view [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2797.6800000000003s)]
*  that so-called risk of huge amounts of refugees as not an opportunity, but a way to both literally [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2805.28s)]
*  and metaphorically build high walls, more security, more surveillance, more so-called [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2812.72s)]
*  protection. And a lot of that experience that those countries are going to go to the so-called [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2817.2799999999997s)]
*  border industrial complex is Israel. It's not only Israel, the US obviously is a big player in that [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2821.4399999999996s)]
*  too, but Israel is a key player, massive player in fact, in that surging industry. And the fact [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2826.64s)]
*  that there's a, there's already the latest UN figures of refugees in the world is the highest [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2834.16s)]
*  since World War II. It's only going to increase in the coming years because of the climate [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2839.2s)]
*  emergency amongst other issues. And I see, don't want to get too dystopian here, but [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2842.64s)]
*  too late. I know exactly. Yeah. Yeah. That ship sailed in it a long time ago, but no, I think the, [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2851.04s)]
*  the idea of seeing, as we talked about before, Israel as an ideal model and ghetto to copy [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2857.2799999999997s)]
*  what the Europeans increasingly want to do with offshoring refugees. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2865.6s)]
*  It's Australia's done for a long time, by the way, sending migrants to far away places to detain [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2871.68s)]
*  them, to allegedly process them, but often they're in limbo for years in some of those facilities, [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2877.36s)]
*  including in Greece, which is a testing ground now for much of this, there's a lot of Israeli tech. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2882.3199999999997s)]
*  And in some ways it makes sense because many European nations, parts of the EU, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2887.92s)]
*  establishment, the globe, parts of the European far right from Sweden to France to Germany [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2895.76s)]
*  are looking to Israel as the model. Now again, to be clear, I don't think everything that, [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2903.04s)]
*  you know, the Swedish far right does is because of Israel. Of course, that's not the case. They're [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2908.0800000000004s)]
*  doing it for their own diluted reasons, but there is a sense often that the far right wants to kind [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2911.92s)]
*  of whitewash itself by being friends with Israel and saying, you see, it's like, Oh, my best friends [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2918.32s)]
*  are Jewish. I love the Jews. I'm best friends with the Israeli government. And to me, what worries [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2923.12s)]
*  me is that as Israel moves, not inevitably, but more and more likely towards a potential [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2931.3599999999997s)]
*  theocratic future, a Jewish theocracy, that the vision of those people in Israel is essentially [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2937.04s)]
*  Afghanistan. That is their vision, obviously Jewish, not Muslim. That's their view. Now, [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2942.64s)]
*  it's not a majority of Israelis who think that, but it's a sizable and powerful minority in Israel [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2946.56s)]
*  who frankly have the political ascendancy have for years, part of the more religious, [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2953.2799999999997s)]
*  hardcore nationalist movement, the ones who are the settlers. And I've said this as an aside that [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2958.96s)]
*  if Israel wants to have one or two million settlers in the West Bank, which they claim they do, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2964.4s)]
*  the only way that's going to happen, by the way, is if evangelical Christians are allowed to settle [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2969.44s)]
*  there, because there aren't enough Jews in the world that want to go. There just isn't. So [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2974.4s)]
*  especially as Jewish Americans diverge in their opinions, [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2980.32s)]
*  in which is particularly younger American Jews have turned away from that's being replaced by [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2983.5200000000004s)]
*  evangelicals and the American right and Orthodox Jews. So as liberal Jews, more and more, the only [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2990.32s)]
*  set of one of the signs of hope to some extent is that you this is a civil war going on in the [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=2996.96s)]
*  Jewish community. There's a lot of younger Jews, thankfully, who don't share the hard right fascist [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=3001.6800000000003s)]
*  policies of Israel, and they're increasingly other moving away from Israel entirely or trying [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=3006.08s)]
*  to fight for a different kind of Judaism within their own communities, which I very much support. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=3011.44s)]
*  But they're being replaced. And Israel sees it this way is Israel thinks they've lost the liberal [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=3016.56s)]
*  world anyway. But they're gone, so to speak. This is the case even before October 7. But more so [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=3023.6s)]
*  since being replaced by evangelicals, by Orthodox Jews and by the global right and far right. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=3029.84s)]
*  So the challenge to me moving forward is how do we deal with the fact that those nations and [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=3036.3199999999997s)]
*  countries and groups, some of whom are deeply anti Semitic, want to put Israel on a pedestal [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=3042.56s)]
*  and say that is our model. We want to have a France or a Germany or a Sweden or an America [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=3051.52s)]
*  akin to Israel, not Jewish, but Christian hardline nationalist, ethno nationalist vision. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=3058.08s)]
*  With the use of Israeli surveillance tech and weapons and border tech. And that is a petrifying [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=3066.24s)]
*  future, which I don't think enough people have recognized. I don't think I've been so eloquently [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=3071.2799999999997s)]
*  slapped in the face repeatedly before. I say that in the best possible way. What I mean is sobering, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=3078.56s)]
*  sobering to say the least. I know. Sorry, I can't end with a bit of a happier outcome. But here we [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=3084.72s)]
*  are. Well, I mean, it's happy in the sense that we want people to listen to this and to be... [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=3089.52s)]
*  Yeah. We can't fight terrible frightening injustices and problems unless we're aware [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=3094.0s)]
*  of what they actually are. And I think the danger is a lot of people aren't aware of this. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=3101.12s)]
*  They don't know what happens. Well, they're not aware of it because so much of our [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=3105.04s)]
*  mainstream media obviously refuses to actually tell us what's actually happening. And they're [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=3109.6s)]
*  complicit in what's happening. Political actors. And we've seen that all the way through this [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=3113.92s)]
*  horror, but we've seen it through so many others. But that's why it's important people, you know, [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=3119.2s)]
*  the knowledge people are being armed with here has to be put to good use. So the positive to [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=3122.72s)]
*  come out of this is you were warned, everyone. You have been warned. You need to listen to this [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=3127.3599999999997s)]
*  and you need to take it very, very seriously because it could be our future. We already see [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=3132.16s)]
*  the dystopian future emerging around us. So don't... We're not crying wolf here. Make sure [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=3137.52s)]
*  you listen to the podcasts and drop site news, the Palestine and the Policy. Make sure you get the [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=3144.24s)]
*  book. Also just get all of Anthony's books while you're at it. Just go to big Anthony, Loan Sime [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=3148.16s)]
*  binge. That'd be great. But honestly, it's a must listen and must read book. So make sure you share [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=3152.64s)]
*  this video as well. Press like and subscribe and leave comments. Great for the algorithm. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=3160.48s)]
*  More people then listen to what Anthony has to say. Share it far and wide everywhere. Anthony, [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=3165.12s)]
*  thank you so, so much for joining us. Yeah, thanks so much. I really appreciate it. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2sQ54gbmzo&t=3171.28s)]
