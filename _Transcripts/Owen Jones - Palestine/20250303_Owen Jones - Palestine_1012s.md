# Israel Resumes GENOCIDE In Gaza - And Western Media Covers It Up
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw)
*  Israel's genocide against the Palestinian people of Gaza has resumed. Israel has announced a total [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=0.0s)]
*  siege on Gaza, blocking all humanitarian aid from getting in, and it has done this, in theory, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=6.0s)]
*  to unilaterally impose new ceasefire terms in defiance of the deal that's been agreed. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=12.08s)]
*  In practice, clearly, this is a deliberate attempt to collapse the ceasefire and unleash [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=18.0s)]
*  Israel's greatest military mayhem yet, with the aim of implementing Donald Trump's [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=23.2s)]
*  forced removal of the surviving Palestinian population of Gaza. Indeed, Israel's military [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=29.279999999999998s)]
*  attacks on Gaza resumed yesterday, and bear in mind dozens of Palestinians have been killed by [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=35.68s)]
*  the Israeli army since the so-called ceasefire began in January. All of this is being suppressed [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=40.72s)]
*  and misrepresented by the vast majority of the Western media, who once again cannot do their [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=46.72s)]
*  basic task in explaining the inarguable facts because their coverage is so slanted in favour of [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=52.24s)]
*  pro-Israel narratives. Now, yesterday the official Prime Minister of Israel account tweeted the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=58.88s)]
*  following, With the conclusion of the first stage of the hostages deal and in light of Hamas's [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=64.0s)]
*  refusal to accept the Witkoff framework for the continuation of the talks to which Israel agreed, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=69.28s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu decided, as of this morning, entry of all goods and supplies to the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=74.4s)]
*  Gaza Strip be halted. Now, I'll come on to what they say about the continuation of the talks, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=79.76s)]
*  the framework, the Witkoff framework. Firstly, before I do, what you've just heard there [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=86.24000000000001s)]
*  is a confession of a war crime. There is no ifs, there is no buts, there is no debate to be had, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  there is no other possible legal interpretation. This is a confession of a war crime. It is a war [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=99.76s)]
*  crime according to Article 33 of the Geneva Conventions, which states, No protected person [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=107.84s)]
*  may be punished for an offence he or she has not personally committed. Collective penalties and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=113.44s)]
*  likewise all measures of intimidation or of terrorism are prohibited. Succinctly, this [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=119.28s)]
*  prohibits the collective punishment of a civilian population. That's what this is, collective [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  punishment. It imposes a punishment on the civilians for having committed no crime. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=134.24s)]
*  They are innocent civilians. You cannot impose a punishment upon them, depriving them of the means [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=141.60000000000002s)]
*  of life. It is against the law. Furthermore, as per the International Court of Justice, which is [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=146.24s)]
*  the United Nations highest court, this is of course the highest court on earth. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=151.68s)]
*  Gaza, like the West Bank and East Jerusalem, is under Israeli belligerent occupation. As summed [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=156.0s)]
*  up nicely by two legal experts in the Journal of Conflict and Security Law, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=161.6s)]
*  as an occupant asserting effective control over Gaza in addition to having an obligation to provide [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=165.92s)]
*  humanitarian guarantees under international humanitarian law to the civilian population in [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=171.68s)]
*  Gaza, Israel has a duty to provide fundamental human rights under international human rights law. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=176.72s)]
*  This means, of course, ensuring the means of life are provided. Furthermore, as the legally binding [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=183.28s)]
*  Provisional Orders of the International Court of Justice ordered last year, the State of Israel [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=190.56s)]
*  shall immediately take all effective measures to ensure and facilitate the unimpeded access to [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=195.68s)]
*  Gaza of the United Nations and other officials engaged in the provision of humanitarian aid and [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=201.28s)]
*  assistance to the population of Gaza. Furthermore, as if we need another furthermore, the core plank [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  of the arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court against Israeli Prime Minister [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence minister Yoav Galan focus on exactly this, starvation as a [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=216.88s)]
*  method of warfare. Now, even though the likes of Galan at the very start very explicitly announced [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=224.4s)]
*  the siege against what he described as human animals, Israel spent the genocide gaslighting [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=230.48s)]
*  us all about it. Despite in practice doing everything possible they could do to impede the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=235.2s)]
*  entry of aid into Gaza and then impede the distribution of aid throughout Gaza, they kept [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=240.4s)]
*  pretending that they were allowing that aid into Gaza. Well, they're not doing that now, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=245.44s)]
*  are they? They are openly confessing to starvation as a method of warfare. They are stating they are [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=248.72s)]
*  blocking aid from entering in order to achieve their aims in negotiations. Let's listen to Benjamin Netanyahu here. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=253.92s)]
*  He says here there are no free lunches. Well, actually Israel is obliged to allow aid [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=275.44s)]
*  to get into Gaza. That is the law and simply adds weight as if more weight was needed [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=280.8s)]
*  to the arrest warrants which are out for Netanyahu as well as his former defence minister. Now, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=287.76s)]
*  according to Israel's public broadcaster, Kahn News, Gaza has enough food supplies for four months, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=294.8s)]
*  so in order to enforce the siege it is halting all fuel supplies, which is absolutely critical [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=300.48s)]
*  for say distributing aid to the population via trucks. It also is considering cutting off water [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=306.08000000000004s)]
*  to the whole of Gaza. I don't need to explain the implications of that and fresh clean water [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  is in desperate limited supply throughout Gaza. Indeed, while aid has been allowed into Gaza as [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=320.72s)]
*  part of the ceasefire deal, the Strip is in a catastrophic situation after Israel's strategy [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=325.2s)]
*  of annihilation. As Oxfam note, when our teams assessed the conditions in Gaza in the wake of [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=330.96s)]
*  the January 19th announcement of a temporary ceasefire, they encountered apocalyptic scenes [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=336.24s)]
*  of complete destruction and famine-like conditions. People in Gaza are in need of everything, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=341.2s)]
*  life-saving water, food, sanitation and other necessities, as well as equipment critically [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=345.84s)]
*  needed for restoration of water and electricity. The goods that were able to enter during the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=350.0s)]
*  weeks of ceasefire have brought some relief but remain a drop in the ocean. Even in this ceasefire, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=355.2s)]
*  Israel keeps blocking vital supplies such as medical equipment on the grounds they could have [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=360.4s)]
*  dual use that is supposedly turned into weapons. The healthcare system has been ravaged. There is [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=365.44s)]
*  an acute lack of shelter for a population that has been repeatedly violently displaced, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=370.72s)]
*  almost all of their homes destroyed or damaged beyond use. There is no sewage system and human [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=375.6s)]
*  waste is overflowing. Israel refuses to allow that to be removed. I could go on. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=380.24s)]
*  Now the Israeli Finance Minister Bezelal Smotrich last month called for the gates of hell to be [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=384.40000000000003s)]
*  opened. He says now that the move now imposed by Israel was the threshold of the gates of hell, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=389.68s)]
*  adding, now we need to open those gates as quickly and lethally as possible on the cruel enemy, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=396.16s)]
*  until absolute victory, talking about cruel enemies there, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=401.84s)]
*  whilst blocking all the means of life and demanding a catastrophic renewed military onslaught. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=406.08s)]
*  Astonishing stuff. Where was the media coverage of all of this? Listen to the brilliant independent [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=414.47999999999996s)]
*  journalist Rachel Shabby calling us out on the Sky newspaper review. First of all, I want to [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=419.35999999999996s)]
*  just note that all the papers are leading with this and none of the papers have anything about [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=424.56s)]
*  your second leading story, which is about Israel collapsing the ceasefire and blocking humanitarian [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=433.12s)]
*  aid to Gaza, which is a war crime. And it is striking that that has not made any of the [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=440.64s)]
*  fronts as a couple of nibs, one on the FT, one on the Times. Sky News itself framed Israel ripping [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=446.32s)]
*  up the ceasefire deal and imposing an illegal siege like so. Hamas rejects Israeli request [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=451.52s)]
*  to extend first phase of Gaza ceasefire deal. Indeed the CNN headline read as follows, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=456.96s)]
*  Israel stops humanitarian aid into Gaza after Hamas rejects extending the first phase. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=462.88s)]
*  All of this is deceit. It is deflecting blame away from Israel. As the Palestinian analyst [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=467.35999999999996s)]
*  Mohammed Shahada points out, the agreement states phase one should be automatically [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=475.03999999999996s)]
*  extended indefinitely as long as phase two negotiations are ongoing. Israel is trying [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=479.36s)]
*  to stop phase two of the ceasefire deal happening, which allows for a lasting ceasefire to end the [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=483.28000000000003s)]
*  war. That's what it paves the way towards and indeed to end Israel's genocide. The Israeli [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=487.92s)]
*  state say they agree to a proposal from Steve Witkoff, Trump's released envoy, to extend the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=492.72s)]
*  first phase rather than proceed to the second phase. As Dropsite News' Jeremy Scargill reveals, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=497.2s)]
*  it was announced that Hamas had rejected the deal before they'd even been briefed on it officially. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=503.04s)]
*  The job of journalists should be to tell the facts. Let's listen to this from the BBC shall [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=508.0s)]
*  we? The United Nations and several Arab countries have accused Israel of breaking international law [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=512.8s)]
*  after it stopped all humanitarian aid from entering Gaza. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=517.76s)]
*  Netanyahu made the decision after Hamas refused to accept an American proposal to extend the first [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=523.12s)]
*  phase of the ceasefire which expired on Saturday. Hamas says blocking aid is cheap blackmail. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=529.2s)]
*  Why does the BBC say Israel is accused of breaking international law? It is a fact that [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=536.0s)]
*  international law has been broken here. You can't turn that fact into a subjective opinion. It's [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=539.2s)]
*  not a violation of objectivity to state the facts. If your house is on fire and you say your house is [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=544.4s)]
*  on fire and I say your house isn't on fire, the job of the journalist there is not to go, well, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=549.76s)]
*  one person says the house is on fire but the other person says it isn't on fire. The job of a journalist [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=553.28s)]
*  there in those circumstances is to state the truth. Now, furthermore, this report frames from the BBC, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=556.96s)]
*  Hamas rejecting Israeli proposals to extend the ceasefire rather than Israel violating the agreed [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=564.24s)]
*  ceasefire deal. As for the European Union, they issued a statement which is a total disgrace. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=572.8000000000001s)]
*  They condemned the refusal of Hamas to accept the extension of the first phase of the ceasefire [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=577.76s)]
*  agreement on Gaza. What are they on exactly? Israel has unilaterally ripped up the ceasefire [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=581.6800000000001s)]
*  deal because the second phase moves towards a lasting ceasefire which Israel doesn't want [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=586.4s)]
*  because Israel wants to keep committing genocide. Israel has further resumed armed attacks in Gaza, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=590.24s)]
*  killing and wounding civilians in Rafeh, Beit Hanan, Kaan, Eunis, amongst other places. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=596.24s)]
*  A dental student in Gaza tweets an image of an explosion in the sky, adding, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=601.04s)]
*  Gaza right now from my window is getting worse. Feels like this is the end. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=605.1999999999999s)]
*  The resumption of genocide in Gaza isn't the only horror being cooked up by Israel. Israel has been [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=610.4s)]
*  looking for excuses to invade Syria, using the pretext of defending the Druze minority there. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=616.08s)]
*  Israel Katz, the defence minister declared, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=621.9200000000001s)]
*  We will not allow the extreme Islamic regime in Syria to harm the Druze. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=624.1600000000001s)]
*  If the regime harms the Druze, it will be struck by us. Netanyahu and Katz specifically refer to [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=627.9200000000001s)]
*  what is being described as the Druze village of Dramama, but as the Syrian doctor Karim Alijian [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=633.5200000000001s)]
*  puts it, this is insane. I don't know a single Syrian who ever considered Dramama. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=639.5200000000001s)]
*  At Dramama to be a Druze village. It's not even a village, it's a suburb of Damascus. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=645.76s)]
*  In fact, you'll find that besides Druze living there, it's more predominantly populated with [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=650.4s)]
*  Iraqi Christians and Palestinian refugees who indeed fled from Israel's genocide. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=655.12s)]
*  The deceptive Israeli propaganda campaign against Syria has gone on complete overdrive. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=659.68s)]
*  Indeed, this is just an excuse to get the Israeli forces essentially to Damascus. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=666.48s)]
*  I mean, it's very transparent what they're doing here. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=672.16s)]
*  Much of the Israeli state was to Balkanise Damascus. They wanted to divide it into statelets. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=675.44s)]
*  The Druze citizens of Syria have been protesting against Israel's claims to be protecting them [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=680.08s)]
*  as an excuse to impose an occupation on Syria. Indeed, following an agreement with the Druze, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=684.72s)]
*  the Syrian general security personnel entered Jaromana and were waving the Druze flag as a [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=689.2s)]
*  sign of unity. Now look, the news from the Middle East seems unrelentingly grim. Not [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=696.4s)]
*  least as Israel resumes its genocide in Gaza and as Donald Trump threatens the violent expulsion [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=701.4399999999999s)]
*  of the entire surviving population of Gaza. But hope has come in an unlikely place. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=707.6s)]
*  No other land was made by a Palestinian Israeli collective of activists and journalists. It is [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=713.04s)]
*  about the ethnic cleansing of Masafah Yatta in the West Bank by the Israeli army. That's where [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=718.56s)]
*  one of the directors, Basil Adra, comes from. It's a film about what's happened to his home. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=727.3599999999999s)]
*  Yesterday, No Other Land won the Oscar for Best Documentary. Before I explain why it offers hope, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=733.8399999999999s)]
*  let's hear the acceptance speech from Basil Adra and his co-director, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=740.7199999999999s)]
*  the Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham, who I've interviewed previously about his journalism [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=744.16s)]
*  exposing Israeli war crimes. Thank you to the Academy for the award. It's such a big honor for [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=749.4399999999999s)]
*  the four of us and everybody who supported us for this documentary. About two months ago, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=759.68s)]
*  I became a father and my hope to my daughter that she will not have to live the same life I'm living [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=764.9599999999999s)]
*  now, always fearing settlers' violence, home demolitions, and forest pill displacements [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=770.72s)]
*  that my community, Masafah Yatta, is living and facing every day under the Israeli occupation. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=782.32s)]
*  No Other Land reflects the harsh reality that we have been enduring for decades and still [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=788.48s)]
*  resist as we call on the world to take serious actions to stop the injustice [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=797.2s)]
*  and to stop the ethnic cleansing of Palestinian people. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=802.64s)]
*  We made this film, Palestinians and Israelis, because together our voices are stronger. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=811.04s)]
*  We see each other, the atrocious destruction of Gaza and its people, which must end [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=819.92s)]
*  Israeli hostages brutally taken in the crime of October 7th, which must be freed. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=827.52s)]
*  When I look at Basel, I see my brother, but we are unequal. We live in a regime where I am free [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=832.48s)]
*  under civilian law and Basel is under military laws that destroy his life and he cannot control. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=839.92s)]
*  There is a different path, a political solution without ethnic supremacy, with national rights [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=845.28s)]
*  for both of our people. And I have to say, as I am here, the foreign policy in this country [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=852.32s)]
*  is helping to block this path. And, you know, why? Can't you see that we are intertwined? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=857.9200000000001s)]
*  That my people can be truly safe if Basel's people are truly free and safe? There is another way. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=871.0400000000001s)]
*  It's not too late for life, for the living. There is no other way. Thank you. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=878.48s)]
*  In front of the whole world, Israel's occupation, apartheid, ethnic cleansing and annihilation of [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=887.44s)]
*  Gaza was denounced. Now look, as heartening as this Oscar win might be, some of you might [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=892.32s)]
*  recently ask, why does it really offer hope? What is a documentary winning an award compared to [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=896.8000000000001s)]
*  Israel's genocidal onslaught against the Palestinian people? Well, I'll tell you, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=901.76s)]
*  that Israel's genocide is currently succeeding is unquestionably true. But a film about Israel's [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=906.24s)]
*  murderous occupation, about its murderous oppression of the Palestinian people won an Oscar, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=911.84s)]
*  despite this being the height of a McCarthyite campaign against anyone who dares speak out [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=917.76s)]
*  about the horrors being inflicted on the Palestinian people. This is a film which [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=922.8s)]
*  couldn't find a distributor in the US because they all refused to have anything to do with it. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=926.88s)]
*  What this signifies, this Oscar, is a symptom or emblematic of Western society being increasingly [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=932.24s)]
*  repulsed by Israel's depraved behavior. Israel is losing in the worlds of public opinion and culture. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=939.52s)]
*  In time, those Western societies will force their governments to stop arming and supporting Israel, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=947.12s)]
*  and Israel depends on that support in order to continue its hideous oppression. Another thing [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=952.4s)]
*  too for those cheerleaders of Israel's depravity. In the here and now, in this time of Israel's [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=958.0s)]
*  critics being silenced, hounded, harassed, sacked, arrested, if an Oscar is being won for this kind of [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=963.76s)]
*  film, what happens next is nailed on. You are going to go down in history as depraved monsters, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKCf3Wj0pNw&t=969.44s)]
