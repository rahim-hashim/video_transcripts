# Israel's Allies PANIC As 14,000 Babies Face DEATH - They Know A RECKONING Is Coming
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo)
*  Panic. Panic is beginning to break out in Western capitals as governments realise the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=0.0s)]
*  scale of the crime they helped facilitate from day one is impossible to deny, to corrupt, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=5.2s)]
*  to deflect from and that a reckoning is coming for them. Let's set the hideous scene. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=11.28s)]
*  14,000 Palestinian babies could die in Gaza over the next 48 hours without aid. That's [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=17.12s)]
*  according to Tom Fletcher, the United Nations' main humanitarian official. Just absorb that [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=22.8s)]
*  fact. Consider the implications. Keep at the front of your mind that this is because of a crime [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=27.44s)]
*  been committed by Israel, a Western ally, in essence a Western state, which is armed and [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=32.24s)]
*  backed by Western states like the United States and Britain. And as Israel's leaders issue their most [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=37.52s)]
*  genocidal statements yet, and brace yourself what I'm going to tell you, as I say, panic is breaking [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=44.24s)]
*  out in the corridors of power in countries like Britain because they know, they know a reckoning [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  is coming and everyone complicit in this crime will be made to account for their words and for [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=54.88s)]
*  their deeds. That's why the embarrassingly weak latest action by the British government [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=59.36s)]
*  tells us a story. I'm going to come on to that. Let's start by listening to what the United Nations [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=64.64s)]
*  Humanitarian Chief told BBC Radio 4. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=69.76s)]
*  We are demanding that the world back us in pushing Israel to let us get in and reach those [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=84.88s)]
*  people who are starving right now. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=90.8s)]
*  Now that's a drop in the ocean. And let's be clear, those five trucks are just sat on the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=100.08s)]
*  other side of the border right now. They've not reached the communities they need to reach. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=104.0s)]
*  Let me describe what is on those trucks. This is baby food, baby nutrition. There are 14,000 babies [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=108.8s)]
*  that will die in the next 48 hours unless we can reach them. This is not food that Hamas are going [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=114.8s)]
*  to steal. We run the risk of looting. We run the risks of being hit as part of the Israeli military [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=120.24s)]
*  offensive. We run all sorts of risks trying to get that baby food through to those mothers who [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  cannot feed their children right now because they're malnourished. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=133.2s)]
*  Bear in mind that Israel has instituted a total siege of Gaza since the beginning of March, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  blocking anything and everything from getting in, a wanton violation of international law. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=140.64s)]
*  Bear in mind too that the daily massacres currently being perpetrated with Israeli weapons [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=144.88s)]
*  right now may well be deadlier than at any point in the last 19 months of this genocide. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  Which brings us to Yair Golan, a former Israeli general and an opposition leader, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=155.11999999999998s)]
*  often touted as a moderate. If you're an example of what qualifies as moderate in Israel, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=159.04s)]
*  earlier this year Golan declared, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=163.44s)]
*  have simply disappeared. Golan now tells the official public broadcaster in Israel, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=170.64s)]
*  Israel is on the way to becoming a pariah state, like South Africa was, if we don't return to [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=175.76s)]
*  acting like a sane country, conveniently whitewashing Israel's past war crimes. He added, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=180.0s)]
*  a sane country does not fight against civilians, does not kill babies as a hobby, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=185.27999999999997s)]
*  and does not give itself the aim of expelling populations. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=188.72s)]
*  And there we have it, a confession, incidentally by an Israeli politician who like almost the entire [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=192.16s)]
*  Israeli political elite, backed Israel's genocidal onslaught from day one, even when it was very [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=196.8s)]
*  clear what it would be from day one. And it's a confession which is provoked outrage by Netanyahu, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=202.16000000000003s)]
*  who has a, a restaurant against him for crimes against humanity and war crimes by the International [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  Criminal Court. He says, I vehemently condemn the wild incitement from Yair Golan against our [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=211.36s)]
*  heroic soldiers and against the state of Israel. The IDF is the most moral army in the world, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=215.76000000000002s)]
*  and our soldiers are fighting in a war for our existence. Wait until I come on to the latest [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=219.76000000000002s)]
*  pronouncements by the Israeli government, but this really is sensational stuff from Netanyahu, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=223.84s)]
*  who goes on to accuse Golan of despicable anti-Semitic blood libel against IDF soldiers [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=227.84s)]
*  and the state of Israel. The abuse of anti-Semitism, a profound evil, to smear anyone and everyone who [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=233.28s)]
*  critiques Israel's mass butchery of Palestinians, has of course been a defining feature of the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=238.88s)]
*  orchestrated attempt to silence opposition to genocide and before the apartheid. And there it [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=243.6s)]
*  is, deployed against the Jewish-Israeli opposition leader, a former Israeli general who has in fact [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  backed a genocidal onslaught which at the very beginning of this year had already killed over [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=253.52s)]
*  1,000 Palestinian babies, according to official statistics which repeated academic research has [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=258.40000000000003s)]
*  shown represents a grave underestimate, with even The Economist, a right-wing magazine which backed [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=263.6s)]
*  Israel's onslaught now estimating the number of Palestinians in Gaza who have suffered violent [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=268.8s)]
*  deaths at the hands of the Israeli military is 109,000, over twice the official figure, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=273.36s)]
*  one in 20 of the pre-war population. Bear in mind, the biggest killer by far, as we know from [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=278.32s)]
*  precedent, will be indirect causes. Now let's move on to what is being proposed by the Israeli [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=282.4s)]
*  government who have announced some humanitarian aid will be allowed in. Before you treat this as [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=287.76s)]
*  some sort of climb down or meaningful concession, let's just look, let's listen, let's read what [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=291.76s)]
*  Israeli leaders have actually said. Note these comments have barely been adequately covered by [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=296.96s)]
*  the Western media, but the brilliant drop site news has thankfully translated them for us. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=300.88s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu declared the following, we're going to take control of all the Gaza Strip, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=304.56s)]
*  that's in a video which he released, saying that Israel would begin delivering [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=309.2s)]
*  minimal humanitarian aid, freedom of medicine only. He goes on, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=313.28s)]
*  Our best friends in the world, senators I know as strong supporters of Israel, have warned that [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=316.71999999999997s)]
*  they cannot support us if images of mass starvation emerge. They come to me and say, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=320.24s)]
*  we'll give you all the help you need to win the war, but we can't be receiving pictures of famine. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=324.56s)]
*  He adds that in order for Israel to continue its onslaught, we need to do it in a way that they [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=328.71999999999997s)]
*  won't stop us. In other words, all about optics. Netanyahu is declaring that only minimal humanitarian [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=332.96s)]
*  aid will get in, not to stop the Palestinian people from starving to death in practice, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=338.56s)]
*  but to minimise pressure on Israel to stop it from completing its genocide. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=342.24s)]
*  To emphasise this point, enter Bezalel Samotrich, the Minister of Finance, a far-right extremist [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=347.12s)]
*  who has never tried to restrain his genocidal mania, who has repeatedly previously opposed [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=352.24s)]
*  all humanitarian aid from getting into Gaza. But he's backed Netanyahu's announcement, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=356.24s)]
*  which tells you all you need to know. In a proff press conference, he declared, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=360.72s)]
*  The aid that will enter Gaza in the coming days is the tiniest amount. A handful of bakeries [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=365.36s)]
*  that will hand out pita bread to people in public kitchens. People in Gaza will get a pita and a [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=369.68s)]
*  food plate and that's it. Exactly what we are seeing in the videos, people standing in line [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=373.44s)]
*  and waiting to have someone serve them with some soup plate. Truth be told, until the last of the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=378.15999999999997s)]
*  hostages return, we should also not let water into the Gaza Strip. But the reality is, is that if we [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=382.08s)]
*  do that, the world will force us to halt the war immediately and to lose. It would be winning the [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=387.76s)]
*  battle and losing the war. I'm committed to winning the war. We are disassembling Gaza and [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=391.6s)]
*  leaving it as piles of rubble with total destruction, which has no precedent globally. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=396.40000000000003s)]
*  And the world isn't stopping us. There are pressures. There are those who attack us. They [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=400.72s)]
*  are trying to make a stop. They are not succeeding. You know why they aren't succeeding because we are [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=404.0s)]
*  navigating the campaign responsibly and wisely. And that's how we'll continue to do it. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=409.44s)]
*  As DropSite News conclude here, Smotrich said that the Israeli forces are initiating a campaign to [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=414.08000000000004s)]
*  force Palestinians into the south of Gaza, and from there, God willing, to third countries as [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=418.32s)]
*  part of President Trump's plan. This is a change of the course of history. Nothing less. Absorb. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=422.96s)]
*  Just absorb what's being said there. Netanyahu's Minister of Finance openly declares that Gaza is [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=429.68s)]
*  being entirely destroyed with a total destruction which has no precedent as well as the total [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=434.24s)]
*  removal of whichever survivors remain from Gaza. And he's boasting that the world is not stopping [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=438.8s)]
*  Israel. He's stating a basic truth. Western governments who have armed and backed Israel [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=443.52s)]
*  have allowed them to facilitate genocide. They've imposed genocide themselves through [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=447.84s)]
*  their actions. And it goes much further than that. It's the Western media who have legitimately [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=453.28s)]
*  supported YROSH and failed to accurately cover one of history's great crimes from day one. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=457.52s)]
*  Without the Western media, Western governments would never have gotten away with facilitating [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=462.88s)]
*  this abomination. Listen to what these genocide maniacs are saying. That is the truth of what [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=467.35999999999996s)]
*  they are saying. Indeed, listen to what Zvi Sukkot, an Israeli politician who is in Smotrich's [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=473.12s)]
*  party, had to say. Last night, almost 100 Gazans were killed. That's what he said. Nobody cares [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=478.16s)]
*  about it anymore. Everyone just got used to the idea you can kill 100 Gazans in one night and [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=496.48s)]
*  nobody in the world cares. There it is. Openly stating the obvious truth that the Western [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=500.4s)]
*  political and media elites allowed Israel and is allowing Israel to get away with genocide. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=504.56s)]
*  So let's come on now to David Lammy, the British Foreign Secretary. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=509.67999999999995s)]
*  And frankly, it's an affront to the values of the British people. Therefore, today, I'm announcing [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=530.64s)]
*  that we have suspended negotiations with this Israeli government on a new free trade agreement. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=539.68s)]
*  We will be reviewing cooperation with them under the 2030 bilateral roadmap. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=548.0799999999999s)]
*  The Netanyahu government's actions have made this necessary. Today, my honourable friend, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=554.64s)]
*  the Minister for the Middle East, is summoning the Israeli ambassadors to the Foreign Office to [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=563.52s)]
*  convey this message. I say now to the people of Israel, we want, I want, a strong friendship [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=568.7199999999999s)]
*  with you based on shared values, with flourishing ties between our people and societies. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=580.5600000000001s)]
*  We are unwavering in our commitment to your security and to your future, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=588.72s)]
*  to countering the very real threat from Iran, the scourge of terrorism and the evils of anti-Semitism. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=593.36s)]
*  But the conduct of the war in Gaza is damaging our relationship with your government. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=600.72s)]
*  And as the Prime Minister has said, if Israel pursues this military offensive, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=608.48s)]
*  as it has threatened, failing to ensure the unhindered provision of aid, we will take further [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=613.84s)]
*  action in response. This is pathetic. Absolutely pathetic. All the British government has done [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=621.4399999999999s)]
*  here is suspend trade negotiations and summon the Israeli ambassador. Oh, I bet she's quaking in [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=627.1999999999999s)]
*  her boots. Is the minister going to be all disappointed and do a sad face about all the [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=631.28s)]
*  Palestinian children that the British government has helped to murder? Incidentally, I'm sure the [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=634.0s)]
*  Israeli ambassador, if she's not completely fit, could point that out. They've also announced [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=639.04s)]
*  sanctions on some extremist settlers, which is less than the action mooted by former [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=642.4s)]
*  Conservative Foreign Minister David Cameron, who declared that he had been planning on [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=645.84s)]
*  sanctioning two Israeli ministers, Bezalel Smotrich and Ben Gavir. They haven't even done that. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=650.88s)]
*  As a Conservative MP, Kit Mulhouse says, the anger and the outrage of the foreign [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=655.2s)]
*  secretaries appreciated by us all and I sense that it is genuine. Well, I was going to say a [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=659.68s)]
*  better man than me. I mean, I respect Kit Mulhouse. I never thought he'd say that. He's a rival and [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=665.3599999999999s)]
*  conservative, but he's spoken out with infinitely more humanity about this than most Labour MPs. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=669.5999999999999s)]
*  I don't believe anything the Foreign Secretary says is genuine. Anyway, he knows as well as I [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=674.4799999999999s)]
*  do that the Israelis couldn't give a damn what he says in this chamber or indeed for the statement. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=678.0s)]
*  And as he will know, since that statement is issued, dozens of Palestinians have been killed [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=682.56s)]
*  and there have been voices of defiance from the Israeli government. Now the statement mentions [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=686.0s)]
*  the taking of concrete action. I'm not quite sure what the trigger for that is. And many of us, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=689.52s)]
*  many of these in this chamber have been trying to spur the government into taking action. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=693.4399999999999s)]
*  Over the last few months, we've tried anger and outrage and got nowhere. We've tried shaming [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=698.3199999999999s)]
*  ministers and action got nowhere. So maybe we need to beg. Here's the truth. The government knows a [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=701.6s)]
*  reckoning is coming and the truth of what this government did cannot be erased in that reckoning. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=706.56s)]
*  When the genocide began, Keir Starmer declared that Israel had a right to impose a siege on Gaza [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=711.28s)]
*  a wantonly illegal act, then declared he never said what he had in fact said. As predominantly [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=716.32s)]
*  Muslim councillors resigned in disgust as he supported Israel's genocide, one of the goons [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=721.44s)]
*  of his goons briefed that Labour was shaking off the fleas. He refused to back a ceasefire [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=727.12s)]
*  for months as his shadow ministers resigned in disgust. He took disciplinary action against [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=731.92s)]
*  Labour MPs opposed to Israeli war crimes. His government, after taking office, suspended just [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=736.16s)]
*  eight percent of arms deals under immense legal pressure. It means nothing. They approved more [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=740.4s)]
*  military equipment in the following three months than approved by the Tories in three years after [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=744.64s)]
*  2020. And when the other week, David Lamme correctly said Israel was violating international [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=748.16s)]
*  humanitarian law, which total blockade in Gaza, he was forced to withdraw those comments. Let's be [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=753.1999999999999s)]
*  clear. This government, this Labour government led by Keir Starmer, they are complicit in genocide. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=758.88s)]
*  They have helped facilitate genocide every step of the way. And every politician and every journalist [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=765.04s)]
*  who legitimised what was very clearly going to be a terrible crime from day one is going to be made [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=771.12s)]
*  to account. They're going to be made to account for themselves for what they have done. They can't [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=775.6800000000001s)]
*  claim ignorance. They can't claim they didn't know this was going to happen because the whole point of [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=781.12s)]
*  people like me sitting in front of a camera like this documenting this crime almost every single [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=786.6400000000001s)]
*  day is in large part, I'll be honest to say very clearly to those people, you have no excuse for [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=792.08s)]
*  saying you didn't know because we have every receipt and now you're going to pay the consequences. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=798.88s)]
*  I'll finish appropriately with these comments by the Israeli journalist Iris Lee. She said, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=804.4s)]
*  there will come a day when everyone who did not report on what is happening in Gaza, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=810.4s)]
*  everyone who remains silent about the killing and starvation, everyone who actively or indifferently [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=814.4s)]
*  support the humanitarian disaster that Israel calls will not know what to do with themselves out [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=818.7199999999999s)]
*  of shame and will look for a stone to hide under and that day is not very far away. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=823.28s)]
*  Being consumed with shame is the very least that these people deserve. Reputations must end. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=829.1999999999999s)]
*  Careers must end. People must go to prison. Accountability is coming. Tick tock tick tock tick [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=839.28s)]
*  tock. Gaza is a crime scene, one of the great crime scenes of history and we are going to dust [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=848.7199999999999s)]
*  over the rubble and identify every single fingerprint. Careers and reputations as I say, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=852.88s)]
*  they are going to end. People are going to go to prison for what they have done. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ZxAFrhsoo&t=857.2s)]
