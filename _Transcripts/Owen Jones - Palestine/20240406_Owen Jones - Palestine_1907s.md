# US Official Tells Me Why She Resigned Over Gaza - w. Annelle Sheline
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtXOEzDBCQ)
*  Now, in terms of how history judges the horror being unleashed against the Palestinian people
*  in Gaza, when we look back at previous horrors, an excuse many in power have fallen back on was
*  they did not know. There isn't that excuse in this particular horror, not that there was in many of
*  those horrors either. And one of the reasons is that there have been so many who have spoken out
*  institutions. We have, of course, the ongoing South African case alleging genocide at the
*  International Court of Justice. In Britain, we have had hundreds of lawyers who signed a letter
*  demanding Britain takes urgent action, whether it be arms embargo and the rest, because of
*  the prospect of complicity in genocide. And we also have very courageous individuals, not least
*  Anel Shaleen, who is a former foreign affairs officer at the US State Department who has resigned
*  over the question of Gaza. And I think history will record what Anel has done as someone who
*  very courageously blew the whistle and took a sacrifice for doing so. Anel, it's such an
*  honour to speak to you. How are you doing? Doing well. Thank you for having me. Do you just want
*  to talk through the moments leading up to this very brave decision of yours? What was going on?
*  What was happening? What was the process, I suppose?
*  Yeah. So, you know, I initially in the aftermath of October 7th, as it became clear what US policy
*  was going to be and what is the Israeli reaction was going to be, I initially thought it would be
*  useful to stay inside the State Department to try to do what I could. I co-authored a
*  dissent cable. I signed two other dissent cables. The State Department held internal discussions
*  about this. Many, many people were extremely concerned. But I think over time, it just became
*  clear that these decisions were being made at the very top. And until President Biden was ready to
*  take a different approach, it didn't really matter all of the work that people were doing.
*  I want to be clear. I was within the office that focuses on human rights in the Middle East.
*  Israel-Palestine was not one of the countries I was covering. My work was mostly focused on
*  countries in North Africa. But it did really undermine our office's ability to just advocate
*  for human rights across the Middle East, not only because members of civil society in these
*  countries didn't want to have anything to do with the US government, understandably,
*  but also what credibility did the US have to advocate for human rights, given what our
*  government was enabling in Gaza or inside Gaza? On that, I wrote a column for The Guardian on the
*  24th of October entitled, Israel is clear about its intentions in Gaza. World leaders cannot plead
*  ignorance of what's coming. I wrote that as a marker because I feared after the Iraq War,
*  there was a formulation which was almost identically used by British and American leaders
*  as others, which was, if I knew then what I knew now, I wouldn't have. So Hillary Clinton said,
*  if I knew then what I know now, I wouldn't have voted that way. Deputy leader of the Labour Party,
*  if I knew then what I knew now, I wouldn't have voted for it. Almost exactly the same. Michael
*  Howard, a conservative, if I knew then what I knew now, I couldn't have voted for that resolution.
*  The point I made there is that Israeli leaders just came out and said what they were going to do.
*  You didn't need to, it wasn't leaked documents. It wasn't reading, you know, it was just they said
*  things like, we're fighting human animals, so we're going to cut off all your centers of life.
*  All the officials talking about raising Gaza to the ground, creating a city of tents,
*  we're going for, not for accuracy, but for destruction. I mean, it was just so much,
*  is that part of it? Did you just listen to the intent? Was that, you know,
*  intent is rarely spoken in these ways, I would say. Exactly. You know, like I said, it was clear
*  quite early on what was going to happen. I mean, I think even, you know, I do commend President Biden
*  for early on telling Israel, you know, don't react the way the US did in the aftermath of 9-11 with
*  just vengeance and, you know, pursuing policies that in many ways were counterproductive
*  in the effort to try to contain, you know, anger, often justifiable anger at the United States.
*  I think subsequently we've seen, you know, that's really the only thing I can commend President
*  Biden for in the aftermath of October 7th, given his unwillingness to impose any sort of consequences
*  on Israel for the ways that they have continued to violate international law, as well as American
*  laws. I think eventually it did get to the point for me where it was just so clear that US laws
*  were not being followed and the State Department and White House officials were denying reality,
*  you know, claiming that they were not aware of what was happening, what everybody could see with
*  their own eyes, you know, live streaming out of Gaza. And so that to your first question about kind
*  of the process of deciding, you know, I had made clear to my supervisors that I was going to resign
*  over Gaza, but I was initially just going to do it quietly. And there have been other people who've
*  done that, just didn't want to work for the US government anymore and left quietly. But then
*  it was conversations with colleagues who said, please speak out, you know, and I eventually,
*  only about a week or so before going public, I decided that I would do this publicly,
*  because I agree that it seems to only be public pressure that is having any effect
*  on this administration, even though thus far the effect has been woefully inadequate and
*  quite minimal. But my hope is that it's building and that we will see a change.
*  I was going to come on to that because that question of leverage. John Kirby is a, is the
*  White House National Security Communications Advisor. He does some of the press conferences
*  people often see on social media or television. I mean, he said a few days ago that they had had no
*  evidence that Israel was breaking international humanitarian law. And given there is the biggest
*  collapse in the nutritional status of the population recorded history and famine in Gaza,
*  given 70% of civilian infrastructure has been severely damaged or destroyed and Gaza looks
*  like a different color and texture from space, given 40,000 people have been perhaps including
*  those under the rubble have been killed. I mean, I could go on. What I just listened to that, you
*  kind of listing listings were they don't I mean, they can't possibly but do they believe I mean,
*  they can't possibly believe that. So they're just lying through their teeth when they say things
*  like that. And they know what's actually happening. They were aware of what's happening.
*  Yes. The until the president wants the policy to change, we're going to continue to hear this,
*  you know, sort of Orwellian wars, peace pieces, you know, like the complete convolution
*  of the facts, which I would argue in many ways is is contributing to why we're seeing Biden's
*  poll numbers continue to plummet, which is something I'm quite concerned about, you know, I
*  I think that the Trump administration would not be better on these issues and would be worse on
*  many issues if we were to get Trump back. But Biden's really the administration is undermining
*  their case that they that they have tried to put forward that that, you know, their administration
*  cares about the rule of law, cares about America's role in the world, cares about
*  supporting allies. Well, I guess they're continuing to support Israel to the exclusion of
*  all these other considerations, whether it's, you know, the war in Ukraine, the concerns about
*  Russia or China, concerns about climate change, you know, saying they were going to advocate for
*  human rights. This is one of the questions that I still has not been answered for me, which is,
*  why is it that this unconditional US support for Israel seems to outweigh all of these other
*  considerations that I do think increasingly for many Americans, it just doesn't really make sense.
*  Like, why continue to pursue this policy, given that they're violating US law to do so?
*  What do you think is driving it? I mean, it's not, you know, Saudi Arabia is another example of the
*  US ally which perpetrates terrible human rights abuses. It's not exclusive, but you can see the
*  impacts that this, you know, I mean, the scale of this crime is just so dramatic, so obscene.
*  What do you think is driving it? What's your kind of impression of why was this total
*  unwavering commitment? I mean, Joe Biden is a self-described Zionist. He's been this way
*  throughout his career. And I do think that much of this does come back to him,
*  which again, remains just so puzzling because, you know, this is part of his whole person. He's
*  a compassionate person. You know, he's someone that America could trust over someone like Trump,
*  who just, you know, is so blatantly self-interested. So again, in so many ways, I'm just confused as to
*  why the administration, I mean, again, if it were just this cold political calculus of thinking
*  about their reelection chances, I think he's undermining himself in so many ways, again,
*  beyond just this basic human question of how could you allow this to happen to a group of other
*  people and to then criticize those who come out and say, I don't want to support what is being
*  done to this group of people, you know, we're all watching it in real time and it's been six months
*  almost. I mean, on that, oh yeah, sorry, carry on. No, go ahead. Well, no, I mean,
*  he was asked about, there was an interview in the New Yorker by Isaac Chotiner. Hold on, this was,
*  this was an interview with you, I'll just double check now, this was, I think, a colleague of yours.
*  Am I wrong here? Or was this an interview with you? I don't think. No. Yeah, Biden's increasingly
*  contradictory as well, policy, a big part. It was, I just saw from it, it says a former US State
*  Department official. I was like, oh wow. No, but in that, what the point he met, the point that was
*  made was he was asked, you know, talking about, I do wonder if the people who make policy in America
*  don't have the same emotion when it comes to Palestinian lives. Do you think that's fair?
*  And that they responded to this other State Department official, I think it's fair to say,
*  yes, that America and America's of a pro-Israel sensibility. But he was talking that, you know,
*  when he was asked, do I do wonder if people make policy in America don't have the same emotion
*  because the Palestinian lives. I mean, it seems so flagrant that Palestinian life is not taken as
*  seriously, obviously, it has no worth or value really, when in these discussions. I mean, is that
*  just brutally hardwired into a lot of the decisions made by the US administration?
*  Yes. I mean, I think we've seen that clearly in, you know, also just the main, the way the
*  mainstream media covers this, the way the, you know, the use of language in the way,
*  you know, this administration has talked about it. We've, we've maybe seen a little bit on the
*  margins starting to get better because it was so blatant, but I would absolutely agree that
*  Israeli lives are seen as more valuable and sort of similar to the world's central kitchen
*  workers who were killed. I mean, while it was absolutely horrifying what happened, you know,
*  the outrage over the death of those people, you know, you're a people of European descent and
*  or Canadian or American backgrounds that that generated so much more of an outcry,
*  at least in the US, than in the death of tens of thousands of Palestinians.
*  I do think that sort of the US-Israel affinity does have a basis, probably does have a basis
*  in racism and sort of counting white lives more than the lives of people who are not viewed as
*  white. But I do think we are seeing a shift here. And one parallel I've made is to the Black Lives
*  Matter movement and the ways that while initially that movement was not really seen as mainstream
*  or people, you know, many Americans wouldn't have necessarily seen themselves as aligned with that.
*  I think, you know, in over the course of 2020, it suddenly, it became self-evident,
*  obviously Black Lives Matter. And so I do think we're starting to see a shift also towards the
*  mainstream of we just need a ceasefire, you know, that people who don't necessarily identify with,
*  you know, wouldn't see themselves as like an advocate of Palestinian liberation,
*  they just want to ceasefire. It just, it's not controversial to say we don't want to see any more
*  babies being ripped to pieces or people starving. Sorry.
*  No, it's more than understandable. This is a hideous episode in human history and I share your grief.
*  In terms of that point you just made about Palestinian life, Joe Biden early on sowed
*  doubt in the number of Palestinians who have been killed back in October.
*  And we've seen quite a big extensive general campaign to sow doubt in those figures.
*  The health ministry in Gaza released at the time a list of names including the ID,
*  Israel approved ID numbers because the civil registry in Gaza is still controlled by Israel.
*  And in order to disprove that and, you know, the UN, you know, in previous conflicts,
*  the figures have been proven to be completely correct. And I'm just wondering about, you know,
*  the general, I mean, the administration must know that the actually these figures are an understatement,
*  they don't include those buried under rubble who haven't been identified for a start. Do you think
*  that's true? I mean, Biden misled people there. I mean, I, you know, I was not inside the White House.
*  I don't know what exactly his staff prepares for him or what he reads, which is not always the same
*  thing. But I do know inside state those numbers, you know, the widely reported numbers from the
*  Ministry of Health inside Gaza are widely disseminated, come through in emails every day
*  that just sort of come into everyone's inboxes. I do, I myself ran into this when I was working
*  on getting the op-ed I published with CNN, you know, working with the editors there, who,
*  you know, admirably wanted to go through and fact check and, you know, make sure that they were,
*  you know, publishing something accurate, which I deeply appreciate. But they wanted to use the
*  words Hamas run health ministry or, you know, something along those lines, Hamas controlled.
*  And, you know, to your point, this was something Biden had said initially. And even that isn't
*  really accurate because the PA pays or when there was money getting in would pay the salaries of
*  many of the employees working in the health ministry inside Gaza. And, you know, and the
*  PA and Hamas are enemies, you know, they're not on the same side if people are not aware.
*  That's the Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the West Bank, although again Israel
*  is in fact in control of the entire territory. So in general, I do just find that when,
*  whenever it's a question of Palestinians being the victims, it is always interrogated or there's
*  always this, you know, well, we have to look into that. We have to investigate. We can't call it a
*  genocide. You know, we can't determine what exactly happened. Whereas if it's an accusation
*  against, you know, where Israelis are the victims, there's no need for investigation. It's just
*  assumed like, well, of course, you know, in looking at the, I mean, you know, for example,
*  the allegations that Hamas committed mass rape on October 7th and the ways in which, you know,
*  that was used strategically because when people were polled, that was the issue that really got
*  a huge reaction that people were horrified about. And that, you know, there's subsequently been so
*  much effort to actually try and find like, well, where are the victims then? And not to say that
*  there were not victims, but just the ways in which some of these claims are, you know, if
*  Palestinians are seen as the aggressor, there's no questioning of, well, let's look into the
*  evidence here. There seems to be no need for evidence. Whereas if the Israelis are the
*  aggressors, you know, no, we need to look into that. We can't ascertain that. And to the, you
*  know, getting back to the point about the ways in which the State Department refuses to acknowledge
*  the reality of what Israel is doing, you know, even when there have been investigations and we
*  do have abundant evidence, they're still unwilling to acknowledge it. I mean, on that, you know,
*  I mean, obviously we're talking there, quite rightly, very emotionally about the impact,
*  human impact. And we're talking, you know, 14,000 children is an underestimate because it doesn't
*  include those buried under the rubble. And I mean, it's unprecedented in for a very long time,
*  sort of children in a very crowded part of the world in which nearly half of the population are
*  kids. I mean, it just kind of thing how, you know, there's obviously in my head, I say, you know,
*  it must be a soulless bureaucracy making crude strategic. And well, obviously we'll talk, I'll
*  ask you about that, you know, about US power and, you know, seeing Israel as a strategic ally in,
*  you know, the 1980s, Joe Biden, as you mentioned, calling himself a lifelong Zionist. He said in the
*  mid 80s of Congress, if Israel didn't exist, we'd have to create it and made it at the point in terms
*  of to serve US interests, that it serves US interests in the region. So he wasn't even making
*  the argument now about a Jewish homeland. He was talking about Israel in the sense that this is a
*  strategically important thing for the US power. I mean, just that impact, so just they must, you
*  know, it's such an obvious obscene crime. Is it just, do you think how much is that just hitting them?
*  I don't know. You know, like I said, in terms of, like, you know, I read recently that that Dr. Jill
*  Biden has apparently made very clear to her husband that this she is horrified by this and she wants
*  it to stop. So I assume, you know, she's able to speak with her husband, you know, there has been a
*  little bit of a question about is this still his his advisors? Is this people like Jake Sullivan or
*  Brett McGurk or other people around him? Or is it really just him? And, you know, I don't know,
*  you know, from from my window inside the State Department, like I said, I wasn't I wasn't on the
*  white staff. But it does. I would just go back to the ways in which, you know, many, many people
*  inside state are are devastated by what's happening. And they see it again, not only in terms of the
*  impact on Palestinians inside Gaza, but on the US standing in the world. And like I mentioned, you
*  know, these these other priorities that this administration had identified as as existential,
*  whether it's climate change or competition with China, just, you know, the need for for countries
*  to work together and the US seeing itself as a leader in those ways. And and yet when we come to
*  this question of unconditional support for Israel, the US appears willing to to sacrifice all all
*  moral leadership, all global credibility, and to essentially behave in ways that that do not
*  differentiate it at all from China, Russia, you know, these other global superpowers that are
*  that, you know, make no claims to care for human rights or or to follow the so called, you know,
*  rules based liberal international order, which I do think is important to to to contrast with just
*  international law. The administration likes to talk about the you know, the liberal international
*  order, but not necessarily just let's adhere to international law and let's adhere to the UN or
*  let's when we when when we abstain on a Security Council resolution, we don't get to turn around
*  and say it was non binding because Security Council resolutions are in fact binding.
*  And this was obviously the that motion which they abstained on the US and then caused a kind of
*  diplomatic rupture and then they rode back on it by saying it wasn't binding. Just just a few final
*  things really. I mean, you know, in terms of that point about and we'll just about leverage,
*  actually, I mean, you know, I was thinking I was reading about in the early 80s during the
*  Israeli invasion of Lebanon in terrible horrors were then committed clearly not on the scale that
*  we're seeing currently in Gaza and an advisor, one of Ronald Reagan, a right wing Republican,
*  of course, is advisors sort of stormed into the Oval Office just like these kids are being
*  slaughtered. This is too much. This has to end. And Reagan ringing an Israeli general and basically
*  ordering them to make it stop. And then the Israeli general saying, you know, that suddenly
*  committing to all these sweeping changes. And I think what we saw, as you mentioned, horrible,
*  horrible for the families of those Western aid workers and no one can take that away.
*  But 200 aid workers, mostly Palestinians have been killed, the biggest killing of aid workers
*  in recorded history, as well as the mass slaughter of Palestinians in general. And then all of a
*  sudden, he did use some leverage, didn't he? Two routes, letting food in aid in which is
*  I could have opened all along during the famine. It just shows they did. I mean, they had that
*  leverage, didn't they? He's always had that leverage, all that hand wringing of Israel.
*  He kept doing all this Israel, you know, private briefings to outlets. He could have used this
*  leverage all along, couldn't he? Exactly. And there's there's so much more leverage there to use,
*  which which goes back to my point about US law. So under the Leahy laws, for example, if units of a
*  foreign military have been credibly shown to have committed gross violations of human rights, which
*  we have abundant evidence of, you know, prior to October 7th of Israel, you know, units of the
*  Israeli military engaging in these, they are no longer eligible to receive US military assistance.
*  And yet we have not seen the State Department coming out and acknowledging that. Likewise,
*  620 I of the Foreign Assistance Act, which says that a foreign government that blocks US humanitarian
*  aid renders itself ineligible to receive US military assistance. Again, Israel in general
*  is no longer eligible. And yet instead, we're seeing billions and billions of dollars on top
*  of the already billions of dollars that that the US sends to Israel every year. But, you know,
*  so much more in order to enable this. One one additional point I think that maybe Americans
*  are not quite aware of is in all so much of this, you know, this money that gets sent to Israel
*  is used in the settlement enterprise to sort of perpetuate this, this violence and and to further
*  entrench the problem. I think, you know, many Americans have just been told for so long,
*  we're pushing, we're moving towards a two state solution. You know, this is stated US policy,
*  we just, you know, just have to keep working towards it. But then it is being actively
*  undermined with US tax dollars. And in many ways, I do think sort of the zombie two state solution
*  is is becoming is similar to this notion of the ceasefire that the US keeps talking about. We just
*  have to get to a ceasefire, we just have to go back to the negotiating table. But they're not using
*  any leverage to actually make sure that happens. And so instead, why would Netanyahu whose political
*  future depends on this violence continuing in order to keep himself out of jail? He has no
*  interest in in a ceasefire or even getting the hostages back, which, again, you know, the families
*  of the Israeli hostages are protesting, because that's not being the priority. And we know how to
*  get the hostages out in a significant number of ceasefire and prisoner exchanges, because by
*  military means more being killed and rescued. And in it before I ask my final question, I mean,
*  just in terms of international obligations, there was the 1948 genocide convention, which lists five
*  crimes. One of them is clearly genocide. The other is complicity in genocide. Now, the US actually
*  dragged its heels for a very long time in ratifying the genocide convention, until a little
*  known senator from Delaware called Joe Biden ensured its ratification in 1988, four decades on.
*  So then it was ratified in law, its provisions because of Senator Joe Biden.
*  I know that.
*  Yeah, there we go. History, eh? Something like that. But I mean, there is that point that
*  that is now is provisions are in US law, thanks to Joe Biden. And yet there we are potentially
*  with the US complicit in what is being tried is in the last genocide. I mean, that is the issue
*  there that alleged that this is about potential complicity in genocide and that the US administration
*  could be complicit in genocide.
*  Exactly. And we know, I mean, Israeli military officials have said this, that they could not
*  do this without US weapons. And if the US were to cut it off, just as Reagan did in the 80s,
*  they would be forced to radically alter their behavior, which is what Biden needs to do,
*  which again is not only in the law that he helped ratify in 1988, but these laws that are actively
*  being discussed inside the State Department and just they're not.
*  They're not being allowed to be upheld or the evidence is not being presented publicly.
*  Just final point. And this is just kind of US power, I suppose. You know, it's interesting,
*  I was in Greece recently, maybe just look at the Colossus on the hill, just thinking about
*  the rise and fall of civilizations and empires throughout history. And it's interesting because
*  empires, when they're in a bit of a tailspin, they don't realize they're in terminal decline.
*  Because how would you know? How do you don't know? You're living, you know, something's amiss.
*  And in many previous cases, there was an obvious something is not going right here. Things, you
*  know, but they think maybe we will recoup it. Maybe things will turn around. If you look at
*  the 21st century, it actually looks like quite steep US decline for lots of reasons. Iraq,
*  Afghanistan, Libya all went very badly wrong. Humiliations for military power. I mean, there was
*  Vietnam in the 70s, of course, but you basically had three disasters. In terms of economic, you
*  know, the economic crash. In terms of the rise of Trumpism, just having a right-wing authoritarian
*  movement, which threatens democracy itself. And then you look at this, and it's, you know,
*  the moral claims of US and Western power in general, a lot of the world were a bit like,
*  don't really believe in that. But it does, it's part of US power, isn't it? And you just kind of
*  look at this and think, how is the, no one will take this, how would anyone take what the US says
*  seriously on human rights ever again? And any part of the world, you just, they'll just refer to the
*  killing fields of Gaza, when little babies were buried under rubble and suffocated and burnt to
*  death. I just, I don't know how, you know, what happens to US power after this. I just.
*  Absolutely. I mean, I think my only glimmer of hope would be that the administration,
*  you know, due to public pressure shifts and forces this to stop, forces Israel to the
*  negotiating table, allows in the aid, and then, you know, pushes for a Palestinian state. I mean,
*  that would not bring back the thousands and the thousands before who've died. But it would be
*  something to come out of this. And what also I would argue lead to greater security for Israel.
*  I mean, the US just always talks about, you know, Israeli security, we have to prioritize
*  Israeli security. Well, clearly the approach of oppression and violence and occupation has not
*  worked for 75 years. So let's try a new approach. And while I don't know if that would be enough to
*  regain any sort of moral leadership, I do think that that may be irrevocably lost.
*  I personally would feel that it would at least be a start.
*  And Alex, it's been such an honor speaking to you and, you know, your humanity and your,
*  I use this term a lot. I think listeners probably sick of it, but more clarity, which for me has
*  been the most important two words since this horror began, it really shines through. And,
*  you know, what you've done is courageous. You know, it's not easy to come out, resign from
*  your job and publicly take a stand. But as I keep saying, history is a savage judge. And I think it
*  will look back at this period and it will, as I keep saying in these videos, it will look at who
*  spoke out and who didn't. And I've got to the point now where people who still support this,
*  I'm kind of like, well, you're so beyond, like you're so beyond any kind of moral understanding
*  of the world I have. I can't even negotiate with that anymore. But it's people who stay silent.
*  That's, that's, that's kind of, that's that I'm struggling with that a lot. Actually, people who
*  know this is wrong, but they won't speak out. They're scared. I get it. They're worried about
*  the backlash. They're worried about the consequences, but it's not good enough. And
*  that's why it's so important. People like you have spoken out. You've shown leadership,
*  more clarity, and you encourage other people to speak out. And also you lay a marker. There was
*  no excuse. People knew they chose to either listen and act or they didn't. So thank you so much. Do
*  for those watching or listening, do share this video, press like, subscribe, do leave your
*  comments. We'd love to hear them. But now thank you so, so much. It's such an honor.
*  Thank you. Thanks for having me and for drawing attention to this.
