# Israel Is Building A CONCENTRATION CAMP In Gaza
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk)
*  This should be front page news, two hideous crimes which again proves Israel's genocidal intent. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=0.0s)]
*  But it's not the chant of a musician at a music festival about the genocidal army responsible for these crimes. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=7.12s)]
*  So there's no outrage, there's no uproar, there's no disgust, certainly not from the Western media. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=13.68s)]
*  Let's start with this. It's a story which Sky News to their credit have run. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=18.96s)]
*  It's always been the case that you've got examples of good journalism which appears in Western media outlets. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=24.16s)]
*  The problem is too few and too little prominence and of course subsumed, overwhelmed by all the structural issues [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=29.68s)]
*  which I've talked about at length in terms of whitewashing Israeli crimes, deferring to Israeli lies, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=40.32s)]
*  dehumanizing Palestinians, treating their lives as worthless and so on and so forth. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=46.64s)]
*  So you'll get these examples of really good commendable journalism and yet of course they're buried, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=50.32s)]
*  they're not of course shared or given due prominence across the rest of the media. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=57.44s)]
*  Let's just talk about this. So this is an interview with an Israeli reservist who served in Gaza. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=62.48s)]
*  He told Sky News that IDF troops killed Palestinian civilians at random with orders to shoot sometimes dependent on the mood of the commander. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=67.92s)]
*  Let's have a listen. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=75.12s)]
*  An Israeli reservist who served in Gaza told Sky News IDF troops killed Palestinian civilians at random [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=75.84s)]
*  with orders to shoot sometimes dependent on the mood of the commander. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=82.24s)]
*  The IDF strongly denies the claim saying it operates against military targets, not civilians. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=86.72s)]
*  Our international correspondent Alex Rossi has the story for us. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=91.83999999999999s)]
*  I think everything in war is kind of messes you up. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=96.0s)]
*  It is rare to hear Israeli soldiers speak openly about their time in Gaza [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  but after three tours of duty this reservist says his conscience won't let him stay silent. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=106.24s)]
*  Every commander can choose for himself what he does so it's kind of like wild west and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=112.72s)]
*  so some commanders can really decide to do war crimes and do bad things and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=120.32s)]
*  and like don't have very consequences of that. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=127.44s)]
*  He agreed to talk on condition of anonymity fearing he could be labelled a traitor or ostracised at home. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=131.44s)]
*  These photos were taken while he was serving in Gaza where he was stationed in the homes of displaced Palestinians. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=138.32s)]
*  I think you can't be in this scenario for so long and not like normalise it and not [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=146.55999999999997s)]
*  like kind of you lose your mind and then killing is more and more normalised and you don't [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=154.8s)]
*  you can't see the problem in it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=167.12s)]
*  Kind of feel like I took part of something bad and so I think it's like I need to counter it [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=169.04s)]
*  with something good that I do and I hope that by speaking of it it can change like how things [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=179.76s)]
*  are being done and I think a lot of people if they knew exactly what's happening they wouldn't [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=188.08s)]
*  it wouldn't go down very good for them and they won't agree with it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=195.6s)]
*  Alex Rossi, Sky News, Jerusalem. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=202.8s)]
*  On one level this is deeply frustrating because anyone who doesn't think [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=206.08s)]
*  that the Israeli army is routinely massacring Palestinian civilians every single day [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=210.4s)]
*  is akin in terms of not believing reality to someone who thinks the earth is flat with the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=217.68s)]
*  quite important caveat that fat earthers are monumentally wrong to say the least [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=224.64s)]
*  but not completely morally bankrupt. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  Now we've got a mountain of testimonies from Palestinians themselves about being massacred [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=233.2s)]
*  about their loved ones being massacred by the Israeli army but there is a refusal to treat [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=237.84s)]
*  Palestinians as even human in our media and thus those testimonies are not accepted for what they [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=243.2s)]
*  are. Now it's notable actually that we have testimonies from Israeli soldiers long before [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=248.8s)]
*  the end of October 2023 about their random murder of Palestinian civilians. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=253.36s)]
*  Back in 2015 for example the Guardian covered testimony from Israeli soldiers who testified [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=259.12s)]
*  about the 2014 assault on Gaza most of our shooting was random we didn't think about [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=263.68s)]
*  civilian casualties. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz a few days ago of course carried testimony from [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=269.12s)]
*  Israeli soldiers and Israeli army officers that the army there had deliberately fired Palestinians [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=274.24s)]
*  their aid distribution sites run by the so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation an Israeli-American [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=279.12s)]
*  front which is in no way designed to actually meet the humanitarian needs of the Palestinian people. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=284.48s)]
*  Around 650 plus Palestinians have been murdered in these massacres over 4,000 injured that's the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  numbers that we know about in any case. Now this is only one crime of course one heinous crime don't [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=295.28000000000003s)]
*  get me wrong and the overall abomination that is Israel's genocide in Gaza yet despite overwhelming [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=300.72s)]
*  and controversial evidence that the Israeli military the IDF is deliberately massacring [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=307.2s)]
*  starving unarmed Palestinians that it has murdered hundreds by this method alone [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=311.2s)]
*  day after day there is no mass coverage across the western media it is at best buried. Dare I [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=315.84000000000003s)]
*  even tell you what the coverage would be or suggest what the coverage would be if hundreds [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=322.16s)]
*  of unarmed Israeli civilians were being massacred in these last few days? I mean this alone is [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=328.0s)]
*  seventh of October massacres in terms of the numbers and the proportion [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=336.88s)]
*  of the numbers of Palestinians being killed in Gaza which has a much smaller population of course [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=343.68s)]
*  in Israel. Now when there's coverage we are treated to derange attacks on the English language like [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=348.8s)]
*  this from the Washington Post and this headline is quite something. Forseeable flaws in Gaza aid [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=353.04s)]
*  project led to shooting of Palestinians. I should note there is really important evidence in this [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=358.16s)]
*  article about the Israeli military slaughtering civilians. Louisa Luvlock is one of those on the [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=363.28s)]
*  byline she's done really superb excellent journalism actually in terms of what Israel [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=369.11999999999995s)]
*  is doing to the Palestinian people. The headline reveals the chosen framing by newspaper editors [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=374.64s)]
*  about stories they're burying. I mean this is ludicrous we're talking about the massacre [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=380.32s)]
*  of civilians. This is I mean imagine again I don't really need to spell it out if this was Israeli [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=385.52s)]
*  civilians being massacred in this way. Starved, deliberately starved Israeli civilians. We had to [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=392.64s)]
*  enter a new parallel universe I get it. You would not get newspaper headlines like I mean just imagine. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=398.0s)]
*  I mean speaking of this kind of framing after Israel dropped a massive bomb on a cafe in Gaza [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=404.71999999999997s)]
*  last week which was bustling with civilians, students, artists, football players which of [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=410.24s)]
*  course the Israeli military would have known before they attacked it and this is really important. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=414.4s)]
*  They know exactly who's there. They can see who's there before they attack. It's not like [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=418.96s)]
*  these are just like random bombs. This is a very sophisticated military as they will say themselves. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=425.2s)]
*  They know almost exactly in fact they'll know exactly how many people are there. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=430.71999999999997s)]
*  They'll know they can see who they are before they attack. It's worth making that point. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=435.67999999999995s)]
*  You know it's not just it's not like bombs just being dropped like in the blitz in London. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=442.71999999999997s)]
*  Now the BBC headline was Israel strike and bustling Gaza cafe killed a Hamas operative [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=448.96s)]
*  but dozens more people were killed. Could you imagine if there was a Hamas attack which killed [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=454.08s)]
*  dozens of Israeli civilians but there was a claimed IDF soldier officer there? Could you even [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=459.44s)]
*  imagine Hamas strike and bustling Israeli cafe killed an IDF operative but dozens more people [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=463.84s)]
*  were killed? It is literally impossible to imagine such a headline. If such a headline ever existed [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=468.71999999999997s)]
*  in such circumstances it would trigger immediate wall-to-wall firestorm. It would be a national [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=475.2s)]
*  scandal probably involving overwhelming demands for the BBC Director-General to resign. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=481.36s)]
*  The fact we can take that for granted you know what I'm saying is true. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=489.2s)]
*  We just take it as red that Palestinian life in our media means nothing. It is the tiniest fraction [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=495.03999999999996s)]
*  at the very least of what is considered a life like us Israel western. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=503.44s)]
*  The most shameless gratuitous face is imaginable. And then there's this new story the headline in [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=510.88s)]
*  the Israeli newspaper Haaretz is Defense Minister says Israel plans to concentrate all Gaza's [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=516.0s)]
*  population in humanitarian zone built on Rafah's ruins. They put rightly as we'll discuss [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=520.32s)]
*  humanitarian scare quotes. The article explains Defense Minister Israel Katz said Monday that he [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=526.4s)]
*  has instructed the IDF to prepare a plan to establish a humanitarian city on the ruins of [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=531.52s)]
*  Rafah which would eventually house the entire population of the Gaza Strip. According to Katz [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=535.76s)]
*  the plan involves moving 600,000 Palestinians primarily from the Al Mawazi area into the new [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=540.3199999999999s)]
*  zone after security screening. Once inside residents would not be allowed to leave the [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=545.12s)]
*  Defense Minister said. Concentrating Gaza's entire civilian population in a small confined [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=549.4399999999999s)]
*  camp from which they cannot escape. Yes well we do actually have a term for that in English language [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=555.6s)]
*  a term you will be very familiar with. This is known as a concentration camp. That is literally [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=560.96s)]
*  what it is. That is inarguable. I have just outlined what a concentration camp is. As for [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=566.72s)]
*  humanitarian zone this is grotesque Orwellian subversion of language. We already know what the [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=573.84s)]
*  Israeli state means by humanitarian given the experience of the so-called Gaza humanitarian [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=578.96s)]
*  foundation which involves pulling Gaza under a total siege for months then allowing in far [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=583.76s)]
*  too little aid much of it unusable with no proper efficient distribution system of any description [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=588.48s)]
*  instead just genocidal soldiers massacring starving civilians by the hundred as they [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=594.08s)]
*  desperately try and get whatever food they can. Now we know about the genocidal intent of Israel [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=599.2s)]
*  Katz the Defense Minister because he's made it abundantly clear over and over again. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=604.24s)]
*  Earlier this year he said the following in a blood curdling video. Citizens of Gaza this is your last [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=608.4s)]
*  warning. The first Sinwar ruined Gaza and the second Sinwar will destroy it completely. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=615.28s)]
*  The air force attacking its Hamas terrorists was only the first step. The rest will be significantly [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=620.0s)]
*  worse and you will pay the price. Soon evacuation from the fighting zones will resume unless all [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=624.4s)]
*  the Israeli hostages are released and Hamas is expelled from Gaza. Israel will act with forces [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=629.36s)]
*  never before seen. Take the US president's advice. Return the hostages and expel Hamas and other [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=634.24s)]
*  options will be presented to you including relocating to other places in the world for [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=639.68s)]
*  those who wish. The alternative is utter destruction and devastation. He didn't even [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=644.56s)]
*  try to hide his genocidal intent. Indeed the Harretts article says the following. In a briefing [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=650.0799999999999s)]
*  with reporters Defense Minister Israel Katz said Israel aims to weaken Hamas by targeting its [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=656.0s)]
*  leadership seizing territory demilitarizing the Gaza Strip and implementing what he called the [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=660.16s)]
*  emigration plan which will happen. He added that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was already [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=665.3599999999999s)]
*  leading efforts to explore countries willing to absorb Gazans. Forcibly removing an entire [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=669.76s)]
*  people from their homeland is wantonly unapologetically genocidal. It means the [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=677.36s)]
*  Palestinian people of Gaza will no longer exist. That is it. Their whole history [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=682.0s)]
*  going back thousands of years comes to an end. Like that. Gone. Now that's despite I should know [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=688.8s)]
*  how it's reporting that other countries so far resisting participation in this genocidal plan. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=697.28s)]
*  As Michael's father, an Israeli human rights lawyer told The Guardian, Katz laid out an [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=702.0799999999999s)]
*  operational plan for a crime against humanity. It is nothing less than that. It is all about [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36JtxIODmYk&t=706.16s)]
