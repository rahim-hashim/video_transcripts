# Israel Keeps Shooting KIDS In The Head - And Its Cheerleaders Are Smearing Medics With The Evidence
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_LdCJdYwOI)
*  The Israeli army is deliberately shooting little Palestinian children in the head and in the chest.
*  Pro-Israeli cheerleaders are monstering those who seek to raise attention about the mass slaughter
*  of children in Gaza, which as per new research by Oxfam has underlined, represents the biggest
*  slaughter of children in this time frame of any conflict in the last 20 years. Bombed, burned alive,
*  suffocated under rubble, blown apart, starved and indeed shot, which we'll focus on today.
*  Let's start with a piece in the New York Times by Dr. Feroz Sidra, who was a trauma and general
*  surgeon who worked in the European hospital in Khan Yunis in Gaza earlier this year. His article
*  is based on the testimonies of 65 US-based doctors, nurses and paramedics who served in Gaza.
*  He reports volunteering in Ukraine and high-team states that what stood out about working
*  in a hospital in Gaza was this, and I quote, nearly every day I was there I saw a new young
*  child who had been shot in the head or the chest, virtually all of whom went on to die, 13 in total.
*  He had concluded that this must be the work of a particularly sadistic soldier located nearby.
*  Then he returned home and spoke to an emergency medicine physician who had worked in a different
*  hospital in Gaza two months before. Dr. Sidra told him, I couldn't believe the number of kids I saw
*  shot in the head. To the doctor's surprise, the physician said, yeah, me too, every single day.
*  Dr. Sidra worked with the New York Times, two polls, 65 healthcare workers about what they'd
*  seen in Gaza. 44 doctors, nurses and paramedics saw multiple cases of pre-teen children who'd
*  been shot in the head or chest in Gaza. Nine didn't, 12 didn't regularly treat children in
*  emergency contexts who weren't able to speak out about it. The testimonies include one surgeon who
*  said over the course of four hours, they saw six children aged between five and 12, all with a single
*  gunshot wound to the skull. An orthopedic and hand surgeon testified that he saw several children
*  shot with high velocity bullet wounds in both head and chest. A plastic and reconstructive surgeon
*  said their team cared for four or five children aged between five and eight, all shot with single
*  shots to the head, all presented to the emergency room at the same time. An orthopedic surgeon says
*  they treated a three and five year old each with a single bullet hole to their heads. Their father
*  and brother had returned to see if anything had remained of their homes in Cardunis after it was
*  destroyed by the Israeli army, having been told that the Israeli army was withdrawing.
*  But the Israeli sniper was waiting and shot both children. An anesthesiologist and critical care
*  doctor saw an 18 month girl with a gunshot wound to her head. 18 months. Another anesthesiologist
*  said he saw many children with gunshot wounds often to their heads. He says many had non-curable
*  permanent brain damage. It was almost a daily occurrence to have children arrive at the hospital
*  with gunshot wounds to their heads. Now this piece also offered detailed testimony about observing
*  severe malnutrition in patients, Palestinian medical workers and the general population alike,
*  near universal psychiatric distress in young children, about babies born healthy then returning
*  to the hospital because of dehydration, starvation or infections caused by their malnourished mother's
*  inability to breastfeed and a lack of instant formula and clean water. Children dying from easily
*  preventable infections we could go on. As Dr. Sidwell points out, this was warned about from the
*  start, the use of indiscriminate military violence, the deliberate restriction of food
*  and humanitarian aid, the near universal displacement of the population, the destruction
*  of the healthcare system. All of that he says is having the calamitous effect that many holocaust
*  and genocide scholars warned of nearly a year ago. That refers to a letter signed in mid-October last
*  year when over 800 scholars and practitioners of international law, conflict studies and genocide
*  studies signed a public statement warning of the possibility of genocide being perpetrated by
*  Israeli forces against Palestinians in Gaza. Now this hideous piece included photographs of x-rays
*  of children with bullets to their heads. It's really important to emphasize that these are
*  testimonies that have been corroborated over and over again. Let's listen for example earlier this
*  year to Mark Pilmutter, he's a Jewish American doctor and he said this in an interview in July.
*  Listen to that. There's no other explanation than these children being deliberately targeted.
*  Indeed in February, Irfan Ghilaria, a Canadian doctor, reported on one occasion a handful of
*  children all about ages 5 to 8 were carried to the emergency room by their parents. All had
*  single sniper shots to the head. These families were returning to their homes in Khan Yunis,
*  about two and a half miles away from the hospital after Israeli tanks had withdrawn,
*  but the snipers apparently stayed behind. None of these children survive.
*  To clarify, it's been clear for a very very long time that the Israeli state is deliberately
*  shooting little Palestinian kids. So what happened next with this New York Times piece?
*  It's worth bearing in mind that the New York Times has frankly, like most Western media outlets,
*  failed catastrophically in reporting about one of the worst atrocities of our age,
*  with journalistic exceptions like this. But then pro-Israel cheerleaders got to work.
*  One of them was Emily Shradder, an Israeli journalist. In a viral tweet, she claimed that
*  the New York Times appears to have published completely fake news in order to falsely accuse
*  the IDF of committing war crimes and shooting children at point blank rage, which Garzane and
*  foreign medics testify they witnessed. She claimed that the evidence had been digitally altered or
*  completely falsified and suggested that this was inciting hatred against Jewish people.
*  That forced the New York Times to issue a statement pushing back on this truly repulsive
*  atrocity denial. They point out they'd gathered first-hand testimonies from 65 US-based health
*  professionals who shared more than 160 photographs and videos, making clear they vetted all the
*  medical workers' credentials, presented the scans to multiple independent experts, examined the
*  images' metadata and added, while our editors have photographs that corroborate the CT scan images,
*  because of their graphic nature, we decided these photos of children with gunshot wounds to the
*  head or neck were too horrific for publication. We made a similar decision for the additional
*  40-plus photographs and videos supplied by the doctors and nurses surveyed that depicted young
*  children with similar gunshot wounds. It is absolutely obscene that a newspaper which has
*  published the detailed testamies of 65 medical professionals backed up by objective, incontrovertible
*  physical evidence has had to publish a rebuttal of pro-Israel fanatics claiming that all of this has
*  been falsified. What depraved moral gutter are you in when you are trying to spread denial about the
*  mass murder of little children? Indeed, in that vein, in the Observer newspaper, Howard Jacobson,
*  the novelist and broadcaster, wrote a piece headlined,
*  Tales of Infanticide have stoked hatred of Jews for centuries. They echo still today.
*  My word this piece. My word indeed. In it, he refers to Blood Libel, the medieval claim that
*  ordinary Jewish people murdered Christian children for ritualistic purposes. He then goes on to
*  suggest Jewish people are being hurt by the barbaric denials and celebrations of 7th October.
*  Well, he says, in quotes, night after night our televisions have told the story of the war in
*  Gaza through the deaths of Palestinian children. Night after night, a recital of the numbers dead.
*  Night after night, the unbearable footage of their parents' agony. The savagery of the war,
*  the savagery of the Israeli onslaught. He suggests here we are again, the same merciless
*  infanticides inscribed in the imaginations of medieval Christians.
*  A few things here. He doesn't offer any evidence, we even try to, that the mass slaughter of
*  Palestinian kids isn't happening. And this is the point here. The whole point about medieval
*  Blood Libel is it was false, libel. Ordinary Jewish people were not killing Christian children
*  in ritualistic sacrifices. It was an invention, a hateful invention. He's quite right about that.
*  Israel as a state and Israel and the Jewish people are not one and the same.
*  Very important point. 40% of Jewish Americans under 40 think Israel is committing genocide.
*  Now, it is objectively the case that the Israeli state is slaughtering children on mass. The
*  evidence of that could not be more overwhelming. And here Howard Jacobson suggests if you object
*  to that mass slaughter about Israel, you are perpetrating some sort of hate crime against
*  the Jewish people. It's also false, as he says, that the news routinely leads with the slaughter
*  of Palestinian children night after night. It's completely untrue. In fact, it's vanishingly rare.
*  This is just a falsehood. Indeed, he makes this claim in a subsequent interview with Isaac
*  Chutner in the New York Times, which is a truly, truly extraordinary interview. And I'm not using
*  extraordinary in a positive, though I have to say the interviewer does a very good job.
*  It's the answers which are the issue. He says in this interview, Howard Jacobson,
*  I'm not saying that the media should underestimate the number of Palestinian children killed. It's
*  a question of whether you choose to lead every story with children killed. 45 children were
*  killed today, 30 children were killed today, 15 children were killed today. It became a recession.
*  It became and still is. When asked what should be the lead story on days when lots of children
*  are killed, he said, I'm not talking about those days. This was every single night. I'm telling you,
*  I saw a dead baby every single night. This isn't true. It's just completely and utterly untrue.
*  That's not what the broadcast media has been doing at all. And what sort of ways is this to
*  talk about the mass slaughter of children? Like, what is going on in someone's head?
*  How can you speak like this? Can you imagine someone speaking about Israeli children in that way
*  during a mass slaughter every single day of Israeli children? What would he think? He'd
*  rightly think they'd be depraved, wouldn't he? Wouldn't he? He goes on to say you couldn't look
*  at a child, pictures of a child being killed every single night without thinking this is making my
*  people, my kin, out to be child murderers. Well, I think that's another of the hymns. That's what's
*  going on. These crimes being committed by the Israeli state are so depraved, so extreme and so
*  unconscionable that no one claiming to be moral or decent or humane could ever possibly defend them.
*  It's very important here to just emphasise the crucial importance of the demarcation between
*  the Israeli state and the Jewish people, because the Jewish people as a whole are not responsible
*  for these crimes. And in fact, some of the most morally eloquent and courageous voices
*  against this genocide have been Jewish. But what he's talking about here is being a pro-Israel
*  cheerleader and facing the reality of just how hideous, depraved these crimes are.
*  So pro-Israel cheerleaders have a choice, don't they? They are forced to have a choice here. They
*  either accept these depraved atrocities are real, the evidence for that being overwhelming, and then
*  are forced to abandon their cheerleading for the Israeli state, because how could anyone who isn't
*  a sociopath possibly cheerlead for a state guilty of such heinous crimes, or they go through tortured
*  processes to deny and deflect? Some are now beginning to realise that those who defended
*  and legitimised this crime of historic proportions will go down in history as monsters, and that's
*  beginning to rot them from the inside out. Well, tough. You had a choice. The evidence for the
*  gravity of this crime is always there. No crime in history has been so thoroughly documented as
*  this. Rarely have the perpetrators been so open and shameless about their intentions, as for the
*  executors themselves directly, Israeli soldiers, they've gleefully posted their war crimes online
*  for the world to see. No excuses, nowhere to hide. Everyone who facilitated this crime must be,
*  and will be held to account. Please like and subscribe, leave your thoughts and comments,
