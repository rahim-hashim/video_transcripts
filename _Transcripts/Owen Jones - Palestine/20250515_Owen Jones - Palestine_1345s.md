# Israel Is Being ABANDONED - The Dam Is Finally Breaking
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM)
*  The tide is turning against Israel. What does that even mean, you may ask? Given Israel has wiped Gaza [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=0.0s)]
*  from the face of the earth, exterminating countless numbers, it is prosecuting a relentless pogrom [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=7.12s)]
*  against the Palestinian people in the West Bank, it has devastated so much of southern Lebanon, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=13.44s)]
*  it's occupying and attacking Syria with impunity. Well, we could go on. Let's see the latest evidence [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=17.36s)]
*  here in Britain. When we're discussing the tide turning against Israel and its genocide against [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=23.92s)]
*  the Palestinian people, we mean the establishment is beginning to turn because the polling has [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=28.56s)]
*  consistently shown that the British people opposed Israel's onslaught from the start. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=34.32s)]
*  12 days after the 7th of October, 58% of British voters said there should be definitely, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=39.12s)]
*  definitely an immediate ceasefire. Another 18% said there probably should. 5% said there probably [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=45.68s)]
*  shouldn't be a ceasefire and 3% said there definitely should not be. That was the position [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=52.08s)]
*  of the British government and it is the same number who incidentally think the earth is flat. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=56.56s)]
*  Since then, polling has shown Brits think Israel is committing war crimes by a huge margin, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=60.56s)]
*  as well as supporting a total arms embargo on Israel and also majority support for the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=66.16s)]
*  arrest of Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu for war crimes and crimes against humanity. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=72.4s)]
*  Now, it's important to note this because we're not giving the British establishment any kudos [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=77.92s)]
*  for playing catch up with where the British people were at a very long time ago. Let's start [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=82.08s)]
*  by listening to Alastair Campbell. He's the former spin doctor to Tony Blair on his podcast [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=87.28s)]
*  with the former Tory MP Rory Stewart. You see the pictures yesterday of people [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  queuing for the limited food that was there and it was children screaming and climbing over each [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=96.64s)]
*  other with these little pans to try and get some food into it. And I just feel that the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=102.4s)]
*  international order has sort of given up. When was the last time we heard an international, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=107.44s)]
*  like we have in Ukraine now, Macron, Stammer come together, push Europe. When was the last time we [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=112.64s)]
*  had any sense of that happening? We had it a little bit when Trump came in, but it seems just to have [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=117.2s)]
*  faded away. I mean, I saw a picture yesterday of a girl, a young girl, who was holding her phone and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=121.36s)]
*  showing a picture of herself a few months ago as this sort of lively, vibrant young girl. Now, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=126.4s)]
*  ribs coming through the skin. Part of me feels that we've been too fair, actually, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=133.04000000000002s)]
*  because we have constantly tried to put both sides. But I just think this is now beyond the pale. I [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=138.08s)]
*  think it's utterly unacceptable. And yet we seem to be accepting it. It's an interesting concession [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=143.44s)]
*  here that Alastair Campbell believes they've been too fair on the podcast because he says they've [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  constantly tried to put both sides. This both-sides-ism is of course a big part of the problem. It is the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=152.32000000000002s)]
*  erasure of the dynamics at play. What are those dynamics? Well, it is Israel occupying Palestine, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=158.64s)]
*  not the other way around. It is Israel which has repeatedly ethnically cleansed Palestinians, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=164.88s)]
*  not least when Israel was founded in the first place. It is Israel which is stealing the land [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  and colonizing the land of Palestinians in the West Bank. It is Israel which has always slaughtered [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=174.39999999999998s)]
*  by far the most people by a very big margin. It's Israel which has mass arrested and incarcerated [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=179.67999999999998s)]
*  so much of the Palestinian male population in particular, as well as subjecting them for decades [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=186.4s)]
*  to torture and sexual abuse. It is Israel which subjected Gaza to a protracted siege before the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=190.96s)]
*  7th of October. It is Israel which is armed to the teeth and backed by the world's only superpower [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=196.72s)]
*  and its Western allies. It is Israel which has wiped Gaza off the face of the earth. It is Israel [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=201.6s)]
*  which has subjected the West Bank to never-ending pogroms since 7th of October, as well as unleashing [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=206.16s)]
*  hell against the Lebanese people and occupying Syria and repeatedly attacking it without any [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=211.28s)]
*  provocation. We could go on. There is the constant erasure of dynamics. So I hope Alistair Campbell [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=215.84s)]
*  has learned that lesson about dynamics. Who has power and who does not? Now Alistair Campbell [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=222.24s)]
*  draws attention to Israel's deliberate starvation of the Palestinian people. That intensified of [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  course with the total siege imposed from the beginning of March, but it has been a recurring [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  feature of Israeli policy since the 7th of October. Indeed it represents the core of the arrest [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=237.12s)]
*  warrants issued by the International Criminal Court against Netanyahu and his former defence [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=243.2s)]
*  minister Yevgalan last year. Now look, we need people with power and influence to shift their [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=247.76s)]
*  positions if we're going to stop this genocide. You do have to ask yourself, how has it taken [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=253.11999999999998s)]
*  19 months of daily depravity for you to get to this point? Mass slaughters of innocent people [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=259.44s)]
*  every single day, including kids, toddlers, babies, mass maiming, mass destruction of almost [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=264.24s)]
*  all civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, the industrialised torture, sexual abuse, rape, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=269.04s)]
*  the overtly, unashamedly genocidal rhetoric of Israeli leaders and officials which has been [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=274.40000000000003s)]
*  never ending since 7th October. How do you not see all of that? How is it only now you can [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  clearly understand that this is beyond the pale? I'd love to hear the answer. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=284.64000000000004s)]
*  Next, the independent newspaper, which has an editorial entitled The Deafening Silence in Gaza, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=290.56s)]
*  it is now time to speak up. Oh, now it's time to speak up. Now it's time to speak up. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=295.04s)]
*  Oh, I'm glad there wasn't any pressure for that to happen earlier. It's now 19 months in. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=300.32s)]
*  That's when it's time to speak up. Now, at the start of the genocide, the independent supported [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=308.48s)]
*  Israel's onslaught, despite empty handwringing about the need to abide by international law, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=312.64000000000004s)]
*  which the independent must have known if they're not completely thick, where Israeli leaders and [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=317.12s)]
*  officials had no intention of doing so because they made clear from the start with their [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=321.92s)]
*  statements they had no intention of doing so. So it's just asking for something, handwringing [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=326.16s)]
*  about something you know isn't going to happen in order for you to justify backing what is [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=330.32s)]
*  obviously a criminal enterprise. Because what you do is you ask for something you know is impossible, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=337.28000000000003s)]
*  but you go, well, I did ask for them to not do the things which you must have known they [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=341.76s)]
*  were going to do anyway. And therefore you keep your integrity. It doesn't work like that, guys. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=345.6s)]
*  The editorial at the time when they backed the onslaught was frankly vile. They said, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=353.20000000000005s)]
*  the imposition of a complete siege in Gaza by the Israel Defense Forces should assist in focusing [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=358.48s)]
*  mines in the region and far beyond. It will be harsh, but as Mr Netanyahu might point out, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=362.88s)]
*  this is war. I beg your fucking pardon. Netanyahu could say what he wants, but imposing a complete [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=367.6s)]
*  siege on a civilian population is a violation of international law. It is a war crime. It's [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=373.52s)]
*  not something that's just part of war. It's not like, oh well, you know, we'll just starve the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=378.56s)]
*  whole population, but you know, as Netanyahu says, you know, what do you expect? It's war. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=382.96s)]
*  This part becomes particularly relevant when I get to the new independent editorial, which speaks [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=389.12s)]
*  about how we need to end the silence. Now at the time they went on whatever path Israeli policy [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=394.79999999999995s)]
*  follows in the coming days, it should avoid measures that will erode world sympathy for a [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=399.44s)]
*  nation under a barbaric attack. There was no justification for it, but as a civilized nation [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=403.84s)]
*  and a democracy, Israel should keep to the international conventions of war. Okay, so [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=408.88s)]
*  abiding by international law becomes about a PR exercise for Israel there rather than, I don't [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=414.0s)]
*  know, protecting civilians as an end in its own right. Do you think Palestinians are humans? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=417.84s)]
*  Where's the evidence in this editorial? I can't see any evidence, which is why we ended up in the [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=422.15999999999997s)]
*  catastrophe you're now handwringing about. I mean, what you did there is whitewash Israel's past, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=426.32s)]
*  which is a list of war crimes, trying to present an ethnostate which was subjecting the Palestinian [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=433.76s)]
*  people in the West Bank to a barbaric brutal occupation for which the Palestinian people there [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=439.52s)]
*  do not consent to. How can you call that a democracy? How can you just pretend that Israel [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=447.44s)]
*  is just some other democracy when it is illegally occupying another people and [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=452.88s)]
*  relentlessly inflicted war crimes against them? Now, the independent went on, Israel has the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=458.56s)]
*  right to defend itself and treat this as an aggressive war. Again, those who wrote the [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=464.08s)]
*  editorial must have known the battery of genocidal statements issued by the Israeli state at the [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=468.15999999999997s)]
*  start. What they did, by the way, in the editorial is say, you know, treat this as an aggressive war [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=473.2s)]
*  because what they were doing is starting the clock on the 7th of October, they were pretending [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=479.68s)]
*  as though Israel was just living in peace and then they just got attacked out of nowhere, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=483.28000000000003s)]
*  as if there wasn't mass murder of the Palestinians taking place in the, literally in the months [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=486.8s)]
*  leading up to what happened. In any case, they made clear with their genocidal statements at [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=492.40000000000003s)]
*  the beginning, which the independent in many cases didn't bother to even print because it [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=497.6s)]
*  would have revealed what Israel was doing. And if they had to report accurately what Israel said [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=502.8s)]
*  they were doing, then it would have been very hard for them to keep this position, wouldn't it? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=507.44s)]
*  So they just lied to their readership because lying by omission is a lie. I mean, did they think [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=511.68s)]
*  these statements were just, I don't know, letting off steam? If so, quite a disastrous miscalculation [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=517.36s)]
*  on your part, independent, a newspaper I used to be employed for, by the way, given those statements [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=523.76s)]
*  proved entirely accurate predictors of what Israel would do. In fact, the most accurate road map [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=528.88s)]
*  to what Israel would go on to do. Now the editorial then went on to say Iran was the [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=533.36s)]
*  real problem in the Middle East and then went on to emphasise the deep trauma in Israeli society [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=537.84s)]
*  without any reference to the deep traumas of Palestinian society. Now let's get to the latest [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=542.72s)]
*  editorial. The independent begins by discussing the war crimes committed on 7th October, adding, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=548.24s)]
*  despite its fierce retaliation, raising immediate alarm, Israel found international backing for the [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=553.2s)]
*  right to defend itself. Now clearly the independent there is trying to cover its own backsides to [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=558.5600000000001s)]
*  justify what it supported. They then go on, but now any initial moral justification for [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=562.48s)]
*  continuing to prosecute the war 18 months on has been lost and the disgust we once reserved for [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=567.84s)]
*  Hamas militants transferred to the brutal and relentless assaults by the Israel defence forces [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=572.72s)]
*  and the humanitarian disaster caused by its blockade. Well, I mean, it's 19 months, I don't [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=576.72s)]
*  know, it'd be helpful to be able to count, especially given you're now talking about the [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=580.8000000000001s)]
*  timing of when we're supposed to speak out or not. Can I ask the independent a polite but [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=583.6800000000001s)]
*  firm question? Are you honestly saying it's only now after 19 months that you believe what you call [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=588.48s)]
*  the initial moral justification has been lost for this onslaught? Is it only now the disgust you say [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=593.2s)]
*  you feel you felt on the 7th October has transferred to the Israel defence forces? 19 months of atrocity [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=600.08s)]
*  has been committed against civilians every single day, every possible war crime under the sun. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=605.28s)]
*  And it's only now you believe things have changed? Seriously? Are we supposed to take you seriously [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=611.52s)]
*  as a newspaper? I mean, I doubt you'll exist in five years time, but seriously, with the requests [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=616.88s)]
*  for arrest warrants issued by the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court a year ago, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=622.72s)]
*  not a clue, or the genocide scholars who've been warning about genocide from the very beginning, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=626.8s)]
*  let alone well, I mean, let's not get pernickety, but the actual total destruction of Gaza and the [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=630.4s)]
*  mass thought of its people. No? Okay. The editorial goes on to discuss the impact on Palestinians [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=634.4s)]
*  using the official death toll, which is a severe underestimate, which they should know and note. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=641.04s)]
*  And they also note the Palestinians living in Gaza have always, always been little more than [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=646.0s)]
*  collateral damage. Okay. Hold on a minute. Okay. If that's always been true, if contempt for [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=650.16s)]
*  Palestinian civilian life has been obvious all the way through, then why is it not obvious enough for [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=655.68s)]
*  the independent to write this editorial any sooner about the need to break silence, as you put it? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=660.88s)]
*  Now they go on to say that shockingly, the response from the international community to Netanyahu's [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=666.88s)]
*  resumption of the onslaught was muted and that Israel's allies, including the UK, should have [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=671.28s)]
*  spoken out against his counterproductive and literally aimless move, as well as the devastating [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=675.6s)]
*  humanitarian catastrophe that caused. It's not aimless, though, is it? I mean, they're openly [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=679.6s)]
*  talking about removing every last Palestinian from Gaza. They want them gone. And that means either [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=682.88s)]
*  they all die or they flee. They flee or they die. So how is it, it's not aimless, is it? It's not [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=688.9599999999999s)]
*  aimless. They're openly talking about their aims. They're openly saying Netanyahu and his ministers [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=693.52s)]
*  that they want all the Palestinians in Gaza gone. They've made that clear. It's not aimless. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=698.88s)]
*  The silence from the UK and others has been deafening, the UK note, the newspaper notes. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=704.8s)]
*  And Sir Keir Starmer should be ashamed that he said nothing. Well, I agree. He should be ashamed. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=710.56s)]
*  Good look on that one. I mean, you know, the fact is Keir Starmer has backed, he backs the onslaught [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=716.24s)]
*  at the beginning. He backs what he called Israel's right to inflict a seizure against the Palestinian [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=723.84s)]
*  people, trying to gaslight everyone afterwards that he didn't actually support what he actually [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=727.92s)]
*  said he did. And he's still now, he's not just silent. They're giving the components, the crucial [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=731.28s)]
*  components to Israel, the F-35 jets to keep raining death and destruction of the people of Gaza. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=736.56s)]
*  So it's not just he's saying nothing. He's actually doing things actively which are killing people. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=741.4399999999999s)]
*  Now, the Independent, which backed the onslaught in Aroo, states, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=746.8s)]
*  it is time for the world to wake up to what is happening and to demand an end to the suffering [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=750.8s)]
*  of the Palestinians trapped in the enclave. Some people may want to turn away, unable to comprehend [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=755.28s)]
*  the levels of starvation, misery and hopelessness. I mean, lots of us, well, enough of us, not people [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=760.16s)]
*  with a platform in the media. Don't get me wrong. I mean, your hands are soaked in blood, you lot. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=767.68s)]
*  But some of us actually did refuse to turn away from the beginning. Now, they then go on to [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=771.12s)]
*  advertise their own coverage, adding, now is not the time to avert our eyes. Quite a lot of fun, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=776.48s)]
*  haven't we lads? Quite a lot of fun. Actually, more the inevitable and predictable and predicted [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=783.04s)]
*  consequences of what you supported. Then you take 19 months and start adopting a moral high ground [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=788.0799999999999s)]
*  and finger-wagging about averting our eyes now, long after Gaza was reduced to nothing, almost. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=792.64s)]
*  Now, some of us have been saying, don't look away for a very long time, precisely because people [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=801.36s)]
*  like you did look away and in the process helped to facilitate genocide. That's the problem. That's [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=804.9599999999999s)]
*  why we're in the current situation. Now they say, but Mr. Niayyahu's vow to destroy Hamas was [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=809.84s)]
*  never a realistic war aim and it morphed into the destruction of Gaza. Morphed, morphed. Are you [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=815.2800000000001s)]
*  taking the piss? According to Air Wars, an NGO of experts, the first month of Israel's campaign was, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=821.12s)]
*  to quote, by far the most intense, destructive and fatal conflict for civilians that Air Wars [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=827.84s)]
*  has ever documented. Within weeks, Gaza was a different colour and texture when looked at [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=832.24s)]
*  from space. They are revising history in order to protect themselves. What they're trying to do is [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=837.12s)]
*  suggest that the onslaught they supported evolved into something different, which they would never [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=841.6s)]
*  have supported if they'd known. This is based on a lie. These are all lies. There's no contrition [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=846.64s)]
*  here, but lots of implicit arse covering. Arse covering from a newspaper, which I'm afraid [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=852.16s)]
*  is complicit in Israel's genocide. You back it. You think it doesn't count because you did [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=857.44s)]
*  hand-wringing about it. The hand-wringing is not relevant. The hand-wringing was actually just to [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=865.76s)]
*  sow illusions. It's even worse. By hand-wringing it and saying, well, Israel should abide by [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=869.92s)]
*  international law when they made clear they didn't, you were therefore deflecting from the fact they [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=875.84s)]
*  made clear that they weren't going to do any such thing and then didn't. It's even worse. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=879.68s)]
*  Now The Economist is another publication which backs this onslaught. They now estimate that [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=885.04s)]
*  up to 109,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed by violence alone. That's not including [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=889.6s)]
*  the deaths by indirect causes. Destruction of healthcare, hunger, lack of fresh water, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=894.8s)]
*  lack of shelter. We could go on. And all the research suggests that it's indirect causes, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=899.76s)]
*  which will be the far bigger cause of death. Then there's The Times newspaper, which has been a [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=903.68s)]
*  zealous supporter of Israel's onslaught, which has published a column by the [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=908.9599999999999s)]
*  former MP Matthew Parris headlined, Why are we closing our eyes to Gaza's horror? Who do you mean by we? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=912.16s)]
*  That's to The Times sub-editor who wrote that. The Times, he wouldn't have written the [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=917.52s)]
*  headline. Colonists don't, just so you know. It is a devastating column, incidentally, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=924.88s)]
*  more devastating than that printed by many liberal newspapers. It begins, Why does the world look [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=928.72s)]
*  away? Are we simply bored or do we flinch from the wreckage, the famine and the blood in Gaza? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=934.0s)]
*  Well, I would politely suggest it's because Israel is a Western ally, which is armed and [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=938.1600000000001s)]
*  backed to the teeth by the West, including the British government, that its people are seen as [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=941.52s)]
*  us and Palestinians are them, as unpeople, not really human at all, and that the Western [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=945.2s)]
*  governments and media outlets who facilitated this abomination day one aren't awfully keen [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=950.56s)]
*  on de facto admitting their culpability at this point. That is just a wild guess on my part. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=955.68s)]
*  Now, he goes on to say, Matthew Parris, this is 2025. As we speak, two million human beings face [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=960.4s)]
*  starvation at the hands of our close ally Israel. As we speak, all hell has been rained down, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=965.1199999999999s)]
*  rained down now. Yes, he notes the atrocities mount and it's been dropped from the headlines. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=969.92s)]
*  He should note that's because of the editorial decisions of people who run media outlets. He [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=977.68s)]
*  doesn't say that. He goes on to say, we British continue to supply military kits, share intelligence [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=980.7199999999999s)]
*  and more. Why? Why indeed? And if you think hard enough, you're going to come, I would say, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=986.0s)]
*  to some pretty disturbing conclusions about the nature of British and foreign policy as a whole, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=993.04s)]
*  aren't you? Because why are we continuing to facilitate a genocide? He doesn't use the word [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=997.52s)]
*  genocide in peace, unfortunately, but it is a genocide. I mean, he's accepted it's a grave crime. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1003.04s)]
*  So what now? I mean, if you accept it's a crime, as grave as the one you're talking about, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1009.12s)]
*  then you think the government are criminally complicit. It wouldn't make any sense otherwise. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1013.92s)]
*  He writes an important paragraph here. It's customary at this point in a column about Gaza [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1018.24s)]
*  to insert a carefully outraced paragraph about Hamas's unprovoked incursion into Israel on [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1022.4s)]
*  October 7th and the slaughter and kidnapping that ensued. Take that as read, but I'm sick of what [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1026.6399999999999s)]
*  about to read. What indeed about October 7th? What indeed? What about Sudan? What about Ukraine? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1030.4s)]
*  As though further horrors can diminish a horror staring us in the face. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1035.0400000000002s)]
*  Well, indeed, those playing this game and it is a game are only doing so to deflect responsibility [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1039.3600000000001s)]
*  for this heinous crime, which they are guilty of. As he discusses Matthew Paris, the horrors being [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1043.68s)]
*  inflicted in plause, what further savagery must be inflicted before we, Israel's Western allies, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1049.0400000000002s)]
*  say enough and mean it. But this is the really important paragraph. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1054.72s)]
*  Well, I think this speaks a little to what's currently happening at the moment. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1059.28s)]
*  It is obviously now becoming very clear to all but the fanatical and delusional that this is going [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1084.8s)]
*  to go down in history as one of the great crimes. And those who either supported it or were in [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1091.36s)]
*  positions of power and influence and refused to call it out for what it is, despite the overwhelming [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1096.24s)]
*  and incontrovertible evidence staring at them in the face, are beginning to panic. They're starting [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1100.56s)]
*  to panic because they fear they may actually be remembered as monsters and they're right to panic, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1106.0s)]
*  especially if they're politicians who are on this abomination, because I have no doubt at all [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1110.08s)]
*  that some of you, those politicians, you're going to go to jail for what you've done. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1114.8799999999999s)]
*  And the careers of journalists are going to end over this. There's going to be a reckoning, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1118.96s)]
*  because the crime really is too big, too extreme, too shameless, too documented. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1121.9199999999998s)]
*  The fact some of those with power and influence are suddenly turning against Israel, some of those [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1127.76s)]
*  who refused to call this crime what it obviously was from the start, which was predictable and [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1132.32s)]
*  indeed predicted. Well, that's instructive, isn't it? We can see some of those with power and [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1138.08s)]
*  influence, yes, suddenly turning against Israel. That's what's currently going on. Some of those [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1144.1599999999999s)]
*  who refused to call this crime what it obviously was from the start. And here's the key point. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1148.8s)]
*  It was predictable and indeed predicted what has happened. In October 2023, I wrote a Guardian [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1154.48s)]
*  column headlined, Israel is clear about its intentions in Gaza. World leaders cannot plead [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1161.12s)]
*  ignorance of what is coming. The subheading was, the UN is warning of a risk of genocide [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1166.48s)]
*  against Palestinians. Future pleas, or if I knew then what I know now, will not cut it. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1171.68s)]
*  I wrote this column for a very straightforward reason. I wanted to record the fact that it was [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1177.52s)]
*  very clear what Israel was going to do to Gaza from the very beginning. I wanted to make it [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1181.84s)]
*  clear that there was no excuses for not knowing from the very beginning. I wanted to preempt [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1184.96s)]
*  attempts by those who were culpable to revise history. Noting what happened with Iraq, where [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1188.88s)]
*  there wasn't a reckoning. I wrote, as the calamity of Israel's onslaught against Gaza becomes [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1194.32s)]
*  apparent, those who cheered it on will panic about reputational damage and plead their earlier [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1198.8799999999999s)]
*  ignorance. Do not let them get away with it this time. I gave examples of genocidal and criminal [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1204.0s)]
*  statements made by Israeli leaders and officials, as well as crimes being committed like a siege [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1211.36s)]
*  and indiscriminate bombing. And I noted the warnings of genocide being discussed at the time [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1216.08s)]
*  by UN experts, warned about by UN experts. As I've said over and over again, no crime in history [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1221.6s)]
*  has been so confessed to as it happened. No crime in history has been so documented as it happened. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1227.1999999999998s)]
*  As I wrote in that column, nobody with power and influence can be allowed to claim ignorance. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1231.52s)]
*  Yes, we do need those with power and influence to turn against Israel and its genocidal depravity, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LIHhWz_EyM&t=1238.3999999999999s)]
