# Israel Throws Temper Tantrum - Because It Is Losing
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEsE73LPdNQ)
*  Israel is currently having the world's biggest temper tantrum. Now, there are many reasons for
*  this. We've seen, of course, the aftermath of the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court
*  serving requests for the arrest warrants of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defence minister
*  Yo Galant for grave crimes against humanity and war crimes. I'll come back to that, but this is a
*  symptom of a wider problem for Israel. Israel's impunity, which it has enjoyed since its foundation,
*  is falling apart in real time. That is, its ability to act as it wishes without consequences,
*  no matter what laws it breaks, no matter what crimes it commits against the Palestinian people.
*  Now, one of the things which has set the Israeli state off is the fact that Ireland, Norway and
*  Spain have recognised the state of Palestine. Let's just have a listen to Simon Harris,
*  the Irish Taoiseach or Prime Minister. Last month, I stood on these same steps with Prime
*  Minister Sanchez of Spain, and we said that the point of recognising the state of Palestine
*  was coming closer. That point has now arrived. Today, Ireland, Norway and Spain are announcing
*  that we recognise the state of Palestine. Each of us will now undertake whatever national steps are
*  necessary to give effect to that decision. In the lead up to today's announcement, I've spoken
*  with a number of other leaders and counterparts, and I'm confident that further countries will
*  join us in taking this important step in the coming weeks. This is an historic and important
*  day for Ireland and for Palestine. On the 21st of January 1919, Ireland asked the world to recognise
*  our right to be an independent state. Our message to the free nations of the world was a plea for
*  international recognition of our independence, emphasising our distinct national identity,
*  our historical struggle and our right to self-determination and justice. Today,
*  we use the same language to support the recognition of Palestine as a state. We do so because we
*  believe in freedom and justice as the fundamental principles of international law, and because we
*  believe that permanent peace can only be secured upon the basis of the free will of a free people.
*  Now, of course, we should support this move. Harris there refers to Ireland's history,
*  and as a Brit currently in Dublin, hello, I would note that this is clearly a decision informed by
*  the suffering that Ireland endured at the hands of my country, centuries of colonialism, terror,
*  starvation, until it won its freedom. Well, most of Ireland's freedom, with much struggle and
*  sacrifice it must be said. Now, this actually brings Ireland, Norway and Spain into the global
*  mainstream though. 143 of the 193 member states of the United Nations now recognise Palestine as a
*  state. The problem is, of course, that Israel has long rightly calculated that it can defy the wishes
*  of the large majority of the world because it has the support of the United States,
*  its weapons, its aid, its diplomatic support. And given that's the only superpower in town,
*  that's what really counts. It knows the US pays lip service to the idea of a two state solution,
*  but allows Israel's government to trash any prospect of such a two state solution. That's why,
*  despite the correct position of the Irish government in recognising the right of the
*  Palestine to exist, we should resist attempts to revise history. Now, last night I was on
*  Irish television, The Tonight Show, with an Irish minister belonging to the
*  centre-right, Finneagail party, who tried to do just that. Let's have a quick listen.
*  I disagree with that.
*  I disagree with that.
*  Sorry, I'll just finish.
*  And that I certainly would hope to see again that is exactly the sort of moderates that we hope
*  that the only people who can deliver long-term political solution are moderates on both sides.
*  You don't believe that the previous Israeli governments would take any issue with declaring
*  recognition of a Palestinian state.
*  No, no, I didn't say. Well, as part of the previous discussions indeed from the Oslo Accords,
*  a Palestinian state and the structure to be created around that was one of the things to
*  follow from that. It didn't happen, but I'm just saying there's a different historical context than
*  perhaps the one that you've set there again.
*  I don't agree. With all due respect, that's historical revisionism.
*  Oh, I'm sorry. I don't agree with that. With or without respect, I simply don't agree with that.
*  Okay, well, with or without respect, I don't need your respects. But I mean, Shimon Peres,
*  who you're referring to, for example, and he made it clear that a Palestinian state would not be a
*  state. It would be less than a state. Under the so-called moderate Israeli governments you're
*  talking about, that's when the occupation was set up. That's when what is defined by the likes of
*  Israeli human rights organization, Bet-Solem, or international human rights organizations like
*  Amnesty International, apartheid was set up. And under those so-called moderate governments,
*  I would note the settlements in the West Bank expanded. And that all happened with the support
*  and complicity or the failure of US governments to take any actions. And that's because those
*  governments knew they could get away with anything. Anyway, these countries breaking ranks does put
*  pressure on the likes of the United States. That's why Israel has lashed out. The state angrily
*  withdrew its ambassadors from those three countries. Its foreign secretary, Israel Katz,
*  who was longer opposed to the Palestinian state, tweeted out that these nations had
*  undermined Israel's sovereignty and endangered its security, that they sent a message to the world,
*  to the Palestinians and the world, sorry, that terrorism pays. Like a gangster, he said,
*  there will be further severe consequences. Well, Israel Katz knows all about terrorism,
*  given the state he represents has been raging a genocidal campaign of terrorism against the
*  Palestinian people, not just in Gaza, but also the West Bank. He's also tweeted out a truly
*  deranged video, complete with willfully cliched Irish music, with a video entitled Hamas Thanks
*  Ireland with a text, Ireland, if your goal was to reward terrorism by declaring support for
*  Palestinian state, you've achieved it. Simon Harris, he copied him in. Hamas thanks you for
*  your service. Meanwhile, the finance minister, Bezelul Smotrich, declared that the Palestinian
*  people must suffer collective punishment because of these countries recognizing their statehood.
*  He declared there should be three new illegal settlements in the West Bank for every country
*  which recognizes Palestinian statehood, while existing illegal settlements should be strengthened.
*  And Palestinians tax revenue should be withheld. Let's be clear, this is the behavior of a rogue
*  state. All the Israeli state is doing is proving that they are at war with the Palestinian people
*  and have no interest of any description in a lasting just peace. Meanwhile, Israel's online
*  digital army is scraping new lows. The misnamed Twitter account Stop Antisemitism, which is not
*  even trying to pretend, frankly, that it isn't conflating antisemitism with opposition to
*  Israel's crimes, tweeted out, meet Israel's PM Simon Harris on October 7th, Hamas terrorists
*  kidnapped his young daughter, Saoirse, into Gaza. Today, PM Harris announced he is rewarding his
*  daughter's kidnappers with a state of their own. Lunacy, right? Then why are you doing this to
*  Israel? Hashtag what if it was your daughter? I mean, just disgusting rage bait, underlining
*  how depraved Israel's cheerleaders have become. Meanwhile, Israel is lashing out in desperation
*  at the International Criminal Court of Justice's prosecutor Karim Khan and the court staff.
*  Sorry to subject you to this, but let's just listen to Benjamin Netanyahu here.
*  Through this incendiary decision, Mr. Khan takes his place among the great antisemites in modern
*  times. He now stands alongside those infamous German judges who donned their robes and upheld
*  laws that denied the Jewish people their most basic rights and enabled the Nazis to perpetrate
*  the worst crime in history. Let's be blunt, he sounds like a lunatic. The ICC prosecutor Karim
*  Khan, described by former executive director of human rights, Kenneth Roth, as someone who is
*  conservative in his approach and unlikely to bring charges that don't have strong evidence behind
*  him, issued requests for arrest words against both Hamas and Israeli leaders. Netanyahu here says he
*  takes his place, Karim Khan, among the great antisemites in modern times, alongside German
*  judges who helped wage Nazi Germany's murderous persecution of ordinary Jewish civilians and
*  paved the way for the Nazis' Holocaust, the systematic and industrialised extermination
*  of the Jewish people. This is the desperation of a man thrashing around desperately because he's
*  banked to rights. He has been held banked to rights on the charges of obscene war crimes and crimes
*  against humanity. There's more documentation for the crimes committed by the Israeli state and the
*  Palestinian people over these last months than almost any other horror committed in human history,
*  thanks of course to the combination of modern technology and the courage of
*  Palestinian journalists who the Israeli state have sought to butcher and persecute.
*  Now, Netanyahu also personally responded to the decision of these three European nations to
*  recognise the state of Palestine.
*  Well, that's extremely revealing stuff. All Netanyahu is doing here has often got evidence of
*  his genocide of mentality. What he's discussing here is his belief in collective guilt. Just so
*  you're aware, I'm sure many of you will be, but when he says Judea and Samaria, he's using
*  biblical terminology for what is the West Bank. It's there used on the basis of Israel has the
*  right to these lands, to annex these lands. This is Israel's lands, and of course it isn't. It's
*  the Palestinians' lands. The Israeli state has occupied and covered the West Bank in illegal
*  settlements. Now, in the last few months, Israel has waged a campaign of terror against civilians
*  in the West Bank, killing hundreds, including huge numbers of children. Netanyahu's belief in
*  collective guilt here is very important evidence. Collective guilt is always intrinsic to genocide.
*  It is Israel's murderous oppression of the Palestinian people by the Israeli state, of course,
*  which has driven so many to support armed attacks. If we're going down the polling group, a large
*  majority of Israeli Jewish citizens oppose all humanitarian aid to Gaza, which means genocide by
*  starvation, thirst and everything else, as well as being evenly divided between Israel having
*  expended too little firepower or just enough firepower, genocidal again, with a large majority
*  supporting Gaza being ethnically cleansed. Now, I say this not because I support collective punishment
*  of the Israeli population. I don't support doing to Israel what Netanyahu has done to Gaza, or
*  indeed what he believes should be done to the Palestinian people as a whole, and nor should you.
*  We need to strive for a peaceful settlement based on the recognition that Israeli Jews and Palestinians
*  are both equal human beings of equal worth, who should share the land they both belong to on the
*  basis of justice and equality. That is everything these fanatics hate. Now, what Israel is currently
*  facing up to is the fate of apartheid South Africa. It too faced the growing hostility of a world,
*  which became increasingly repulsed by its system of racist domination. It last hour, it had
*  temper tantrums, it played the victim, and eventually it lost and apartheid was dismissed.
*  This is how this story ends too. This is all heading in one direction only, and the Israeli
*  state knows it. That's why they're lashing out. That's why they're desperate, because they're
*  going to lose. It's only a matter of time. Please like and subscribe. Do leave your comments. Do
