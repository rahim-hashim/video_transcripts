Video Description: Remember Israel's claim that al-Shifa hospital was Hamas' headquarters? They used that to justify a devastating attack on the hospital, destroying medical facilities and killing doctors, nurses and patients alike.

Well, a new study in the Washington Post has exposed these claims for what they are - and underline that this was a war crime, and a grave war crime at that.

# Israel's Deadliest Gaza Lie Exposed
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [December 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLvc9ficvBE)
*  This is the most obscene lie in this whole depraved saga and it's just been revealed for what it is.
*  It was used to justify a grave, grave war crime and it should have been very clearly accepted as a lie from the start,
*  as indeed many of us saw it as such.
*  Now I realize that Israel's onslaught is one overarching moral obscenity,
*  but we can't lose sight of the specific war crimes which are being committed.
*  Al-Shifa Hospital suffered a huge military assault and new evidence is conclusive.
*  The basis for this hideous attack was a lie.
*  Now let's just start at the beginning.
*  Al-Shifa is the biggest hospital in Gaza.
*  It was built in 1946 when Palestine was still under British colonial rule.
*  In the midst of Israel's assault on Gaza, which has now killed well over 20,000 people and injured over 50,000 others,
*  such a hospital clearly plays a pivotal role.
*  Whether it functions is a matter of life and death on a grand scale.
*  Not just for those injured by missiles, but keep in mind, say, the 50,000 women who are pregnant with 180 women a day giving birth
*  or indeed people with cancer or serious underlying medical health conditions.
*  But the Israeli Defense Forces declared in October that Al-Shifa Hospital was, and I quote,
*  the main headquarters for Hamas's terrorist activity.
*  Terrorism, they added, does not belong in a hospital and the IDF will operate to uncover any terrorist infrastructure.
*  They then released a mocked up video seemingly detailing a huge labyrinth series of tunnels as well as Hamas meeting rooms.
*  They also declared that Hamas's continued military use of the Shifa Hospital jeopardized the hospital's protected status under international law.
*  That's because, as you probably can guess, without being an international lawyer, you can't actually just attack hospitals.
*  That is a war crime.
*  The exception given is if that hospital is used for clear military purposes, such as as a base to launch rockets,
*  and then it becomes a legitimate military target.
*  Under Article 19 of the Geneva Convention, in those circumstances, an advance warning must be given to the hospital and the attack must be based on the principle of proportionality.
*  Now, the IDF claims were backed up by President Joe Biden's administration in the United States.
*  They said Hamas is operating a command node from the Al-Shifa Hospital when Israel was preparing its final assault.
*  Now, the US provided no intelligence publicly to back up its claims and indeed refused to do so when asked.
*  Now, as well as the medical staff there, foreign doctors who'd worked there strenuously denied the claims about Al-Shifa Hospital.
*  Let's listen to the former Norwegian, sorry, the Norwegian physician who formerly worked at the hospital, Mads Gilbert, as one example.
*  But with the go ahead of the US administration, Israel repeatedly attacked and laid siege to Al-Shifa Hospital,
*  where as well as patients, many thousands of terrified civilians were also sheltering.
*  The hospital was left without power.
*  Doctors, nurses and patients were killed by the Israeli assault while premature babies died.
*  A mass grave was dug for as many as 180 people, with the morgue having long ceased to function.
*  According to the World Health Organization, the hospital became a death zone.
*  When the IDF raided this besieged hospital, they arrested the director of the hospital and several doctors.
*  The IDF then embarked on a propaganda campaign to back up these claims.
*  The evidence they provided was a joke. Not a funny joke.
*  The horror of this can be described as many things, but funny is not one of them.
*  As the brilliant investigative journalist Jeremy Scarhill could put it,
*  the IDF released its first round of purported evidence, which more or less consisted of a smattering of automatic rifles,
*  some nestled behind an MRI machine and a conveniently placed combat vest with a Hamas logo on it.
*  With the exception of Israel's most diehard supporters, this effort appeared to convince almost no one of the sweeping assertions about
*  Al-Shifa's importance to Hamas' current operations.
*  Indeed, damning stuff from the outset.
*  They then released video supposedly showing tunnels below the hospital.
*  It was already known Gaza has an extensive network of underground tunnels, partly used to smuggle in food and crucial supplies.
*  Gaza, after all, has suffered the longest siege in modern history,
*  and we don't have to be a sympathiser to Hamas to be sympathetic to the civilian population getting food and supplies,
*  but as well, almost certainly smuggling weapons, which as Scarhill says, those claims are entirely credible.
*  We also know that there were tunnels and rooms under the hospital because Israel built them when it was occupying Gaza in the 1980s.
*  Now, the IDF released footage of what they said, let's just remind ourselves, was the main headquarters,
*  Hamas' terrorist activity, footage of these tunnels.
*  The best we got was some dilapidated bathroom, and it was pathetic, completely pathetic,
*  completely in no way justified what they said about Al-Shifa Hospital.
*  Israel refused demands from an independent investigation of this tunnel, and then they destroyed it.
*  Convenient, so no one could then investigate the actual evidence.
*  They also released CCTV footage from the 7th of October, which showed two hostages being brought into the hospital.
*  Now, this should not need saying, but I'll keep saying it, when Hamas took civilians' hostages,
*  they committed a grave war crime for which there is no defence.
*  The first thing I would say is they presumably, the IDF, scouted through all the CCTV they could get,
*  and all they could offer up was evidence, as evidence that this was the main headquarters of Hamas was this.
*  Now, one hostage was clearly there being forced in under duress.
*  Obviously, these hostages had been taken violently against their will.
*  The other was clearly receiving medical treatment.
*  Now, when I received, when I pointed this out, that a hostage was receiving medical treatment because you could see it happening,
*  I personally got overwhelmed with bile and smears from apologists for Israel's onslaught.
*  Many of them call me a terrorist, stooge, Hamas cheerleader, and that was the milder end.
*  Now, obviously my point wasn't that Hamas fighters would take hostages they had illegally seized to a hospital
*  because they were filled with the milk of human kindness and really cared about their physical condition.
*  My point was that from their point of view, the value of taking a hostage was that those hostages would be kept alive,
*  otherwise what's the point? You'd kill them on the spot.
*  It's such an obvious, basic point that they're seized because they're bargaining chips.
*  The amount of bad faith required to distort that out of any recognition is quite something.
*  The first thing, obviously Hamas and other groups can do and should do is immediately resort those hostages, obviously.
*  But the second thing is if they're injured, they should obviously make sure they get medical treatment,
*  even if it is for the purpose of keeping them alive as bargaining chips.
*  Again, that is a war crime rather than an actual humanitarian gesture.
*  In any case, whatever they were doing at that hospital, that wasn't evidence to support the IDF's claims.
*  And as I say, one of them did seem to be receiving medical treatment and I've explained why they would be getting medical treatment.
*  Now, the Washington Post, to its credit, has just published a truly shocking piece of investigative journalism.
*  As it notes, the claims were remarkably specific by Israel that five hospital buildings were directly involved in Hamas activities,
*  that the building sat atop underground tunnels that were used by militants to direct rocket attacks and command fighters,
*  and that the tunnels could be accessed from inside hospital wards.
*  Their conclusion?
*  The evidence presented by the Israeli government fall short of showing that Hamas had been using the hospital as a command and control centre,
*  according to a Washington Post analysis of open source visuals, satellite imagery and all of the publicly released IDF materials.
*  The ad, with quite the understatement, that raises critical questions, legal and humanitarian experts say,
*  about whether the civilian harm caused by Israel's military operations against the hospital,
*  encircling, besieging and ultimately raiding the facility and the total world beneath it, were proportionate to the assessed threat.
*  So, their main findings.
*  The rooms connected to the tunnel network discovered by IDF troops showed no immediate evidence of military use by Hamas.
*  None of the five hospital buildings identified appeared to be connected to the tunnel network.
*  There was no evidence that the tunnels could be accessed from inside hospital wards.
*  It goes on to emphasise the unique horror of what happened.
*  The targeting by a US ally of a compound housing hundreds of sick and dying patients and thousands of displaced people has no precedent in recent decades.
*  The March on Al-Shifa caused the hospital's operations to collapse.
*  As Israeli troops closed in and fighting intensified, fuel ran out, supplies couldn't enter and ambulances were unable to collect casualties from the streets.
*  They examined the tunnels, which the IDF claimed were connected to five hospital buildings and could be accessed from inside hospital wards.
*  The Washington Post say that the Post mapped the path of the tunnel by geolocating the excavation sites within Al-Shifa
*  and analysing the videos frame by frame to determine the network's directionality and length.
*  The Post then superimposed the tunnel routes on the original map released by the IDF on October 27th that it said showed the full extent of Hamas' command and control infrastructure.
*  They go on to say none of the five buildings highlighted by the IDF appear to connect to the tunnels
*  and no evidence has been produced showing that the tunnels could be accessed from inside the hospital wards.
*  As for the two small bathrooms, a sink, two empty rooms, according to the Washington Post, no immediate evidence of them being used for command and control.
*  No recent sign of recent habitations that no one had recently been there.
*  The Washington Post also said about the two hostages on the CCTV camera,
*  it was not clear if the hostages were taken to the hospital for medical treatment or other purposes.
*  Missions to the hospital five weeks before the IDF operation did not bear the legality of the IDF operation.
*  Let's be clear. Let's be clear.
*  This was a grave war crime, a grave, grave, grave war crime for which there is no defence, none, zero.
*  And yet, as well as the US administration, multiple commentators, journalists, media outlets,
*  justified the assault on a hospital full of desperately ill Palestinian civilians,
*  including children, including the elderly, including pregnant women and indeed including newborn babies.
*  That includes, for example, a column published in the Washington Post itself entitled
*  Evidence confirms Israel's al-Shifa claims so critics move the goal posts.
*  You can't make this stuff up.
*  Let's take Jake Waller-Simon, the editor of the Jewish Chronicle, and I must say that paper is a travesty.
*  Given the humanity and love which exists in Britain's Jewish community and the contribution
*  made by that community to movements throughout history for justice and liberation,
*  there won't be a left as we understand it without the Jewish community.
*  Now, he tweeted one month ago,
*  As predicted, we all knew the hospital was a Hamas HQ. It was even in season two a founder.
*  Jeremy Bowen and Owen Jones should be eating their words.
*  Well, Jake, it's not me who should be eating my words here.
*  That the US administration and so many commentators propagated these claims
*  helped Israel justify further assaults on hospitals and medical facilities with catastrophic human consequences.
*  Now, here's just one war crime amidst the litany of so many other war crimes.
*  War crimes happening every day.
*  Now, as the gravity of what Israel has done, as the depravity and scale of the war crimes becomes impossible to defend,
*  many of those who cheered on this barbarism have suddenly gone pretty quiet.
*  I don't know if you've noticed this.
*  Maybe they think if they walk away quietly from the crime scene, everyone will forget they were there in the first place.
*  Well, we can't do that. We have to hold them to account.
*  This horror was made possible in part because of those who helped disseminate the lies, the distortions,
*  the propaganda of the Israeli state.
*  They can't get away with it. Indeed, there's something I want to finish by saying.
*  And I don't want this to sound self-indulgent or centering myself.
*  I say this because of the wider point, and I suspect it's how many of you feel as well.
*  I had no illusions in the Western media before this horrendous episode. None.
*  I've worked in the mainstream British media now for 12 years.
*  That's 30% of my entire life.
*  I was fully aware of the racism, the bigotry, the official Western propaganda
*  that's often believed and regurgitated.
*  And I'm not surprised per se by how much of the Western media lined up behind this atrocity
*  or simply refuse to speak out against it and call it what it is.
*  But I am shocked, shocked to my core.
*  The way that Palestinian life has been treated as having no worth of any description,
*  the way the most depraved, unhinged war crimes can be simply accepted and be permissible
*  and receive almost no outrage at all.
*  I'll never go over this or look at the world in quite the same way ever again.
*  And I suspect many of you won't either.
*  This has to be a lesson and a lesson that we learn and act on.
