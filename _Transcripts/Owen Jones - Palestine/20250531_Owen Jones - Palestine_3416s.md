# Israel's LIES Destroyed By Palestinian Analyst - w/. Muhammad Shehada
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64)
*  What a really crucial and disturbing phase of Israel's genocide against the Palestinian [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=0.0s)]
*  people. There is obviously no pretense whatsoever from the Israeli state as their aims, as per [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=4.68s)]
*  their aims, in terms of no Palestinians will remain in Gaza. That's their official plan. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=11.56s)]
*  That's their official strategy. The total destruction of Gaza, that's their official [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=18.8s)]
*  strategy. No hyperbole. That's what they're openly saying. At the same time, we're seeing [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  an interesting phenomenon in Europe where it seems to be crumbling a bit for the genocide [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=27.36s)]
*  lobby for Israel's cheerleaders. Is that meaningful? What's happening? Also, what's going on with [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=32.56s)]
*  the aid situation? There's been an intentional, of course, starvation policy against the Palestinian [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=38.72s)]
*  people in Gaza. But a new so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, what's that all about, backed [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=43.24s)]
*  by Israel and the United States? Well, there's no better analyst than Mohammed Shahada, who [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=51.04s)]
*  is an incredible writer and analyst from Gaza. I always go to your Twitter feed every day. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=55.4s)]
*  That's one of the best possible ways you can get a good handle on what's actually happening [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=67.08s)]
*  on the ground in Gaza. Demonquing lies, myths, cutting through the crap. So it's really, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=70.84s)]
*  again, an honor to have you. So hey, good to see you. How are you doing? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=76.28s)]
*  Thanks so much for having me, Owen. I always appreciate your moral consistency and strong [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=79.88s)]
*  voice on the topic. I know you paid a lot for this, but I really appreciate how you [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=84.16s)]
*  stood your ground. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=88.92s)]
*  Well, I mean, that's very kind of you, but obviously, nothing compared to the Lions of [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=90.8s)]
*  the World's Press Pack, the Palestinian journalists of Gaza, who obviously, they really do pay [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=96.56s)]
*  a price, which is why the silence of my colleagues is so abominable. I just want to start with, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=100.52s)]
*  just on that, actually, that question of silence and things shifting, because obviously, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=108.56s)]
*  Western states, not just the United States, have facilitated this genocide. They've armed [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=112.96s)]
*  and mapped this genocide. Something suddenly seems to be shifting. And we've seen in my own [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=116.16s)]
*  country a government which continues to provide, for example, the key components for F-35 jets, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=121.32s)]
*  which only suspended 8% of arms licenses under huge legal pressure. They're suddenly saying, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=126.88s)]
*  this is intolerable what's happening. And they said they're suspending negotiations over a trade [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  agreement, which is just nothing. And also, they sent their UK trade envoy the next [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=137.6s)]
*  week, which was then posted by the British Embassy in Israel. So, they put in sanctions on [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=142.88s)]
*  some extreme settlers. Again, just tokenistic measures. But even the far-right government in [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=150.96s)]
*  Italy are speaking out. Even the new right-wing German Chancellor has said, this is too much. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=157.92s)]
*  She doesn't know what Israel's doing in Gaza over the last few days. I don't know where it's been [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=165.04s)]
*  for the last 20 months. But that aside, what's your analysis? What do you think is going on? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=168.72s)]
*  Why? And it's the same in the media. There's an opening happening, suddenly hand-wringing, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=176.56s)]
*  and also going over to, well, actually, this is intolerable. What Israel is doing is a disgrace, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=181.6s)]
*  as if they've just woken up and out of a stupor. What do you think about this phenomenon? How do [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=186.24s)]
*  you understand it? Well, first of all, those European governments expected that the anti-genocide [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=192.32s)]
*  movement would die out as a result of two things, fatigue because of the repetition of atrocities [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=199.11999999999998s)]
*  and no end in sight, and a mix of police crackdown, suppressive tactics. What we see now that is [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  basically draconian, unraveling everything that Europe is supposed to stand for in terms of [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=211.76s)]
*  suppression, going after individuals to intimidate, terrorize, and kill a movement in its butt. But [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=216.39999999999998s)]
*  that didn't work. They expected this movement to fade away, to become quiet and disappear. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=222.39999999999998s)]
*  But the opposite happened. And the opposite is happening now because of two things. Number one, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=228.08s)]
*  Netanyahu and his government partners are basically overreaching. And we always see that when those [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=232.88s)]
*  sort of elites overreach, that's when they begin to fall down. When the McCarthyist era was at its [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=238.72s)]
*  peak, it began to crumble after they went after the military. It was okay as long as they went [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=244.56s)]
*  after left wingers. But as soon as they touched the military, it began to unravel. And that is [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=249.36s)]
*  the same with the Israeli government. They basically saw that Netanyahu understood that Trump [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=253.92s)]
*  would give him absolute impunity, this sort of blanket invincibility. And they got drunken on [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=259.36s)]
*  power that they began to speak up and state visibly, blatantly their plans like a James Bond villain. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=265.44s)]
*  And that basically put Europeans in a corner because European leaders early on, they would [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=274.0s)]
*  keep telling us that those statements that are coming out, the genocidal incitement coming out [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=278.71999999999997s)]
*  of Israeli government ministers is basically as a result of shock and trauma. That they were [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=283.68s)]
*  traumatized by October 7th and it was too much for them and it reminded them of atrocities from before. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=290.16s)]
*  And that's why they came up with these statements in a moment of sort of emotional outburst. My [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=296.64s)]
*  answer is always as a Palestinian, I don't have to look back 80 years to activate my trauma. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=301.6s)]
*  The October 6th itself, 2022 and 2023 were the single two bloodiest years in Palestinian [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=307.91999999999996s)]
*  modern history since records began in the West Bank. So I don't need to look beyond those basically [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=313.52s)]
*  the very day before. And you don't see me chanting genocidal slogans. It's not trauma, it's impunity. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=319.35999999999996s)]
*  But they were willing to hide behind these convenient talking points. Ah, these are emotional [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=325.35999999999996s)]
*  statements that don't represent actual policy. But now we're 20 months into the genocide, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=329.28s)]
*  where you have the Israeli government stating explicitly, no, this is not emotional speech. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=334.4s)]
*  This is practical planning. We are planning to push everyone beyond the Moorak corridor in [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=339.2s)]
*  Rafah on the borders with Egypt and then kick them into Egypt and third countries. Or you have Netanyahu [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=344.24s)]
*  saying, we are destroying homes one by one so people would have nothing to go back to. There's [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=350.0s)]
*  nothing left they would have to leave. Or Smotrich saying we're destroying everything that remained [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=354.24s)]
*  of Gaza or even like a member of Knesset explicitly stating and saying, we're killing a hundred people [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=358.64s)]
*  per day. It doesn't make headlines anymore. The world has moved on. The world has forgotten about [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=364.24s)]
*  them. We can keep doing it. So when they go that far explicitly, it makes it difficult for their [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=368.64s)]
*  European accomplices to defend them. And European governments, they understand that basically a mass [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=374.48s)]
*  ethnic cleansing in Gaza into Egypt would destabilize and potentially collapse Egypt, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  which is already in a severe financial crisis. So basically they understand this is a matter of [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=387.12s)]
*  national security and they don't want to have it under hands. The other thing is now Gaza is slowly [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=392.47999999999996s)]
*  sort of creeping into the mainstream domain. You saw the Financial Times basically shaming European [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=397.91999999999996s)]
*  governments and leaders and saying your silence and Gaza is deafening and shameful. And you have [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=404.0s)]
*  like people like Piers Morgan suddenly flipping and pretending that he's been sort of at the [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=409.03999999999996s)]
*  forefront of defending humanity after telling Tucker Carlson explicitly that, ah, what's wrong [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=414.79999999999995s)]
*  with killing civilians in a war? Now he's basically saying Israel is going too far because [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=419.76s)]
*  it became unbearable. So this combination, it pushed European leaders not to take action, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=424.32s)]
*  but to give Israel some extra time to finish off the genocide. What they're doing now is far from [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=429.76s)]
*  taking a firm stance. It's basically what they're doing with all these sort of less, slightly [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=435.59999999999997s)]
*  stronger statements than before is basically a warning shot to tell Israel that we cannot defend [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=441.92s)]
*  you anymore. Our back is against the wall, so hurry up. We cannot buy you more time. It's basically [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=446.96s)]
*  like when you have Germany coming out and saying, ah, Israel is no longer conducting a war that could [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=452.88s)]
*  be justified as a war against Hamas. It's a war that's unjustifiable. And they say that Israel is [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=458.96s)]
*  carrying out atrocities and they recognize all these things. And then you have the foreign [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=465.52s)]
*  minister saying, no, but we reject imposing an arms embargo on Israel. We're not going to take any [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=469.12s)]
*  steps to hold Israel accountable for an unjustifiable assault for their own [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=474.56s)]
*  assessment at the moment. This is basically like condemning a killing spree and then giving the [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=479.52s)]
*  murderer a sharper knife or looking at a pyromaniac and telling him, no, playing with fire is dangerous. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=484.64s)]
*  It's not good for you, but here's a blow torch, a lighter, gasoline, red bull, go and have fun. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=492.0s)]
*  And that's basically the stance like the EU high representative, Kaya Kalas, said we will conduct a [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=496.8s)]
*  review whether or not Israel is violating human rights in Palestine. Seriously, they literally [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=503.36s)]
*  had two reviews, the last of which was leaked in December last year, so not that long ago. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=509.92s)]
*  And it was concluded that Israel was committing crimes against humanity, war crimes violating this [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=515.6800000000001s)]
*  association agreement with the EU into virtual obsolescence. They didn't do anything about it. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=521.92s)]
*  To conduct another review is basically an empty gesture to just say, ah, okay, let's buy Israel [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=526.5600000000001s)]
*  a couple of months more. You had even Emanuel Macron who's saying now we should recognize [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=531.92s)]
*  Palestine, that's the moral thing to do, but under certain conditions. The conditions are Hamas should [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=537.76s)]
*  disarm, Hamas should leave Gaza, Hamas should never play any role in government, Hamas, Hamas, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=544.0799999999999s)]
*  Hamas, Hamas, Hamas. And he knows that all of these things are non-starters. Hamas is not going to [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=548.88s)]
*  disarm. They offered to lay down their arms in a truce for up to 15 years, but to sort of dismantle [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=553.4399999999999s)]
*  armed resistance in its entirety is something that they objected to. So he knows it's impossible. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=560.32s)]
*  So he's using it as an excuse to say, ah, I really want to recognize, which is an empty gesture on [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=565.92s)]
*  its own recognition. It doesn't mean much of anything. It's sort of a symbolic gesture of [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=571.84s)]
*  safe face. I really want to recognize, but Hamas are the ones that are obstructing it. Seriously. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=576.72s)]
*  Like now there's a conference that Macron is holding in Paris on around June 12th, June 13th, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=581.84s)]
*  where he's going to bring about 500 Palestinian and Israeli activists, human rights defenders, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=589.12s)]
*  civil society. And he insists that this should be on the record. All the names should be published [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=593.84s)]
*  despite risk to the participants. And there should be as many cameras as possible. So I asked one of [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=599.44s)]
*  the people helping to organize it. I was like, what do you expect to come out of this? He said, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=605.2s)]
*  it's a photo op to save Macron's face. He's basically sensing this growing heat in the [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=609.28s)]
*  mainstream. And he wants to show that he's actually been the good guy all along. So he's [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=615.6s)]
*  going to do this photo op for safe face. And that's basically where Europeans are at the moment. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=619.84s)]
*  It's interesting you mentioned those statements of genocide and criminal intent by Israeli leaders [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=625.84s)]
*  and the shift in narrative, because I mean, you know, the industry I work in, the Western media [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=630.32s)]
*  aren't passive bystanders, of course, in this genocide, but active facilitators. The genocide [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=635.0400000000001s)]
*  wouldn't have been possible without the role of the Western media. And those statements of criminal [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=638.88s)]
*  and genocidal intent were buried or just ignored altogether from the outset in Western media coverage [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=642.72s)]
*  when they should have framed the coverage around them because they were the most accurate predictors [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=650.4s)]
*  of what actually Israel went and did. But even now, with that shift, you know, a Western media, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=653.6800000000001s)]
*  which had no problem in just weaving in a standard Hamas run health ministry in an effort to sow [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=661.36s)]
*  doubt in the official death statistics, which were by every bit of research, a chronic underestimate [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=666.96s)]
*  of the real death toll. For some reason, even now, when Benjamin Netanyahu says we are destroying [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=673.44s)]
*  more and more homes and Gaza's have nowhere to return to, the only inevitable outcome will be [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=679.2s)]
*  the wish of Gaza to emigrate side the Gaza Strip. When the finance minister Smoczki says we are [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=682.96s)]
*  destroying and dismantling everything in Gaza with no precedent in human history and all the [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=687.6s)]
*  rest of it, that's still not stated as the factual aim of the Israeli government. Do you see what I [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=692.0s)]
*  mean in the Western media coverage? As standard in the way we know they can do the standard weaving [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=698.64s)]
*  thing. Of course. The Israeli government has said that they are destroying Gaza and wish to expel [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=702.72s)]
*  all its 5M population. That's the fact. Do you see what I mean? The coverage still hasn't, won't [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=708.88s)]
*  state the facts of what's happening. Yeah, exactly. It's just minimal criticism to show [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=713.44s)]
*  case some sort of moral platitudes. It's nothing more. So I've like I read before Edward Said's [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=721.6s)]
*  Orientalism and Neom Chomsky's Manufacturing Consent. I never understood them fully until I [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=728.96s)]
*  saw this unraveling in front of my eyes that all the journalists I speak to, literally, I would send [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=734.48s)]
*  articles to mainstream media journalists from Israeli newspapers in Hebrew, from the biggest [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=740.88s)]
*  Israeli newspapers and say, translate this as it is word for word. And every single instance that [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=745.76s)]
*  I did this, there's an editorial decision not to do it. It's not a priority. We need to verify more. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=751.76s)]
*  We need to look into it more. And every time it's killed, like literally a journalist in American [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=757.3599999999999s)]
*  mainstream media, he told me that the editorial rule made a decision to prioritize the protests [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=762.9599999999999s)]
*  in Gaza against Hamas instead of the genocide itself. Although the protests, like people on [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=770.0s)]
*  the street were chanting for an end to the genocide, that was one of the main demands, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=775.84s)]
*  the very first demand before anything to do with Hamas. And that was never reported. So he was [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=779.52s)]
*  saying like, now there is a decision to shift the gaze to distract from the actual genocide by [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=784.72s)]
*  focusing on the demonstrations as the only thing we report on. And like it goes on and on with, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=790.0s)]
*  you know this better than I do, with how much intimidation journalists have been under by their [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=795.44s)]
*  superiors. But some of them, how much sort of opportunism, careerism, cynicism, self-interest [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=800.6400000000001s)]
*  has driven them to basically self-censor, to decide to take Israel's side or to decide to do nothing [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=806.8000000000001s)]
*  or to decide to like mildly weave a narrative that is so technical and boring and nameless that you [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=813.2s)]
*  wouldn't understand anything out of the story. Like I recently saw an article that speaks about [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=821.92s)]
*  Israel's starvation of children in Gaza. And the article never names Israel a single time, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=826.4799999999999s)]
*  doesn't mention the word Israel at all. It just says children are starving, children are dying, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=831.4399999999999s)]
*  children are getting bombardment. Who's doing it? And like once there was a top European leader that [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=836.24s)]
*  told me this explicitly, he said, we always are careful to say Gazans are starving instead of [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=842.4799999999999s)]
*  saying Israel is starving Gazans or Gazans are getting killed instead of an active voice [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=849.44s)]
*  because using an active voice entails legal responsibility to do something about it. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=854.0s)]
*  Whereas when you use it passively, ah, it's just happening. We don't know how it happened. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=859.12s)]
*  Like now you're seeing it where you have pundits coming out and saying, ah, the world, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=863.12s)]
*  Israeli society have been largely kept in the dark about the genocide. They didn't know what was [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=869.5200000000001s)]
*  happening. Now they're waking up to it. Ah, the vast majority are not informed on what is going on. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=874.48s)]
*  Seriously, like in Israel, they mobilized about 400,000 reservists to take part in the genocide. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=879.9200000000001s)]
*  That means in every family, in every home, either someone is actively taking part in this genocide [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=886.24s)]
*  or knows someone first degree, a friend, a colleague, a teacher, a mentor, a student who [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=891.9200000000001s)]
*  took part in the genocide. There was an article in Haaretz that spoke about Israeli pilots and [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=897.04s)]
*  drone operators. And every single one of them has a side career. Like bombing Gazans is basically [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=901.68s)]
*  a side gig, but they have a main job, a main life. One of them is an educator. One of them is a school [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=908.88s)]
*  teacher. One of them is a doctor. And they're basically describing it very sort of unremorsefully [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=913.92s)]
*  saying, ah, we bombed those children. We killed that many people, but I trust that the system [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=920.88s)]
*  would not deliberately target children. That's why I felt at ease with it. They know exactly what [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=925.68s)]
*  they're doing. And Israelis have the internet. The problem is in ignorance, it's genocide or mania. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=930.8s)]
*  Just that point on what the work, because you mentioned about just hit translate. Translate [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=936.8s)]
*  this from Hebrew. It says what Israeli leaders and officials say to their own audiences, which [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=943.92s)]
*  they've said from the beginning, just a litany of genocide or criminal, the most extreme statements [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=947.8399999999999s)]
*  basically you can come up with. Tanya Haj Hassan, a Canadian pediatric intensive care doctor from [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=952.64s)]
*  Canada who served in Gaza. In fact, she left Gaza a month ago and she challenged the BBC on them [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=958.88s)]
*  because what they kept doing is the bottle on behalf of Israel. They just go, Israel would deny. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=965.04s)]
*  Actually, a point which I just thought of when I watched that interview was because the BBC go, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=970.96s)]
*  well, we have to quote all sides. That's our job. But they're not quoting the official Israeli [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=977.04s)]
*  statements made in Israel. This is the point. They're quoting press releases which are [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=983.4399999999999s)]
*  deliberately tailored for Western audiences and behaving as though these Israeli leaders and [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=989.4399999999999s)]
*  statements, sorry, leaders and officials statements to the Israeli public are happening in a parallel [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=994.8s)]
*  universe because you can actually fulfill your obligation as a journalist to quote different [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=999.36s)]
*  sides by quoting what Israeli leaders and officials are saying to their own people rather than pretending [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1004.96s)]
*  that's not happening and then quoting what the Israeli IDF press department are saying [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1012.08s)]
*  for only to Western audiences, not to their own people. Do you see what I mean? They're only [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1019.44s)]
*  choosing to quote what is actually tailor-made as propaganda for Western audiences. Yep, it's like [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1022.72s)]
*  the biggest propaganda operation by omission. They don't actively need to lie. They just need to skip [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1028.0s)]
*  the very important details that would change the entire context and story. Well, at some point, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1034.48s)]
*  I was contacted by a BBC producer before the genocide started. She was very polite, very nice [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1039.52s)]
*  person, but very honest as well. She was very straightforward to the case. She asked me to [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1046.24s)]
*  connect her with someone in the West Bank at a point where Israel was decimating Jenin, Nablus, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1050.8799999999999s)]
*  and all those different Palestinian villages. She said, I need that person to not be too critical [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1056.4s)]
*  of Israel and the occupation and apartheid because then we would have to host an Israeli guest as [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1062.32s)]
*  well to present an opposite view and we don't have time for this. I need that guest to preferably [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1067.36s)]
*  be critical of the Palestinian Authority, critical of Hamas, and not critical of Israel. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1072.4799999999998s)]
*  Good luck finding one that fits this category. You don't ever see the BBC or any of these [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1078.7199999999998s)]
*  media channels pushing back against Israeli leaders whenever they claim on TV that, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1085.04s)]
*  oh, we bombed this hospital because Hamas's entire leadership was hiding underneath in a magical [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1090.7199999999998s)]
*  nonexistent city or that journalist was one of the most dangerous warlords. That's why we needed [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1096.0s)]
*  to bomb him in a hospital in his bed after we tried to kill him a week before. You never see [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1101.36s)]
*  them pushing back or asking for evidence or debunking any of this. No, I mean, it's actually a [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1106.64s)]
*  combination of, well, subservience to Western propaganda and Israel is obviously under the [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1111.84s)]
*  bracket of us and ignorance as well doesn't really help. But you're right, it's systemic. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1117.44s)]
*  It's completely systemic, the whole thing. I just want to talk about, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1123.76s)]
*  in terms of what's been going on with AIDS, because there was, I mean, at the very start, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1128.8799999999999s)]
*  obviously Israel, again, said to the world they were depriving the means of life from Gaza because [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1134.08s)]
*  they were fighting human animals. Major Ghassan Ali, the head of COGAT, for those who don't know, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1139.92s)]
*  the civilian arm of the IDF, made it clear that the civilian population had collective guilt. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1144.8799999999999s)]
*  He said they were cheering and they would, you ask for hell, you'll get hell, and said, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1152.8s)]
*  human beasts will have their food and all the rest cut off. So, but I mean, they obviously [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1159.36s)]
*  imposed a total blockade on the 2nd of March, but there's something called the Gaza Humanitarian [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1163.36s)]
*  Foundation, a US-Israeli very shadowy foundation, which was led by a Marine who then resigned on [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1168.24s)]
*  the basis that it violated the basics of humanitarianism, independence, and so on. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1175.04s)]
*  Can you just tell us a bit, you've been doing incredible work just exposing this, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1181.12s)]
*  because Israel's going, oh, no, no, we are providing aid. And they claimed, which, as you'll [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1184.3999999999999s)]
*  see, is a lie about, well, actually, the reason we have to impose these sieges is because Hamas [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1190.0s)]
*  is stealing the aid and we can't let go to them. And this is a way of stopping that going to them, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1195.28s)]
*  it's going to the people themselves. But this is actually just a very important and quite sick, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1198.2399999999998s)]
*  actually, quite grotesque element of the genocide, this strategy. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1204.0s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. You touched on two important points, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, and [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1208.8s)]
*  then the claim of Hamas looting aid. So the first one, I've spoken to a number of European diplomats, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1213.2s)]
*  UN officials, and people on the ground in Gaza. Every single person I spoke to described this as, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1219.2s)]
*  quote, extremely dangerous, abate, a tool of blackmail, extremely sinister, dystopian, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1224.88s)]
*  and horrifying. People in Gaza told me one has to be completely out of their mind to step afoot in [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1231.2s)]
*  these heavily militarized and surveilled compounds and expect to walk back on their feet alive again. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1236.72s)]
*  So basically, to describe it in simple terms, if you've ever watched the movies Mad Max, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1244.56s)]
*  Fallout, Black Mirror, Minority Report, and any of these sci-fi horror movies, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1250.64s)]
*  combine them together, you get this idea that Israel implemented now. Basically, to take it [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1257.92s)]
*  step by step, I have family and friends in the very north of Gaza, Jabalia, Beit Hanun, and Beit Lahya. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1264.24s)]
*  If they want to get food from that organization, they would have to walk on foot on destroyed, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1270.16s)]
*  decimated streets where buildings are collapsing on all the streets and rubble is everywhere. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1276.0s)]
*  They would have to climb on top of destroyed buildings and rubble and walk through [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1280.88s)]
*  on foot under the baking, boiling sun of the Middle East for about 41 kilometers on foot, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1285.6000000000001s)]
*  which would take almost an entire day. As soon as they get there, under airstrikes, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1292.24s)]
*  so they would expect under bombardment, keep walking, don't look behind you. If anybody falls [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1297.84s)]
*  dead, if anybody dies from thirst or an airstrike, just keep walking, pretend everything is normal [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1302.4s)]
*  for 41 kilometers all day long and expect that you would make it on your feet. When you reach out to [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1308.08s)]
*  the area where that organization is based, you're supposed to pass through a number of Israeli [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1313.92s)]
*  checkpoints that are equipped with facial recognition technology and they're teaming [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1318.48s)]
*  with genocidal soldiers that are craving to burn Gaza to the ground. I literally had a friend who [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1324.56s)]
*  went into Gaza through the Department of Defense and he said, those soldiers, those officers, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1330.08s)]
*  there was no soul behind their eyes. The only thing that lit their eyes ablaze was the word [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1335.04s)]
*  Lahashmi to annihilate. They wanted to burn Gaza to the ground and that was during the ceasefire. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1340.64s)]
*  You're expected to walk past those very nice, horrifying, monstrous soldiers and through a [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1345.6799999999998s)]
*  facial recognition technology where you could be detained and kidnapped based on a system that is [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1350.8799999999999s)]
*  more horrifying than anything we've seen in North Korea or China or any of these claims. China's [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1358.6399999999999s)]
*  social credit system freaked out the world a few years ago. Now Israel implemented the same system [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1364.08s)]
*  but with lethal consequences where artificial intelligence would scrap all your data online, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1370.0s)]
*  all your digital footprint and give you a score. That score would determine whether or not you live [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1375.6s)]
*  or die. That score would literally give you a categorization whether or not you are supportive [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1382.08s)]
*  of Hamas based on your social media activity, based on people you've been in touch with on [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1388.24s)]
*  WhatsApp or other groups. It's basically these gospel and where's daddy artificial intelligence [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1392.96s)]
*  tools. A lot of those tools would just save target names in a bank of targets until one of [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1398.16s)]
*  them would surface in front of a facial recognition checkpoint and then they would be kidnapped. I [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1405.28s)]
*  literally had a friend whose brother was kidnapped at one of those checkpoints and the only evidence [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1410.0800000000002s)]
*  is really held against them. They said like when you were a child, literally when you were a child [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1415.8400000000001s)]
*  14 years ago in 2011 you went to a demonstration where some members of the Palestinian Islamic [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1421.28s)]
*  Jihad showed up as well. So that means you are affiliated with them and now we hold you under [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1428.88s)]
*  the illegal combatants act which means that you will be released or you will be held as sort of [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1434.0800000000002s)]
*  a strategic asset to negotiate a prisoner swap with Hamas. You will be released as soon as the war [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1439.52s)]
*  is ended but not before. You're just held as a hostage basically. So you would expect to pass [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1445.6s)]
*  that checkpoint with a high chance of getting kidnapped or killed. We've seen now Israel killing [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1451.04s)]
*  12 people and wounding 63 since this organization began operation. Once you step into beyond the [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1455.6799999999998s)]
*  checkpoints and into the compound you will be shuffled, herded into feeding pins like animals, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1462.7199999999998s)]
*  into caged metal, fenced areas, a concentration camp basically. The organization itself was worried [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1468.08s)]
*  explicitly in an internal document that was reported by the Washington Post. One of their [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1475.28s)]
*  main concerns is that people will immediately see this as a concentration camp and rightly so [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1479.76s)]
*  where you would be like literally fenced in for a whole day waiting whether or not you will get [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1484.6399999999999s)]
*  food and they would only give food to 8 000 people per day. The rest are sent back to starve to death. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1489.84s)]
*  So that is the first problem is that it's practically unworkable for any person with a [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1495.6s)]
*  disability, pregnant women, children, the elderly. Like now you have in Gaza the biggest cohort [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1500.16s)]
*  of child amputees in human history and the biggest cohort of child sort of killing in modern history [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1505.44s)]
*  in the 21st century and you have the largest number in Palestinian history of orphan children. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1513.92s)]
*  You have like every day in these soup kitchens and these communal initiatives you have lines [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1519.1200000000001s)]
*  filled up only with children, some of whom are missing limbs and they're crying and they're [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1524.72s)]
*  breaking in tears and they're collapsing from hunger. So you would expect a child with that [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1530.24s)]
*  sort of very starved body to walk 41 kilometers into that trap. So that's the first layer. The [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1534.72s)]
*  other layer is forcible expulsion that Israel strategically set up these compounds in the very [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1542.32s)]
*  south of Gaza so that they would tell people if you want to have food depopulate northern Gaza in [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1547.92s)]
*  its entirety, leave it, turn it into a howling wilderness and we will concentrate you closer and [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1553.92s)]
*  closer to Rafah and then you would be expelled to Egypt. That's basically Netanyahu's and Smotrich's [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1559.8400000000001s)]
*  publicly stated plan. Then the other level is what the UN warned about along with basically [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1565.6000000000001s)]
*  every human rights and humanitarian organization that works in Gaza. There was an internal memo [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1571.3600000000001s)]
*  in which they said this carries a clear risk of mass interment which means concentration camps. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1576.96s)]
*  Netanyahu made this clear. He said people who would go to get aid at some point they will not [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1583.04s)]
*  be allowed to go back. They would have to stay in these fenced areas and there's the other risk [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1587.44s)]
*  that basically this apparatus is the ultimate tool of blackmail, surveillance and punishment. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1592.56s)]
*  So one European diplomat said if this goes through and it is sustained, Palestinians would be the [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1599.6s)]
*  most surveilled people on the face of planet earth in modern human history, period, worse than North [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1605.44s)]
*  Korea. But the other level is this organization only provides food to at best maximum half of the [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1612.0s)]
*  population. The other half is expected to starve to death and who picks and chooses? It's Israel, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1619.2s)]
*  it's those mercenaries, American mercenaries. One of them described himself as quote a degenerate [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1625.12s)]
*  who joined the army to inflict pain. That's one of the people running this. The others are basically [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1630.48s)]
*  Hilbelis so it's like something from Mad Max where you have those armed hooligans standing and having [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1636.24s)]
*  fun like you saw the scene of an American mercenary laughing and having fun in front of a giant crowd [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1641.2s)]
*  imprisoned in a concentration camp waiting for food. And every day when the food runs out, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1647.04s)]
*  those mercenaries start to fire tear gas, tongue grenades and even live fire at people to push [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1652.72s)]
*  them back. So when you put all of these things together, when you give food to only half of the [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1657.8400000000001s)]
*  population not the other half, it means Israel would hold the power to use this for blackmail. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1662.72s)]
*  So if they want to blackmail you into becoming a collaborator or an informant or snitching on your [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1667.92s)]
*  own family, they will tell you okay the only way you can get food provide us with this information. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1672.72s)]
*  We've already seen an incident of this sort where the IDF took aside an elderly man and asked him [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1677.2s)]
*  about a distant relative whom he doesn't know anything about and they asked him to provide [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1683.28s)]
*  information in order for them to allow him to access the humanitarian hub quote unquote. And [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1687.52s)]
*  then basically when he said I don't know anything about the guy, that elderly man disappeared. He [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1692.8000000000002s)]
*  was taken aside and kidnapped by the IDF. So the last element is that this structure is the [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1697.76s)]
*  ultimate incentive for looting. Oh yeah, of course. Yeah, if you just if you let in just a tiny amount [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1704.32s)]
*  of a token amount of food into a starving population that anyone who knows anything [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1710.48s)]
*  about basic humanitarian provision knows that will happen. Exactly. Yeah, yeah. So that's the [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1716.16s)]
*  other point that you mentioned about Hamas looting aid and very briefly, don't take my word for it, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1721.92s)]
*  take Israel's own word. The IDF conducted a review into 110 incidents of looting that they [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1726.72s)]
*  recorded recently and they said look, they said zero, none of them were carried out by Hamas. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1733.04s)]
*  They were carried out by criminal gangs, organized armed clans and families or disparate starving [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1739.2s)]
*  people. And then the plot twist is that those criminal gangs are operating with Israeli [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1744.8s)]
*  protection in areas that Israel deemed as extermination zones. No Palestinian is allowed [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1748.88s)]
*  to walk there. Anybody who does would be shot on sight. Whereas those people, those criminal gangs [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1753.44s)]
*  established military complexes. That was literally the report in the Washington Post. And they are [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1758.96s)]
*  looting aid right in front of Israeli soldiers and troops and tanks, 100 meters away from them. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1764.72s)]
*  And the only time that those soldiers would fire is at the police, the local police, whenever they [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1770.0800000000002s)]
*  try to stop the looting. We've seen dozens and dozens of policemen getting killed and bombed by [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1775.3600000000001s)]
*  Israeli drones as soon as they approach an area to stop an organized looting attempt. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1780.16s)]
*  So that's the number one. Like number two, you have Cindy McCain, the wife or the widow of one of the [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1785.3600000000001s)]
*  most pro-Israeli senators in US history, John McCain, saying that Hamas has nothing to do with [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1790.8000000000002s)]
*  the looting. It's the desperation that's created by the starvation that leads to this looting. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1795.76s)]
*  And number three, you have David Sutterfield, Biden's humanitarian envoy, who said on two [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1799.92s)]
*  occasions that Israel could never privately alleged. They didn't even dare to make an [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1804.32s)]
*  allegation privately, let alone provide any evidence of Hamas looting aid. And then you have [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1810.24s)]
*  Israel's ambassador to the EU saying explicitly in mid October, 2023, that there's no evidence of EU [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1816.8799999999999s)]
*  aid being subverted or going to Hamas. But even like use common sense. Why would Hamas steal aid? [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1824.8s)]
*  Israel's answer is that they would steal aid to buy weapons from where? Walmart, Amazon, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1832.48s)]
*  Gaza's completely sealed off. Then the Israeli second answer is Hamas would steal aid to sell [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1837.1200000000001s)]
*  it on the black market and do what with the money. The only thing you can buy in Gaza right now is [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1842.16s)]
*  more food. So sell food to buy food. And then the third talking point is basically Hamas is stealing [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1846.32s)]
*  aid in a systematic way. Well, Israel maintains the most meticulous surveillance in human history [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1852.96s)]
*  on the face of the earth in Gaza, where they surveil every single inch, every dot on the map [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1859.04s)]
*  with satellite surveillance, drone surveillance, predator drones, as well as these quadcopter [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1865.28s)]
*  drones. And both of them are sort of equipped to shoot to kill or bomb to kill. And they've never [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1870.48s)]
*  recorded a single incident on camera of Hamas looting aid. Are Hamas really that good at stealing [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1876.56s)]
*  aid? Like Israel is able to spot Hamas policemen when they approach a truck from a distance and [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1882.24s)]
*  bomb them, but they're not able to spot Hamas diverting a whole aid truck and stealing it away. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1887.2s)]
*  And if Hamas would steal aid, are Hamas that idiotic to steal aid to put it in a warehouse [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1893.04s)]
*  that Israel would bomb immediately? These trucks that are carrying the aid are fitted with GPS [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1897.76s)]
*  monitors. They are monitored by Israeli drones. And Israel is the one that dictates which road [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1903.04s)]
*  they should drive on. If any of them diverts from that road, they get bombed immediately. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1908.16s)]
*  So like it's insane that Israel would even try to make that talking point. The more insane thing [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1913.52s)]
*  is basically I was yesterday talking to a journalist and she kept mentioning Israel's [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1919.76s)]
*  allegation, Hamas stealing aid, Hamas stealing aid. And I said, listen to what Israelis themselves [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1923.9199999999998s)]
*  are saying. But she said, yeah, I understand. I understand your point, but I still have to [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1928.56s)]
*  emphasize that Israel says Hamas is stealing aid. Seriously. That's the point where we're at. It's [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1933.04s)]
*  basically like the Hamas stealing aid is a talking point that is used to externalize blame [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1939.2s)]
*  for Israel's stated starvation policy. It's like human shields. I mean, overwhelming evidence of [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1944.48s)]
*  Israel using palaces is human shields, but the narrative just gets fixed on that in order to [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1950.16s)]
*  justify wiping Gaza off the face of the earth. Yeah, yeah, precisely. And that's the last thing [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1954.72s)]
*  about this GHF foundation is that it is a cover up to allow only less than 10% of what Gaza actually [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1958.8s)]
*  need for basic survival. So Israel said they would allow 60 trucks, 20 to 60 trucks to go [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1967.12s)]
*  to that organization per day. Gaza needs a minimum of 600 on a normal day, let alone after 80 days [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1972.2399999999998s)]
*  of full starvation or 20 months of genocide. So 60 out of 600, that would mean that Gazans are [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1978.8799999999999s)]
*  getting way less food than what prisoners got in the Gulag concentration camps. Like the daily [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1985.04s)]
*  intake of any Gazan at the moment is about a third of a concentration camp inmate in the Gulags. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1990.8s)]
*  And also, I mean, the executive of Refugees International pointed out that the contents [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=1996.48s)]
*  of these packages were often, for example, dry pasta and rice, which you need cooking materials, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2000.96s)]
*  you need fuel in order to cook, which are banned from getting into Gaza. So it's actually in many [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2006.16s)]
*  cases not even practical. And the other part, I mean, again, we just have to listen to what [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2011.2s)]
*  Israeli leaders say. Smotrich, finance minister, who opposed aggressively all humanitarian aid [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2015.2s)]
*  getting in suddenly backed this scheme because he said it would oversee the entry of the minimum [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2021.44s)]
*  necessary to stop the world so that the world does not stop us. That's what he said. And also, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2025.52s)]
*  he said, you know, within a few months, we were able to declare that we have won, Gaza will be [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2031.6s)]
*  totally destroyed. And he said the population will be totally despairing, understanding there's [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2036.32s)]
*  no hope and nothing to look for in Gaza. We'll be looking for relocation to begin a new life in other [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2041.44s)]
*  places. Just have to take them literally, don't we? Just literally just take what they say. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2045.12s)]
*  That's what it is. It's not a secret. Smotrich should just be given as much air time as possible. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2050.3199999999997s)]
*  They should just host him on CNN, BBC, Sky News and let him run his mouth. And basically, like, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2056.8799999999997s)]
*  what Smotrich is saying has been Israeli government policy since they occupied the [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2062.4799999999996s)]
*  Palestinian territory. So in 67, you have Israel's defense minister, who was a left winger. And he [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2066.9599999999996s)]
*  was described as he was like spoken of as the most sympathetic Israeli politician towards [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2072.64s)]
*  Palestinians, Moshe Dayan. And Moshe Dayan is saying, we will tell Palestinians this, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2077.44s)]
*  our policy is clear. Whoever wants to stay shall live like dogs. Otherwise, they should leave. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2081.52s)]
*  And that has been consistently Israel's policy, cage Palestinians in an uninhabitable cage until [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2087.52s)]
*  they give up and leave. Now they're just expediting the process. I lived through multiple Israeli [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2093.2000000000003s)]
*  wars in Gaza, three wars, 10 high tech killing sprees, what is called military operations and [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2099.04s)]
*  two grand invasions. And after each of which, Israel would conduct these mass terror bombing, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2103.04s)]
*  they would turn major parts of Gaza entire neighborhoods back to the Stone Age. And they [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2109.36s)]
*  would maintain this siege that kills the economy and destroys any individual's future there. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2114.16s)]
*  Virtually everyone I know in Gaza would reach the age of 40 without ever having had a job without [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2119.92s)]
*  being able to move out of their parents' homes or put food on the table or afford to fall in love [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2124.64s)]
*  and start a family or have purpose despite having many, many qualifying degrees and very [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2129.36s)]
*  high levels of education. And that was basically Israel's modus operandi, keep Gazans living like [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2134.2400000000002s)]
*  dogs with periodic massacres, high tech killing sprees to terrorize them into leaving. By October [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2139.6s)]
*  7th, 2023, about a quarter million Gazans had already left since Israel's siege on Gaza started [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2145.2000000000003s)]
*  in 2007. And the quarter million was an underestimate because public authorities, they tried to like [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2152.0s)]
*  avoid creating a sense of societal panic by suppressing the numbers. So now you just have [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2158.24s)]
*  Israel instead of this incremental slow process of attritional genocide, pushing Palestinians out [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2164.64s)]
*  slowly, they're just expediting it, accelerating as much as possible while ensuring there's nothing [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2171.6s)]
*  left of Gaza. So there is no possibility of any organized human life there for the next century, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2176.24s)]
*  at least. I mean, just before we're going to ask you about that, the other thing I want to ask [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2181.9199999999996s)]
*  you about is the, in terms of obviously we'll conclude on that, but where do you think things [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2187.52s)]
*  down with the ceasefire negotiations at the moment? What do they actually mean? [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2192.16s)]
*  The ceasefire, basically, since it collapsed in March, Israel, like when the ceasefire was [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2197.04s)]
*  signed, Israel violated the ceasefire at least a thousand times. They killed 150 people. Hamas [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2204.32s)]
*  never fired a single bullet in return. It was like incredibly self-restraint. And that's the [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2209.68s)]
*  bar that you have there, a designated terror group in the UK versus what the UK considers the [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2215.12s)]
*  closest ally in the region. And the closest ally is the one that kept killing people during a [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2220.72s)]
*  ceasefire without ever being called out for it. But when Israel collapsed the ceasefire officially [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2225.52s)]
*  and said, the ceasefire is no more, that's when you had Steve Witkoff trying to step in to come [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2230.4s)]
*  up with a new bridging proposal between Israel and Hamas. And he's gone through a number of rounds, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2235.8399999999997s)]
*  like the way it works. I asked a number of American former officials, senior diplomats, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2241.76s)]
*  and people close to the White House. They said the White House is minimally staffed. When you go there [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2246.96s)]
*  is basically no one, it's empty. And the only people that are dictating, that are discussing, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2251.1200000000003s)]
*  negotiating the Gaza ceasefire are Trump, Witkoff, and occasionally JD Vance. Marco Rubio, the state [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2256.1600000000003s)]
*  department, the national security council are not even in the loop on this, which is a good sign. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2262.7200000000003s)]
*  You don't need Marco Rubio on this file at all. But basically what you have is the Arab media has [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2267.12s)]
*  told me that Witkoff is serious about getting a deal done. He was very serious about it. And he [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2273.04s)]
*  tried multiple, multiple rounds of negotiations, but he got swamped with other files, Ukraine, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2278.32s)]
*  Iran, and Syria, that he's handling on his own, single-handedly without sort of staff or an office. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2285.36s)]
*  So that gets him sort of drowned in the other noise. That's when you had Shara Bahbah, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2292.08s)]
*  the guy that ran the Arabs for Trump campaign, that stepped in and tried to bridge between the [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2296.56s)]
*  White House and Hamas and talk to Hamas directly. You had also Adam Baller, Trump's hostage negotiator, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2301.7599999999998s)]
*  trying to talk to Hamas face to face on four different occasions. And as soon as Israel got [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2307.6s)]
*  any sort of rumors of this, they managed to kill it immediately. They did everything possible to [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2313.12s)]
*  take Baller off that file because they sensed an extreme danger that the U.S. would see Palestinians [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2317.84s)]
*  as people that are rising to a level of respectability, that they are not the problem. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2325.04s)]
*  Basically, Hamas was offering to lay down their arms, have a ceasefire, a truce in the West Bank, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2330.0s)]
*  Gaza, and Jerusalem for the next 15 years, dismantle tunnels, step down from government. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2333.92s)]
*  And that's precisely why Israel killed that initiative immediately. But then you had these [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2338.48s)]
*  multiple negotiations where Witkoff would try to bridge the gap between the two sides. And they [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2343.68s)]
*  managed to get to a very solid outline a couple of days ago. Hamas accepted it. Israel immediately [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2348.72s)]
*  came out and said, we reject this outline completely. It's a non-starter. We're not going [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2354.24s)]
*  to deal with it. Like even when Hamas said, we're willing to not produce any new rockets, we're [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2358.56s)]
*  willing to lay down arms, we're willing to do all of this, Netanyahu came out and said, this is [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2363.68s)]
*  non-negotiable. This is an un-starter. He just got in a panic attack because he wants the guys, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2367.52s)]
*  the pretext of Hamas as a sort of a solid armed threat to Israel and Gaza to continue the genocide. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2372.4s)]
*  But basically what you had there is as soon as the Witkoff proposal was accepted by Hamas, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2379.6s)]
*  Israel goes out denounces and condemns this proposal. So Witkoff had to take a step back [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2385.04s)]
*  because he's not allowed to criticize Netanyahu publicly and say that Hamas are not the obstruction [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2390.1600000000003s)]
*  Netanyahu is. You see all the sort of interpersonal relations between the Netanyahu government and [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2395.2000000000003s)]
*  Trump's family, Trump's orbit, Witkoff himself, different business entanglements, etc. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2402.4s)]
*  Miriam Adelson, all these lobbyists, philanthropists, donors, whatever. And it plays a major role where [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2407.28s)]
*  it sort of constrains the US or the White House's ability to call out Netanyahu publicly. And [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2413.6800000000003s)]
*  they're basically like the talking point that runs in the White House and in Israel is that if you [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2419.52s)]
*  ever criticize Israel, it would embolden Hamas and sort of make them less compromising in negotiations. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2424.7200000000003s)]
*  So that's basically what the lie that they keep telling Witkoff to avoid criticizing Netanyahu [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2431.6s)]
*  publicly. He did criticize him on an occasion where he said that Israel wants an endless war in Gaza, [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2436.3199999999997s)]
*  whereas that is not the way to get the hostages out. But now what you had as soon as Israel condemns [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2442.56s)]
*  this, Witkoff takes a step back and embraces Netanyahu's position as it is 100% and says this [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2447.92s)]
*  is the new proposal. And what you had after this is mediators trying to like change the wording [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2454.48s)]
*  and it introduced some vague language that would make it give some plausibility of an end to the [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2461.52s)]
*  genocide at the end of the release of all captives in Gaza. But it's still nowhere near enough [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2467.12s)]
*  because we have two episodes where the US would provide guarantees that Israel would violate [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2472.08s)]
*  immediately and the US does absolutely nothing. The collapse of the ceasefire and the constant [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2477.52s)]
*  violation of it up to a thousand times, but also the release of Aidan Alexandra, the Israeli-American [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2482.56s)]
*  soldier that was captured from a tank on October 7th. Amos released him unconditionally, freely, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2488.24s)]
*  for nothing in return except for a promise of Trump calling for an end to the war and [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2494.24s)]
*  humanitarian aid being resumed in Gaza. Israel immediately amplified the bombardment of Gaza up [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2499.3599999999997s)]
*  to 200% immediately after the release and refused to abide by any of this. So there is no incentive [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2505.2s)]
*  to trust the word of the White House that they would actually guarantee some good faith negotiations [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2510.9599999999996s)]
*  as they say. So it's still running like the main premise is does a ceasefire mean Israel seizing [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2516.72s)]
*  fire or does it mean posing bombardment to get hostages out and then resuming genocide? [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2523.12s)]
*  And that's Netanyahu's position. It's just a temporary pose, get our people out and then [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2529.2s)]
*  bomb them with 10 times the intensity. And that is what the strategic aim of Israel is, which is [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2533.68s)]
*  that no Palestinians will remain in Gaza alive. I mean, that's what this is all directed at. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2543.36s)]
*  Yeah, and Gaza represents sort of a more substantial value for Israel to carry out this genocide than [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2550.7999999999997s)]
*  anywhere else in the occupied territory because Gaza is basically the Cape Town of Palestine, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2559.12s)]
*  a Cape Town what made it unique, what made it the chief organizers of the anti-apartheid struggle [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2564.4s)]
*  and an undying insurgency is basically Cape Town was a combination of South Africans that came from [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2570.24s)]
*  all over the country from every part of it as workers. So they had unions and organized, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2576.08s)]
*  whereas in the Bento stands, for example, you can easily buy off the chief of a clan or a tribe and [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2581.52s)]
*  then buy the silence of that tribe. But in Cape Town, it was impossible because it's people from [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2587.7599999999998s)]
*  all different backgrounds. And that's what you have in Gaza. Two thirds of the population are [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2592.08s)]
*  refugees whom Israel ethnically cleansed from the entire land of Palestine in 1948 and specifically [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2596.08s)]
*  from the very kibbutzim that surround Gaza today. Like Sederot and all these different Israeli towns [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2602.24s)]
*  and cities around Gaza are built on the ruins, on the mass graves of Palestinians and villages [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2609.2s)]
*  that were completely depopulated. So that's why Israel since 1948, like the idea of emptying out [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2614.72s)]
*  Gaza is not new. From the day of the Nakba, Israel tried to push Gazans out and Palestinian [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2620.4s)]
*  refugees in Gaza in specific to push them to leave. So they tried, they organized something that was [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2626.08s)]
*  called the Unit 101 under Ariel Sharon, who later became Israel's butcher, prime minister, [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2630.7200000000003s)]
*  minister of defense and responsible for the most atrocious day in Palestinian history. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2636.88s)]
*  Like you think October 7th was atrocious, Sabra and Shatila was four October 7th in one day. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2641.52s)]
*  A 3,500 Palestinians killed, massacred in a refugee camp in Lebanon under Ariel Sharon's [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2648.56s)]
*  own supervision. But basically what Israel found that Unit 101 in 1951 that carries out these terror [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2654.64s)]
*  attacks against Palestinians, they called it reprisal attacks to prevent Palestinian refugees [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2662.96s)]
*  from trying to go back to their homes and kill Palestinian insurgency, any form of resistance [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2668.0s)]
*  in Gaza. And they escalate this. They even came up with a practical plan to move 12,000 Palestinian [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2673.04s)]
*  refugees in Gaza to the Sinai desert. The US paid UNRWA and Egypt about $30 million, which is the [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2679.7599999999998s)]
*  equivalent today of $350 million to do this program. And Palestinians in Gaza revolted and took to the [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2687.12s)]
*  street in mass in 1955. They killed the idea. Then the year after Israel occupies Gaza destroys the [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2693.6s)]
*  railway that connects Gaza to Egypt, kicks as many people as possible out. 1967 Israel occupies Gaza [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2700.08s)]
*  again. And then every year they try these terror bombings, these campaigns of pressure and [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2706.3199999999997s)]
*  rendering Gaza uninhabitable to push as many people out as possible. So Israel is still keen [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2712.48s)]
*  on this because if they succeed in Gaza, they don't need to even do it in the West Bank. Just [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2717.52s)]
*  the basic threat that we're going to do to you what we did in Gaza would send people flying and [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2723.2799999999997s)]
*  running away. Like basically the Dariusine massacre, one ginormous massacre that would be [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2727.76s)]
*  a cautionary tale for Palestinians to run for their lives. And that's why you had Ehud Olmert, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2732.96s)]
*  Israel's former prime minister, right-winger. He's been a member of Netanyahu's Likud long before [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2737.84s)]
*  Netanyahu ever joined the Likud. He was even a member of Herut, the Freedom Party, that Einstein [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2743.44s)]
*  condemned as akin to fascists in Europe. And basically Ehud Olmert comes out and says, [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2749.1200000000003s)]
*  the settler leaders in the West Bank are making genocidal declarations against Palestinians, [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2755.36s)]
*  not in Gaza, in the West Bank. That's what we already in Jenin and Nablus and Tulkarem, [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2760.32s)]
*  Israel already displaced 60,000 people and wiped out the Jenin refugee camp. It's just like this [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2765.36s)]
*  incremental genocide that's unfolding as well. But if they manage to succeed with Gaza, it would [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2771.28s)]
*  make it very, very extremely easy for them to do it in the West Bank, just with the basic threat. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2776.32s)]
*  We're going to do to you what we did to Gaza, cage you into a concentration camp for 20 months, [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2780.64s)]
*  non-stop bombardment until you either are mass exterminated or you leave. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2785.6s)]
*  Finally, I mean, linked to all of this, and going back to where we started really, [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2792.3199999999997s)]
*  I get the sense that maybe part of the shift taking place is a recognition that this crime is too [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2799.2s)]
*  extreme and too unapologetic and too documented to get away with and that a reckoning is going to [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2806.64s)]
*  come. A reckoning is going to happen because Western politicians and journalists, people in [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2812.7999999999997s)]
*  the media, think they're protected by an iron dome of Israeli impunity reinforced with anti-Palestinian [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2819.2799999999997s)]
*  racism. And that will protect them in perpetuity. But I think they're seeing that already beginning [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2826.48s)]
*  to fragment in real time. And who's to know what will happen in a year's time, in two years' time, [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2833.84s)]
*  in five years' time, in 10 years' time, in 20 years' time? There's no statute of limitations [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2839.84s)]
*  on genocide. You can be prosecuted for that any point in the rest of your life. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2845.44s)]
*  A conservative MP challenged David Lammy, the Foreign Secretary, a right-wing conservative, [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2856.7200000000003s)]
*  and said, he challenged a junior minister and said, have you taken legal opinion on your personal [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2863.44s)]
*  liability, as well as the Foreign Secretary's personal legal liability, and the Prime Minister, [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2869.04s)]
*  and other ministers, for the reckoning? He said, for the coming reckoning. That was a conservative [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2874.16s)]
*  MP. I think they think there's going to be a reckoning. And I just wonder what you think about that. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2879.68s)]
*  Precisely. You saw it with the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, that's now the General [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2884.56s)]
*  Secretary of NATO, Mark Rother, who basically asked his own people, how do we make it sound on [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2889.6s)]
*  paper in bureaucratic procedures? How do we make it sound less war-crimey so that we can get away [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2894.7999999999997s)]
*  with it explicitly? They understand the personal liability, and they just incriminated themselves. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2901.2s)]
*  When you have all those public officials saying Israel's war in Gaza is, according to Germany, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2906.08s)]
*  unjustifiable, or according to the UK and France and Canada, that Israel is starving Gazans and [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2910.88s)]
*  threatening Israel, unless you stop this, we're going to act, and then not following it by any [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2917.52s)]
*  action at all. It's self-incriminating. But then Israelis themselves understand that there is a [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2922.6400000000003s)]
*  moment of reckoning for this genocide. So at some point during the genocide, I was at a conference [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2928.4s)]
*  where I spoke to an Israeli journalist. And basically, I asked her, what would happen if [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2935.6800000000003s)]
*  Israel disarms Hamas, dismantles them? Hamas is completely gone, and Gaza is demilitarized, [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2940.8s)]
*  and what Netanyahu says denazified, although if you check any Israeli TikTok channel or telegram [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2946.64s)]
*  channel, you will see who actually needs deradicalization. But suppose Gaza is [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2951.3599999999997s)]
*  denazified, deradicalized, we become hippies, and Hamas is gone completely, and we're completely [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2955.68s)]
*  disarmed, and the entire population there is just singing hymns, praises of Israel, and singing [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2961.12s)]
*  Ahmaia, Israel Chai. What would happen? Would Israel lift the blockade? And her answer was very [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2967.3599999999997s)]
*  honest and stunning. She said, no, absolutely not, because now you have, after everything we've done [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2973.2s)]
*  to you, you have a quote, revenge incentive. You will never forgive us for this. Like she understood, [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2978.16s)]
*  we massacred you for 20 months straight. You're not going to let go of this easily. We're not going to [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2985.4399999999996s)]
*  sleep soundly at night knowing that this entire population that we tried to destroy is still [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2990.3199999999997s)]
*  living about 10 minutes away from us. And basically, Israel had this rationale as a legal procedure, [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=2995.3599999999997s)]
*  even before this genocide started. So I applied once for a permit to travel out of Gaza, [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3002.56s)]
*  I think in 2015, 2016. So it was about 10 years ago. The permit, first time it was rejected without [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3007.36s)]
*  any explanation. Second time, it's still being processed until today. If you open the official [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3013.2799999999997s)]
*  website, it says it's being processed. But I contacted a number of organizations. One of them [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3018.0s)]
*  was the Israeli organization, Gisha, a human rights organization that provides legal help and [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3023.84s)]
*  counsel for Palestinians on freedom of movement. And I asked for their help. And the first question [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3028.32s)]
*  they asked me was this, did Israel ever kill a member of your family? Did Israel ever imprison [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3033.92s)]
*  a member of your family? Did Israel ever bomb your home? Because if Israel did any of this, [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3039.52s)]
*  you would have lost your right to travel because you have quote, revenge incentive. So there's no [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3044.6400000000003s)]
*  way they would let you out through areas, through borders. That is quite dystopian. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3050.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, precisely. North Korea on steroids. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3057.52s)]
*  I mean, that is Black Mirror. It's a horror film. And it is a horror. It was not a horror film. It was real. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3062.96s)]
*  It's happening before us, live stream every day. Yeah, yeah. Like you always read about Radio Rwanda [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3066.7999999999997s)]
*  and all the horrors that came out of it. And now you see mainstream media, not just Israeli media, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3074.48s)]
*  mainstream media becoming Radio Rwanda, where they are very adamant to remind us every day [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3079.7599999999998s)]
*  that Hamas are worse than ISIS, that Deuce are absolute monsters, that Deuce are the worst that [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3086.0s)]
*  God ever created. They beheaded Israeli babies, etc. I keep thinking about that. I think about [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3090.8s)]
*  that and I think of Radio Rwanda. Yeah, yeah, precisely. But they're still repeating it until [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3096.72s)]
*  today. Like you saw Chuck Schumer saying it recently and other similar atrocious allegations. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3101.28s)]
*  And basically repeating it over and over and over again to manufacture as much consent for [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3106.72s)]
*  genocide as possible, or at least to numb people. Like Israel's secret weapon is not to make the [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3111.04s)]
*  case for Israel. Israelis understand their propaganda today is self-defeating and garbage [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3116.32s)]
*  because they have gone too extreme and unhinged to even go through the motion of pretending to [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3121.2799999999997s)]
*  care for Palestinians. It's basically a career suicide. If you're an Israeli official or a [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3126.88s)]
*  journalist that says, ah, we want Palestinians to live, just to live, then you would lose your job. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3131.52s)]
*  Ilan Levin, Netanyahu's former spokesperson, he said something like, ah, Gazans should stay in Gaza, [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3137.6s)]
*  but we should cancel UNRWA because if they want to stay in Gaza so bad and they don't want to leave, [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3142.7999999999997s)]
*  then they're not refugees and blah, blah, blah. Then he got lynched online for it, for saying this. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3147.3599999999997s)]
*  And then he had to delete the tweet and apologize and be like, ah, I'm on board with the idea of [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3152.16s)]
*  depopulating Gaza. So they understand their propaganda is garbage now because of how extreme [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3156.24s)]
*  they've become. So they're not trying to make the case for Israel. Instead, they're trying to make [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3162.16s)]
*  it as complicated as possible. Israel's secret weapon is to say it's complicated. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3167.2799999999997s)]
*  I have a brilliant friend, Fadi Khorran, who once joined a Hillel chapter at a university in the US [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3171.44s)]
*  and claimed to be a Jewish Iraqi student. And they took him in and he said he attended a training [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3177.44s)]
*  at an Israeli consulate in the US where the Israeli official told him this. He said, [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3184.48s)]
*  about 10 to 20% on the campus are pro-Palestinian, about 10 to 20% are pro-Israeli. What do you do [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3189.52s)]
*  with that majority in the middle? And all the Hillel students were saying, ah, we try to win [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3195.52s)]
*  them over. We try to convince them. The Israeli official said, no, this is wrong. You don't try [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3200.0s)]
*  to do that. Just tell them it's complicated. Bore them out of this topic. You don't need to win them [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3204.16s)]
*  over. You just need to sort of neutralize them. And this, like, it's complicated. Israel is a magic [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3209.12s)]
*  weapon. And if it doesn't work, then he told them, go to the next level. Tell them, why are you [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3214.24s)]
*  obsessed with this topic out of all the conflicts in the world? That means you're an anti-Semite. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3219.4399999999996s)]
*  And I've seen this. It's complicated working in practice. Like, I have a European diplomat who told [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3223.7599999999998s)]
*  me she tried to educate her parents on Gaza. She was one of the people that protested in front of [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3230.24s)]
*  Ursula von der Leyen's office and signed a protest letter. She felt very strongly about the topic. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3235.68s)]
*  And she tried to educate her parents on what's happening. And she said they got very sort of [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3240.24s)]
*  touched and moved by the atrocities. And then a week into it, a week into listening to the TV [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3245.3599999999997s)]
*  and trying to read about it, they said, nah, honey, this is too much. This is mentally exhausting. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3250.56s)]
*  And they checked out. And that's what Israel tries to do. That's what the mainstream media [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3255.6s)]
*  tries to do. Yeah, exactly that. Brilliantly put. Very, very perceptive, as always. Mohammed, [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3259.8399999999997s)]
*  honestly, it's such an honor speaking to you. I mean, that really was, [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3266.4s)]
*  I don't know what the right word is, to be honest. I mean, it was just so incisive. So just every [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3270.88s)]
*  time I rely on your Twitter feed, anytime I hear from you, it always makes me think about things [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3277.36s)]
*  in a different way. And, you know, it's 20 months of genocide, which is an unimaginable amount of [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3281.28s)]
*  emotional labor for you to have to talk about this all the time and speak about all this at the time. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3288.8s)]
*  But you do it so brilliantly and eloquently. And you've educated so many people, people you'll [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3293.2s)]
*  never meet, who will use that education to fight one of the great crimes of our age. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3298.0s)]
*  So for everyone watching, please press like and leave comments, subscribe, because that means [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3304.48s)]
*  more people listen to the video, which is why we're talking. Share the video as well. But do [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3310.16s)]
*  leave, I'm sure the comments, as always, will just be full of praise for Mohammed's insights. We really [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3316.3199999999997s)]
*  are very lucky to have you. So thank you. Thank you so much. I always cherish our friendship. And [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3321.84s)]
*  it means a lot to talk to you. I admire your work. As I said, your moral consistency on this has been [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3327.04s)]
*  remarkable. I've seen most journalists just chickening out of it or deliberately trying to [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3332.88s)]
*  avoid it in order to advance their careers. You put your career on the line for this. It means a [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3337.92s)]
*  lot. Well, I'd never forget myself. And I have to say to those journalists who are still not speaking [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3342.96s)]
*  out or just hand waving, hand wringing and doing empty platitudes, there is, you can be scared of [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3347.04s)]
*  your career. I get that. You could be scared of being smeared and all the rest. But your government [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3352.96s)]
*  is complicit in genocide and is facilitating genocide. And history, we all know. We know how [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3359.36s)]
*  history remembers the people who stayed quiet in the face of unimaginable barbarism, because they [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3363.92s)]
*  were scared about their own positions. The more people that speak up, the more difficult [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3370.72s)]
*  it becomes to pick up on them. You're not going to fire the entire media class if more and more [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3377.04s)]
*  journalists come forward. No. And it's the silent. There's the cheerleaders of this who at this point [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3382.24s)]
*  are just depraved sociopaths. How do you reason with people like this at this point? But the people [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3387.2s)]
*  who every atrocity in history is always made possible by the silent. So something to remember [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3391.7599999999998s)]
*  if you're one of those people. But anyway, thanks for having me. Always a pleasure. Have a good day. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3397.92s)]
*  You as well. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzmfkSEZ_64&t=3405.44s)]
