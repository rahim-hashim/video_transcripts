# Biden Stands Down - History Will Damn Him
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [July 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biWOqF6CqLs)
*  You will have heard so many heartfelt tributes to President Joe Biden now that he has announced
*  that he's standing down as the Democratic Presidential nominee. He's declared that
*  it's in the best interest of my party or the country for me to stand down and focus solely
*  on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term. He said that he has
*  decided not to accept the nomination and to focus all his energies on his duties as the
*  President for the remainder of his term and to offer full support and endorsement for his Vice
*  President Kamala Harris to be the nominee of our party this year and he urges Democrats to come
*  together and beat Trump. Now Joe Biden is standing down because his mental faculties have very
*  visibly sharply declined and no one serious thinks he is able to continue functioning
*  as President of the United States of America. The truth is though that Joe Biden is a
*  monster. He's a man with the blood of tens of thousands of Palestinians on his hands
*  and that is how he should be remembered. Now I'll just read over some of the tributes
*  as an example of what we're dealing with. A courageous and selfless decision says former
*  Obama official John Favre. Having led us out of the worst public health and economic crises in
*  most of our lives, President Biden should be remembered as one of our great leaders says
*  former Secretary of State Robert Reich. Biden's legacy as a statesman who defended democracy rather
*  than himself is now cemented says one associate professor in global politics at University College
*  London. Well, pass the sick bad guys. None of these people mentioned Gaza. None mentioned the Palestinians
*  who've been slaughtered, maimed, starved, driven from their homes, their homes largely destroyed,
*  the healthcare system torn apart. I don't believe those lauding Joe Biden in these terms believe
*  Palestinians are human beings, not in a meaningful substantive way. If Biden had facilitated the mass
*  slaughter of those they did regard as human beings like themselves, then I don't believe for one
*  second that they would have responded like this. Now Joe Biden is standing down because the efforts
*  of both him and crucially his close advisors to cover up from the American people his true medical
*  condition collided with the eyes and ears of the American people and indeed everybody else.
*  Those around him should be regarded with contempt. We can all see his decline.
*  They work with him, close up, day in day out. Did they really believe he was capable of serving a full
*  four year term on top of the time he has due left to serve until the inauguration of the next president
*  of the United States in January 2025? Of course they didn't. Of course they didn't believe that.
*  They lied. They conspired against the American people. But I'm not myself in any way primarily
*  concerned with the mental decline of the US president. I don't know what ails him and if I'm
*  perfectly honest, it doesn't particularly interest me. What I am interested in is the role of this man,
*  President Joe Biden, in one of the worst atrocities of our age, Israel's depraved onslaught against
*  Gaza in particular and Palestinians in general, which has so far led to a case of genocide being
*  lodged against Israel in the International Court of Justice, which has issued multiple damning
*  judgments about Israel and the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor issuing requests
*  for arrest warrants for war crimes and crimes against humanity against Israel's leaders.
*  Biden has always been a man, it must be clear, with a zealous ideological commitment to the
*  state of Israel. Let's just listen to what he said in the 1980s.
*  We stop those of us who support, as most of us do, Israel in this body for apologizing for our
*  support for Israel. There is no apology to be made, none. It is the best $3 billion investment
*  we make. Were there not in Israel, the United States of America would have to invent an Israel
*  to protect her interest in the region. That's right, Joe Biden believed that
*  Israel existed primarily to serve the interests of US imperialism, not even subtle. In the aftermath
*  of 7th October, Joe Biden used the bully pulpit of the US presidency to spread Israeli lies which
*  were used to build a case for genocide. No one serious disputes that Hamas and other armed groups
*  were guilty of war crimes on 7th October for which there is no defence. What Biden did is
*  specifically spread lies about atrocities which did not happen. Let's listen to what Joe Biden said
*  on 11th October, four days after the 7th. I mean, I've been doing this a long time.
*  I never really thought that I would see and have confirmed pictures of terrorists beheading children.
*  I never thought I'd ever. Anyway. What he did there was lie. He never saw any such pictures
*  of children being beheaded. There were no such pictures of children being beheaded. They don't
*  exist. There's no evidence of any children being beheaded in the 7th October. According to Israel's
*  official statistics, 36 Israeli children were killed on 7th October, each of those an
*  inoffensible crime. One of them was a baby who was shot dead as Hamas fighters shot through the door
*  of a safe room where a family was sheltering. None of those children, none of them were beheaded and
*  there was no evidence presented to say otherwise. Indeed, it was widely circulated at the time that
*  40 Israeli babies had been beheaded by Hamas militants. Why do these lies matter when actual
*  atrocities were indeed committed on the 7th October? Very straightforward. The point was
*  to portray what happened as uniquely evil as violence so depraved and unhinged that whatever
*  possible misgivings you might have about the fate which was to befall and did before Gaza,
*  those misgivings would simply vanish. There was almost nothing you can come up with that is worse
*  than beheading children or indeed baking babies in ovens. Another lie that was spread or indeed
*  ripping the fetus with a knife from a pregnant woman. Another lie because Israel was always going
*  to slaughter far far far more innocent people. The point was to say Israel's violence is morally
*  superior. The violence committed by Palestinian hands is depraved beyond imagination and therefore
*  you should snuff away any empathy you have for Palestinians in Gaza. Indeed, each time atrocities
*  committed by Israel were highlighted, a stock response by Israeli spokespeople and indeed their
*  cheerleaders was to regurgitate the lie of Israeli children being beheaded. That was the entire point.
*  And indeed, this is also a key point. Why not just talk about the atrocities that did happen?
*  There are atrocities you could talk about. I'll tell you why. Why did they keep talking about
*  the atrocities that didn't happen rather than atrocities that did happen? Very straightforward.
*  Because you cannot argue the same moral distinction between the sorts of crimes Israel has committed
*  and those that actually happened on the 7th of October. The truth is that Israel has committed
*  far more atrocities and many of those atrocities are worse than most of the atrocities committed
*  on the 7th of October. The mass slaughter of children, 14,000 plus, including the deliberate
*  killing of children. For example, little Hind Rajab who was slaughtered alongside her family. She
*  begged for help with an ambulance sent to help her which was also blown up. It's paramedics
*  killed by the Israeli state. Multiple testimonies by doctors discussing the shooting in the head
*  of little kids, many of them pre-teens, shot in the head by snipers. That's the point, isn't it?
*  You can't talk, you can't focus on the atrocities that did happen because I've just come up with
*  atrocities that if they had been committed, those specific examples from the 7th of October
*  would be considered as amongst the worst atrocities committed that day. So they had to
*  come up with atrocities that were beyond imagination and they were lies and Joe Biden spread them.
*  And by spreading them, he built consent for a genocide law. Now, while inventing Hamas atrocities,
*  which didn't happen, Biden also engaged in atrocity denial on behalf of the Israeli state.
*  In late October, when many thousands of Palestinians had already been butchered far
*  more than the number of Israelis slaughtered on the 7th of October, not to understate the
*  horror of the latter but to emphasise the horror of the former, Biden publicly declared, and I quote,
*  I have no notion that the Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed.
*  I'm sure innocents have been killed and it's the price of waging a war.
*  What a despicable man. Notice here how he talked about his doubt in the Palestinians,
*  the Palestinians he talked about as a group of people, being untruthful about their numbers
*  being slaughtered and then simply dismisses away the numbers being killed as the price
*  of waging war. Well, that's not a price he would accept, would it, for American civilians.
*  Gaza's health ministry then responded by releasing the full list of, at the time,
*  the over 7,000 who'd been killed by late October, including over 3,000 children,
*  over 83 times the number of Israeli kids who'd been killed on the 7th of October at that point,
*  including not just their names and personal information but crucially their Israel-assigned
*  identification numbers because Israel remains in control of Gaza's civil registry, showing that
*  what Biden had done was baseless. But what Biden did was intentionally undermine global faith in
*  the death figures coming out of Gaza, helping to therefore diminish anger and protect Israel
*  from scrutiny, thus allowing it to get away with killing even more as they went on to do.
*  Atrocity denial kills, especially when it comes from the United States of America's president
*  who is arming and supporting one side. Indeed, this man gave Israel all the weapons it needed.
*  In the first two months after 7th October, Biden bypassed Congress to approve emergency weapon
*  sales to Israel. That included providing Israel with tank ammunition, mortar rounds and crucially
*  2,000-pound bombs. As even the New York Times, which has repeatedly echoed Israeli propaganda,
*  found in December, Israel repeatedly used these bombs to commit some of their worst atrocities
*  against Palestinians, repeatedly using them in areas that are designated as safe for civilians.
*  They did, in May, pause a shipment of 2,500-pound bombs, seven months into the horror after
*  which they'd been used to slaughter and maim thousands of Palestinians on the grounds they
*  could be used in an offensive against Ra'atha. But bear in mind that in January, Israel made
*  publicly the obvious that its onslaught was not possible with US weapons. They made it all possible.
*  Now Ra'atha claimed a major Israeli offensive against Ra'atha was his red line, but then Israel
*  began conducting it with deadly effect by an injunction that no such red line had been crossed.
*  In one example, in May, dozens of Palestinians in Ra'atha were butchered, many of them kids,
*  including burning them to death, and at least one child was beheaded in the attack. Yes,
*  an actual beheaded child. The weapons used? US produced weapons. Biden publicly has vowed
*  ironclad support for Israel. When asked about specific Israeli war crimes, the Biden administration
*  simply falls back on generic responses about asking Israel for further information and even
*  repeatedly expressing confidence in the ability of Israel to investigate itself in the face of
*  all precedent and evidence. Indeed, when confronted with evidence of Israeli war crimes, the US
*  repeatedly falls back on blaming Hamas instead. The Biden administration repeatedly echoes Israeli
*  attempts to lie, deflect, muddy the waters about atrocities committed by Israel. The Biden
*  administration has no response to the countless examples of genocidal intent made by Israeli
*  leaders and officials, many of them detailed over nine pages in South Africa's submission to the
*  ICJ, alleging genocide. It has taken no action against Israel's policy of starvation against
*  the Palestinian people, which formed the main basis of the ICC request for arrest warrants.
*  When US senators and house democrats demanded Biden comply with US laws and make US aid conditional
*  on Israel allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza, Biden refused. Instead, he set up this joke of
*  a floating pear which repeatedly fell apart, supposedly to get in aid, which delivered almost
*  no meaningful aid, and then was abandoned, probably ended up killing people because it was
*  used to distract people from Israel's policy of starvation. The US also dropped aid on Gaza,
*  which again provided a pinprick of what was needed, inefficiently targeted, and in some cases killed
*  Palestinians as it fell from the air. Gaza is in the grip of famine and Biden's prints are all over
*  it. Biden's administration spread Israeli claims about, for example, Al-Shifa hospital,
*  Gaza's main hospital, being a terrorist hub, which journalists such as those at the Washington
*  Post ended up tearing apart, lies used to almost entirely destroy every single hospital and medical
*  facility in Gaza, every single one bombed in attack, imposing a daily death sentence on
*  countless Palestinians. Biden officials have repeatedly privately briefed their disillusionment
*  and supposed anger in Netanyahu, which makes them total cowards, because they clearly only do this
*  because they know democratic voters are angry, understandably, and they think that will be enough
*  to satisfy them. Occasionally we've heard Biden's public hand-wringing over Israel,
*  but where little there has been is purely for domestic consumption and makes no meaningful
*  impact on Israel's conduct. The US has repeatedly used its veto on the UN Security Council to
*  protect Israel, such as vetoing demands for ceasefire or for Palestinian full membership
*  of the United Nations. When the ICC's chief prosecutor issued those arrest warrants for
*  war crimes and crimes against humanity against Benjamin Netanyahu and his defence minister
*  Yoav Galan, Biden condemned them, responding, I will always ensure that Israel has everything
*  it needs to defend itself against Hamas and all its enemies. Just this week, the Biden inspiration
*  condemned the International Court of Justice's overwhelming opinion that Israel's occupation of
*  Palestinian territories was illegal and indeed apartheid. And by the way, before you go, well,
*  any president of the US would do this. Don't hate the player, hate the game. I'm aware this is to
*  do with the US state. I'm aware this is a systemic problem, but individuals still have agency and they
*  must be held to account. When Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982, right wing Republican President
*  Ronald Reagan was disgusted and rang the then Prime Minister Mounahem Begin and said, Mounahem
*  Begin, this is a Holocaust. He demanded Begin stop the bombing and 20 minutes later, Begin rang back
*  and ordered the then defence minister Ariel Sharon to halt the attacks. In 2002, George Bush strongly
*  condemned Israel for killing Hamas's most wanted militant because 14 Gazans were killed in the same
*  strike. Joe Biden is a monster. He is someone with the blood of countless Palestinians on his hands.
*  He made this atrocity, one of the great atrocities of our age, possible. It is notable that polling
*  shows most Americans do not believe that Israel is committing genocide. More Americans than not,
*  including a large majority of those intending to vote for Joe Biden.
*  Even if it wasn't for his mental decline, Biden was always going to struggle in the presidential
*  elections because many natural Democratic voters were disgusted by this genocide and had no intention
*  of voting for him. Do not warn this guy. He's a monster. He's a moral disgrace. He deserves to be
*  condemned by history forever. Don't rehabilitate him. Don't give him an inch. And those blindly
*  celebrating him now simply underline the fact they don't believe Palestinians are humans.
*  But Palestinians are humans. The worth of their lives, no greater than the lives of me or you.
*  Palestinian lives matter. And there are those of us who will never stop believing that and never
*  stop holding to account the criminals who drowned Palestine in blood. Please like and subscribe. Do
