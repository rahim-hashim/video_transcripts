# Israel DESTROYING Gaza 'Ceasefire' - Lies of Israel's Cheerleaders Taken Apart
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc)
*  The so-called ceasefire in Gaza is on the brink of collapse, and the reason it's going [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=0.0s)]
*  to collapse is because of what I just said. This is a so-called ceasefire, because Israel [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=4.16s)]
*  has systematically violated the terms of that ceasefire. US President Donald Trump has declared [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  that if all Israeli hostages aren't released this Saturday, then quote unquote, all hell [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=14.92s)]
*  will break loose. It comes at the context of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  who is an international fugitive, sought by the International Criminal Court for war crimes [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=24.32s)]
*  and crimes against humanity, has made it clear, in the clearest possible terms, repeatedly, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=28.76s)]
*  that he wishes to resume his murderous onslaught against Gaza. It comes at the additional context [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=34.84s)]
*  of President Trump making it clear he did not believe the ceasefire would last, and [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=39.64s)]
*  repeatedly endorsing the illegal annexation of Gaza by the United States of America, and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=44.64s)]
*  the forcible permanent removal of its entire population, an act of ethnic cleansing which [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  would constitute a crime against humanity and be innately genocidal in method and outcome. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=56.32s)]
*  Let's discuss what's happened. Hamas has announced that it is delaying the release [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=61.16s)]
*  of Israeli hostages indefinitely because of alleged Israeli violations of the ceasefire, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=65.36s)]
*  and when I say alleged, they're real. We'll go on about that. That ceasefire is held for [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=69.6s)]
*  three weeks and was greeted with jubilation and exhilaration by a traumatised Palestinian [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=73.68s)]
*  population. We went into the first phase of that ceasefire deal, due to last 42 days, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=78.32s)]
*  the second phase in which the remaining Israeli hostages are released, as well as Palestinian [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=82.92s)]
*  detainees, many of them in practice, hostages seized without trial or charge by the Israeli [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=87.64s)]
*  state and subjected to hideous torture, rape, dozens of them, torture and rape to death, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=93.6s)]
*  all of that in exchange for a lasting ceasefire. The Israeli state has now cancelled leave [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=100.64s)]
*  for its soldiers and is preparing to renew its genocidal onslaught against the people [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=104.48s)]
*  Now as Mustafa Barghouti, the General Secretary of the centre-left Palestinian National Initiative [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=109.12s)]
*  puts it, the ceasefire has been violated in three ways by the Israeli army. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=113.72s)]
*  Number one, 25 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza and dozens wounded since the so-called [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=118.44s)]
*  ceasefire began. Does this sound like a ceasefire to you? Now call me old-trash-ent, sure, but [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=124.04s)]
*  my definition of ceasefire is when armed forces cease firing. Secondly, Barghouti notes that [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=129.52s)]
*  the Israeli army are obstructing humanitarian aid, including crucial supplies of tents [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=136.0s)]
*  and shelter, bearing in mind that most of the homes of the Palestinian people have been [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=140.64s)]
*  destroyed. That includes 8,500 of 12,000 aid trucks that were promised to enter Gaza. That [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=146.44s)]
*  includes 15 fuel trucks instead of 50 entering Gaza each day. None of the 60,000 promised [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=153.96s)]
*  temporary housing units have been delivered to Gaza and just 20,000 of the 200,000 promised [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=161.44s)]
*  tents have been delivered. Now according to Trey Yngst, and bear in mind he's the chief [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=166.0s)]
*  foreign correspondent of Fox News, one of the four key ceasefire issues right now is [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=169.64s)]
*  that of caravans, temporary homes for Palestinians in Gaza. An official with knowledge of the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=174.28s)]
*  talks tells me a number of countries and international organisations, including the United Nations [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=178.8s)]
*  of Qatar, have requested to send caravans to Gaza in accordance with the agreement. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  All the requests have so far been rejected without explanation, according to this official. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=188.2s)]
*  Israel must approve for the caravans to enter. Now number three, Barghouti notes Netanyahu [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=193.39999999999998s)]
*  and Trump have provoked Palestinians with repeated statements about their intentions [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=198.67999999999998s)]
*  to totally ethnically cleanse Gaza. Imagine all of this, just take a step back for one [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=203.6s)]
*  second. Imagine Hamas militants had killed multiple Israeli soldiers, let alone Israeli [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=209.28s)]
*  civilians. Nobody would be talking about a ceasefire, let alone a parallel universe [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=213.56s)]
*  where there was a serious proposal backed by the US to ethnically cleanse the whole [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=218.4s)]
*  of Israel. Imagine just one Israeli had been killed in Gaza or by Palestinian militants [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=221.4s)]
*  in Gaza. That would be, no one would be talking about a ceasefire. And this just underlines [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=230.0s)]
*  racist dehumanisation. It's not just Gaza, by the way, because Palestinians feel themselves [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=236.54s)]
*  strongly to be part of Palestine. The clue really is in the name. The West Bank and Gaza [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=242.18s)]
*  are both equally part of Palestine and in the West Bank, the Israeli state has been [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=245.86s)]
*  on the rampage. In January alone, Israel killed nearly 70 Palestinians with a 14% increase [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=249.9s)]
*  in violent incidents compared to the previous month. As the Israeli newspaper, Haaretz, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=255.38s)]
*  notes, the Israeli army have expanded the open fire orders in the West Bank, resulting [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=259.46000000000004s)]
*  in a high number of deaths of Palestinian civilians. Here's one example of one particular [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=263.52s)]
*  atrocity this month. Soldiers shot to death a man and his wife, a woman, in the eighth [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=268.14s)]
*  month of her pregnancy. According to the IDF preliminary investigation, the man was shot [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=274.9s)]
*  and killed inside his car without trying to breach the checkpoint or threaten the soldiers. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=280.02s)]
*  His pregnant wife, Sundas Shalabi, 23 years old, was able to get out of the car. She was [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=286.28s)]
*  shot three times in the chest. The Palestinian Health Ministry said rescue teams were able [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=292.62s)]
*  to save the life of the fetus. According to the investigation, the pregnant woman looked [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=297.5s)]
*  suspiciously at the ground. She was unarmed and no weapons were found near her that might [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=302.42s)]
*  have served as evidence she was trying to place an explosive device. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=307.66s)]
*  Looked suspiciously at the ground. This is the justification given for butchering a pregnant [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=315.22s)]
*  woman. It should be noted that the Israeli army prevented medical staff being able to [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=319.66s)]
*  get to the pregnant woman in order to save her life and that of her unborn fetus. Imagine [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=323.86s)]
*  for a moment this had been a pregnant Israeli woman shot and killed by Hamas militants. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=328.66s)]
*  Just imagine what would happen in those circumstances. It would be at the top of news bulletins. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=332.54s)]
*  It would be splashed across the front of newspapers. It would trigger howls of outrage from politicians. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=336.74s)]
*  It would be widely denounced as the total evil of Hamas. Not so here though, because [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=341.46000000000004s)]
*  Palestinian life is deemed to be completely worthless and the Israeli state has been granted [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=346.5s)]
*  total impunity. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=350.7s)]
*  Israel has launched Operation Iron Wall in the West Bank on the 21st of January, the [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=352.58s)]
*  longest operation there since the second Intifada, so far driving 40,000 Palestinians from their [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=357.26s)]
*  homes, an act of ethnic cleansing which has received almost zero attention from the Western [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=362.46s)]
*  media. And what planet are we even discussing a ceasefire here? And yet pro-Israel commentators [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=367.14s)]
*  are out there claiming it's Hamas rather than Israel which is destroying the ceasefire. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=371.46s)]
*  The level of gaslighting, of turning the world on its head, involved in absolving Israel [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=375.58s)]
*  of guilt for trashing the so-called ceasefire is simply astronomical. Now let's just hear [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=379.7s)]
*  Trump's latest intervention in support of his plan to forcibly deport, that is ethnically [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=384.42s)]
*  cleanse, the entire Palestinian population of Gaza. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=388.7s)]
*  Beautiful piece of land. No big money spent. No, they wouldn't because they're going to [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=409.7s)]
*  have much better housing, much better. In other words, I'm talking about building a [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=415.3s)]
*  permanent place for them because if they have to return now, it'll be years before you could [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=419.9s)]
*  ever, it's not habitable. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=425.06s)]
*  Well note here how he makes clear this will be permanent, that the survivors of Gaza will [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=426.78s)]
*  be driven from their homes forever with no right of return. Now he seeks to dress up [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=431.34s)]
*  this criminal act as a humanitarian gesture while he builds, he says, what he calls a [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=434.7s)]
*  beautiful real estate development, but not for the people who actually live there who [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=439.22s)]
*  will be deported. Note how he says Gaza is not habitable. So he is there admitting that [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=442.1s)]
*  Israel has made Gaza uninhabitable. Let me just read from Article 2 of the Genocide Convention, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=446.82000000000005s)]
*  which defines genocide, deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=452.1s)]
*  to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part. Trump here is admitting [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=456.78000000000003s)]
*  literally by definition that Israel has committed genocide in Gaza. It's very clear what's [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=462.74s)]
*  happening here. The so-called deal struck between Netanyahu and Trump was a sham in [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=467.78s)]
*  which Israel would get some hostages out and then regime its genocidal onslaught. Indeed, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=472.17999999999995s)]
*  the Israeli media a month ago reported that in the deal, if Netanyahu agreed to it, Trump [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=476.17999999999995s)]
*  would support Israel retroactively if it decided to return to fighting and violate the ceasefire. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=480.82s)]
*  As Rohan Talbot, the director of advocacy and campaigns at medical aid for Palestinians, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=485.94s)]
*  puts it, if the ceasefire is allowed to collapse, I really worry that Israel's violence will [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=490.53999999999996s)]
*  be even more wildly brutal and destructive than before. They would try to destroy the [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=494.94s)]
*  30% of infrastructure that has so far been spared and make human life impossible so Trump's [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=498.98s)]
*  plan can come true. Well, I am afraid he's correct. It is likely a resumption of Israel's [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=504.86s)]
*  onslaught with the active support of Trump will mean a dramatic escalation of the genocidal [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=509.46s)]
*  violence to even more obscene levels than we've currently seen. That genocidal mayhem will [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=513.62s)]
*  be calculated to empty Gaza through mass slaughter and expulsion. You may have studied genocides [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=517.5s)]
*  in the past and wondered how could they ever have been possible? How could they have been [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=522.46s)]
*  tolerated? How could they have been facilitated when they actually happened? Well, now you [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTZWM4o7Zc&t=526.14s)]
