# Israel Arrests RENOWNED Palestinian Feminist Academic Nadera Shalhoub-Kevorkian
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0hPgEdspIM)
*  This is so important. We know that Israel has unleashed a genocidal onslaught against the people
*  of Palestine. Now, there's another part of the story which we don't hear about enough.
*  A fifth of the population of Israel's pre-1967 borders, that is excluding the occupied territories,
*  are Palestinian citizens of Israel. And they're treated as third or fourth class citizens by a
*  state which makes clear that this is a state which exists for its Jewish citizens. And they face
*  rampant discrimination and they also face intimidation if they speak out for their rights
*  and the rights of the Palestinian people in general. Which brings me to the case of the
*  renowned Palestinian feminist academic Naderah Chalhoub Gaworkian, whose work focuses on state
*  violence, trauma, genocide. You can see why her work is so relevant right now. And her case
*  really exposes Israel's claim to the world that it is the Middle East's only democracy. Now,
*  those speaking out who are Jewish in Israel against the horrors in Gaza face being victimised. But
*  for its Palestinian citizens, it is so much worse. Now, she's been arrested for comments made in a
*  podcast and subjected to horrendous conditions. What she's been arrested for is absurd and false
*  incitement to terrorism, violence and racism. But a state which she should know allows its leaders,
*  politicians, generals, soldiers, army officers, media outlets, journalists, private citizens,
*  to engage in rampant and obscene genocidal incitement in violation of the 1948 Genocide
*  Convention, which Israel put on its statute books in 1950, actually made incitement to genocide
*  a capital offence, i.e. in theory having the death penalty. And indeed also defies the
*  provisional orders of the International Court of Justice, which ordered Israel to fulfil its
*  legal obligations and prosecute such people. But she, she's the sort of person that they're arresting
*  in Israel. Now, firstly, I'm going to play the comments she made in the podcast, which she's
*  been attacked. And then I have two brilliant guests who know her very well and her work,
*  who will explain what's going on, why this matters and what you can do.
*  Nadiya, I want to ask maybe a final question, which is on this report that came out on the
*  October 7th report that the UN just put out on the question of the rape and the sexual violence. Now,
*  I want to ask you as a Palestinian feminist who's there, there's a lot of, there's been a lot of,
*  you know, criticism of this report and the fact that it's still, as far as I know, still relies
*  almost entirely on Israeli official sources with almost no actual eyewitnesses. And yet, of course,
*  if one were to express this kind of thing, to say, even to just to say that on social media or
*  anything else, one is open to attack for being against women and against, you know, so how,
*  how do you read that? And how do you compare that to the absolute silence of all the other reports
*  and all the documented, rigorously documented reports on sexual violence, let alone violence,
*  sexual violence towards Palestinian men and women and girls and boys?
*  Well, you know, it's, it's very telling. The way I read it, I read it as shaming the state of Israel
*  because they're using women's bodies, women's sexuality and women's intimate life to play with
*  it in political terms. Now, if, if, rapes, abuses, sexual abuses, gang rapes, it always happened in
*  war times. It always happened. We know of my book on militarization and violence against women covers
*  this topic. And, and we know that the state of Israel, 1948, you know, there is a report,
*  for example, in Niren, exactly that specific place where October 7 started, there was a case of a
*  Bedouin woman, a Bedouin young girl that was not only, you know, there is documentation that I
*  managed to get from the, from the archive whereby Ben-Gurion learned about the case and the captain,
*  the military officer asked his, the soldiers, what do you want to do with the, with the Bedouin woman?
*  Do you want us to kill her or do you want us to rape her? And the answer was,
*  let Fokota, let Fokota to fuck her. That was, this is something that I've written about. And in my book
*  on un-childing, it opens up the chapter on, on, on the NACAP area. Abuses and sexual abuse happened,
*  and it shouldn't happen. And I will never approve it, not to, not to Israelis, nor to Palestinians,
*  and not in my name. The reports sometimes can get testimonies, some other times cannot get
*  testimonies. The issue is that is Israel allowing proper collection of evidence? Plus, you know,
*  personally, as a feminist, I do not, I don't go and interrogate the rape victims. If a woman said
*  she was raped, I will believe her. I do not need evidence and I don't want to go check facts,
*  to be honest. This is my opinion. The issue is that even that we don't have, we don't see
*  women coming out and saying what happened. So women's bodies are being used as political weapons.
*  If it happened not in my name, if it didn't happen, it's shame on the state to use women's
*  bodies and sexuality to promote political agendas, to promote further dispossession of land,
*  to promote further killing, to promote abuse and rape. And, you know, keep in mind that the
*  rape ability of the Palestinian based on the Zionist agenda is hard at work, hard at work in so
*  many ways. And I again have written about that. And the state crime that is sexualized and gender
*  right is there. So we need to, we need to number one, remember this is a very dishonest to come,
*  to say the state, they will use everything to further kill. It's a killing machine
*  and it's a necropolitical regime that can survive only on the erasure of Palestinians and only when
*  they will stop this and they will acknowledge what they're doing, we can start talking like,
*  but not to criminals. Criminals should be punished at this point. So I don't know what to tell you
*  else about, you know, when I look at the pictures, at the photos of soldiers today getting into
*  Palestinian homes, using the lingerie, playing with it, using you and laughing and putting it on tanks
*  and putting it on rifles. What is it? What is this if it's not sexual abuse? When you see the way
*  they're treating men, undressing them, keeping them with nothing, using that, what is it if it's not
*  sexual abuse? So using dogs exactly like what happened in Abu Ghraib, the body of the Palestinian,
*  the living body, the dead body, the cut to pieces body are all capital in the hands of this
*  Zionist entity. And of course they will use any lie. They started with babies, they continued with
*  rape, they will continue with million other lies every day with another story. We stop believing
*  them. I hope that the world will stop believing them. And if things like this happen, not in my
*  name, I will never approve it. Now with that context, I'm really delighted to be joined by
*  two brilliant guests at UCLA, which is obviously University of California Los Angeles, for those
*  who don't know. That's Shireen Razak, who is a distinguished professor in the Penny, Canna and
*  Dow chair in Women's Studies at the Department of Gender Studies at UCLA, who's at the encampment,
*  we know encampments in support of the sort of outing of the Palestinian people calling for
*  divestment by universities in Israel have sprung up across the United States and suffered a brutal
*  clampdown by the police, which we've been covering, as well as Saree Magdisi, Literature Critic
*  and English Literature Professor at UCLA. Hello to you both. I'm going to start with you, Shireen,
*  if that's okay. A very much sunnier looking place than where I'm, than poor old London.
*  And you're out that encampment. Can you just tell us a bit, I just gave a bit of context there,
*  but could you tell us more about Nadira? I can tell you about her scholarship and about her
*  personally, but let me start with her scholarship. What she is absolutely known for is scholarship
*  that crosses a number of fields. And that's very significant. It's, it's law, it's criminology,
*  it's social work, it's feminist studies. And her scholarship on feminist studies is particularly
*  salient right now because she has been for 25 years an analyst of sexual violence, of gender
*  violence, of colonial violence, and understanding how all of these things are related, which makes
*  her very important at this moment, but it also makes her a target for the Israeli state who is
*  wanting to advance that, that it is the only feminist voice ironically on these matters.
*  Saree, you wanted to say a bit as well about just her scholarship and how important her work is?
*  Her work is foundational for anybody who wants to have an understanding of, for example, the
*  surveillance mechanisms of the Israeli state, circumstances of occupation and discrimination
*  in the Israeli state. One of her most important projects is what she calls the un-childing of
*  Palestinian children at the hands of the Israeli state. That is this almost, not almost, literally
*  this stripping away of the childhood of Palestinian children. For example, children in the West Bank
*  can be arrested and put in jail without charge for months on end on what's called administrative
*  detention. Obviously, what we've been seeing for the past seven months in Gaza is that large scale
*  slaughter of Palestinian children and their abuse and so on. So, these, Nadira's concepts are
*  absolutely essential to a critical understanding of what the Israeli state does and how the Israeli
*  state operates and so forth. So, I mean, I could say much more than that, but just as a snapshot,
*  that's part of why her work is so indispensable. So, I mean, Israel often describes itself, as we
*  know, without just making people die of eye rolling as the world, sorry, the only democracy in the
*  Middle East. That's how it often likes to start itself. I'm just wondering, in terms of the basis,
*  the justification for what she's been subjected to, we've heard her lawyers spoken out about the
*  terrible conditions in which she's being held. Just either of you, I don't know who wants to kick off,
*  but in terms of what the basis, the justification for this and what this represents.
*  Who wants to go? Sorry?
*  Shireen, go ahead.
*  Oh, sorry.
*  Okay. Yes. Well, you know what? First of all, to say the basis for the justification,
*  nothing has to make sense here. This is a bit of a title of my book, but really it's the genuine point.
*  The justifications don't make any sense. So, it's hard to find the basis, but we do know that there
*  is, first of all, there's been this obsession with saying that Nadira Shalhoub Kavorkian
*  supports Hamas raping Israeli women. I mean, that's been one of the bases for it.
*  It has directly sort of invoked the idea that she is not a feminist. She does not accept
*  that Hamas raped women, et cetera, when in fact, she has quite clearly declared that this kind of
*  violence can never be in her name. So, that's one of the bases that I can make out. The other is
*  simply the allegation that she is not being truthful when she talks about the enormous
*  violence directed, for example, at Palestinian children and her very careful scholarship showing
*  that children are political capital for the Israeli state. Killing them is important.
*  These are messages that must be disavowed.
*  I mean, just on that, I mean, again, I just want to add just a bit more context for those who don't
*  know. I mean, she's in her 60s. She was strip searched, handcuffed, so tightly it caused pain,
*  denied access to food, water, medication for several hours, held in a cold cell,
*  and without, I'm just reading from the Guardian's report here, without adequate clothing or blankets
*  and as well as conditions in Israeli prisons have deteriorated. They're under the control
*  of one of the more even more extreme elements of a very extreme government who's relished making
*  those prison conditions worse. I think it's also important just to note in terms of that, because
*  we're talking about kids there, is Save the Children months before the 7th of October did
*  a detailed report about child detainees and reported that those children were subjected
*  not just to physical abuse but also to sexual abuse as well that has not received coverage
*  in almost any Western media outlet. And I just think that just shows the importance of her work
*  and what she's speaking about, but the evidential basis for it because the likes of Save the Children
*  obviously have spoken about that. I mean really, sorry, because she's spoken out about, she's
*  described this as genocide, hasn't she? And to use her platform to talk about genocide as far as the
*  Israeli authorities are concerned, that's really what this is really largely about, isn't it?
*  I mean it's certainly partly about that. Yeah, it's certainly partly about that, but of course
*  there are other people talking about the Israeli genocide in Gaza, including the International
*  Court of Justice in The Hague, innumerable legal scholars among whom her company can be counted. So
*  there's no doubt that that's what's going on and there's no doubt that that's part of what's going
*  on in the background here. But I mean as Shireen is saying, her work on children, specifically in
*  the instance of Gaza children, becomes absolutely pivotal here. And her work, there's her academic
*  work as I said, and her employer has been going after her since October because of what she's
*  been saying about the catastrophe that Israel is inflicting and imposing on Gaza. But the podcast
*  that I co-host with my brothers, the Makhtasi Street podcast, also came up when she was arrested
*  because of the suggestion that she denied what happened on October 7th and that she engaged
*  in incitement of violence also. And I mean the good thing about that is that the podcast that's out
*  there, our recording with her, is available for anybody to see, it's available anywhere. And you
*  can see it's one of the most powerful podcast episodes we produced precisely because Nadira
*  brings to bear her brilliant apparatus of scholarship and theoretical investigation and
*  of course cumulative knowledge onto the question of the treatment of children, Palestinian bodies,
*  Palestinian families and so forth in Gaza. So at least in that podcast episode in particular,
*  since I know it because I was there and I witnessed it. What I think is really striking is
*  we're seeing obviously, she's a Palestinian citizen of Israel, very distinguished, academic as you've
*  detailed, being prosecuted for incitement, rhetoric, all the rest of it. What we've seen in
*  Israel since 7th October is genocidal mania. I interviewed Raz Sigal, who I know you know,
*  the Israeli-American associate for the rest of genocide in Holocaust studies. He says intent is
*  so rarely overtly spoken as it has been in this particular case. The 1948 Genocide Convention
*  legally prohibits incitement to genocide. Israel actually put that in its own law as it was obliged
*  to do as a signatory. It actually in Israel carries the death penalty in theory incitement
*  to genocide. And the ITJ, the Intercultural Justice, in its provisional orders, ordered Israel to
*  prosecute those who incite genocide. They didn't do that, not one of them. So you see all media
*  figures, politicians, generals, soldiers engaging in rampant genocidal incitement,
*  whilst carrying out genocide, I would argue. And then you see a Palestinian citizen of Israel,
*  she gets prosecuted. What do you think that tells us? Well, it first of all tells us that
*  Israel does not obey international law, but it also tells us that there is a necessity to go after
*  the intellectuals and the academics, because you know, in fact, the incitement to genocide has
*  come from the very top levels of Israeli society. It has come from the prime minister, it has come
*  from the various ministers. So you know, you have to do something to deflect attention to
*  that. And I think this is what this does is, you know, draw attention to the intellectuals
*  and the academics. But it does seem to me to be a particularly sort of ill-advised move. What is
*  this clamped down on this very well regarded scholar and scholarship? Is that going to be
*  somehow in your interest? This is what I can't get over.
*  Sorry, what about your thoughts on that?
*  I mean, it is remarkable that not only have the Israelis refused to prosecute anybody
*  among their leaders from the president to the prime minister, all the way down to common foot
*  soldiers, not only have they refused to prosecute them for genocide, or even interrogate them or
*  stop them for incitement to genocide, they are continuing to engage in these acts of incitement.
*  So that a state that is engaged in what the International Court of Justice found plausibly
*  to be genocidal acts, and that as you just said, the court demanded that the Israelis suspend their
*  genocidal actions, and above all stop inciting further genocide, that this state is now turning
*  to a brilliant scholar and saying, she is the one who is inciting genocide. It is something,
*  to talk about Kafka or Jonathan Swift or somebody like that, that doesn't even do the justice to
*  the extent to which we have left, we have departed, we've left the terra firma of reality far behind,
*  and we're in this other sort of alternate universe in a way. And that's where this kind
*  of absurdity takes us. It's mind boggling. It is Kafkaesque, I think is a very good way
*  of putting it. Just finally then, what can people do? Because obviously, this is a huge injustice.
*  I mean, there's lots of horrific injustices taking place at the moment, but this is really
*  important. It's important people speak out and show their solidarity. In terms of people
*  listening to this, what's your suggestions? I think that they should, first of all, in the
*  specific case of Nazira, they should inform herself about her work. Go read her work. Go see what she's
*  saying. Listen to our podcast. Read her journals, articles. Read her other interventions in print.
*  They're all over the place. She's a major author and a major scholar. It's very easy to get a hold
*  of her work. And then beyond that, to inform themselves as to what the Israelis are doing in
*  Gaza. And above all, the nature of the Israeli state and the forms of racial discrimination
*  that it practices internally, of which this is one instance. And that's kind of the amazing thing.
*  The Israelis are giving the world an instance of the forms of racial discrimination that they
*  practice consistently. Their educational system is rife with forms of racial discrimination
*  against Palestinians, just to say from their standpoint, non-Jewish citizens of the state
*  that begins before kindergarten, goes all through the entire school system, which is, by the way,
*  split between Jewish and non-Jewish citizens. They have different educational systems entirely
*  that are segregated according to that foundation. And then on into the university system.
*  Palestinians are renowned in the Arab world as being among the most highly educated, along
*  with the Lebanese. The percentages of Palestinians with university degrees, with PhDs and so forth,
*  is far in excess of the normal kind of standard. And yet, if you look at the Israeli state,
*  of whom 20% of the population of the state within its pre-67 borders are Palestinian citizens,
*  you'll find that as you go up each rung of the Israeli academic system, the percentage of
*  Palestinian participation declines. Not because Palestinians are not educated, but because of the
*  forms of racial discrimination. And again, what's happening to Nadra is an expression directly of
*  that. And that's what we have to think about rather than the absurdity, as you're saying,
*  the Kafkaesque or Jidesque or whatever absurdity of these trumped up charges to which she's being
*  subjected. And just a final word to each of you. And also, if you could tell us as well about the
*  encampment, finally happens, because I know these wonderful encampments, people, both faculty and
*  students sitting out. But yeah, you'll find the thoughts on this. And then maybe on a final flush,
*  you could tell us about the encampment. Oh, sorry. Yeah, yeah, go for it. So,
*  Shireen, it's just to ask you about both about your thoughts just in terms of what people could do,
*  but also if you could just tell us a bit about the encampment. Okay. Well, first, I just want to say
*  that in reference to Sarie's point about why they're going after Nadra and what people could do is
*  inform themselves about her work. I want to think about the fact that after you've destroyed every
*  single university and every school, and you killed a number of educators, prominent educators,
*  and you killed more than 10,000 children. I wonder if we must connect what is happening to Nadra to
*  that, because this is in effect continuing to kill the education in one way or another, to silence,
*  to kill, to persecute, torment, harass Palestinian speakers, in fact, anyone who is speaking out
*  about this genocide. So we must connect it to the material reality of all this death and persecution
*  that has gone on. So I really want to emphasize that. And I could bring that right back to the
*  encampment. The encampment is made up of hundreds of students and tremendous faculty support who are
*  all finding it absolutely critical to speak out about this genocide and to do things that will
*  stop it, anything to stop it, to call for divestment, to do all of these things. That's
*  what this encampment is about. And I have to tell you, it is remarkably well organized.
*  The students are so terrific about this, so careful. It is a very peaceful encampment out here at UCLA.
*  Well, it's very heartening, I have to say. And I think this really has been a formative experience
*  for people in the global north, across the world. They're watching the obscenity of what
*  the Israeli state is unleashing against the Palestinian people, but they're also seeing the
*  brutality of the repression, the attempt to silence those who are speaking out. And
*  I think the intensity of it is because they're losing. They're losing quite badly, actually.
*  And I think you can see that they've lost hearts and minds in a really catastrophic way, is only
*  heading in one direction. And they can try and, in this case, lock people up. They can arrest people,
*  they can intimidate them, they can deplatform people, threaten their careers, all the rest.
*  But I think people have seen too much that they can't unsee. And I think the courage,
*  and we've just spoken about someone's incredible courage, that just inspires other people to speak
*  out. I don't think it's having the impact they hope. And I think that's the most important
*  lesson we draw from this, that we don't feel scared and frightened by these examples.
*  We use them to speak even louder. That's the least we can do. So thank you both very much to all of
*  you. If you're watching, obviously, do subscribe, press like, leave a comment, let us know your
*  thoughts. Do share this video, get the message out. Let's make sure everyone knows all about this.
*  And a very special thanks to both my guests. Thank you. Thank you.
