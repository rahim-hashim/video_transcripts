# Israel Isolated As UN Orders Ceasefire
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [March 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFyQbog2lyc)
*  Is Western complicity in Israel's Genocide War against Gaza, without which this entire
*  atrocity would have proved impossible, finally falling apart?
*  Yesterday, the United Nations Security Council voted for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.
*  It was motion-tabled by the 10 non-permanent members and voted for by all of them, plus
*  four of the permanent members. That includes Britain, as well as France, Russia and China.
*  Crucially, the United States, that is Israel's patron, which allows Israel to do what it wishes,
*  given it's the world's only superpower that matters, abstained. In other words,
*  it did not use its veto, as it has previously done, over and over again, to prevent this
*  resolution from passing. Alas, an amendment proposed by Russia calling for a permanency
*  ceasefire did not pass, not to give Russia credit here, given what it's doing to Ukraine and
*  what it did to, say, Chechnya many years ago. Its motives are certainly not pure, but driven by
*  crude strategic calculation that the US is further destroying its own global power
*  and the likes of Russia are looking to fill the vacuum, cultivating relationships across the Middle
*  East. But needs must, doesn't matter in this context, who's proposing the right thing,
*  whatever the reasons may be. Nonetheless, this resolution passing is an important step and was
*  hailed by Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian representative at the United Nations, as a
*  belated vote for humanity to prevail. It places demands on all parties to comply with their
*  obligations under international law, accordingly deplores all attacks on civilians and civilian
*  objects, as well as violence and hostilities against civilians and all acts of terrorism.
*  And also, it quite correctly restates that the taking of hostages is prohibited under international
*  law. Just on the point about terrorism, which has been conveniently increasingly defined over the
*  years as violence directed against civilians for political ends by non-state actors, that's very
*  convenient, of course, for states like Israel, who can use that this arbitrary definition to claim
*  their violence is legitimate and moral in contrast to their opponents, even though Israel clearly
*  uses state violence to achieve political ends. Just Google the Daha doctrine developed by Israel
*  in the 2006 Lebanon war, which centres on deploying huge violence against civilian targets to encourage
*  civilians to turn on, in that case, Hezbollah, in the case of Gaza, Hamas, without a state terrorism,
*  obviously. So I'm glad the resolution allows for potential consistency in how that word is defined.
*  The resolution rightly expresses deep concern about the catastrophic humanitarian situation in
*  Gaza. That's putting it mildly, since it has suffered Gaza, the worst collapse in nutritional
*  status of any population in recorded history, caused by a famine manufactured entirely by Israel,
*  alongside the mass destruction of its healthcare system, the mass displacement of virtually the
*  entire population, the devastation of its civilian infrastructure, the siege, and of course, on all
*  the essentials of life. Well, we really could go on, but there is a reason, lots of good reasons,
*  why we describe this as genocidal. What it demands is an immediate ceasefire for the month of
*  Ramadan, respected by all parties, leading, of course, to, as it says, an immediate and
*  unconditional release of all hostages, as well as ensuring humanitarian access and all parties
*  complying with obligations under international law in relation to all persons they detain.
*  Some important points there, obviously, all hostages taken by Hamas and other armed groups
*  must be released. It was and is a war crime to take hostages, as I say. That should also apply
*  to the huge numbers of Palestinians seized by Israel without charge, not least in the West Bank,
*  including children. The courageous Israeli journalist Gideon Levy, who I've interviewed,
*  rightly describes as Israel's own hostages, with overwhelming evidence about torture and arbitrary
*  killings of detainees, as well as sexual violence. Now, ensuring humanitarian access, it says, well,
*  that's what the International Court of Justice demanded as a provisional order for Israel to
*  avoid genocide, and Israel has wantonly flouted this demand from the deliberate obstruction of
*  humanitarian aid entering Gaza, as the UK government officially detailed via public letter
*  from the Foreign Secretary David Cameron to its war on UNRWA, Gaza's main humanitarian agency,
*  based on unevident smears. Now UNRWA, of course, has been banned from taking any aid into northern
*  Gaza just recently by Israel, and it's there where the most catastrophic situation, of course,
*  of anywhere in Gaza exists. Now, it emphasizes the resolution, the urgent need to expand the
*  flow of humanitarian assistance to and reinforce the protection of civilians in the entire Gaza
*  Strip. Well, bad news then there in terms of the siege imposed on Gaza by Israel and the mass
*  destruction of infrastructure and the collapse in security, those latter two factors making what
*  little aid enters rather hard to transport to those who need it, to say the least, hence civilians are
*  resorting to eating animal feed and grass as they slowly starve to death. Now, the resolution
*  reiterates the demand of the Security Council for the lifting of all barriers to the provision
*  of humanitarian assistance at scale. Well, all of this means, of course, engaging with why that's
*  not happening, which is the genocidal intent of the Israeli state, which is very transparently
*  driven by two things, which we can note because of the things they keep saying and have said all the
*  way through, intent and their actions, murderous vengeance against the population it regards as
*  collectively guilty and clearly less than human, as well as a desire for Gaza to be emptied of
*  Palestinians. Now, this resolution is clearly a step forward. On the one hand, it underlines
*  Israel's growing isolation, though worth pointing out Israel was already isolated in much of the
*  world. It's a rogue state, which has been protected with rampant criminality, violations of international
*  law because of the patronage of a superpower, which in this case didn't veto this particular
*  resolution, unlike its past behavior. Well, Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's Prime Minister,
*  was furious about this perceived betrayal from his patron, which he depends on for arms sales,
*  the vast amounts of aid and indeed diplomatic protection. So to use the vernacular I grew up
*  with in the North of England, he's had a right on MAD and canceled a visit to the White House.
*  Well, let's hear the White House National Security Communications Advisor, and that is John Kirby,
*  responding to a question about that. What is the President's reaction to the decision by Netanyahu
*  to not descend an Israeli delegation this weekend? I gotta tell you, Steve, we're kind of perplexed by this.
*  A couple of points that need to be stated and in fact restated. Number one, it's a non-binding
*  resolution, so there's no impact at all on Israel and Israel's ability to continue to go after Hamas.
*  Number two, as I said in my opening statement, it does not represent a change at all in our policy.
*  It's very consistent with everything that we've been saying we want to get done here,
*  and we get to decide what our policy is. The Prime Minister's Office seems to be indicating
*  through public statements that we somehow changed here. We haven't, and we get to decide what our
*  policy is. It seems like the Prime Minister's Office is choosing to create a perception of
*  daylight here when they don't need to do that. So again, no change in our policy.
*  Well, that's pretty cringe to say the least, as the US administration seeks to blunt the impact
*  of a resolution it abstained on, declaring it as non-binding, a non-binding resolution with no impact
*  on Israel's military strategy, with the calamity we've seen in terms of consequences. That doesn't
*  change the US position, trying to diminish the idea there's any meaningful difference with Israel
*  as it unleashes genocide of violence and famine. It's not legally binding, let's just fact check
*  that, because as research analyst Nax Bilal points out, the advisory opinion of the International
*  Court of Justice, the highest court on earth in the Nubia 1971 ruling under Article 25 of the UN
*  Charter, declares that such resolutions are, in fact, binding. The representatives of Mozambique
*  and Sierra Leone, both hailing from legal backgrounds, correctly declared the resolution to
*  be binding as well at the Security Council. That's been backed variously by, for example, Gerard Aro,
*  the former French ambassador to the US, the United Nations and Israel itself.
*  Let's listen to this Al Jazeera senior correspondent Imran Khan, who explains more.
*  Well, yes, this really, I'm afraid, sums up the farce of international law, where it exists in the
*  abstract, but in practical terms, how it's applied and enforced depending on who has power, and in
*  this case, that is the US, and they're the key allies of Israel, so they can just flower international
*  law rogue states indeed. Indeed, note that the US has said it will find ways to warn Israel against
*  attacking Ra'far, where much of Gaza's desperate population has been displaced, which means nothing
*  because the US is refusing to use the leverage that it actually has over Israel. The arguments
*  they're making are not simply about the loss of civilian life, but they say this type of invasion
*  would weaken Israel's security, would make Israel less safe, not more safe, it would undermine its
*  standing in the world. It's a bit late for that, guys. If I'm honest, the damage inflicted or the
*  reputation of the Israeli state globally is catastrophic and irreversible, barring some
*  total transformation, the nature of the entity which governs the Israeli and Palestinian
*  populations, the latter subjected to apartheid and in the present genocide. And indeed, a last
*  thing, just peace must protect the security of both, that is, none of them are going anywhere,
*  the land belongs to them both. Now, what's going on here? Well, this is significant. I don't think
*  we should water down that significance. Israel's in a much weaker position than it was quite clearly.
*  US power, which has already been in a steep decline in the 21st century, in significant part
*  due to the catastrophic foreign military adventures it has itself pursued, has been severely
*  damaged. The global south, epitomised, of course, by South Africa, hauling Israel before the
*  International Court of Justice for alleged genocide, has been strengthened and you can see
*  their moral authority strengthened, the global south and the diplomatic presence of muscle growing.
*  There are lots of factors behind all this. I think we need to pay special tribute to the
*  unbelievably courageous Palestinian journalists, many of whom have lost their lives, some of them
*  slaughtered, not just alone, but alongside their entire families, including with their little
*  children, in the biggest mass killing of journalists in any conflict ever recorded in history.
*  And they've brought to the world at such cost, at such sacrifice, the horrors inflicted by the
*  Israeli state, well, some of them, and they've ensured that despite the attempts by Israel to
*  corrupt this historic crime, the world has been able to see this atrocity for what it is, and that
*  has had a huge impact, as have the peace movements across the global north demanding this horror
*  ends. And indeed, Benjamin Netanyahu has himself been quoted privately fretting over the impact
*  of these demonstrations. It's all having an impact. All of that is contributing to what's clearly,
*  increasingly, a catastrophic strategic defeat for Israel and its patron.
*  But that's not something we need to rejoice at, given the utter horror and carnage and mass slaughter
*  of so many innocent people, so much horror and carnage and mass slaughter of so many innocent
*  people still to come. We need to be honest about that fact. But it is easy now to see a future in
*  which Israel cannot so violently deprive the Palestinian people of their basic rights,
*  because of their own murderous hubris. But the lesson here, we have to keep on pushing,
*  because this nightmare, and clearly I do not mean just the nightmare which began since 7th of October,
*  I mean the generations of nightmare that the Palestinian people have been forced to endure
*  can only end when western states which have allowed Israel to get away with it are forced
*  to make it all stop. So, I think we've got a lot of work to do there. Please like and subscribe.
