# Israel Faces Defeat: Palestinian Ex-Negotiator Diana Buttu Explains
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w)
*  Now, since this horror has begun, I've been really honored to be able to speak to just [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=0.0s)]
*  the most compelling possible voices. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=6.08s)]
*  And right at the top is Danabee Teev, who is a former member of the Palestinian negotiating [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=8.48s)]
*  team, lawyer, writer. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=14.4s)]
*  Also now we're both at Zetio, Medhi Hasan's new media project. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=16.740000000000002s)]
*  But just a brilliant commentator, so full of expertise, insight, knowledge. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  So Dan, it's an honor to speak to you, albeit always slightly depressing in these bleak [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=27.24s)]
*  times. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=33.48s)]
*  But we spoke, I think about four months ago, and a lot's happened since then. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=34.48s)]
*  So firstly, hello, by the way. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  Hope you're well. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=41.239999999999995s)]
*  I'm well, thank you, Owen. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  Thanks for having me on again. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  I should say, in fact, we'll talk about this, but Dan, I was in Haifa, which is a town in [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  Israel with a very large Palestinian population, Palestinian citizens of Israel. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=51.56s)]
*  But we'll talk about that in terms of the climate in Israeli society. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=56.52s)]
*  But first, I just want to ask you actually about the latest developments in terms of [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=58.84s)]
*  when I spoke to you earlier this year, you used the phrase, which I think struck me, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=62.08s)]
*  it was obviously very accurate, that you saw this as an Israeli-American attack. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=67.0s)]
*  And what's striking is all the way through, of course, the US has facilitated this genocidal [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=69.88s)]
*  onslaught every step of the way. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=75.4s)]
*  Arms, military, diplomatic support, hand-wringing occasionally, hand-wringing to media outlets [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=77.2s)]
*  as, you know, Biden's really lost his temper this time privately, as opposition in US society [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=84.19999999999999s)]
*  has grown. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=92.32s)]
*  But now President Biden's actually come out and said he's going to stop. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=93.32s)]
*  They've already delayed one lot of shipment of weapons. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=98.28s)]
*  And now they're talking about no more shipments of weapons if an onslaught against Ra'afah [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=103.0s)]
*  happens properly. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=107.32s)]
*  I just wonder what you thought about all that. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=109.67999999999999s)]
*  What's the significance of this, do you think? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=112.2s)]
*  You know, it's perplexing, Owen, because Israel has been attacking Ra'afah since day one. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=115.88s)]
*  And even when they took over Ra'afah the other day, they not only took over the border crossing, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=121.72s)]
*  but they went into very heavily populated centers with over 100,000 Palestinians then fleeing. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=127.64s)]
*  So it's not entirely clear to me where that red line is for him. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=134.76s)]
*  Am I happy that he's finally articulating a kind of red line, maybe a pink line? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=139.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=144.52s)]
*  But it needs to be much more than that. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=145.32000000000002s)]
*  And I think the US public and I think the Israeli public also know that all it really [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=148.04000000000002s)]
*  takes is one phone call for President Biden to make this stop. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=153.0s)]
*  And the reason that it only takes one phone call is because it's been the US who's been [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=157.24s)]
*  supplying the weaponry, they've been giving the diplomatic support, they've been making sure that [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=161.56s)]
*  other countries around the world are continuing their shipments to Israel. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=165.88s)]
*  They've done everything possible to carry out this war, which is why Palestinians call this [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=171.16s)]
*  the American-Israeli genocide of Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=177.79999999999998s)]
*  I mean, because it's such an important point you made about Ra'afah. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=183.56s)]
*  There's this Palestinian former journalist called Nahedah who we've been working on trying [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=187.96s)]
*  to get him out with his family, including the kids of his brother who was killed by the Israeli [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=192.2s)]
*  state. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=196.83999999999997s)]
*  And they've been forced to flee Ra'afah. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=197.56s)]
*  And originally they went to Khan Unis and they just said it's like the apocalypse. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=202.11999999999998s)]
*  He said it's like an end of the world film, an apocalyptic film. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=205.56s)]
*  I mean, just in terms of where you think now, you think this is seven months in. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=210.2s)]
*  I just think often people don't realize, for example, how small Gaza is. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=216.44s)]
*  Talking about a strip of land about the size of East London. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=219.32s)]
*  A state armed by the world's only remaining superpower has unleashed hell against, and I'm [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=223.4s)]
*  quoting there what an Israeli military figure promised at the very beginning. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=230.6s)]
*  You wanted hell, we'll give you hell, as one Israeli general said at the very beginning. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=234.2s)]
*  Where do you think things are at in terms of just strategically for Israel? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=238.51999999999998s)]
*  Because they haven't got many, obviously huge numbers of the hostages back, which [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=242.2s)]
*  are the only ones they got back was because of a prison release and ceasefire. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=247.0s)]
*  And Hamas has not been defeated. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=251.08s)]
*  Seven months in, I don't know. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=252.92000000000002s)]
*  I think that's not really, people haven't really discussed this enough. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=254.28s)]
*  What kind of strategic defeat Israel's suffering here? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=256.84000000000003s)]
*  It's suffering a catastrophic strategic defeat and they know it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=261.16s)]
*  And this is why, well, they've been genocidal from the beginning, but I don't think people [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=266.36s)]
*  truly understand just how more genocidal Israeli society is today. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=270.76s)]
*  For example, on a daily basis, you hear statements from politicians talking about [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=276.2s)]
*  flattening Gaza. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=282.36s)]
*  And it's not just politicians, it's members of the press, it's commentators, it's ordinary [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=283.64s)]
*  people in the streets. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=290.28s)]
*  You see bumper stickers everywhere. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=291.24s)]
*  There's a hat that's very popular here that says, make Gaza flat again. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=293.88s)]
*  And so all of this is happening because, as you put it, they haven't been able to [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=298.68s)]
*  meet any of the so-called goals that they wanted to meet. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=305.56s)]
*  Now we have to step back and ask about those so-called goals. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=309.0s)]
*  Israel said that they had three goals. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=312.36s)]
*  One was to release the Israelis. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=314.68s)]
*  The second one was to defeat Hamas. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=317.0s)]
*  And the third was to make sure that this is not possible again. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=319.0s)]
*  The problem is that they know that they can't achieve, they can't release Israelis without [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=323.24s)]
*  a ceasefire and they know it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=328.28000000000003s)]
*  And it's been clear after seven months. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=329.64s)]
*  And so all that they've been doing is destroying and destroying and destroying because I think [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=331.8s)]
*  that the ultimate goal for them is genocide. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=337.56s)]
*  And Netanyahu made this clear from day one and he keeps continuing with it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=340.76s)]
*  And their actions are speaking much larger than words. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=347.0s)]
*  I think that they were hoping to have a genocide coupled with a white flag, coupled with the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=350.52s)]
*  release of the Israelis. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=356.2s)]
*  And all they have been able, they haven't been able to get the Israelis back and they [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=357.56s)]
*  haven't been able to get that white flag. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=362.28000000000003s)]
*  So the one thing that they have been able to do is to destroy Gaza as much as possible. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=364.44s)]
*  When you say it's apocalyptic, I don't even think apocalyptic can describe what it's like [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=371.08s)]
*  today in Gaza. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=375.96s)]
*  The friends that I have there are describing conditions that I don't think any human should [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=377.8s)]
*  be living under. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=382.76s)]
*  And I don't think we should be playing up as somehow Palestinians are strong. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=383.88s)]
*  That's a form of dehumanization. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=387.64s)]
*  They're living without food, without water, without electricity, without water, without [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=389.64s)]
*  proper health care. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=396.28s)]
*  30 of the 36 hospitals have been bombed. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=397.96s)]
*  There are no schools left. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=400.84s)]
*  Every university has been destroyed. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=403.08s)]
*  80% of homes have been flattened. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=405.24s)]
*  And you're talking about an area that is 26 miles long by 12 miles wide at its widest [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=407.72s)]
*  point that already was the most densely populated place on earth. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=414.68s)]
*  Now in the south where people have fled to Rafa, it's approximately 1.7 million people [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=419.16s)]
*  that are in one third of that space that I just talked about. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=425.64000000000004s)]
*  So you can just imagine what the conditions are like for people there. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=428.6s)]
*  It's beyond apocalyptic. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=432.04s)]
*  There was such a crucial point you made there about an attack on Rafa has been ongoing [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=434.12s)]
*  since day one. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=439.08s)]
*  And if this was, if you just looked at Rafa in isolation, if that was just since this [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=440.76s)]
*  began, if this was somewhere else, people would regard this as ruinous in terms of just [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=446.12s)]
*  the devastation inflicted on Rafa. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=450.28s)]
*  The point is just relative to the rest of Gaza, it's been less severely destroyed. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=452.59999999999997s)]
*  And I guess I wonder is the point there in terms of, because they, you know, Khan Unis, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=459.32s)]
*  originally, and Khan Unis people, for those who don't know, it's in the southern part [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=464.68s)]
*  of Gaza. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=469.48s)]
*  Towards the beginning, there was this idea of the claims of the Israeli state flee south [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=470.68s)]
*  and you'll be safe there. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=474.6s)]
*  And that it will be spared the level of destruction of the north. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=477.0s)]
*  But actually Khan Unis, I think, has been more severely destroyed than even Gaza city [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=479.88s)]
*  has been destroyed. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=484.2s)]
*  I mean, if Rafa is destroyed, then they basically, the argument they could present is, well, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=485.32s)]
*  it's not a habitable place anymore, Gaza, and therefore its entire population will have [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=491.40000000000003s)]
*  to leave. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=497.8s)]
*  And if they don't, I mean, that's what they said at the beginning, General Gilra island, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=498.28000000000003s)]
*  starve or die. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=502.92s)]
*  That's done. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=503.88s)]
*  He's an advisor to, you know, gallons. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=504.28000000000003s)]
*  So do you think that's part of it? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=506.36s)]
*  You destroy Rafa, you then argue, well, there's nowhere for you to go anymore. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=507.40000000000003s)]
*  Yes, and that was the plan from the beginning, Owen. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=512.68s)]
*  So within the first week, you may recall that there was a former Israeli foreign minister, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=515.24s)]
*  Danny Danan, appeared on Mark Lamont Hill's show on Al Jazeera. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=522.1999999999999s)]
*  And he said, we should be pushing Palestinians from Gaza into the Sinai and creating tent [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=526.4399999999999s)]
*  cities with these tent cities then paid for by the Gulf states. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=532.92s)]
*  And nobody questioned him. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=537.3199999999999s)]
*  Nobody within mainstream media questioned other Israelis and said, is this the official [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=539.48s)]
*  policy of the Israeli state? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=545.4s)]
*  Yes, he's a former, but you can imagine if a former Palestinian minister of any sort [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=547.4s)]
*  issued any type of statement, they'd be going after the current government asking for [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=553.16s)]
*  clarification. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=556.9200000000001s)]
*  Well, nobody did when it came to Danny Danan. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=557.5600000000001s)]
*  And then sure enough, within a month or within actually two weeks, we ended up seeing a [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=559.8000000000001s)]
*  document that was going around a funding request to actually create these tent cities [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=565.16s)]
*  in Gaza in the event that people need to flee. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=574.04s)]
*  This was a document that came out in Congress from the White House. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=577.56s)]
*  And so the plan has been clear since the beginning. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=581.24s)]
*  And that's why what you now see is that if you think about life from the perspective [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=583.8s)]
*  of a Gazan, let's say that they want to go to university. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=589.64s)]
*  And let's assume that there's a ceasefire tomorrow, which I'm not sure there will be. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=593.64s)]
*  Assuming that there's one tomorrow, a person wants to go to university. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=597.08s)]
*  Where are they going to do it? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=600.04s)]
*  Outside of Gaza. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=601.24s)]
*  If they need to get health care, because many of them will need health care, where are they [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=602.52s)]
*  going to do it? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=606.4399999999999s)]
*  Outside of Gaza. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=607.0s)]
*  You want to get a job or practice your profession. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=608.1999999999999s)]
*  Where are you going to do it? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=610.76s)]
*  Outside of Gaza. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=612.04s)]
*  And so Israel's point from the very beginning was to flatten Gaza, to make it uninhabitable. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=613.16s)]
*  And this is why we've heard statements from Jared Kushner and others saying that there's [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=619.4s)]
*  practically nothing left. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=624.1999999999999s)]
*  The point is to make life miserable for Palestinians so that they either get killed off or they [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=625.8s)]
*  flee. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=632.4399999999999s)]
*  And one of the things that has been that, you know, when you have friends in Gaza who [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=632.84s)]
*  talk about what life is like, is they tell me, one friend who just left just two weeks ago said [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=638.4399999999999s)]
*  the thing that struck him the most after he left was that he didn't have the stench of [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=645.3199999999999s)]
*  death any longer. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=649.72s)]
*  That he wasn't smelling that 24 hours a day. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=651.0s)]
*  That's what Gaza has been turned into. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=653.96s)]
*  Israel has turned it into killing fields. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=655.72s)]
*  The Israeli-American professor Omar Bartov, I interviewed him many months ago, and he [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=658.28s)]
*  made, I guess, a very disturbing, chilling point about the dynamic between what we describe [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=665.72s)]
*  as ethnic cleansing and genocide and how ethnic cleansing becomes genocide because you try [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=672.36s)]
*  and force people out, but lots of people, they don't want to leave their homes and therefore [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=676.76s)]
*  you murder them and you subject them to conditions which, you know, we see with famine. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=679.48s)]
*  I mean, you know, they said from the beginning, you know, Gallon, the defense minister, were [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=684.2s)]
*  fighting human animals and we were cut off all the essentials of life. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=688.76s)]
*  And they have done, they stuck to their words. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=691.64s)]
*  I mean, do you think that's the point? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=693.4s)]
*  Basically, their point is we don't want Palestinians to be in Gaza. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=694.76s)]
*  How that is achieved. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=697.96s)]
*  You know, how many, we will kill a certain number and others will die because we have [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=700.44s)]
*  deprived them of the basis of life. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=704.84s)]
*  The end game is Gaza will no longer have Palestinians living there and that's what [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=709.32s)]
*  they're trying to achieve. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=712.6800000000001s)]
*  That's precisely it. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=714.2s)]
*  And Owen, you know, it's also important to keep in mind that the Israelis knew and were [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=715.48s)]
*  calculating exactly what the caloric intake was of Palestinians in the years of the blockade. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=720.12s)]
*  And so they know precisely the amounts that are needed, that are needed to sustain life. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=728.2s)]
*  And that's why they decided to cut everything off. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=735.96s)]
*  And even with the very little humanitarian aid that is trickling in, they know that it's [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=738.76s)]
*  not enough to sustain life. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=743.88s)]
*  And that's, again, that's the point is Israel's committing genocide. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=745.72s)]
*  And it's sad to say, but none of the world's powers as we know it are actually doing [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=749.72s)]
*  anything to stop it. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=754.6800000000001s)]
*  We do have other countries that are pushing ahead, such as South Africa and others that [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=756.2s)]
*  have been at the forefront of making sure that Israel is held to account and also to [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=760.5200000000001s)]
*  try to stop the genocide. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=766.44s)]
*  But the major superpower, which is the United States, has done nothing other than to become [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=767.72s)]
*  part of this and is not only funding and fueling this, but is providing diplomatic cover as [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=773.5600000000001s)]
*  well. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=779.48s)]
*  I mean, in terms of just that prospect, you said you doubt a deceased fire would happen. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=780.6800000000001s)]
*  And we saw Hamas say they'd accepted the outline presented by Egypt and immediately Israel [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=784.2s)]
*  pooh-poohed that. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=793.08s)]
*  They took the wrath of crossing, which is crucial for aid to get into, whatever limited [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=793.88s)]
*  aid gets into Gaza, not that you can distribute it. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=797.6400000000001s)]
*  They've destroyed roads. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=801.5600000000001s)]
*  They've made it as impossible as it can be to distribute aid. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=802.5200000000001s)]
*  But I mean, what do you think in terms of now that Joe Biden is under domestic pressure, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=808.2800000000001s)]
*  in fact, as a poll by Zetio found, the vast majority of a large majority of democratic [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=814.2800000000001s)]
*  voters think that genocide is being committed by Israel. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=818.6s)]
*  More Americans do not think genocide has been committed by Israel, which is quite astonishing [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=822.12s)]
*  if you think about where American public opinion used to be on the issue of Israel and how [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=825.8000000000001s)]
*  difficult it was to even be critical of Israel. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=829.1600000000001s)]
*  But because of that, he's under pressure because he faces Donald Trump in six months, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=832.0400000000001s)]
*  and there's a good chance a significant number of his voters will think, I just cannot bring [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=837.4000000000001s)]
*  myself to vote for a candidate who has facilitated genocide. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=840.92s)]
*  I have to live with myself. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=844.28s)]
*  That's just how people feel. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=845.16s)]
*  They'll get screamed at by Biden supporters who will just guilt-shit them into doing [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=846.52s)]
*  otherwise, but that's the reality. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=851.64s)]
*  So I just wonder, do you think now that that pressure, in terms of weapons, now they've [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=853.24s)]
*  got enough weapons to just flatten Ra'afah even if no shipments happen. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=860.12s)]
*  But what do you think? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=863.56s)]
*  Do you think there's any prospect or do you think Netanyahu will just plow ahead and [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=864.12s)]
*  Ra'afah will be ravaged? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=869.4000000000001s)]
*  I think he's going to plow ahead. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=871.8000000000001s)]
*  And the reason I think that is because I don't think that Joe Biden's statements have been [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=873.48s)]
*  strong enough. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=881.0s)]
*  And also, you have to position yourself in the shoes of Netanyahu. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=882.12s)]
*  He's a deeply unpopular prime minister. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=886.9200000000001s)]
*  He was deeply unpopular before the 7th of October. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=889.48s)]
*  And since, because of all of the corruption scandals that he was facing, you'll recall [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=893.8000000000001s)]
*  that there had been seven months of sustained weekly protests against him. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=898.28s)]
*  What's now happened is that Israelis are recognizing that there is no way that they [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=903.9599999999999s)]
*  are going to be able to release any of the Israelis without having some measure of a [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=913.0s)]
*  ceasefire. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=917.9599999999999s)]
*  And so he recognizes that his political life is on the line. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=918.92s)]
*  He's got his political life that's on the line, both from the right wing, who is saying [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=924.28s)]
*  that they should just be nuking Gaza. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=928.52s)]
*  Those are their words, not mine. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=930.1999999999999s)]
*  And he also has it from the political, I don't want to say left, because there really is no [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=932.28s)]
*  left wing in Israel, but the less fascist right wing, who is also saying that they need [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=939.16s)]
*  to, he needs to reach an agreement and he needs to have a ceasefire. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=945.9599999999999s)]
*  They're not saying ceasefire because they care about Palestinian lives. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=949.72s)]
*  They're just saying ceasefire because they do want to see the Israelis returned. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=952.36s)]
*  And so either way, for him, it doesn't really make sense to stop. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=956.76s)]
*  Instead, he's going to gamble and take the gamble that Israelis will somehow love him if the final [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=963.88s)]
*  phases of genocide are actually successful. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=971.0s)]
*  That's the gamble that he is taking right now. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=973.8000000000001s)]
*  And given the lack of US leadership on this issue, you can see why he's going to take [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=976.92s)]
*  that gamble. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=982.28s)]
*  I mean, that's what I'm wondering about in terms of endgame there, because as you know, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=982.8399999999999s)]
*  I mean, if we look at the polling of Jewish Israelis, and the reason I say that for [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=987.0799999999999s)]
*  everyone's benefit is because a fifth of the population of Palestinian citizens of [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=990.5999999999999s)]
*  Israel and their views are very different from them. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=993.88s)]
*  But the polling is bleak. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=996.12s)]
*  About 60% have opposed all humanitarian aid getting into Gaza, which is genocide by definition. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=998.68s)]
*  I think too little firepower has been used on Gaza, I think just enough has been used, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1004.68s)]
*  with about 2% saying too little, sorry, too much firepower has been used. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1012.84s)]
*  That's what we're talking about. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1016.52s)]
*  I think that context is important. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1017.64s)]
*  But nonetheless, now more say they prioritize rescuing those Israelis being held than [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1019.32s)]
*  an onslaught on Ra'far. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1025.88s)]
*  So I'm just wondering how that ends for him if he's seen as not being able to get those [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1027.24s)]
*  hostages back but continuing with that Ra'far offensive. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1031.96s)]
*  Is that not going to produce an ever greater backlash? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1035.48s)]
*  Or do you just think, well, if he basically just ended up with Gaza being permanently [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1038.28s)]
*  destroyed, then that will compensate for that with the Israeli society? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1043.08s)]
*  How does it work in the end? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1046.52s)]
*  That's a great question, Owen. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1048.1200000000001s)]
*  The problem with Israeli society is they aren't thinking beyond the immediate day to day of [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1049.48s)]
*  genocide. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1056.2s)]
*  I can share with you some conversations that I've had with people. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1057.72s)]
*  When I asked them, is 15,000 kids being killed by Israel acceptable and a shrug? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1060.92s)]
*  And then I think, okay, well, what about 20,000? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1067.72s)]
*  What about 25,000? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1070.2s)]
*  Is there a number that is going to be acceptable? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1071.8000000000002s)]
*  And it's just passed off as this is just par for the course. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1076.68s)]
*  This is the price, is what I'm told. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1080.52s)]
*  And so I don't think that Israelis have really thought it through. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1082.52s)]
*  The reason that they haven't thought it through is because, again, nobody has been [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1087.0800000000002s)]
*  forcing Netanyahu to articulate anything other than his vision for genocide. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1090.76s)]
*  So for Israelis, they've now resigned themselves to the fact that, oh, this is what the way it's [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1096.84s)]
*  going to be. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1101.8s)]
*  And that's terrifying. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1103.56s)]
*  As a Palestinian living in this society, it's terrifying to have as your neighbors, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1104.76s)]
*  people who look around and say, oh, 15,000 kids being killed is just the price. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1111.32s)]
*  40,000 dead is just a price. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1117.32s)]
*  Or 10,000 who are still stuck under rubble is just a price. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1119.8s)]
*  Or the flattening of the largest Palestinian city is just a price. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1124.28s)]
*  It's so genocidal that all that they're thinking about is just these small little things [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1127.8s)]
*  and not the bigger picture of what this is going to lead to. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1135.48s)]
*  There's no way that this, and I say this over and over again, there's no way that Israel [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1138.76s)]
*  is going to come out looking good in this. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1145.32s)]
*  There's no way that Israel is going to ever be victorious in this, ever. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1147.48s)]
*  Well, on that, because that's a very crucial point that I did want to discuss with you. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1150.84s)]
*  I was on Irish television yesterday with, I think, the only pro-Israel politician in Ireland. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1154.52s)]
*  I mean, for all these historic reasons, obviously Ireland was subjugated by the British and starved [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1161.56s)]
*  and suffered horrific atrocities. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1168.76s)]
*  Ireland has more than natural affinity, obviously, with the Palestinian cause than most European [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1171.4s)]
*  nations. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1175.88s)]
*  The polling is pretty clear in Britain and elsewhere, which is overwhelmingly opposed [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1177.0s)]
*  to Israel's genocide law and slaughter. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1181.3999999999999s)]
*  But it was just striking because he did the whole going about student placards, student slogans, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1184.36s)]
*  which I just find the most desperate attempt to turn the world upside down, given the rhetoric [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1188.76s)]
*  of Israeli politicians. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1193.96s)]
*  And just on that, because sometimes I see these clips from Israeli television, which are [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1194.92s)]
*  translated as a brilliant Israeli Jewish peace activist who's anonymous. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1198.44s)]
*  He's called I Really Hate You Act on Twitter. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1204.12s)]
*  And he often, but he's absolutely brilliant, just translates all these. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1206.6s)]
*  And you watch it, it's just because I remember all the kind of liberal hand-wringing about, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1210.12s)]
*  quite understandably about Russian television clips saying terrible things about Ukraine. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1215.0s)]
*  But you'll see clips where people say, let's kill all the kids because I grew up to be [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1219.0s)]
*  terrorists. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1222.84s)]
*  I just wonder, is that what we're kind of, that's where we're at with a lot of Israel. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1224.36s)]
*  It's such a level of dehumanization. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1228.12s)]
*  Can you mention about the kind of shrugging off of children, children who are being slaughtered [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1229.8799999999999s)]
*  and maimed, but they don't, they just, they look at them all and they just see would be [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1235.6399999999999s)]
*  monsters, don't they? [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1241.3999999999999s)]
*  They don't see them as children, as far as I can tell, a lot of ordinary citizens with [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1242.12s)]
*  great courageous exceptions. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1246.44s)]
*  Yes, with few exceptions. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1248.9199999999998s)]
*  A lot of it, Owen, is, I can refer to some of the television broadcasts that you see. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1251.8s)]
*  At the beginning, they used to put the numbers of Palestinians who were killed. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1258.12s)]
*  This was in the early days when it was still possible to get numbers. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1263.1599999999999s)]
*  I'm sure you know this, but today we don't actually have an accurate count of the number [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1266.92s)]
*  of Palestinians who've been killed because the hospital system has collapsed and there's [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1271.3999999999999s)]
*  no real way to know. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1275.6399999999999s)]
*  Plus there's so many who are still trapped under the rubble, very sadly. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1277.3999999999999s)]
*  And so in the early days, within probably about the first month of this genocide, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1281.72s)]
*  the Israelis were posting numbers of Palestinians killed and the way that they posted it, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1287.0s)]
*  it was number of terrorists killed. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1293.32s)]
*  And that so-called terrorist included babies, included babies that were two and three days [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1295.9599999999998s)]
*  old, that included, you name it. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1301.32s)]
*  And so there's just been the only way that you can sustain a colonial project in the [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1303.1599999999999s)]
*  way that Israel has sustained it is through a very deep dehumanization process. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1309.3999999999999s)]
*  And that's why you've seen everything from the dehumanization of Palestinian children, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1314.84s)]
*  the dehumanization of everything Palestinian. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1320.68s)]
*  That's why you see that it's considered acceptable to torture Palestinians. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1325.32s)]
*  And I'm sure you've seen the videos of particularly men from Gaza who are forced to crawl on all [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1329.24s)]
*  fours naked, bark, swear at Hamas, and do all sorts of things, as well as people who've [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1336.12s)]
*  been shackled to the point where circulation gets cut off and they need to have limbs amputated. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1343.48s)]
*  That only comes as the result of years of dehumanization. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1350.44s)]
*  And that's what Israel has been doing to Palestinians since before 1948, since before the Nakba. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1355.0s)]
*  Will Barron But before I just [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1360.76s)]
*  talk to you about what you just mentioned before about why actually Israel, because I keep saying [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1363.08s)]
*  Israel is going to lose this. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1366.84s)]
*  That's been the theme of many of the videos have been over the last few [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1368.68s)]
*  weeks. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1372.12s)]
*  I just want to talk to you, just ask you about it, because I mentioned that in passing, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1373.8799999999999s)]
*  Palestinian citizens of Israel about a fifth of the population. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1378.12s)]
*  I did a video where I interviewed a couple of colleagues, associates, Professor Nadira [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1381.1599999999999s)]
*  Shalhoub Gaworkian, a feminist Palestinian legal scholar who was arrested by Israeli [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1388.04s)]
*  state. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1392.92s)]
*  The reason I'm just asking is, you know, the polling has always been clear. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1393.3999999999999s)]
*  Obviously, the Palestinian citizens of Israel have a very different view, but there's a [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1396.52s)]
*  climate fear about speaking out. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1399.0s)]
*  I'm just wondering, I wonder, you know, some Palestinian citizens of Israel have relatives [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1401.72s)]
*  in Gaza and the West Bank where there's a reign of terror. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1408.92s)]
*  I'm just wondering what's happening at the moment? [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1411.16s)]
*  Is there just a sense of kind of being cowed, fearing, speaking out? [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1414.3600000000001s)]
*  Is there any kind of potential political expression, or is it just too much fear for [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1418.52s)]
*  that to, you know, for something to be galvanized there? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1423.24s)]
*  I'll thank you for that question, Owen. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1426.04s)]
*  It's very important. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1430.12s)]
*  I'll describe what it's like to live here. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1432.92s)]
*  Now, I always say I wasn't born here. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1434.84s)]
*  I wasn't raised here. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1438.6s)]
*  So it's always a little bit awkward for me to speak on behalf of a community that I was [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1439.6399999999999s)]
*  not born into. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1444.84s)]
*  I wasn't raised. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1445.56s)]
*  But I have lived here for quite some time, and I hope that gives me a little bit of [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1446.68s)]
*  experience to be able to talk about what life is like here. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1452.68s)]
*  To be a Palestinian who holds Israeli citizenship means that you are the descendants of people [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1457.5600000000002s)]
*  who survived the 1948 Nakba. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1465.48s)]
*  And the 1948 Nakba, yes, it was 76 years ago and less televised as we see happening today, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1468.8400000000001s)]
*  but also very brutal with the ethnic cleansing of three quarters of a million Palestinians, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1478.12s)]
*  that's 75% of the population, the destruction of over 500 villages and towns, including my [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1485.32s)]
*  father's village and town. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1494.04s)]
*  And then having to live amongst the very people who destroyed your city, who destroyed your town, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1496.92s)]
*  who destroyed your community, who have killed your relatives, who's thrown your relatives [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1503.08s)]
*  into exile, and you had to live amongst these people. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1507.88s)]
*  And so my father was one of the survivors of the Nakba. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1511.3200000000002s)]
*  And so this community ended up rebuilding itself from scratch. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1517.0s)]
*  It succeeded despite Israel, not because of Israel. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1521.48s)]
*  But because they've succeeded, they've also learned to have these coping mechanisms of how [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1525.24s)]
*  to deal with being in a system where all around you it's people who want to get rid of you, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1531.16s)]
*  who make it clear that the only reason that you're still around is because they didn't [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1536.12s)]
*  quote unquote finish the job in 1948. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1540.04s)]
*  So immediately in the aftermath of October the 7th, what we saw happening was that there was a [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1543.32s)]
*  massive crackdown against Palestinians in Israel. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1550.4399999999998s)]
*  And the crackdown was, and this part's important, the crackdown was for social media posts. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1553.7199999999998s)]
*  It was for liking a picture. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1560.84s)]
*  It was for putting an emoji up. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1564.04s)]
*  It was for saying something as benign as there is no victor but God. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1566.2s)]
*  That's what Delana Abu Amni, a neuroscientist and singer, wrote. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1571.0s)]
*  And what happened was that the people who snitched on you were the very people who have worked with [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1575.1599999999999s)]
*  you. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1582.12s)]
*  They're your colleagues. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1582.28s)]
*  If you're a student, they were people in your study group. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1584.6s)]
*  They may have been your neighbors. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1587.3999999999999s)]
*  And so what they did was they were your neighbors, your study group, your colleagues were taking [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1589.32s)]
*  screenshots and then sending it to the police with hundreds of people being arrested for [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1594.76s)]
*  supporting terror or in some cases inciting or in some cases they ended up being disciplined [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1601.0s)]
*  from university. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1607.72s)]
*  For a simple thing, one of them was a man sitting on rubble with a little emoji of a broken heart. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1609.24s)]
*  So for Palestinians, you're absolutely right. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1616.68s)]
*  Many of us have family in Gaza. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1618.92s)]
*  Many of us have family in the West Bank. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1620.6000000000001s)]
*  Many of us have family in both places. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1622.28s)]
*  And you're not allowed to say anything for fear of being arrested, for fear of losing your job, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1624.76s)]
*  for fear of being kicked out of university or even worse than that. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1631.48s)]
*  One man was held in prison for 122 days just for trying to organize a protest. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1637.96s)]
*  Nadra, whom you interviewed, was also arrested for saying what I'm saying, which is that this is [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1644.3600000000001s)]
*  genocide and with colleagues going after you and you name it. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1650.3600000000001s)]
*  But it doesn't just stop there. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1656.28s)]
*  Even people like Dalal Abou Amn, the singer who just wrote, there is no victor but God, since her [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1658.8400000000001s)]
*  release from prison, since the end of October, so we're now talking six months, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1665.0800000000002s)]
*  each and every day there are protesters in front of her house calling for her and her husband, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1672.68s)]
*  who's a deputy director at a hospital, to be expelled from the city. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1678.8400000000001s)]
*  They call on her to be killed. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1682.76s)]
*  They call on her to be raped. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1684.6000000000001s)]
*  They've put up pictures of her all over the city between crosshairs. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1686.2s)]
*  They've renamed her street the IDF Street. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1691.16s)]
*  The mayor has participated in all of these protests and in fact ran his entire campaign [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1693.96s)]
*  on having her expelled from the city. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1699.96s)]
*  So this is what it's like. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1702.36s)]
*  This is not just a climate of fear, but it's a climate in which you feel that you are next [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1704.2s)]
*  because they make you feel as though you are next and they've told you that the only reason [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1710.12s)]
*  that you're still here is because they didn't finish the job in 1948. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1715.24s)]
*  So it leaves you to question, is now the time that they're going to finish the job? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1718.9199999999998s)]
*  That makes sense, Grim, brilliantly put. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1723.96s)]
*  The final thing I want to talk to you about, Gaza, as we've discussed, has been devastated [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1729.3999999999999s)]
*  beyond the imagination of the vast majority of people. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1736.76s)]
*  Even when we spend time, I think, looking at footage, nothing could prepare people based [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1740.6s)]
*  on those I speak to who've been there for what you actually see and witness with all your senses. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1746.4399999999998s)]
*  Mass devastation, one of the great slaughters of our time, through violent deaths, but also [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1753.32s)]
*  destruction of the healthcare system, famine, the basis of life, all those conditions made [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1760.2s)]
*  impossible for people. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1766.28s)]
*  The West Bank, a murderous reign of terror. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1767.72s)]
*  All the while, the US has bankrolled, militarily supported, offered diplomatic support. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1769.96s)]
*  Why are we so convinced Israel has lost? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1777.8s)]
*  Because that's what I've been saying. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1781.72s)]
*  But I want to hear from you. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1782.76s)]
*  Why people might look at that and think, they're going to get away with it. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1784.28s)]
*  This is a catastrophe beyond our imagination or the imagination of most people alive. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1788.68s)]
*  But they've got the superpower, the last superpower on Earth, on their side. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1795.72s)]
*  They've got away with this. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1799.96s)]
*  Why have they lost? [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1802.44s)]
*  Because Israel was banking on the fact that it could continue to do the low grade slaughter [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1803.5600000000002s)]
*  of Palestinians for an indefinite period of time. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1811.8000000000002s)]
*  And that it could continue to get international support and be lauded somehow as a democracy [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1815.88s)]
*  rather than the racist, fascist, apartheid state that it actually is. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1822.0400000000002s)]
*  And now that is gone. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1825.8000000000002s)]
*  That is gone. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1829.0s)]
*  And what do I mean by that? [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1830.0400000000002s)]
*  And what do I mean by that? [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1831.48s)]
*  For Israelis here talk about how this feels existential for them. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1833.08s)]
*  And I have to say it is existential. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1839.08s)]
*  You know why? [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1840.76s)]
*  Because what's at stake now is this idea of being a racist, fascist, apartheid regime [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1841.64s)]
*  that is allowed to conduct its actions with impunity. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1850.44s)]
*  I think that part is no longer going to be there any longer. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1854.28s)]
*  I think what we're seeing now is a complete awakening by the world of what Israel is [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1858.52s)]
*  actually about and what its goals have always been since before 1948 and what its goals are now. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1865.24s)]
*  So rather than it having this veneer of democracy, rather than having this veneer [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1873.08s)]
*  of being a normal state, that veneer has now been completely and totally removed. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1878.6s)]
*  And you see everything from students on campuses in the United States, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1885.64s)]
*  and not just in the United States, actually around the world, who are demanding that their [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1890.8400000000001s)]
*  universities no longer invest in genocide. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1895.4s)]
*  We see that protests are all around the world demanding boycotts, divestment sanctions. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1899.3200000000002s)]
*  We hear countries talking about arms embargoes. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1906.1200000000001s)]
*  We hear this idea that of even settlers now being sanctioned. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1909.96s)]
*  Wow. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1915.64s)]
*  Things that we would have never even heard about just a few years ago. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1917.0s)]
*  Remember a few years ago, we were on the brink of all states within the Arab world, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1921.32s)]
*  or most states in the Arab world normalizing relations with Israel and ignoring Palestinians. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1927.88s)]
*  That's not going to happen any longer. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1933.8s)]
*  This idea of win for them, they wanted to be able to get rid of Palestinians and have the [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1936.76s)]
*  veneer of being an acceptable, democratic, loved state. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1942.68s)]
*  And they can't do that any longer. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1947.96s)]
*  One final point, Owen, is when I look at the protests that are happening in the United States, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1951.24s)]
*  people are often comparing them to the anti-war protests of 1968. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1957.56s)]
*  Neither you nor I were around during that era. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1962.76s)]
*  But one thing that was different during those protests was that those were protests that were [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1966.36s)]
*  involving US troops and a US war. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1972.36s)]
*  This time around, this isn't about US troops. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1978.52s)]
*  This is about what kind of society it is that we want to be living in. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1982.6s)]
*  And what do we want us as a society to be representing? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1987.24s)]
*  And is Israel representing those ideals and those values that we believe in? [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1991.24s)]
*  And that's why I firmly believe that when you have people around the world who are talking about this, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=1997.24s)]
*  not just about their immediate, but about the bigger pictures, not just about their soldiers, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=2004.04s)]
*  but about the bigger picture, there is no way that Israel is going to win. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=2008.68s)]
*  I'm just finding on that. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=2012.44s)]
*  I think I've just written a column for you comparing with Vietnam war protests in the way [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=2014.04s)]
*  they've often been misrepresented. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=2018.1200000000001s)]
*  Actually, most college students in 1967 wanted escalation, let alone and opposed de-escalation. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=2020.04s)]
*  So the protesters were isolated even amongst their own cohort. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=2026.28s)]
*  There's a very different context now. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=2029.3999999999999s)]
*  But it strikes me that I've often described in the last few months Israel as a genocidal [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=2030.68s)]
*  hothouse where it just kind of radically has an internal dynamic. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=2035.72s)]
*  It just spins out of control. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=2038.28s)]
*  And a kind of strategic response by Israel would be to look at what's happening. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=2040.68s)]
*  They'd look at, particularly in the US, their main patron supplies the weapons, diplomatic support. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=2044.52s)]
*  And they think, look, we're massively repelling these people. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=2050.2799999999997s)]
*  Particularly, there's a young generation of younger Jewish Americans who are leading these protests. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=2053.72s)]
*  Panic, panic, panic. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=2057.64s)]
*  We need to do something. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=2058.52s)]
*  They actually go the other way. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=2059.72s)]
*  It makes them more defensive. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=2060.84s)]
*  It makes them almost kind of like punch harder. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=2061.88s)]
*  But that's something's got to give, hasn't it? [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=2064.92s)]
*  Because it's going to boil over. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=2066.44s)]
*  And the gap between them and where Western public opinion is, there's just a divorce. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=2070.68s)]
*  And then who's going to pop them up? [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=2076.12s)]
*  I don't think that anybody wants to be investing in societies that view themselves as being superior. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=2079.32s)]
*  And that's what Israel is. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=2085.08s)]
*  It's a society that's based on this notion of Jewish supremacy and the ability to do no wrong. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=2086.2s)]
*  And people look around and they say genocide is not acceptable, not in any context. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=2092.6s)]

*  Brilliant input. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=2102.84s)]
*  I think an extremely convincing case for why Israel has already lost. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=2105.0s)]
*  It doesn't realize it's lost, but it has clearly lost. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=2108.52s)]
*  Notwithstanding the catastrophic consequences which will continue for the Palestinian people. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=2111.56s)]
*  But I think Dana has just again proven why such an incredible, invaluable voice, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=2115.8s)]
*  which we're so lucky to have. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lguCweg-B3w&t=2122.6s)]
