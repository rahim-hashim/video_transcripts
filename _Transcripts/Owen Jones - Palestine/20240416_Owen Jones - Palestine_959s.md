# Jewish German ARRESTED Over Gaza Speaks Out - w/. Udi Raz
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY)
*  This weekend in Berlin, the Palestine Congress, which brought together a whole range of activists, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=0.0s)]
*  Palestinians, thinkers, doctors, as well as Jewish activists, public intellectuals, the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=6.24s)]
*  Palestine Congress was shut down by Berlin police. Over 2,000, in fact, police officers [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  were involved in shutting it down. There were arrests, as well as the likes of Yanis Varoufakis [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=19.44s)]
*  being banned from entering Germany and engaging in any political activity whatsoever, whilst [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=27.08s)]
*  German politicians denounced the Congress as somehow being a hotbed of various described [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=32.96s)]
*  as Islamist activity and anti-Semitism. Now, one of those who was arrested was Udi Raz, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=40.44s)]
*  who joins me now. He's a board member of Jewish Voice for Just Peace, at least, and also in [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=48.4s)]
*  the Berlin Graduate School studying Muslim cultures and society. That's relevant, we'll [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=56.2s)]
*  discuss now. Firstly, Udi, it's a great honor to have you. Hello. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  Hello, Elwin. Thank you so much for having me here today. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=63.92s)]
*  So, before I just start, I'm just going to show a clip, if you don't mind reliving this again, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  of you being arrested by the Berlin police. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=72.88s)]
*  So, Udi, can you just explain what the hell happened there from your perspective, in terms [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=86.2s)]
*  of the Congress, it being shut down, and then you being arrested? Can you just explain what [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=99.04s)]
*  happened? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=103.28s)]
*  So, I think the footage speaks for itself. What we have been witnessing on Friday in [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=104.28s)]
*  the last six months, as the German government show its commitment to an ongoing genocide [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=111.52s)]
*  in Gaza, in Palestine, but in the context of Germany, we saw how the German government [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=126.52s)]
*  is committed again and again and again to the violation of Germany's Basic Law. What [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=133.72s)]
*  we saw in the footage was the aftermath of what happened before, where one of the police [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=141.72s)]
*  persons who basically made us stop the Palestinian Congress, he stood to the front and he was [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=148.52s)]
*  pointing at me, at my keeper that you see over here, and he was laughing with his other police [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=159.88s)]
*  colleagues. After a moment, I came to confront him with his action, and I said that he is [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  an anti-Semite. At this moment, he decided that this was an assault. I am not allowed [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=176.0s)]
*  to decide. Me, a Jewish person, me, a self-identifying Jew, I am not allowed to decide for myself [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=183.52s)]
*  what I perceive as anti-Semitic. It is the Aryan police person who decided for me not [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=190.4s)]
*  only that what I experienced is not legitimate, but also what he said, that the way that I [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=197.24s)]
*  understand or perceive reality as such is a very insult to his job. At this moment, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=203.8s)]
*  he decided to arrest me. I was detained for about two hours. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=212.12s)]
*  Wow. Wow. That really is some context. After the police officer was laughing at you visibly [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=216.12s)]
*  as you were there, wearing your kippah, and then you suggested that as anti-Semitism, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=224.92000000000002s)]
*  they then arrested you. And then in the aftermath, it was then suggested that the arrests were [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=228.6s)]
*  linked to the Congress itself being anti-Semitic when you as a Jewish activist were taken away [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=234.56s)]
*  by the Berlin police because you suggested that anti-Semitism would play on their behalf. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=239.12s)]
*  Oh, and this is exactly why it's so ridiculous. Since months, we hear that what we are doing [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=244.12s)]
*  for calling for democracy, for calling for human rights, for calling for the implementation [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=250.68s)]
*  of law for everyone who lives between the river to the sea. Every time we do so, those [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=256.88s)]
*  who are in power pointed us and accused us to be a danger to Germany, but also for Jews [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=263.8s)]
*  themselves completely disregarding the fact that we speak from our own experience as Jewish [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=272.72s)]
*  individuals, as a group indeed of Jews who came together as Jews in order to promote [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=280.88s)]
*  an idea that Germany told us that actually it's something that we should celebrate. We're [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=289.0s)]
*  talking about democracy, human rights and international law. What is wrong with that? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=295.12s)]
*  How did we end up in such a situation that Germany accuses those who call for a ceasefire [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=300.24s)]
*  as the problem of the nation and of Jews? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=307.96000000000004s)]
*  Watching, I have to say, watching German police arresting Kippa-wearing Jewish activists, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=313.0s)]
*  I found it disturbing. I'll just be honest about it. What's even more disturbing is [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=321.44s)]
*  earlier this year, research by Emily Disch-Becker found that a third of those in Germany who [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=328.0s)]
*  have been arrested or deplatformed over Gaza and accused of anti-Semitism are Jewish. What [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=335.56s)]
*  the hell is going on there? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=342.15999999999997s)]
*  Exactly what I'm asking myself as well. You see, this fact that you mentioned, a third [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=344.12s)]
*  of all those who were cancelled are Jewish. This is, I cannot even count at the moment, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=350.8s)]
*  but it's like way, it's hundreds of percentage more than our actual presence within the [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=356.36s)]
*  demographic sphere that constitutes the population of Germany. We are less than 1% of Germany's [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=364.59999999999997s)]
*  population. We as Jewish people. So the fact that Jews are among the most vulnerable groups [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=371.52s)]
*  who is now being attacked by those who are in power is quite telling that what Germany [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=379.2s)]
*  is interested in is not the protection of Jews as such. What Germany is interested in [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=386.2s)]
*  is only the protection of those Jews who are willing to reproduce and what Germany [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=394.04s)]
*  is understand as its own national project, which is rooted in anti-Muslim racism. Jews [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=401.64000000000004s)]
*  who do not perceive Muslims as their essentially enemies are marked as a problem for Germany [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=408.76000000000005s)]
*  and for Jewishness. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=416.36s)]
*  If I put just the position of the German state to you so you can respond. I mean, so the [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=417.64s)]
*  official position goes like this. Within living memory, the German state did attempt the total [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=424.15999999999997s)]
*  extermination of the Jewish people and succeeded in a very short period of time in murdering [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=430.24s)]
*  two thirds of the Jewish population. So their position is Germany's founding basis has [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=435.52s)]
*  to defend Israel because of that past. What do you say in terms of the way that Germany [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=443.32s)]
*  has interpreted the German state's official position, the undoubted obscene unparalleled [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=450.76s)]
*  crime of the Shoah in terms of how it's being interpreted and enforced as regards to what's [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=456.52s)]
*  happening in Gaza and what's happening in German society? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=461.44s)]
*  Look, there is nothing wrong with the attempt to come to terms with Germany's own genocidal [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=464.44s)]
*  past. On the contrary, there is something beautiful and essentially important to honestly [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=470.6s)]
*  try to understand what could be a lesson that we all could benefit out of the atrocities [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=477.0s)]
*  that has been committed among others. Again, my own grandparents who survived the Holocaust [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=483.72s)]
*  here in Europe. The only problem is that Germany wishes to come to terms with its own genocidal [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=490.92s)]
*  past by supporting another genocide. We do not, when I say we, I'm talking about Jewish [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=498.92s)]
*  people in general, Jewishness does not imply that we want to commit a genocide. On the [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=506.2s)]
*  contrary, if genocide is also our history, then it's also up to us to try to make the [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=515.24s)]
*  world better. But the fact that we are not even given the possibility to imagine a reality [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=524.12s)]
*  where Jews are not involved in the committing of an ongoing genocide is something that Germany [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=531.88s)]
*  does not allow us. And this is exactly the reason why the Palestinian Congress was not [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=538.28s)]
*  allowed to take place in Berlin this weekend. In the Palestinian Congress, we wanted to, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=543.44s)]
*  among other things, to come together Jews, Palestinians, but also Aryans and other people [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=551.2s)]
*  who constitute the population of Europe. We wanted to come together to envision how can [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=557.6400000000001s)]
*  we imagine a future that is based on shared future, that is based on shared values, that [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=564.0s)]
*  is based on democracy, where everybody who lives between the river to the sea have the [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=573.1600000000001s)]
*  same access to the democratic decision making, not only for Jews, not only for Palestinians, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=578.7199999999999s)]
*  but really for everybody. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=586.4399999999999s)]
*  When the federal minister of the interior, Nancy Facer, says it is good the Berlin police [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=590.64s)]
*  have announced a crackdown on the so-called Palestine Congress in Berlin, we are keeping [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=596.2399999999999s)]
*  a very close eye on the Islamist scene. What's your response to that? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=600.0799999999999s)]
*  We have been marked with different names by now, Islamists, anti-Semites, Israel haters. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=605.84s)]
*  To my understanding, those who call us these names for opposing an ongoing genocide, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=612.5600000000001s)]
*  those are a genocide lovers. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=621.04s)]
*  I had a German Iranian citizen get in touch with me. He is a gay man who fled Iran as a refugee [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=626.0s)]
*  and works in a shop in Germany. He says because he supports a ceasefire, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=634.24s)]
*  non-Jewish Germans have racially targeted and abused him, called him an Islamist, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=641.76s)]
*  told him to f off back to his shithole country and tried to force a shop he works in to put up [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=648.48s)]
*  the Israeli flag on its doors. I'm just interested in what you said there, because it strikes me [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=656.64s)]
*  that what's happening here, partly as you suggested, is an excuse and a rationale [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=662.56s)]
*  for legitimising racism against what is now the biggest minority in Germany, those of Muslim [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=670.64s)]
*  heritage to the extent where you get gay refugees from Iran being targeted. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=678.2399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, this reality is truly heartbreaking. We only now, in the last few months, we start to realise [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=684.2399999999999s)]
*  the dimensions and the resolution of the gaslighting that we have been subjected to, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=691.9200000000001s)]
*  we as a minoritised group of all spectrums, by those who are in power since generations, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=697.44s)]
*  since decades, we were told that Germany is a democracy, that Germany upholds the legacy [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=706.8000000000001s)]
*  of pluralism. So where is it now? How come that we are not allowed to participate in the democracy [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=715.6s)]
*  that Germany promised to us by the virtue of being human beings who live on the territorial [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=725.12s)]
*  geography of Germany? What we are witnessing nowadays is that Germany is a democracy for [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=734.72s)]
*  Aryans only, controlled by Aryan supremacists. Germany became a dangerous place for all [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=744.0s)]
*  non-Aryans who live nowadays in Germany. And I want to explicitly give an advice to my Jewish [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=752.88s)]
*  sisters and brothers and siblings who watch this. If you ever consider to come to Berlin, to Germany, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=760.56s)]
*  please reconsider your decision. This place is going down. What we are witnessing here is [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=768.0s)]
*  Nazi Germany 2024. Just finally, that was my final question really, which is, this is happening under [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=774.8800000000001s)]
*  a nominally centre-left dominated government between, they've got social democratic prime [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=784.0s)]
*  minister in coalition with the Greens, but also of course with the centre-right free democrats. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=789.2s)]
*  But nonetheless, this is a country in which the far right, the AFD, are on the march and on the [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=794.0s)]
*  rise. I mean, I guess the worry I look at this is, if this is happening under a centre-leftish, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=799.12s)]
*  supposedly by officially anyway, government, where is Germany going to head in terms of what's [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=806.08s)]
*  happening with the right who really are obviously defined by racist, but also in the case of the [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=811.36s)]
*  AFD clearly have Nazi sympathisers in them? This is a very important question because we [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=816.32s)]
*  must keep an eye on the political development that also shows us what kind of future awaits for us [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=822.72s)]
*  right behind the corner. Let me remind you that according to Paul's, most of the German population [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=830.64s)]
*  nowadays who live in Germany do not find the politics promoted by the German government [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=836.64s)]
*  as something positive. On the contrary, most of the population in Germany opposes the policies [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=844.08s)]
*  promoted by Germany's government. So there is still a chance here and this is a wake-up call [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=850.64s)]
*  to all Aryans, to everybody who watches this video and lives nowadays in Germany, go on the streets. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=857.52s)]
*  We are holding the spaces, we are holding the demonstrations, we are holding now a camp 24-7 [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=865.6s)]
*  in front of the Bundestag. Join us. Our fight is your fight because the alternative is the [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=873.76s)]
*  alternative for Germany and this is nothing that any one of us can survive. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=881.28s)]
*  Very powerful, scary words, I'll be honest. It's terrifying what we're [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=889.76s)]
*  I think all witnessing here and the way things could head, but we also do see the incredible [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=893.76s)]
*  courage and resolve of people like yourself, which I think should give us all a huge amount [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=898.32s)]
*  of strength. I think this will be seen as a very dark period, obviously, of German history. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=904.88s)]
*  Everyone looks at McCarthyism now and McCarthyism is used as a pejorative term, but then again, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=908.48s)]
*  the sorts of people who condemn McCarthyism, exactly the sorts of people who would have been [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=912.88s)]
*  part of it at the time. And so it goes for this horror show in which we see the targeting of [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=916.5600000000001s)]
*  disproportionately Jewish Germans as well as the rampant racism against the biggest minority in [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=923.76s)]
*  the country, those of Muslim heritage as well as complicity in a genocide and massive authoritarianism [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=928.88s)]
*  clamped down on basic freedoms. And that apparently is compensating for Germany's past. Absolutely [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=933.92s)]
*  astonishing. Please do everyone watching share this, get the message out, make sure Udi's [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86CZatA7CsY&t=940.08s)]
