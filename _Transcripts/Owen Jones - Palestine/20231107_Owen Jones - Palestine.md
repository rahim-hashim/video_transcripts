Video Description: They've done everything they can to cancel the protest - and so far, it's backfired. The Met can't find an excuse to ban it. But this tawdry episode tells us so much - and it is not good.

# Braverman HUMILIATED Gaza Protest Is On
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [November 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHZwli7i4zU)
*  Well, it looks as though they failed. This is a total humiliation for, amongst others,
*  Suheila Bravaman and various right-wing media outlets and commentators.
*  There has been a deliberate and hysterical campaign to ban the protest this Saturday
*  against Israel's massacre of thousands of innocent people.
*  And that campaign has, for now, backfired badly.
*  Despite all the bullying, the stamping of feet, the hysteria, the lies, the incitement,
*  the Metropolitan Police, according to The Guardian, doesn't believe it has grounds to support a ban on the protest.
*  Sources say that the legal threshold needed, which requires intelligence pointing to a risk of serious disruption,
*  has not yet been met, though I'm sure the pressure will continue to be piled on them
*  to somehow make that threshold be met.
*  Now, the government has been trying to force them to ban this protest.
*  Suheila Bravaman has led the charge, denouncing the planned demo as a hate march.
*  A hate march. Coming from Suheila Bravaman, the most notorious hate preacher in the country,
*  the absolute poison of blight on, I don't know, humanity as a whole,
*  who does speeches claiming immigration is a threat to Western civilisation itself,
*  dog whistles about the number of kids born to front-born mothers,
*  refers to refugees arriving here as an invasion of our southeast coast,
*  as though they're an army with weapons, spends her time denouncing her critics in the most vicious caricature way possible.
*  Now, this has all been accompanied by a relentless campaign by the right-wing media.
*  Some of those who talk about threats to free speech, cancel culture, the left are dangerous authoritarians.
*  They're the ones leading the charge, trying to ban a mass peaceful protest because they don't like it.
*  It's all based on lies. Every protest since this horror has begun has been overwhelmingly peaceful.
*  At the demonstration the Saturday before last, with up to half a million people, there were around 10 arrests.
*  That's a lower arrest rate than the average football match, despite the fact,
*  as I saw it was crawling with police officers who are under political pressure to go around arresting people,
*  not that the Metropolitan Police, if we're honest, need pressure when it comes to, let's just say, protests they find unsavoury.
*  It was multicultural, diverse, Jewish protesters were there prominently and marched alongside them with placards for them showing it.
*  It was in practice, you know, this practice, in practice is claimed that this protest is intimidating towards Jewish people and therefore has to be banned.
*  Jewish people who are marching against this massacre.
*  This is itself a truly an offensive attempt to lump Jewish people in with the Israeli government.
*  And it means banning however many thousands of Jewish protesters intend to march.
*  So banning Jewish people themselves from taking part in a protest.
*  It was basically a family day out.
*  It's nothing like the protesters portrayed in the fevered imagination of these people.
*  Not that I think they believe it, I think they're just lying.
*  Parents with their kids from all over the country united on one basic point, wherever our different backgrounds or beliefs and a whole range of things,
*  that the innocent, that the slaughter, the slaughter of innocent people has to stop, including thousands and thousands of children.
*  Now, those who support the massacre continuing, which I'll come on to, spend their time scouring social media to find any evidence they can of this.
*  Extremists. Now, a crowd of that size, half a million, you're always going to get some idiots.
*  I mean, in central London, if you've got half a million people on a normal Saturday milling around, you're going to get some idiots.
*  If that is grounds to ban a demonstration, you would have to ban every single large demonstration from ever taking place.
*  Because what if a few people in half a million people, what, are idiots, which is, I would say, a dead cert, then that's the end of that.
*  No protests of that size ever again.
*  Now, we're told Armistice Day is a sacred day when a protest cannot take place. When did that come in? When did that one come in?
*  Now, on that day, I remember, I will remember my great uncle Francis Ayelet, the youngest of seven boys who died at the age of 17 on the Somme in World War I.
*  Their great granddad who died while serving in the Royal Navy in World War II.
*  My great uncle, he got a military medal. My grandfather, who was in the merchant navy, the second most dangerous service after the RAF.
*  In World War II, his boat was sunk by the Nazis twice. He was rescued once after living 10 days on an open boat.
*  I'll also remember all those killed in wars and those who suffer in wars, whoever they are, including wars happening right now with the complicity of our own government, which is what this is really all about.
*  The idea it's offensive to march on Armistice Day is one of the most absurd, insulting ideas I've ever heard in my entire life.
*  The two minute silence is at 11 a.m. The march starts at 12.45 p.m.
*  The march is nowhere near the Cenotaph, which is the focus. It's just been conjured up.
*  The idea of the Cenotaph would be endangered. Absolute gibberish when there aren't even any events happening until Sunday anyway.
*  It starts at Hyde Park, about two miles away from the Cenotaph and ends at the UN Embassy, which is even further away.
*  And when did all this whole Armistice Day is so sacred that nothing can take place come in?
*  Do we close the pubs and clubs on Armistice Day? Do we close the shops and the high streets?
*  Do we stop the football matches, which will have packed terraces?
*  They will almost certainly have more violent incidents at any of those than there will be a march for peace.
*  Let's be honest about this. On the one hand, those who support Israel's murderous onslaught, which has killed over 10,000 people, nearly half of whom are children, know they're morally exposed.
*  They know that actually most Brits, whatever their political persuasion, don't actually take normally kindly to knowing little toddlers are having their heads ripped off.
*  Sorry to be lurid in how we speak about it, but I think people need to be aware of what the consequences of this horror show actually is.
*  They know Gaza has been reduced to hell on Earth, a humanitarian catastrophe caused by Israeli offences, which enjoys the active support of our government through weapons and diplomatic cover.
*  And they know the polling shows that around 3% of opposed to an immediate ceasefire, the same percentage as think the Earth is flat.
*  Having lost the argument, they're trying to turn the world upside down, that the real dangerous extremists, the real threats, the real haters are the ones who support peace and oppose the slaughter of thousands of innocent people.
*  And the real moderates are the ones who support what the UN aid agencies and lawyers have made clear are serious crimes against humanity.
*  This is also all dripping with racism.
*  Several commentators haven't even tried to hide it.
*  This is about the fact that many Muslims take part in these protests, unsurprisingly, because it's largely fellow Muslims being slaughtered in large numbers.
*  And they're trying to portray British Muslims as violent, dangerous extremists who are un-British.
*  They're even talking about having them deported for disrespecting the British way of life.
*  The truth is that ordinary citizens opposed to actual extremism, massive war crimes against the civilian population.
*  The other element is racism specifically against Palestinians, stripped of their humanity as they have been by our politicians and media.
*  Any attempt to sympathize with ordinary Palestinians in a time of catastrophe has to be stigmatized, made somehow sinister, evil, itself indicative of murderous intent.
*  It's all a hateful lie.
*  Neither will we be stigmatized, and we must fight back against this, for opposing decades of illegal occupation, colonization, the land grabs with the illegal settlements,
*  and what Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the Israeli human rights organization, Betsalem, call apartheid.
*  Now, I must say they are playing with fire because they are whipping up far-right extremists who increasingly think they have permission to regard those who support the Palestinian cause,
*  who oppose the slaughter of innocent Palestinians by the Israeli state with Western support, that we're fair game.
*  That's what's happening here. If they don't realize they're doing this, these commentators and politicians, then they are thick.
*  Because it's obvious that's what's happening when they're denouncing hate marchers and extremists and a bunch of dangerous racists because they don't like watching mass murder.
*  They are giving permission to those sorts of elements.
*  And I note, for example, that when Just Stop Oil, in this fevered moment, were peacefully protesting, as is their right,
*  and Yvette Cooper, the shadow Home Secretary and a Tory MP, suggested that they had targeted the Cenotaph and congratulated the police for taking action against them.
*  That was a lie. That didn't happen. In fact, the only reason they ended up anywhere near the Cenotaph is because the police dragged them there.
*  So Yvette Cooper deleted a tweet with no apology. In this fevered atmosphere, that is helping to incite people.
*  It is dangerous. We're not out in the woods. The cynical campaign will continue. It has nothing to do with Armistice Day.
*  They're looking for an excuse. That's actually what's disrespectful.
*  They're using Armistice Day as a prop in their vicious vendetta against those of us who support peace.
*  They know they're losing the battle for public opinion.
*  They know increasing numbers are repulsed and horrified and grief-stricken about what's happening to the people of Gaza.
*  They know increasingly that those complicit in this massacre are morally exposed.
*  And so they are desperately trying to find a moral high ground because they support mass slaughter in turning the tables and go,
*  No, the real extremists, the real haters are those who support peace. So they will continue doing everything they can.
*  They will continue to do it for what it is. They'll still try and ban the protest.
*  But for now, they haven't managed to get their way and expect them, therefore, to increase the hysteria about this protest.
*  And the way to answer it is to come out in ever greater numbers.
*  Let's make sure we tell everyone we know that we're all there together, united, whatever our backgrounds, Muslim, Jewish, Christian, non-believers,
*  we're all there together, united together against the massacre of thousands of innocent people.
