# Time To BOYCOTT Germany Over Gaza?
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [February 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8)
*  I think it's time for a boycott of the German state, specifically a boycott of its public events by artists, performers, writers, authors, musicians, those who care about human rights, who oppose mass murder, who oppose what the highest court on earth, the International Court of Justice, is investigating as an alleged genocide, that is Israel's mass murderous onslaught against Gaza and its people. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=0.0s)]
*  Here's why. Now, if I were the German state at this particular juncture, I would simply keep a low profile. Let me just sit down and just sit this one out. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=24.64s)]
*  That is not the tact they've gone for. Instead, they've settled on a particularly gruesome strategy to gain absolution for the attempt by the German state to exterminate the entire Jewish population of Europe in which two thirds of Jews murdered within living memory. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=32.88s)]
*  Now, firstly, the German state has long loudly demanded that somebody else pay for the crimes committed by the German state, specifically the Palestinian people. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=48.64s)]
*  It seems to believe, or does clearly believe, that compensation for what it did should be paid by Palestinians through being violently ethnically cleansed repeatedly, occupied, their land stolen, colonized, subjected to apartheid, huge state violence over and over again, mass incarceration, suspension of basic civil liberties. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=58.32s)]
*  We could go on. These are all horrors which clearly no German citizen would tolerate. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=76.4s)]
*  Now, I'm aware that it's not just the German state responsible for 2000 years of European antisemitism by any stretch. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=83.84s)]
*  It is simply the case that firstly, 19th century German antisemitism played a pivotal role in the racialization of antisemitism, that is turning antisemitism into a race theory, which became a precondition for its particularly genocidal form. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=90.32s)]
*  And the rise, obviously, of Nazism and then the Shoah, the murder of six million Jews. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=105.52s)]
*  All of that is a precondition for what is happening today. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=110.48s)]
*  Now, this attempt to force other people to pay the price for what Germany did as a state now takes the form of being one of the world's leading legitimizers and apologists and backers for the present mass murder of Palestinians. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=114.16s)]
*  Now, that's always been very profitable, I would note, for German arms company since the arms trade between the two countries, Germany and Israel, began in the early 1960s. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=126.96s)]
*  By November last year, military exports to Israel from Germany were up tenfold, thanks to fast tracks in the aftermath of the current horror, of course, unfolding. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=135.84s)]
*  Reading a headline in the Financial Times like Israel Hamas war boost German investor interest in defense sector, says rank chief. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=145.68s)]
*  That was the other day. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  Or pass the sick bag. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=154.32s)]
*  Secondly, in a particularly perverse twist of history, not only is the German state targeting anyone who speaks out in support of the Palestinian people, they are disproportionately targeting Jewish people. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=155.6s)]
*  You can't make this shit up. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=166.32s)]
*  Let's just listen to Yuval Abraham, a brilliant Israeli Jewish journalist who I interviewed late last year. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=167.84s)]
*  He's one of the directors of No Other Land, a documentary film about the forced displacement of the Palestinian people of Masafir Yata, where another co-director, Basil Adra, is from. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=172.8s)]
*  Now, he made a speech at the Berlin Ali Film Festival. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  Let's hear from it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=186.24s)]
*  I want to say we are we are standing in front of you now. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=187.36s)]
*  Me and Basil are the same age. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=189.52s)]
*  I am Israeli. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=191.28s)]
*  Basil is Palestinian. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=192.08s)]
*  And in two days, we will go back to a land where we are not equal. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  I'm living under a civilian law and Basil is under military law. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  We live 30 minutes from one another, but I have voting rights. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=204.88s)]
*  Basil is not having voting rights. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=208.08s)]
*  I'm free to move where I want in this land. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=210.4s)]
*  Basil is like millions of Palestinians locked in the occupied West Bank. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  This situation of apartheid between us, this inequality, it has to end. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=217.68s)]
*  There he is, calling for equality, documenting facts established by independent human rights groups. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=223.04s)]
*  What happens next? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=228.64s)]
*  The mayor of Berlin condemns, here amongst others, for anti-Semitism. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=230.0s)]
*  Now, the mayor of Berlin is not Jewish, just so you know. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  So the non-Jewish mayor of Berlin is condemning a Jewish Israeli for anti-Semitism [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=237.2s)]
*  because he called for equality and condemned human rights abuses. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=241.67999999999998s)]
*  He was also condemned anti-Semitism by Israeli television [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=246.4s)]
*  and has been subjected, because of all of that, to a tsunami of death threats since. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=250.79999999999998s)]
*  So a German non-Jewish mayor helped whip up a firestorm of death threats [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=254.72s)]
*  against a Jewish Israeli for calling for equality. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=258.88s)]
*  Is that redemption for Germany's past? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=263.12s)]
*  Is it? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=265.28s)]
*  A speech was also made, with a similar theme, by the co-director, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=266.08s)]
*  who I mentioned there, Basil Adler. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=269.6s)]
*  I'm here celebrating the award, but also very hard for me to celebrate [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=271.36s)]
*  when there are tens of thousands of my people being slaughtered and massacred by Israel in Gaza. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=276.72s)]
*  My community is being also erased by Israeli bulldozers. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=282.08000000000004s)]
*  I ask one thing for Germany, as I am in Berlin here, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=286.40000000000003s)]
*  to respect the UN calls and stop sending weapons to Israel. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  Now, a German green minister, green party, I'm not talking about the far right here, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=299.6s)]
*  we're not talking about the right-wing party, I'm talking about the green party, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=312.24s)]
*  then releases a statement making clear that they were only clapping the Jewish Israeli co-director [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=315.68s)]
*  and not the Palestinian co-director. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=321.44s)]
*  That's not even subtle racism. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=325.52000000000004s)]
*  On one level, refreshing, because politicians and media outlets across Europe and the US [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=327.36s)]
*  haven't even bothered to pretend they have anything other than contempt for the Palestinian people [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=331.12s)]
*  and their lives, they're just not normally so crudely honest about it. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=335.44s)]
*  Does the German state think treating people as inferior because of their ethnicity [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=338.48s)]
*  is redemption for Germany's past? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=342.16s)]
*  Does it really? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=344.08s)]
*  Does it really think official statements issued by ministers [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=344.88s)]
*  clarifying they're not clapping someone based on their ethnicity is that redemption? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=347.6s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=351.84000000000003s)]
*  It's bringing back memories, isn't it? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=352.64s)]
*  In the aftermath of the Bernal Ali in a German newspaper, which is written in a hideous way, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=354.08s)]
*  framed exactly on the terms of all of this outrage, it says government ministers are [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=359.84s)]
*  threatening criminal action against those who said, for example, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=364.71999999999997s)]
*  free Palestine from the River to the Sea, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=367.52s)]
*  claiming it's an endorsement of the killings committed by Hamas on the 7th of October. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=369.52s)]
*  Ludicrous nonsense. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=373.28s)]
*  I'd note, from the River to the Sea, it's in the founding platform of Likud, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=374.56s)]
*  Israel's ruling party, has also been stated, for example, by the Israeli ambassador to the UK. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=378.0s)]
*  What they mean by it, one Israeli state from the River to the Sea, is apartheid. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=383.12s)]
*  In practice, it can only mean the subjugation of the Palestinians who lived there, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=387.76s)]
*  but that's fine. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=390.64s)]
*  People who use it to mean equal rights for Palestinians across historic Palestine, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=391.68s)]
*  turns out you're going to jail in Germany. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=395.44s)]
*  Now, who thinks throwing people into police cells for fraud crime [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=397.44s)]
*  is going to wash away the sins of Germany's past? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=402.4s)]
*  I don't think so, guys. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=404.88s)]
*  I think all of this is having a pretty opposite effect to what you intend. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=406.16s)]
*  The minister actually said that this was rewarding and... [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=410.0s)]
*  They said, rewarding and endorsing crimes is a criminal offence. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=413.84s)]
*  Completely off their trees, these people. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=417.04s)]
*  He claimed the Bernal Ali suffered serious damage this weekend [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=418.56s)]
*  because anti-Semitism went too far and challenged. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=421.52s)]
*  No evidence of any anti-Semitism here. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=423.76s)]
*  The newspaper offers evidence such as calling for a ceasefire. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=425.6s)]
*  I repeat, you cannot make this shit up. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=429.68s)]
*  You really can't. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=432.72s)]
*  Calling for peace and an end to a war machine and violence. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=433.76s)]
*  That's anti-Semitism. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=438.0s)]
*  It gets so much worse. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=439.84s)]
*  The main targets of Germany's offence against those who believe in human rights [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=440.88s)]
*  inequality for Palestinians and oppose their mass murder are Muslim citizens. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=444.88s)]
*  We'll talk about that. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=448.88s)]
*  But according to the researcher Emily Dish Becker, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=449.84s)]
*  almost a third of those targeted by the German state, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=452.08s)]
*  whether through deplatforming or arrests, are Jewish. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=455.28s)]
*  Now, as an article on this by Kenan Malik and the Observer points out, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=460.48s)]
*  according to Suzanne Neyman, who's a Jewish American philosopher [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=464.71999999999997s)]
*  and a director of the Einstein Forum, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=471.76s)]
*  she says to be a left-wing Jew in today's Germany [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=474.71999999999997s)]
*  is to live in a state of permanent cognitive dissonance. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=476.96s)]
*  German politicians and media talk incessantly about protecting Jews from anti-Semitism, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=481.76s)]
*  but many criticize the Israeli government and the war on Gaza [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=486.15999999999997s)]
*  have been canceled and certainly attacked. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=488.47999999999996s)]
*  I'm an Israeli citizen and I've been accused of being a Hamas supporter [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=490.56s)]
*  and even a Nazi in mainstream media. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=494.16s)]
*  Need I add that I am neither. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=496.88000000000005s)]
*  So what? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=498.64000000000004s)]
*  Calling an Israeli Jewish person a Nazi in mainstream German media [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=499.20000000000005s)]
*  because they support peace. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=506.48s)]
*  Is that atoning for the past? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=508.40000000000003s)]
*  As the Israeli-born architect and academic Eyal Weizman has acidly put it, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=510.08000000000004s)]
*  this is me quoting Kenan Malik again, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=514.48s)]
*  talking about certain irony in being lectured and how to be properly Jewish, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=516.72s)]
*  to be properly Jewish, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=519.84s)]
*  by the children and grandchildren of the perpetrators who murdered our families [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=520.96s)]
*  and who now dare to tell us that we are anti-Semitic. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=526.88s)]
*  I'm just trying to gaslight people to death here. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=530.72s)]
*  Here's another example. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=534.1600000000001s)]
*  One Jewish woman, again actually an Israeli for the record, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=535.84s)]
*  arrested earlier this month for holding a sign inscribed with [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=538.96s)]
*  Another Jew for a Free Palestine. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=543.6s)]
*  A museum cancelled an exhibition by Jewish artist Candice Bright after she spoke out [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=546.7199999999999s)]
*  over Gaza, silencing and cancelling Jews for calling for peace, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=554.3199999999999s)]
*  washing away the sins of the past. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=559.36s)]
*  Is it targeting Jews with leftist inclinations, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=560.7199999999999s)]
*  including with police repression? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=564.16s)]
*  Is that absolution for Germany's past? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=566.8s)]
*  Really? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=569.36s)]
*  How is the disproportionate targeting of Jews not anti-Semitism? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=570.16s)]
*  I would note, leftist Jews were particularly targeted in the run up to the rise of the Nazis. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=572.8s)]
*  Obviously the Nazis killed and targeted all Jews. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=577.8399999999999s)]
*  But the claim of Jews being dangerous leftist adversives was an important plank of anti-Semitism [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=581.3599999999999s)]
*  at the time. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=586.0799999999999s)]
*  The International Jewish Bolshevik Conspiracy, etc. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=586.88s)]
*  Now you have German police attacking a Palestinian woman on film [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=589.92s)]
*  because he called her ridiculous. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=594.8s)]
*  Well, he clearly is ridiculous. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=597.52s)]
*  A spot of police brutality. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=600.24s)]
*  Definitely washing away the past here. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=602.0s)]
*  In Berlin high schools, they've been ordered to distribute a leaflet describing the 1948 [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=604.08s)]
*  Nakba, the mass expulsion of Palestinians from their homes, as a myth. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=608.8s)]
*  German cities have been banning protests, Palestinian flags, the Palestinian kethya. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=613.2s)]
*  In Berlin, a police officer stomped on candles for a vigil for the dead of Gaza. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=617.68s)]
*  Banning protests, silencing people. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=623.92s)]
*  Authoritarianism. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=627.76s)]
*  Is that atoning for the past? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=629.76s)]
*  A Palestinian author, Adania Shibley, had a ceremony for her award at the Frankfurt [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=630.88s)]
*  Book Festival, indefinitely postponed. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=636.64s)]
*  Now the German authorities tried to strangle state support for artists deemed to cross [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=639.84s)]
*  the extremely restrictive lines of criticising Israel, only backing down. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=644.08s)]
*  It's no after outrage. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=646.96s)]
*  Meanwhile, rising discourse about the supposed anti-Semitism of Muslims has helped fuel [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=649.68s)]
*  already rising bigotry and prejudice towards the five and a half million German Muslim population. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=655.04s)]
*  Rats are going to put bigotry against a minority which suffers high levels of [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=659.92s)]
*  discrimination and prejudice. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=664.24s)]
*  Is that atoning for the past? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=665.4399999999999s)]
*  It should be known that the Berlinale Instagram feed was hacked into and someone posted [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=667.1999999999999s)]
*  genocide is genocide. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=671.92s)]
*  We are all complicit. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=673.04s)]
*  Condemning the silence make is complicit in Israel's ongoing genocide in Gaza and [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=674.24s)]
*  ethnic cleansing of Palestine. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=677.92s)]
*  It says after long internal discussions, we've decided to finally shed the idea that [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=680.0799999999999s)]
*  German guilt absolves us of our country's history or our current crimes as a nation. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=683.52s)]
*  They go on to demand an immediate and permanent ceasefire. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=688.08s)]
*  They add from our unresolved Nazi past to our genocidal present, we have always been [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=690.8000000000001s)]
*  on the wrong side of history. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=695.2s)]
*  But it's not too late to change our future. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=697.2800000000001s)]
*  Well, that's punchy, isn't it? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=700.8000000000001s)]
*  And that's the point. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=702.4000000000001s)]
*  The far right is on the rise of Germany. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=703.12s)]
*  It is dangerous. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=704.96s)]
*  It's never been as powerful as it's been since the end of World War II. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=706.1600000000001s)]
*  It's on the rise because of the abject failures of the German establishment, which itself [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=710.4000000000001s)]
*  is whipping up bigotry towards migrants and indeed Muslims, which is helping legitimize [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=714.8s)]
*  the far right. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=718.56s)]
*  We can see what's happening here. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=720.0s)]
*  We can see what's happening here, particularly in these arts and box and films and literature [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=721.36s)]
*  and performance spaces. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=727.36s)]
*  I know the brilliant author Vincent Bevin. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=729.92s)]
*  He was due to give a keynote address in Germany on his new book, cancelled again due to pro [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=731.92s)]
*  Palestine posts on social media. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=737.68s)]
*  Okay, Germany, if you want to respond, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=740.8s)]
*  to this racist and genocidal past with racism and support for genocide and intimidating [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=744.16s)]
*  and harassing those who stand against it, disproportionately Jewish people, as well [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=749.28s)]
*  as the disproportionately targeted minority of Germany Muslims, as they are disproportionately [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=753.12s)]
*  targeted everywhere, then we've got a responsibility to boycott all events in that country. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=758.8s)]
*  I mean, this is a piss take. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=765.12s)]
*  I think we should seriously be talking about a just general boycott of any events in Germany [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=767.36s)]
*  and to call out Germany for what it's doing, which is not making a men's face history [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=776.08s)]
*  quite the opposite. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=779.36s)]
*  It's bringing the terrible crimes of the German state right back to the fall. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=780.56s)]
*  A reminder that we live in the shadow of what the German state did and that it is not atonement [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=783.68s)]
*  to support terrible crimes, not least when you are forcing other people, innocent people, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=790.72s)]
*  to pay for what your state did. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJX9-9ubu8&t=797.28s)]
