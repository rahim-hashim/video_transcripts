# Western Media COVERS UP Israeli Finance Minister Call For Genocide
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [November 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILTsXB-jtpo)
*  Since Israel's genocide began, a recurring theme of our coverage has been that Israeli leaders and officials made their intentions to commit war crimes, to commit crimes against humanity, and indeed to commit genocide very clear from the very start.
*  And so it remains, Bezalel Smotrich is the Finance Minister in Benjamin Netanyahu's government, and he has a history of making statements underlining support for war crimes and genocide long before the 7th of October.
*  Those statements have of course intensified since. This April, the editorial of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz was entitled, Smotrich must pay the price for his repeated calls for genocide of Palestinians.
*  They noted, he declared, in reference to cities in Gaza, there are no half jobs, Rafa, Deir el-Bala, Nusrat, total destruction. Thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven. There is no place for them under heaven.
*  Now, they added Haaretz about these comments. They said, plain and simple, total destruction. There is no room for interpretation. Quite correct.
*  Haaretz rightly noted that the Finance Minister was openly advocating genocide and yet remained in government in a key position, of course.
*  Now, in August, he declared in a speech that it may be justified and moral to starve the people of Gaza. And of course, Israel has, as we keep focusing on, pursued a deliberate policy of starvation in Gaza, which is at the very core of the International Criminal Court's issuing of arrest warrants against Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defense Minister, Yov Galan.
*  In the latest speech, Smotrich has declared that Israel must permanently occupy Gaza and that it will, or can, more than halve Gaza's population within two years. Let's listen to what he says.
*  It doesn't cost that much. The IDF must be there, and that's a crime. To fight terrorism, to maintain security and to prevent Gaza from re-emerging and to be a citizen of the State of Israel, not to control the civilian population.
*  On the way, and also to control the civilian population, is the only way to destroy Hamas's civilian population. Hamas is a civilian, and it was built by its military aid.
*  There is no other way. And even if it costs a little money, they scared me, they'll have to go to the army. They said it costs 5 billion. I mean, it's quiet.
*  It won't cost 5 billion. A maximum of a few million. But I told them, even if it costs 5 billion, I'll call it now.
*  You gave me the last year 250 billion in debt a year. I can break it down to 50 years ahead. I bought it in the 90s.
*  If that's what I need to protect the security of the State of Israel, then I would have said yes. But again, it won't cost. It doesn't get close to my agreement at all.
*  It's the same thing in Lebanon. It's the same thing in the West Bank.
*  Oh, I just missed it, of course. There is no doubt that the resumption of the
*  government is a chance that will open with a new government.
*  I think that the less we talk about it, the more we can do. It's like the West Bank over the years.
*  It's a twisted relationship between the
*  West Bank and Israel.
*  To quote, it is possible to create a situation that Gaza in two years has less than half of its current population.
*  He talks about supposed voluntary migration. Clearly, no such thing exists.
*  What he's referring to is the conditions of Gaza being made unbearable for the Palestinian civilian population, as well as, of course, the use of violence to drive them out.
*  In other words, ethnic cleansing. And in any case, he knows from his support of starvation that depriving civilians of the essentials of life, as well as the use of mass violence, the destruction of the health care system and so on.
*  All of this is causing an unknown huge spike in what is clinically described as the excess death rate.
*  That is the number of deaths above what is projected from natural attrition.
*  All the evidence of conflicts involving intense levels of destruction tell us that most people do not die of direct violence.
*  They die from other causes like the lack of health care is notable to that.
*  He refers to this strategy of collapsing the civilian population as being a model elsewhere to be emulated, notably in the West Bank,
*  which he labels with the biblical term Judea and Samaria and Lebanon.
*  And if you think there is room for doubt, let's listen to what he said subsequently in this speech.
*  So he says, what's important is that we beat the hell out of them and we'll continue to beat it.
*  We won't let them rebuild and anyone who lifts his head will get beat.
*  He goes on, nothing makes a move and what moves dies. That's all. And is attacked and annihilated.
*  Clear, straightforward, genocidal intent. Once again, note the role of the Western media here.
*  There is barely any coverage of these comments. I mean, listen to these comments.
*  I mean, this is just absurd. If this was a state hostile to the West and you had the finance minister talking about halving the population of a land they had occupied.
*  Just imagine for a moment the response. Imagine Putin said this about Ukraine.
*  Yet there's barely any coverage. Oh, sorry, Putin's finance minister. Let me be correct.
*  There's barely any coverage for these comments.
*  The finance minister of Israel is openly committing to halving the Palestinian population of Gaza in two years.
*  And this is apparently not de-newsworthy. As I keep on saying, the Western media not only failed from the start to frame their coverage around these statements of intent by Israeli leaders,
*  which proved the most accurate predictor of what indeed Israel has gone on to do, they generally failed to report them at all.
*  And when they did, buried them and stripped those statements of significance.
*  Some wider context. As the brilliant Palestinian analyst, Mohamed Shahada, this week puts it about latest reports,
*  Israeli experts estimate Gaza's reconstruction will cost between 100 to 200 billion dollars to restore buildings to the lowest standard.
*  That's 575 percent to 1150 percent the size of the entire Palestinian economy.
*  He adds, this is what we mean by genocide. Israel ensured it'd be impossible for Gaza to sustain life for decades to come.
*  Shemuel Meir, a former IDF officer, meanwhile tweets that Gaza is being turned into a flattened wasteland using bulldozers and baby trap vehicles wiping out entire streets as well as houses.
*  He says Israeli citizens aren't aware of this because it's not reported in Israeli media.
*  And then they are surprised by the decisions of the International Criminal Court, he says, in The Hague.
*  Following reports that only 11 out of 109 aid trucks managed to get into Gaza, Shahada notes that this means 68 grams of food per Gazan.
*  In Stanley's Gulag, he adds, it was 950 grams per person.
*  A note that when aid does get in, it is being blocked from getting to civilians, including because the Israeli army is allowing criminal gangs,
*  including blatant collaborators and ISIS-linked militants that steal the aid, whilst killing security personnel who are trying to protect the aid.
*  As UNRWA, the UN's Palestinian refugee agency and the main humanitarian agency in Gaza, which Israel is seeking to destroy entirely.
*  As they note, hunger in Gaza is at critical levels with people scavenging through weeks old waste for scraps of food as winter approaches, conditions are rapidly deteriorating and survival is impossible without immediate humanitarian aid.
*  As the office for the coordination, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs further notes, with the onset of heavy rains, 1.6 million people in makeshift shelters urgently need assistance.
*  And of the 41 attempts by the UN to support people besieged in northern Gaza so far in November, 37 were denied or four impeded.
*  The survivors in Gaza are being driven by the Israeli military literally into the ocean.
*  Gazans have been crammed into increasingly small places, specifically the low-lying Al-Mawazi area, which has been flooded as sea levels rise with kill zones on each side if they try and flee.
*  Mohamed Shahada notes that 10,000 tents have been destroyed within two days by rain and sea and 110,000 tents are damaged, worn out and unusable.
*  That is, he says, over 80% of tents in Gaza.
*  Indeed, UNICEF report Palestinians testifying to sea waves sweeping over tents and Palestinians freezing as winter now approaches.
*  Once again, there was no excuse for pleading ignorance, for claiming, I did not know what was really happening at the time.
*  The Israeli state has been extremely and definitely clear about its genocidal intentions from day one.
*  Their leaders scream their intentions to the world in the least subtle fashion possible.
*  And we can see the overwhelming evidence on the ground because we are literally watching the first live stream genocide in history.
*  We can see this genocidal plan being implemented.
*  And we know because of the work of Palestinian journalists who've suffered the biggest slaughter of journalists in recorded history, because of Palestinian civilians on the ground, because of the UN, because of aid agencies, because of human rights agencies,
*  overwhelming evidence every single day of this genocidal plan as it is implemented.
*  Do not let those who aided and abetted this historic abomination get away with it.
