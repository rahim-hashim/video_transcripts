# Media BIAS On Palestine EXPOSED
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf2-EjJccOU)
*  This is being done in your name. A massacre, a bloodbath, a war crime on a biblical scale
*  is currently underway in Gaza. Now I went on TV earlier doing my best to challenge the absolutely
*  outrageous media coverage with courageous exceptions of this calamity but before I share
*  that clip a few more comments. This is what's important it's your government arming and backing
*  Israel as it unleashes this war crime. The Israeli state has ordered the civilian population of northern
*  Gaza to leave their homes all 1.1 million of them. Now the UN has declared that this will lead to
*  devastating humanitarian consequences and calls for that order to be reversed. The Norwegian
*  Refugee Council has declared it would amount to the war crime of forcible transfer demanding it
*  be reversed. The Director General of the World Health Organization has said that that decision
*  to order an evacuation is asking vulnerable patients to evacuate hospitals in Gaza and that
*  amounted to a death sentence demanding it be reversed. The truth is hundreds of thousands of
*  those civilians cannot leave it's impossible to do so. This is a war zone not least those who are
*  desperately desperately ill injured. The Gaza Health Ministry said it's impossible to evacuate
*  the wounded to the south there were no extra beds in any hospitals anywhere for people to move to
*  most of the wounded are in stable they die on route all the hospitals in Gaza even after they've
*  been expanded are full. It was already a war crime to cut off food water and electricity
*  to Gaza which remember has been under blockade from land air and sea for 15 years reducing it
*  to the world's largest open air prison. As you listen to this entire neighborhoods have been
*  wiped out the head of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees has said Gaza is
*  being turned into a hellhole. The mentality of the Israeli state here should not be in doubt.
*  Their president Isaac Herzog has directly made it clear that the official position of the Israeli
*  state is one of collective punishment. He said it is an entire nation out there that is responsible
*  it's not true this rhetoric about civilians not being aware not evolved is absolutely not true.
*  They could have risen up they could have fought against that evil regime which took over Gaza
*  and Akut Dita. Have no doubt that's the sort of mentality which historically has led to genocide.
*  Now what we may well what we are witnessing what we are witnessing is a human catastrophe one created
*  by the Israeli state armed and backed by Britain and the United States but much of our media is
*  not telling the truth about the brutal reality of what's happening in Gaza. Earlier I went on the
*  Jeremy Vine show to make this point and about how Palestinians are being stripped of their humanity
*  by the media and politicians. The British government is helping the humanitarian crisis in the first
*  place happen because it's supporting what is a war crime and that's what we should be talking
*  about is a war crime being committed with the support of the British government. This military
*  contribution by the way is completely tokenistic if anyone thinks it's going to do anything
*  worthwhile it won't and I don't understand the framing of prevent all-out war in the region
*  it won't do any such thing clearly and what it does show is that the British government will stand
*  behind the Israeli state whilst it commits a war crime. Now what's happening at the moment is
*  collective punishment which is illegal under international law. We were all horrified by the
*  atrocities committed by Hamas against innocent civilians in Israel. What is now happening is
*  illegal under the Geneva Convention you cannot cut off. Okay let's just go back to these ships
*  though because what we have there is a hospital ship and certainly from the way that I- But the
*  reason I'm very distracted about talking about that is- We witnessed the military- There's nothing-
*  Medics they didn't regard which side people came from they treated them and if we are about to see
*  a humanitarian crisis on an increased scale then that ship could be there to help out. This is
*  too tokenistic a contribution to be worth commenting on. All it shows the only significance of this
*  is that it shows the British government will unequivocally unconditionally back Israel while
*  it cuts off water, food and electricity while it drops white phosphorus people should google
*  white phosphorus. What it does it's like raining fire on civilians it sticks to your skin and burns
*  it off it's a war crime to use that against a civilian population. The British government's
*  position is that it will support collective punishment against a population which is the
*  the size Gaza of East London it has 2.2 million people 80% of them rely on international
*  humanitarian assistance 50% of them are children 50% of children they are hungry desperate kids
*  they did not kill those people those poor innocent people in Israel and the position of Britain is
*  that the hundreds of Palestinian kids who have already died more will be killed as well as medics
*  who are dying as well as UN officials journalists the whole works. I think we do need some balance here
*  we had genuinely a bit of balance here I was talking to a Jewish friend this morning
*  who said who lives in London and said that her daughter whose Jewish is in Paris is not going
*  out because she's so fearful you've got WhatsApp groups in Jewish communities saying to people
*  you don't go out because they're really worried about anti-semitic attacks in the UK all over the
*  world so there's a there's an you know if you were Jewish I think you would feel different I
*  think you'd feel very afraid I think the the shock and the hurt the as you said the horrific nature
*  of the attacks that happened to completely innocent Jews and according to civilians is it is a kind of
*  very it's euphemistic these are families these were mothers and fathers and children and the way they
*  were killed and the fact that it was absolutely unashamedly we weren't even trying to get a
*  military target we were just going to kill people in a terrible terrible way so I understand I want
*  to I really have to okay no I really want to focus on our subject which is about which is about
*  the purpose of these ships I agree it's just so we're clear but just so we're clear what they're
*  aiming to do is patrol to prevent arms making their way to her mouth can I answer why I just
*  think I'm frustrated about it because my response is somehow not acceptable because I'm saying that
*  the significance of what Britain is doing is through this tokenistic gesture it's showing that
*  it supports what Israel is doing and just don't know I have to respond very quickly to that
*  you're absolutely right antisemitic incidents always go up during these flames of violence
*  that's always true and every attempt to blame Jewish people for what's happening committed by
*  Israel is antisemitism what is also happening it always happens at the same time is you get an
*  increase in anti-muslim hate crimes and they are being spiking in Britain and elsewhere as well
*  but the point I'll just make very politely to you is you talked about the fear people have
*  Jewish people here and in France and elsewhere the fear of people in Palestine now is based on
*  the fact they are being bombed they are having white bosses dropped and the reason I'm frustrated
*  is what caused this? Hamas caused this? No those Palestinian children didn't do that and they're
*  paying and Palestinian children are of equal worth their lives for that of an Israeli child
*  but I think people aren't saying that in the media Palestinian people are being treated as less
*  than human again this support that's been offered that's on its way there what do you want us to say
*  about this I'm genuinely curious I don't understand what the point I'm just saying if you look at the
*  purpose of these two ships what they're there to do one is to prevent arms making their way to Hamas
*  that's a good thing they're not going to do that's the tokenistic effort the other is to provide
*  hospital assistance now presumably that's for whoever needs it regardless of which side that
*  that is aiding in what could be a catastrophic humanitarian crisis which which Britain could
*  stop Britain could stop by taking a stand against collective punishment which is killing innocent
*  people I cannot stop that I mean my fear when I heard that we were sending this task force was
*  oh my goodness we're not getting involved in another war are we you know surely we have learned
*  that when we step into the middle east no good thing ever happens there and I think we've already
*  got Ukraine that we're involved in and now we're going to be involved in this it just like we've
*  I feel like as a country we've got so many problems here and yet yet again we're getting
*  whether it's tokenistic which I think it largely is here we are getting involved you just made a
*  great point well we just made an excellent point there which is every single one of these military
*  interventions has been disaster you're right Iraq Afghanistan Libya we could go on but that's also
*  true with the with Gaza every single Israeli onslaught on Gaza killed huge numbers of innocent
*  civilians and it did not stop Hamas and you also had Israeli soldiers dying not anywhere
*  compared to the number of Palestinians and again in the last 15 years before this hideous
*  atrocity which Hamas committed 96 percent of the deaths were Palestinian 96 percent of the injuries
*  were Palestinian and we've got to start treating Palestinians as human beings because in this
*  discussion in the media at the moment people are not treating Palestinians as human beings
*  and that has to stop I just want to end by saying this I've worked in the media now for 12 years and
*  I've never been so disgusted with this industry never so disgusted with commendable exceptions
*  that is not even the pretense that Palestinian civilian life is of equal life to that of an
*  Israeli or Western civilian life that is gratuitous unapologetic racism and it should be described
*  as such when someone because of their racialized characteristics their life is treated as of being
*  less worth than you it is vitally important of course to hold our governments to account for
*  this ongoing massacre and for example in Britain the failure of the opposition to hold the government
*  to account but it's also important to hold media outlets and commentators to account they are
*  helping to build consent for this atrocity some of them their rhetoric is nothing short of
*  nauseating whipping up in the most kind of bloodlust way support for this mass murder now everything
*  that happens from now on is in part on them in the coming bloodshed some of those who cheered on this
*  war crime will start to express regrets we didn't mean this this isn't what we wanted that's what
*  they'll say don't let them get away with it don't let them get away with it what happens next is
*  obvious it's obvious to us all they cannot look back and say that what is about to happen is
*  something they could never have predicted it we know what's going to happen and they should not
*  and cannot be absolved of their own responsibility please like subscribe do keep the channel on the
