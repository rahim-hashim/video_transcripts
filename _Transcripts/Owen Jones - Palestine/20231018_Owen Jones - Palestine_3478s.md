# Gaza's Humanitarian Crisis: THE TRUTH
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4)
*  Hello, welcome to the show. We are now a week and a half into a war crime, which has been [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=0.0s)]
*  committed. Need to be clear about that. And I'll speak about that with my guests as well, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=18.8s)]
*  which has been committed against the people of Gaza by an Israeli state, which is armed [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=22.92s)]
*  and backed by the West, which is why we're devoting so much time to discuss this because [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=27.9s)]
*  our governments are directly complicit in exactly what's going on. And obviously this [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=34.339999999999996s)]
*  happened after the horrendous events of the atrocity committed by Hamas, which we discussed [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=38.58s)]
*  last week with the Israeli human rights organization, Betzalab. Now, before I bring in my guests, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=44.019999999999996s)]
*  because it's so important in times like this that I pass the mic to voices who are far [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=49.3s)]
*  more educated in what exactly is going on in the grounds and also elevating the voices that we [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=56.26s)]
*  need to hear from at times like this. But just in terms of what we know, because we often hear [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=61.54s)]
*  about the fog of war. So it's very, very important that I say this to begin with, which is we know [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=65.1s)]
*  that Israel has declared a total siege, that the Israeli defense minister very clearly said that [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=69.74s)]
*  all water, food and electricity will be cut off from Gaza in pursuit of what he called human [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=75.46s)]
*  animals. And he further said that we will eliminate everything. We know that a siege of such [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=80.25999999999999s)]
*  description is against international law. It's against the Geneva Conventions. We know that [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=86.25999999999999s)]
*  Israeli officials are boasting that they will turn Gaza into a city of tents. We know that one of [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=91.69999999999999s)]
*  Israeli's top military lawyers says if you want to destroy Hamas, then you have to destroy Gaza, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=97.05999999999999s)]
*  because everything in Gaza, almost every building there is a stronghold of Hamas. And I say that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=101.46s)]
*  because a leading light in the Labour Party in support of what's going on says that those, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=107.13999999999999s)]
*  that Israel can't possibly be in violation of international law because their actions have [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=112.74000000000001s)]
*  signed off from the lawyers. I've just quoted from one of those lawyers, so we know exactly what we're [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=116.74000000000001s)]
*  dealing with. We know that the forcible removal of civilian populations under threat of violence [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=120.58000000000001s)]
*  is a war crime. We know that because the likes of the United Nations, the Norwegian Refugee [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=126.9s)]
*  Council have made that abundantly clear. We know what international law says. We know that as [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=131.70000000000002s)]
*  aid agencies, the UN have said on the ground that they have run out of clean water, that people are [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=137.22s)]
*  resorting to drinking seawater and drinking from intravenous drip bags in order to survive. We know [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=144.02s)]
*  the hospital system is on the brink of collapse. We know, incidentally, we will talk about what [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=150.74s)]
*  happened in terms of the hospital bombing yesterday, we know that Israel has bombed hospitals [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=156.5s)]
*  and it has killed medics. And we also know that Israel has a track record of spreading [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=161.62s)]
*  disinformation. A very famous example is when they shot dead the prominent Palestinian journalist, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=168.98000000000002s)]
*  US journalist as well, Shireen Abu Akhlai. They claimed that they didn't target her. They released [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=177.38s)]
*  video footage to claim they had not done so. It turned out months later that they admitted it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=181.38s)]
*  The same in 2022, Israel claimed Islamic Jihad was responsible for a strike which claimed five [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=185.62s)]
*  children. It turned out that Israel was responsible. In terms of the hospital itself, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=190.98s)]
*  we will discuss that. Bezalem, the human rights organisation, said that they haven't, they've said [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=194.66s)]
*  they're not in a position to know who was responsible, that Israel has a responsibility [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=201.29999999999998s)]
*  to allow the International Criminal Court access as well as journalists. Israel are refusing to [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=207.85999999999999s)]
*  allow independent investigators into the site. But we know already, regardless of the horror [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=213.62s)]
*  inflicted on that hospital with a horrific death toll, we know that Gaza is in a humanitarian [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=220.02s)]
*  catastrophe. And we will keep talking about that throughout this programme and also in the days, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=227.06s)]
*  weeks and months ahead. If you're watching live or not watching live, please click like and do [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=234.10000000000002s)]

*  voices that we desperately need to hear. So thank you so much for joining us, regardless of whether [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=280.66s)]
*  you're watching live or not. I just want to bring in straight away, actually, Asad Raymond, who is [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=286.1s)]
*  the head of War and Want, an incredible organisation, NGO, who I'll be very proud to work with [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=290.5s)]
*  over the years. Yeah, I mean, just to begin with, Asad, I mean, I just want to just give an example [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=295.14s)]
*  here of in terms of what's happening on the ground. And here is, I should say, obviously, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=304.58s)]
*  this is going to be distressing for lots of people. I don't know if you can hear me, but I'll say that. Just on footage here of the Nezirat refugee camp. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=312.18s)]
*  Just some footage there from ADC showing the sheer level of devastation. I mean, Asad, just tell us on the ground from what you're hearing. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=325.14s)]
*  What are we talking about in terms of the sheer scale of humanitarian catastrophe in developing Gaza at the moment? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=344.26s)]
*  I mean, as you know, Palestine, Gaza, the West Bank have been occupied for over 50 years. Gaza already was under a quite a brutal siege, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=349.54s)]
*  which has left over 80% of Palestinians in Gaza in poverty and struggling to basically survive because [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=361.46s)]
*  Israel is the occupying power, controlled all the land, sea and air borders, and would decide what comes in and what comes out. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=370.26s)]
*  And I was openly saying that it was strategy was basically leaving the Palestinians in Gaza barely alive. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=377.62s)]
*  And so enough that they would be alive, but not enough that they would be able to thrive. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=385.70000000000005s)]
*  Since the bombardment started, what, 11 days ago now, I mean, we are talking about utter devastation. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=391.70000000000005s)]
*  I mean, literally every UN agency from the World Health Organization to UNRWA to every aid organization to every human rights organization are saying it is an absolute catastrophe. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=400.42s)]
*  We have, of course, blockade for 11 days of food, medicine, water and electricity. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=413.78s)]
*  And we've got to remember that, you know, human beings can survive for about three days without fresh water. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=420.65999999999997s)]
*  Israel is blockade on fuel, meant that the water salination plants are not working. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=428.5s)]
*  Most people are down to a litre of water. Water is pretty much running out. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=435.94s)]
*  The World Health Organization said food is out in the next few days. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=441.38s)]
*  And of course, many of the hospitals have been desperately short of supplies, especially because over 3000 Palestinians, including women and children, have been killed and countless others have been wounded. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=445.22s)]
*  I think there was a telling quote from the head of the UNRWA, which is the agency, is basically saying Gaza is dying. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=458.58s)]
*  We need you to act. So it is, I think, literally on every level. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=467.14s)]
*  The majority of civilian infrastructure has been destroyed. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=474.02s)]
*  Large numbers of people have been internally displaced. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=478.58s)]
*  Of course, as you've said before, Owen, we're talking about one of the most overcrowded places in the world. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=481.38s)]
*  2.3 million people, roughly the area of like East London, if you took it from the city right through to East London. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=487.21999999999997s)]
*  I mean, we're talking what was already a crisis has been fuelled into catastrophe. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=494.97999999999996s)]
*  And in terms of, I mean, that context, which has been deliberately stripped, of course, since this has begun by those supporting this horrendous onslaught. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=502.82s)]
*  80% of Gaza's population before this dependent on international humanitarian aid in order to survive. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=512.58s)]
*  70% unable to meet their daily food requirements, half the population children. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=519.0600000000001s)]
*  I mean, the point is, this was a deeply vulnerable population defined by food insecurity and huge levels of poverty. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=525.0600000000001s)]
*  And before, I mean, 70% refugees as well. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=535.46s)]
*  I mean, that's the point, isn't it? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=540.74s)]
*  It's that this was so fragile in a very densely populated area that when you get a collapse of this social infrastructure, then you get a very severe humanitarian crisis actually very, very quickly. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=541.7s)]
*  Absolutely. And that's why many of the Palestinians and everybody else said this violence didn't start on Saturday, 7th of October. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=553.5400000000001s)]
*  It started in 1945. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=561.38s)]
*  It started in 1967 for many people. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=564.3399999999999s)]
*  It's been going on for decades and that slow, deadly occupation, which is the context in which we see what's happening in Gaza needs to be really understood. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=567.14s)]
*  And it needs to be understood because, of course, one of our most pressing calls at this moment is to allow humanitarian access to get into Gaza. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=579.54s)]
*  And that's really, really critical. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=588.9799999999999s)]
*  But it's also to solve this crisis once and for all. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=590.74s)]
*  And that's largely been missing from anything that governments, Western governments have said, which is we have to end the occupation. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=593.94s)]
*  The people of Palestine have a right to live with the same security and safety as citizens in Israel. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=601.0600000000001s)]
*  Their lives are not worth any less than the lives of Israeli citizens. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=607.38s)]
*  And there must be a political answer. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=612.5s)]
*  And what we have seen is that Western governments have been very, very happy for Israel to continue this occupation. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=614.82s)]
*  And Israel has been very content that every few years it does what it calls more the grass, which is to launch an onslaught on Gaza, kill a number of people, destroy the infrastructure and then step back. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=622.98s)]
*  But we have now a government that is full of far-right extremists that is even within Israel's history has never been seen. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=636.26s)]
*  About people who call themselves and define themselves as as fascists, as Jewish supremacists, as racist, a very strong, extreme settler community that has been pushing that government into acts which, as you said, included less wipe out Gaza. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=644.58s)]
*  This is the opportunity to wipe them out. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=665.46s)]
*  And if you look at the discourse that's happening in Israel, I mean, it's it's violent and it's extreme. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=667.22s)]
*  And it would shock people as to what many, many commentators and politicians in Israel are asking and demanding that happens, that Gaza is once and for all wiped out. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=673.3000000000001s)]
*  And I think that's important because it helps to understand what the strategy or one of the strategies of the Israeli government is in the in the brutal bombardment, first of the whole of Gaza, then of the north and the pushing of the forced transfer of people into Gaza. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=684.58s)]
*  I think their ultimate goal is that they create a humanitarian crisis. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=702.1s)]
*  And then in the name of solving that humanitarian crisis, you force the border in the crossing of to open and you push the Palestinians into the desert in the Sinai and never to return. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=706.26s)]
*  And therefore, you solve the Palestinian question because there is no Palestinians left. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=718.18s)]
*  I mean, this is a really crucial point. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=722.8199999999999s)]
*  The point I made at the start that you don't have to somehow read between the lines or that Israel is being very open and honest in what it's doing. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=725.54s)]
*  I'll give an example just based on what you just said. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=736.18s)]
*  So if we take Zippy Hotevelli, who did a despicable interview with Sinscone News, I did a video dissecting it. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=738.18s)]
*  And Zippy Hotevelli is an open supporter of a greater Israel, which he calls Judea and Samaria, i.e. on biblical grounds, justifying the annexation, not just of the whole of Jerusalem and the West Bank, but the Gaza Strip as well. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=745.8599999999999s)]
*  So when we have this argument that this force removal of people that will be for humanitarian ends, particularly, for example, if they're pushed out to the Sinai desert, and we had 700000 Palestinians in the Nakba in 1948 forced from their homes. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=758.9799999999999s)]
*  And the story of Palestine is that when Palestinians are forced from their homes, they do not return. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=771.0600000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's the point, isn't it? When we're hearing this presented as a humanitarian option, they're not being subtle, which is what about their intentions, including essentially in the likes of these extremists that they would like to annex Gaza and purge it as Palestinian population? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=775.14s)]
*  Absolutely, and of course, there is an irony also, the fact that you listen to our discourse in the UK and the frankly dehumanization that's taken place of the Palestinians. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=790.9s)]
*  Absolutely outrageous comments by the Home Secretary calling last week's demonstration in support of Palestinian rights a despicable mob, etc., and then saying that the call from the river to the sea was anticipated to be won. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=805.14s)]
*  The ambassador believes that she calls for it. She openly calls for an Israel from the river from the river to the sea. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=823.62s)]
*  I mean, it was one of her hallmark slogans in her own political career. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=831.14s)]
*  So, yeah, I mean, look, we are dealing with a regime that is openly and explicitly saying what it wants to do. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=838.26s)]
*  I think the real question now is, you know, what happens next and where do our governments who have been, of course, extremely complicit with this regime and have been extremely complicit with 11 days of bombing, what do they do next? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=846.9s)]
*  I think your viewers would be shocked that even today, Brazil put forward a resolution to the UN Security Council calling for an immediate ceasefire, was vetoed by the United States and the UK abstains. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=864.34s)]
*  I mean, the UK, even at this moment, even as we see the scale of death and destruction in Gaza, cannot bring itself to say the words there must be a stop to this war. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=879.86s)]
*  I mean, empty calls around, belated calls around humanitarian aid or etc. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=891.9399999999999s)]
*  Don't stop. Don't answer the key question, which is, you know, the indiscriminate bombing of Gaza is leading to widespread, widespread humanitarian crisis and, of course, a huge loss in life. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=898.8199999999999s)]
*  I mean, just on that, that's the other thing I wanted to talk to you about, and that is, you know, when I have people on Twitter today saying, well, actually, in terms of what's happened now, Jordan cutting off a conversation with Joe Biden about how we deal with the humanitarian crisis when the root cause of the humanitarian crisis is the war. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=913.22s)]
*  There's the attack on Gaza. Without a ceasefire, you can't end, end to the siege, you can't end the humanitarian crisis. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=929.86s)]
*  I'm just wondering, just in terms of the point, which really does have to be hammered home here is what we've seen, this horrific death toll, potentially, for over 3000 civilians, way more than that, over 1000 kids. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=935.86s)]
*  That's before an armed invasion that hasn't happened yet. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=947.62s)]
*  So I just think, isn't it worth just spelling out what the catastrophe that, you know, is one of potentially historic proportions? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=951.5400000000001s)]
*  But the British political establishment, the idea of even calling for a ceasefire is seen as somehow morally abhorrent. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=959.22s)]
*  Absolutely. And I think, you know, there'll be big questions about the role of the UK's complicity, as with many other leaders. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=965.86s)]
*  We know, we saw that during in the first week when international leaders, including the leaders of our own government and the leader of the main opposition party, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=976.42s)]
*  were categorically given a green light for Israel to violate international human rights law, even when they knew that the blockade and the deliberate starvation of people was a war crime. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=988.0200000000001s)]
*  Even when they knew that indiscriminate bombing of civilian and civilian infrastructure was a war crime and a crime against humanity, they only needed to listen to, of course, what the Israeli government was saying. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=999.46s)]
*  They were making genocidal calls and we stood by them. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1011.38s)]
*  And now at this critical moment, we have to say, isn't it enough? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1014.9s)]
*  When is enough enough? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1020.18s)]
*  And will the UK government, which has, you know, shockingly sent warships to in support of Israel. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1021.8599999999999s)]
*  Well, if it was serious about the humanitarian crisis, why isn't it broken the blockade itself? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1030.1s)]
*  Why doesn't it air drop food, water? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1035.7s)]
*  We did it in the Berlin blockade. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1037.78s)]
*  Why doesn't it put the lives of Palestinian people front and center? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1039.62s)]
*  It's sitting on its hands and it's allowing Israel a very, very long leash to continue to do what it's doing. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1044.34s)]
*  And I think with President Biden going to Israel today and our prime minister will be in Israel on Thursday, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1051.3s)]
*  it's very, very clear that they're not openly standing and speaking out and standing up for international law, humanitarian law at all. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1059.6999999999998s)]
*  What we are seeing is, of course, some warn, whispers in Israel's ear, please don't be as brutal as you expect it to be. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1067.62s)]
*  We mustn't have images like this on our television screen because it incites and it upsets our British population. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1077.2199999999998s)]
*  You can kill them slowly, but don't kill them en masse. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1085.1399999999999s)]
*  That seems to be the message. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1087.9399999999998s)]
*  Well, a chilling way to end there, but a brutally honest analysis of what is happening and what is happening. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1091.3799999999999s)]
*  What is likely to happen? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1097.54s)]
*  I said I really appreciate it. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1098.82s)]
*  One one, the incredible work, please, if people can look up one one and donate and support the work that I said in his team do, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1099.7s)]
*  I've seen what they do firsthand and it is incredible stuff. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1108.02s)]
*  So thank you. I said I really appreciate it. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1110.18s)]
*  And I know absolutely. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1111.46s)]
*  And I have to just end with saying one thing, you know, we were together during the anti-war movement, right? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1113.3s)]
*  And I think we stood at a moment in the war in Iraq where, you know, we tried to stop what it was. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1122.42s)]
*  We already knew was going to be an absolute catastrophe. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1129.14s)]
*  You know, ultimately a million people in Iraq paid for their lives and the utter destruction of much of the Middle East. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1131.78s)]
*  I think we're at the similar moment and it's only people acting in solidarity, raising their voice that changed the conversation this week. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1138.02s)]
*  We really need to be out on the streets. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1146.5s)]
*  People really need to be pushing their MPs. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1148.26s)]
*  We need to make our voices heard. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1150.58s)]
*  That's the critical thing. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1152.4199999999998s)]
*  That's the one thing that our Palestinian partners and everybody is saying on the ground. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1153.86s)]
*  Stop the war and the occupation. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1158.6599999999999s)]
*  We need people in the West to be pushed their government. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1160.8999999999999s)]
*  So please do anything that you can and hopefully see on the demonstration. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1163.3s)]
*  And a really, really critical point there. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1167.62s)]
*  And I mean, I want to keep trying to emphasize, which is those the architects of Iraq, of Afghanistan, two decades long occupation, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1169.3s)]
*  which led to the Taliban back stronger than ever. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1177.1399999999999s)]
*  Libya, those of us who opposed it were vilified at the time. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1179.46s)]
*  We were vilified. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1182.5800000000002s)]
*  We were called stooges of Saddam Hussein, the Taliban, all the rest of it. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1183.5400000000002s)]
*  And according to Brown University, a detailed study found that up to 4.7 million people died collectively in the post 9-11 wars. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1188.0200000000002s)]
*  And yet those responsible, their reputations apparently unvarnished, their careers continued, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1195.22s)]
*  and they walked from crime scene to crime scene, demanding yet more blood. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1200.98s)]
*  And that's what we're seeing here. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1205.14s)]
*  So please join us on the streets, 12 o'clock on Saturday in London or anywhere you are. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1206.58s)]
*  Please write to your MPs to put pressure on them. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1210.6599999999999s)]
*  And thank you for making that point. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1213.06s)]
*  Cheers, Asad, and I'll speak to you soon. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1214.4199999999998s)]
*  No problem. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1215.46s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1216.02s)]
*  Goodbye. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1216.5s)]
*  Oh, sorry, I let Brett Asad take over the show there. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1218.34s)]
*  Brilliant stuff always from Asad. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1220.26s)]
*  Later, we'll be joined by Dr. Nick Maynard, who is a surgeon who was in Gaza back in May, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1222.02s)]
*  who worked in Gaza, was caught up in the last bombing campaign. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1227.78s)]
*  He'll talk us through the humanitarian crisis there. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1230.58s)]
*  I'm really delighted to be joined by M. Hilton, who is a brilliant activist, for example, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1233.06s)]
*  a co-founder of NAMOD, which is a key part of the Jewish peace movement. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1237.54s)]
*  M is a Jewish peace activist here in Britain. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1244.4199999999998s)]
*  She also has family connections to Israel. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1246.74s)]
*  And firstly, thanks for joining us, M. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1250.34s)]
*  I know this is a hard time for you as well. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1251.54s)]
*  I mean, I think it's important to have your voice here, but it's not, I know, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1254.34s)]
*  easy to be talking about these things at this time. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1259.78s)]
*  One of the things I just wanted to ask you about, and thank you so much, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1262.74s)]
*  an honor to be here. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1265.54s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1266.42s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1266.74s)]
*  It's an honor. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1267.86s)]
*  The demonstration on Saturday, which I attended, and the likes of Zach Goldsmith, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1269.38s)]
*  who's a conservative MP, who by the way, ran a racist campaign against Sadiq Khan back in 2016, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1275.3s)]
*  an Islamophobic campaign, was outrageous, denounced essentially this demonstration as [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1280.5s)]
*  a bunch of anti-Semites who hate Jewish people. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1288.02s)]
*  And I know you responded to that. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1290.6599999999999s)]
*  So just be very interested from your perspective, given you spoke about it, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1292.6599999999999s)]
*  to talk us your response to that. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1295.78s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I attended the march. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1298.5s)]
*  I found it very moving and an important thing to do in an act of solidarity in this moment. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1300.6599999999999s)]
*  I think what we often see happens in particularly in when there are either attacks on Gaza or what's [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1305.3799999999999s)]
*  happened in the last week, you see this sort of conflation between Jews and Israel or Hamas [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1311.6999999999998s)]
*  and Palestinians, particularly by politicians who seem to be only pushing their own agendas [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1315.7s)]
*  and not actually having any particular care for anyone's life. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1321.46s)]
*  But obviously, there's been a real clear dehumanization of Palestinians in the press, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1327.06s)]
*  but also they're sort of using the Jewish community as cover for their own anti-Palestinian racism. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1330.9s)]
*  It's something that we've seen, particularly the Conservative Party do a lot. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1336.74s)]
*  And obviously, we've also seen that from other political parties in the last few days. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1340.5800000000002s)]
*  And it's very, very disappointing. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1344.8999999999999s)]
*  I think it's really important in this moment because also there are concerns amongst Jewish [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1346.34s)]
*  and Jewish community and Jewish people. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1352.02s)]
*  And there have been sort of some anti-Semitic attacks as well, but that we don't conflate [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1353.3799999999999s)]
*  the sort of movement for freedom for Palestinians, for equal rights and liberation for everyone [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1357.3799999999999s)]
*  with some sort of existential attack on Jewish people. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1362.1799999999998s)]
*  It's very dangerous to do that in this time, particularly because there are also a lot of [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1364.4199999999998s)]
*  Jewish people like myself, like many others, like many Israelis who are still in this moment [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1368.34s)]
*  really demanding a de-escalation, ceasefire, ending the siege on Gaza, freedom, equality, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1374.1s)]
*  democracy for everyone. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1379.9399999999998s)]
*  So to really see that sort of just be and sort of, and also the pain that I think that a lot [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1381.9399999999998s)]
*  of people are going through. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1385.86s)]
*  There's a real pain happening for Jewish people and Israelis and people who have a lot of [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1386.98s)]
*  connection to the horrible events in the South, for Palestinian folks and Muslim folks in the UK [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1392.1799999999998s)]
*  who also have connection to people in Gaza. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1397.4599999999998s)]
*  There's a lot of pain and seeing that being sort of instrumentalized for a very far right [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1399.1399999999999s)]
*  political agenda that's really about sort of shutting down these conversations, oh sorry, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1403.54s)]
*  shutting down public conversation around this issue is frankly appalling. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1407.06s)]
*  I mean on that, I mean, as you say, it's absolutely, it's very important to note that whenever [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1412.1s)]
*  we get these hideous examples of violence in the Middle East, you get a spike in anti-Semitic hate [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1416.6599999999999s)]
*  crimes here and you also, also Islamophobic hate crimes at the same time. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1422.1s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1425.86s)]
*  And there was a horrendous, you know, we cannot obviously downplay the impact of the atrocity [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1426.82s)]
*  committed by Hamas and the deaths of so many innocent civilians. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1434.02s)]
*  So I suppose what would be interesting is from your perspective as a Jewish peace [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1437.7s)]
*  activist, because you said it's so important that that trauma obviously isn't instrumentalized, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1441.7s)]
*  but that there has to be within those of us fighting for Palestinian solidarity and empathy [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1446.66s)]
*  and understanding. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1451.38s)]
*  So how is best, how do we best navigate that? [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1452.1s)]
*  Because we need to build obviously a peace movement, which includes, so centrally, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1454.74s)]
*  Jewish activists such as yourself. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1460.26s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great question and I won't contend I have all the answers, but I do think for me, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1463.6200000000001s)]
*  my sort of Jewish liturgy and my Jewish heritage talks to me about the sort of sanctity of human [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1467.7s)]
*  life, that's El Ameliehim, we're all made in God's image, it's really important that those [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1473.3s)]
*  values are extended to all people, you know, including Palestinians and that sort of Jewish [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1477.38s)]
*  liberation, Palestinian freedom is not a threat to Jewish safety, it's not a threat to Jewish [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1482.58s)]
*  liberation. We need to come back to these core values, you know, I think we see in this moment, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1486.82s)]
*  you know, we see that in Israel itself, we see sort of the relatives of people who either were [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1493.7s)]
*  killed or taken hostage, still demanding a de-escalation or a ceasefire, demanding that [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1498.9s)]
*  Gaza is free, that Palestinians deserve equal rights to everyone and we need to learn from that [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1504.82s)]
*  courage to be able to do that and really to be able to, excuse me, sorry, to be able to learn [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1509.06s)]
*  from them and actually take that to our own sort of demonstrations and activism here too, you know, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1516.5s)]
*  I think in these moments, it could be very easy to become sort of very much back into sort of [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1521.86s)]
*  taking a side and actually the side is sort of shared humanity and democracy for everyone [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1525.54s)]
*  and freedom for everyone and that's really important and that is not to equivocate or [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1529.62s)]
*  equalise between, you know, I'm also very aware through my work that this is not an issue that [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1535.14s)]
*  started on October 7th, this is a, you know, we have to look at the broader context in which we [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1540.98s)]
*  are working in in this moment but for me then it's like, you know, these are the people that [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1545.7s)]
*  I learn from and those are the people I want to be in movement with. And I was interested just in [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1549.5400000000002s)]
*  terms of what sorts of discussions are going on, you know, because you've got perspectives as a [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1554.3400000000001s)]
*  Jewish Brit but also connections in Israel, what are the sorts of discussions that you think are [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1558.26s)]
*  really interesting at the moment going on within the Jewish peace movement here and also the [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1564.1000000000001s)]
*  Israeli peace movement that might give some heart? I think, well, I think the first thing is that [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1568.74s)]
*  what we are seeing is a real sort of horror and sort of trying to hold grief and trying to hold [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1575.54s)]
*  like a sadness of what happened in the south of Israel but also not wanting that grief to be used [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1581.94s)]
*  as ammunition for sort of war crimes against people in Gaza, that is incredibly important [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1587.54s)]
*  to say number one. I think that is really the sense that we really do have to mobilize in [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1592.9s)]
*  this moment to stop any more sort of atrocities taking place and that it feels like something [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1597.46s)]
*  that really speaks to the work that we are all doing. I think there's deep distress and [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1602.42s)]
*  uncertainty that happens but I think I know from speaking to Israeli friends and sort of the sort [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1607.94s)]
*  of progressive leftist circles there that there's also concerns about crackdowns on protests against [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1613.22s)]
*  the war and people sort of being monitored by the state and this is being really, really concerning [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1618.1s)]
*  for folks. So I think really it's about how do we move forward in a way that sort of should hold [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1622.58s)]
*  our commitment to Palestinian solidarity and also in terms of sort of saying that we need, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1628.74s)]
*  there is no military solution here, like there's only a political solution and that political [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1633.86s)]
*  solution has to reflect and uphold the dignity and humanity and quality for all people between [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1638.34s)]
*  the river and the sea and that we need Israel to stop bombing Gaza. That is just very clearly [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1643.78s)]
*  clear what needs to happen. I think that there is, yeah sorry, I basically think that is absolutely crucial. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1649.3s)]
*  I mean I'm just wondering in terms of, I mean over in Israel I know there was a [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1657.62s)]
*  leftist journalist who was basically hounded in the streets by extreme supporters of what's [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1661.3799999999999s)]
*  happening obviously in Gaza. I mean it's very, in terms of that atmosphere, I mean do you see [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1669.9399999999998s)]
*  hope as this war goes on? Because at the moment that trauma is obviously you know being used by [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1674.8999999999999s)]
*  the government in a certain direction. Do you see any hope in terms of given that atmosphere, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1679.3799999999999s)]
*  just how hard it is including actually threats to people's safety when they speak out for peace? [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1684.1799999999998s)]
*  I mean I think it's a, you know I think no one was under any illusions as to what this government [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1692.26s)]
*  was and the kind of sentiment that existed. Wait like before this everything broke out on [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1697.14s)]
*  Saturday, like I think that this is something that is reflective of a deep sort of far-right [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1702.18s)]
*  authoritarian and fascist supremacist state that is not surprising. I think it's been very hard [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1706.0200000000002s)]
*  for a long time to be like leftist anti-occupation anti-apartheid activists in Israel and obviously [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1710.5800000000002s)]
*  again it's not to equate or compare but I think it is something that I think is very concerning [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1718.18s)]
*  and thinking about how to move forward, how to support people in the south as well, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1722.98s)]
*  I mean people in Israel as well is really crucial for I think these connections but also from [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1728.58s)]
*  my perspective it's also about sort of building Jewish-Palestinian solidarity in this moment too [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1733.7s)]
*  and I think really demonstrating that is fundamental to sort of more long-term political change. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1738.02s)]
*  But yeah I think it is, I don't know if hope is the right word, I think it's just that we have to, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1744.9s)]
*  I mean I think the idea of hope as a discipline is really crucial in these moments, hope has to be [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1750.02s)]
*  something that we hold even in times of great distress and difficulty and that's sort of what's [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1754.26s)]
*  getting me through in this moment but you know I really hope that you know yeah as I said like [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1758.34s)]
*  turning out on Saturday, turning out to the work that Jewish progressives are doing to sort of [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1765.3s)]
*  draw attention to this as well, you know that's you know praying with our feet as Ramo Herschel says, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1771.46s)]
*  like that's what we have to be doing in this moment. Emma it's a real pleasure as ever, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1776.74s)]
*  we've obviously interviewed you about this before but honestly you always give me hope so that's [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1780.74s)]
*  good and I look forward to seeing you soon and I'll be there on Saturday and obviously keep [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1785.94s)]
*  emphasising the need for people to mobilise this Saturday. If you're in London obviously there [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1790.1s)]
*  were other demonstrations elsewhere and I know there were lots of you listening or watching this [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1794.74s)]
*  from abroad but yes to the streets. All right Emma lots of love, take care, speak to you soon. Thank you so much, thank you, bye. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1798.5s)]
*  Don't forget to hit like and to share the video as ever whether you're watching live or not and to [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1804.5s)]
*  subscribe of course. I want to bring in straight away now Dr Nick Maynard who's a consultant surgeon [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1810.66s)]
*  and who was in Gaza in May, you were there during the last bombing campaign, can you just tell us a [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1815.38s)]
*  bit more about that? So how long were you in Gaza and what you were doing in the hospital for how [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1821.62s)]
*  long that kind of thing? Yeah by the way thank you so much for joining us, big honour I should have said. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1826.98s)]
*  Well no thank you for inviting me, it's a great pleasure to be here and as I said my daughter's [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1831.78s)]
*  delighted I'm here as well. So I've been going to Gaza for many years initially teaching medical [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1836.18s)]
*  students and junior doctors and latterly working with Medical Aid for Palestinians, a wonderful UK [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1843.46s)]
*  based charity that supports healthcare and takes many UK medics and nurses out there to help in the [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1848.82s)]
*  healthcare system. So I was out there in May with a colleague of mine from London and we were there [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1857.3s)]
*  to operate for a few days and my specialty is cancer of the upper gastrointestinal tract so [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1863.54s)]
*  we were there to help develop stomach cancer services and this was a week of operating we'd [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1871.22s)]
*  had arranged. We saw patients on the first day, we worked with our friends in [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1878.26s)]
*  Shefa Hospital there and the European hospitals to decide which patients we could operate on and [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1884.58s)]
*  we'd planned a whole week of operating. We did one day of surgery all day and then at three in the [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1890.1799999999998s)]
*  morning that night a huge bombing campaign started which of course everyone knew about over here [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1896.4199999999998s)]
*  and then the borders were closed immediately by the Israelis so we were not able to get out. The [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1904.02s)]
*  country went into lockdown, we were confined to the hotel, we weren't allowed to do any of the [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1910.1s)]
*  operations that we'd planned because there were so many trauma victims coming in and we were eventually [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1914.98s)]
*  evacuated about four days later by the United Nations. Blimey. In terms of just the hospital [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1920.4199999999998s)]
*  system, the healthcare system in Gaza, could you just talk through before obviously this [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1928.26s)]
*  terrible onslaught and because obviously Gaza has been under a what 15, 16 year blockade, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1934.1000000000001s)]
*  in terms of the reality of that healthcare system, in terms of how it's resourced, equipped [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1939.5400000000002s)]
*  to deal with, I mean I was reading for example now there are 50,000 pregnant girls and women, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1944.18s)]
*  I mean it's just aspects like that, I mean how, you know, what was it like in that healthcare [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1947.7s)]
*  system in terms of meeting the basic needs of Gaza under those conditions let alone these? [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1954.18s)]
*  So under stress the whole time, I mean you brought up the issue of the [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1958.5s)]
*  50,000 pregnant women, two of my colleagues in Oxford who come out to Gaza with me a lot are [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1962.1000000000001s)]
*  terribly concerned about that, they're in touch with obstetricians over there and the [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1967.3s)]
*  potential disasters for many of those pregnant women in the next few weeks is huge. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1973.22s)]
*  The healthcare system there, well it's staffed by magnificent people, I mean really talented surgeons, [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1981.14s)]
*  I've worked with nurses, other healthcare workers, so the quality is huge but the [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1987.14s)]
*  resources are very limited. They do rely on donations from a lot of countries which are [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1992.42s)]
*  very generous but it's never enough of course. Electricity is often very short in short supply, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=1998.5800000000002s)]
*  I mean this week of course there's no electricity, the generators have just about run out this [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2005.7800000000002s)]
*  afternoon at Sheefer Hospital and there is therefore no way of running any equipments [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2011.38s)]
*  that rely on power, so no ventilators can work, the operating theatres won't be usable. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2017.3000000000002s)]
*  So even outside periods like this they are under huge stress with limited resources but they [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2024.2600000000002s)]
*  they do produce and work some remarkable [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2032.02s)]
*  deeds with patients despite the lack of resources. They often get paid for sometimes six months at a [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2038.1799999999998s)]
*  time but they're still in there day in day out working hard. In terms of now, I'm sure you're [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2044.26s)]
*  hearing on the ground what's happening in terms of the healthcare system but what impact is this [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2051.7s)]
*  going to have? I mean I mentioned 50,000 pregnant women, that's just one facet. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2056.9s)]
*  Yeah. You know people with cancer, people with serious illnesses let alone those now being [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2060.34s)]
*  severely injured by by airstrikes. I mean what? So one of the reasons that people like me go out [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2064.9s)]
*  there and why Matt take out there as teams is to help them treat some of the illnesses they [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2072.02s)]
*  otherwise cannot treat. There are some patients who are allowed out to go to the West Bank for [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2077.06s)]
*  treatment or occasionally into Israel but they are in the grand scheme of things a very small [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2083.38s)]
*  percentage. So most patients with diseases that cannot be treated in Gaza will not be treated and [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2088.02s)]
*  will die. So one of the things we do is we're desperately keen to teach and help them develop [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2093.62s)]
*  their own services so they can treat those patients and without that help then they will be [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2101.06s)]
*  unable to treat many many patients. I mean in terms of I mean we've been looking now at a bombing [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2108.34s)]
*  campaign, we don't know how long that will go on. I mean if there's an invasion I just don't see how [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2115.7000000000003s)]
*  a healthcare system operates at all. I mean it's in a state of near collapse at the moment. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2121.38s)]
*  There as I said earlier they've the generators, I mean the generators ran out at Shefa Hospital [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2129.3s)]
*  last night. I was speaking to two friends and colleagues this morning. They did manage to find [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2135.54s)]
*  some fuel so they got them up working again but he said they were going to run out this afternoon [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2140.2599999999998s)]
*  sometime. So you can't do anything without any without energy like that. There are patients [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2145.06s)]
*  lying in the corridors, there's patients lying on the floor of the wards, their recovery areas are [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2152.2599999999998s)]
*  full of patients awaiting surgery. They've almost run out of blood products. They've certainly ran [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2157.06s)]
*  out of surgical gloves so they have to wash the gloves between operations. They've run out of drugs. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2163.46s)]
*  So as we talk now it's about to collapse. Once the fuel has run out which is imminent [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2169.7s)]
*  it will collapse and if there is a ground invasion it is... I dread to think what will happen. I mean [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2178.58s)]
*  it'll lead... I mean we've seen well over 3 000 deaths so far. I hate to think what would happen [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2185.38s)]
*  then. The other thing I'd like to say Owen is that the people in the north of Gaza have all [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2190.18s)]
*  been asked to evacuate to the south of Gaza so that in preparation for the ground invasion and of [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2197.7799999999997s)]
*  course that is for the healthcare work of the patients that is absolutely impossible. All the [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2203.62s)]
*  roads surrounding Shefa Hospital and other hospitals have been bombed so this idea that you can transport [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2209.7799999999997s)]
*  patients out down to the south of Gaza is a ludicrous idea in my view. The healthcare [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2216.5s)]
*  workers, the doctors and nurses won't leave. They refuse to leave. They're patients. They will stay [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2223.38s)]
*  and carry on treating them and many of them have said to me and my colleagues we know this means [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2228.66s)]
*  we may die but we will not leave. We will stay with our patients. So I am horrified by what might [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2233.7s)]
*  happen in the next few days. And regardless of what we know about the hospital yesterday we know [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2241.38s)]
*  hospitals have been attacked by Israel and also medics killed and the incredible courage you've [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2246.58s)]
*  just noted there of medics who've put the safety of their patients first often risking their lives [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2252.1800000000003s)]
*  to do so. I mean I suppose just the other thing I wanted to talk to you about is... I mean this is [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2259.2200000000003s)]
*  all of this is macabre if I'm honest but I was just referring earlier to a study by Brown [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2265.38s)]
*  University which looked at the death toll of the post-911 wars and there's this horrible clinical [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2271.06s)]
*  word which is excess deaths and the reason I mention excess deaths is we're looking now [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2276.98s)]
*  at for example the direct deaths from airstrikes but the reality is isn't it that actually it may [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2282.02s)]
*  well be that the biggest killer isn't directly from missiles for example it's things like lack [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2287.94s)]
*  of clean water, lack of food, lack of medical care for people in you know whether they be pregnant [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2293.7s)]
*  or have serious conditions that's the danger isn't it that's that's you know something which [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2300.18s)]
*  gets missing just because we're looking at that direct death toll. It's macabre conversation as [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2304.58s)]
*  this is. Absolutely this is a terrifically important point and and and of course the [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2308.18s)]
*  I spoke to people today who a psychologist and his sister I know who run a wonderful centre to [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2314.8999999999996s)]
*  support children who've been mentally traumatized by war and they are now they have no clean water [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2321.2999999999997s)]
*  they're drinking filthy water and they are getting ill from it and you're absolutely right I think [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2326.9s)]
*  the real dread now is quite apart from the trauma victims is the the risk of huge spread of infectious [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2333.86s)]
*  diseases to name just one thing which has the potential for killing many many people in the [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2342.1800000000003s)]
*  next few weeks and months and of course there's all the other conditions the long-term conditions [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2347.94s)]
*  that patients have diabetes which won't be treated because there's no drugs and [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2352.34s)]
*  all the drugs are running out heart disease cancer patients who won't be diagnosed so [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2356.6600000000003s)]
*  you're absolutely right I mean the death toll will be will be far greater in months to come [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2361.5400000000004s)]
*  but for those for those very reasons. Nick I really appreciate you joining us [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2367.3s)]
*  and I know you're doing lots of media at the moment and it's very important that we hear your [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2373.3s)]
*  voice shocking stuff I have to say but I think so important to hear the gravity of the situation [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2377.06s)]
*  not least because it'll encourage people hopefully to take the sorts of action to stop this entirely [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2382.2599999999998s)]
*  unnecessary humanitarian catastrophe unfolding so thank you I mean all of your work obviously [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2388.2599999999998s)]
*  Nick and you know the work that you've done in Gaza and the courageous medics currently on the [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2392.66s)]
*  ground risking their lives in a truly hideous hellish situation so thank you so much Nick [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2396.98s)]
*  really appreciate it but just finally if there's anything you'd like to ask people to do [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2402.42s)]
*  yeah okay thank you yeah I mean I'd like to say one more thing so there is talk of aid coming [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2406.3399999999997s)]
*  in through the RAFA crossing which of course will be welcomed and that is in many ways being [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2412.58s)]
*  peddled in international media as the big solution to sort out the humanitarian crisis and [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2418.42s)]
*  everyone welcomes that but it will be inadequate by itself that the note there's no way that you [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2424.58s)]
*  can get enough aid in through RAFA to to sort this problem out the only way to get enough aid in [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2430.3399999999997s)]
*  is for there to be a ceasefire for the siege to be lifted and for aid to come in through the [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2436.02s)]
*  Israeli borders and I can see no other solution to it on that so I would plead with people to [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2442.1s)]
*  put pressure on governments to put pressure on the Israeli government to to lift the siege [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2449.38s)]
*  I rely heavily on medical aid for Palestine Palestinians which is a wonderful UK-based charity [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2455.14s)]
*  and they are poised ready to take aid in ready to take doctors and nurses who want to go and help [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2462.58s)]
*  and they need ever more funding so please go and donate to that wonderful charity yeah I'll be [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2469.14s)]
*  doing a fundraiser actually using this channel to support medical aid to Palestine so I'm glad you've [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2474.18s)]
*  glad you've raised that so I'll be doing that though people just look up medical aid for [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2478.98s)]
*  Palestinians and you'll very very quickly find out how to donate but also use righttotheem.com [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2483.14s)]
*  which is how you can contact your MP it will take you three minutes to do that type in your [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2488.8199999999997s)]
*  postcode so I'm a cat attacking me there type in your postcode and it will find your MP for you [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2493.7799999999997s)]
*  and you just type into the box and just ask them particularly I would say for the Labour MPs but [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2498.4199999999996s)]
*  not exclusively because we have had do actually have one one conservative MP is actually speaking [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2504.58s)]
*  out like more loudly than most at the moment crispy and blunt but yes everyone should do their best [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2509.8599999999997s)]
*  to put pressure on thank you so much Nick honestly really really appreciate and [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2513.86s)]
*  solidarity thank you very much for inviting me take care buddy take care bye great stuff [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2518.26s)]
*  moving stuff and horrifying stuff at the same time now as I said we'll be doing interviews with [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2524.26s)]
*  these sorts of crucial voices right now and I'm going to do for example I want to do a video to [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2530.6600000000003s)]
*  encourage people to donate to medical aid to for Palestinians and tomorrow I'll be interviewing [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2538.5s)]
*  Labour councillors who resigned from the Labour Party in protest that the Labour Party support [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2543.22s)]
*  for war crimes and their failure to put pressure on the British government and there's a few more [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2546.74s)]
*  things I want to say before signing off by the way and and in fact I've got some clips as well [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2551.54s)]
*  just to kind of flesh that out I suppose I mean in terms of a political establishment I do want to [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2557.86s)]
*  just make a just a quick note of deep admiration for Hanzo Youssef who's the [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2563.22s)]
*  Scottish First Minister the leader of the Scottish National Party of course [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2571.4599999999996s)]
*  and he has family trouts in Gaza and and he's showing incredible leadership must be you know [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2574.8199999999997s)]
*  the fact that his his wife's parents are trapped in Gaza his wife's brother is a doctor there [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2581.22s)]
*  I just want to just share a clip and I just want to say this is this is genuine leadership [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2590.5s)]
*  What we can't do is justify the collective punishment of 2.2 million people the vast [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2594.82s)]
*  overwhelming majority of whom have nothing to do with Hamas and that's why I've been calling for [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2600.82s)]
*  over a week now for a humanitarian corridor to be opened supplies to be let in people who want to [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2606.42s)]
*  leave to leave and of course a ceasefire absolutely crucial stuff there of course [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2612.42s)]
*  particularly there the call for ceasefire now Jordan called off its meeting with the US president [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2619.3s)]
*  and many have protested about this on the basis that that was designed to deal with the humanitarian [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2628.02s)]
*  crisis in Gaza but the truth is there is no lasting there's no meaningful solution to the [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2632.6600000000003s)]
*  end of the humanitarian crisis unless the siege ends and there's a ceasefire I mean everything [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2636.98s)]
*  else is simply trying to soften a catastrophe and it's just papering around the edges it's you know [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2641.7000000000003s)]
*  the fact is if you're preventing water and crucial services and goods food and from getting into Gaza [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2648.82s)]
*  whilst you were lobbying huge numbers of rockets and bombs sorry missiles at a dense one of the [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2656.82s)]
*  most densely populated places on earth then whatever you do in terms of getting in humanitarian aid [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2663.6200000000003s)]
*  there's going to be humanitarian catastrophe I think that's just so important that we emphasize [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2670.5s)]
*  because so many people are going to keep saying well you know this is how we get human we need to [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2674.1s)]
*  get aid and all the rest obviously we need to get aid in but that context cannot be forgotten [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2678.42s)]
*  now in contrast to that I would say add more political leadership by someone who's under a [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2683.14s)]
*  huge amount of stress and here's a clip from Lisa Nandi who was recently demoted by care [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2686.74s)]
*  I'll come on to that by Keir Starmer and to now be the spokesperson for international development [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2693.06s)]
*  let's just hear from her but we also met with the aid agencies who were working on the ground [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2698.66s)]
*  who were talking to us about their playing as messages from people who were in Gaza hospital [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2702.58s)]
*  doctors talking about having to power down for lack of fuel turning off the incubators of newborn [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2708.1s)]
*  babies and it's it's a very very painful time for a lot of people in this country and it's hard to [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2713.62s)]
*  see through that at the moment to see what the solution is but I think it is right that we are [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2721.22s)]
*  all clear and have consistently been clear as Keir has from the day that this atrocity was [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2726.98s)]
*  committed against Israel that international law must apply I'm not going to be gaslit like that [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2732.5s)]
*  not going to be gaslit by that um that's not what happened Keir Starmer said that he supported [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2739.54s)]
*  Israel's right to cut off water and energy to a civilian population he then went on to say [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2744.5s)]
*  that Israel's response must be consistent with international law but that is a contradiction in [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2750.34s)]
*  terms because if you back a siege collective punishment that's against the Geneva conventions [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2754.26s)]
*  now Keir Starmer is a human rights lawyer it's kind of how he sold himself in his leadership [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2759.0600000000004s)]
*  campaign when he lied for his teeth in order to become leader of the labor party he knows what [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2763.46s)]
*  international law is so he clearly supported the violation of international law Emily Thornberry [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2767.3s)]
*  also a lawyer again no excuses there Shadow Attorney General quite literally their top lawyer [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2772.5s)]
*  also refused the national television to oppose the siege on Gaza and then David Lammy the foreign [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2778.34s)]
*  secretary when he was asked about the forcible removal of the civilian population described by [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2784.34s)]
*  the United Nations in multiple charities and lawyers as a war crime refused to condemn that [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2789.78s)]
*  as well very clearly hold these people to account now counselors across the country have been [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2796.02s)]
*  resigning that has been putting pressure on the labor leadership who had to have an emergency [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2801.0600000000004s)]
*  meeting with the heads of local government not least after they banned people from counselors [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2805.46s)]
*  and MPs from attending demonstrations against this war crime and it's so important we talk about this [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2812.58s)]
*  and it's humiliating for Lisa Nandi because she was demoted by Keir Starmer who briefed against [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2817.46s)]
*  her saying that his aides briefed the media that he told her that he didn't even really [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2824.42s)]
*  want her to stay in government on the on the front benches sorry in opposition I mean why offer [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2831.94s)]
*  these deceptive statements on behalf of someone who's humiliated you like this it's just absolutely [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2839.3s)]
*  ludicrous now I think it's just important that we make these points because we need to say exactly [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2845.3s)]
*  what is happening on the ground in terms of what's happening in the region obviously there's huge [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2849.54s)]
*  anger and fury and it's so important we and I will be interviewing people from around the Middle East [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2856.5s)]
*  about this in the coming days I think this clip just demonstrates the level of anger you see there's [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2861.3s)]
*  a lot of tear gas and it's quite difficult to breathe here it gets in your eyes as well but [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2865.38s)]
*  fuck you America the reaction you'll forgive the language there as well I think I think you can [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2872.02s)]
*  understand why he's angry can't you and that context of course of the fact that the US has [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2879.46s)]
*  unstintingly backed Israel as it has deprived the Palestinians of their right to self-determination [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2884.9s)]
*  and opposed the system of apartheid as defined by Amnesty International Human Rights Watch and the [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2893.54s)]
*  Israeli Human Rights Organization of Bezalem and the longest modern occupation of our time [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2898.02s)]
*  and that this year alone 248 Palestinian civilians and 40 children were killed before the atrocity [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2904.5800000000004s)]
*  committed by Hamas 96 percent of deaths in the last 15 years before last Saturday were Palestinian [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2911.54s)]
*  and you know that that Gaza has been under a devastating siege for the last 16 years [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2918.74s)]
*  15 16 years context is important people in the Middle East know that context and that's why [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2926.34s)]
*  they're angry and that's why this risks spiraling it risks spiraling out of control I think it's [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2931.06s)]
*  important to talk about that just before I end I'll be on Good Morning Britain this week at 6 30 [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2935.94s)]
*  a.m Thursday and Friday obviously we'll be talking about that and I will there use my platform as [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2942.82s)]
*  best I can as I did on Sky News and the Jeremy Vine show to obviously use my platform as I've [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2947.94s)]
*  tried to do throughout this to oppose what's happened there's something I do want to respond [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2955.86s)]
*  to quickly as well because it went viral on Twitter ever since this devastating horror show [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2960.1s)]
*  began I've been bombarded with hundreds if not more of messages often in quite explicit [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2969.62s)]
*  and pornographic terms fantasizing about what they think would happen to me as a gay man if I went to [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2978.5s)]
*  Hamas and on the grounds of trying to you know taunt the idea that I would stand in solidarity [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2983.3s)]
*  with the people of Palestine as they face utter utter devastation that includes AI generated images [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2991.3s)]
*  of me being thrown off buildings now I'm not saying this to claim victimhood very important I [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=2998.42s)]
*  make that point not victim kind of used to this sort of nonsense if I'm honest it is obviously a [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3002.42s)]
*  form of attempted psychological warfare going on at the moment against anyone using their platform [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3009.22s)]
*  to stand with the people of Palestine I say it's I think coordinated if I look through my Instagram [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3014.1s)]
*  dms I keep getting almost the same message relating to how I'll be tortured and murdered [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3018.2599999999998s)]
*  often in graphic detail by people from Israel if I go to Gaza now I responded to this and the reason [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3022.8199999999997s)]
*  I responded to this is truth matters in times like this which is firstly if you want to talk about [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3028.02s)]
*  the plight of gay people in Gaza facts do matter it's bad enough on its own terms if you want to [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3034.26s)]
*  go there there isn't the death penalty for homosexuality in Gaza there is a prison sentence [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3039.54s)]
*  of up to 10 years now Hamas obviously clearly are happy to enforce that nobody suggests Hamas would [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3044.1s)]
*  ever support gay rights I noticed that it's a law which was introduced by the British Empire [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3050.5s)]
*  in 1936 didn't say that was the cause of Hamas's homophobic position but the point I wanted to make [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3055.78s)]
*  is absolutely is just really critical and it's about pink washing because I've interviewed for [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3062.42s)]
*  example a queer Palestinian about this and I've been bombarded with messages from queer Palestinians [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3067.38s)]
*  who are passionately opposed to this barbaric and brutal assault on Gaza and that is you must [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3074.1800000000003s)]
*  never allow the oppression of your own minority and community in order to justify mass catastrophic [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3081.46s)]
*  suffering the biggest threat as things stand to LGBTQ people in Gaza is the fact that Israel is [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3088.42s)]
*  trying to wipe Gaza off the map statistically speaking if three percent of Gaza are LGBTQ that [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3096.7400000000002s)]
*  means a hundred if not more LGBTQ Gazans have died in the last few days as well as those who have been [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3102.82s)]
*  named as well as those who have been traumatized as well as those who have lost their relatives [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3110.7400000000002s)]
*  a precondition that any LGBTQ person in order to love is to be alive and they are being deprived of [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3116.58s)]
*  that basic right you do not show solidarity with the people enduring horror at the behest partly of [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3123.38s)]
*  your own government you do not use that in order to justify suffering inflicted in that way and [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3132.66s)]
*  Gaza being wiped off the map with huge numbers of people dead including LGBTQ people is obviously [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3139.14s)]
*  not going to advance the cause of LGBTQ rights and it would be monstrous to suggest that is the case [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3145.38s)]
*  when it was the case of the Yazidi people who faced a mass atrocity against them we didn't say [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3153.62s)]
*  well actually I'm not going to show solidarity to them because they practice child marriage [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3160.02s)]
*  and marry off 12 year old girls nobody said that because it would be a grotesque misuse of [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3164.42s)]
*  human rights to stand aside as people are slaughtered on mass so it's very clear that [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3171.38s)]
*  is a disgusting and abhorrent attempt going on by people who do not care about LGBTQ rights [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3177.54s)]
*  at all who are trying to use appropriate the suffering of a particular minority to justify [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3183.94s)]
*  mass slaughter including members of that particular minority and it's so important to talk about that [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3191.1400000000003s)]
*  and people are always not you're blaming the British Empire for what Hamas did no I'm simply [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3196.66s)]
*  saying facts matter because people keep sending me by the way as well as AI generated images of [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3201.62s)]
*  me being thrown off buildings they keep throwing me over and over again images of gay men being [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3206.58s)]
*  thrown off buildings by ISIS in Syria okay it's bad enough in its own terms obviously I don't want [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3211.46s)]
*  gay men to be criminalized in Gaza okay but the prison sentences which exist to get that that gay [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3217.14s)]
*  men can suffer in Gaza is not a justification for what's going on just wanting to make that [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3225.78s)]
*  point absolutely clear as I've said tomorrow we'll be doing interviews with the Labour Council a [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3231.3s)]
*  couple of Labour Councils brilliant Labour Councillors who've resigned including Councillor [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3236.9s)]
*  Shaisa Aziz from Oxford who I actually worked with with Asad Raymond our first guest we helped [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3241.0600000000004s)]
*  organize the mass protest against Donald Trump a few years ago she's brilliant amazing person I'll [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3246.5800000000004s)]
*  be joined by her and another Councillor as well just quickly in terms of Superchats and Citizen of [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3253.06s)]
*  Nowhere thank you for your support Alison Morris you're keeping the show on the road we're doing [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3258.82s)]
*  all our best working a lot to try and get obviously the best interviewees to do our research [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3264.34s)]
*  and it is obviously taking a lot of time but we're doing it for the right reasons [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3270.98s)]
*  rambling tag admire your reporting Owen be careful out there well I mean you know like you know [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3275.62s)]
*  obviously you know it's the people of Gaza we need to be thinking of right now in terms of [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3281.54s)]
*  what people are going through and they're suffering David Bratt a grim question but [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3285.94s)]
*  no water food or supplies how long can they last it sounds like a holiday more well it's just a [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3289.38s)]
*  crucial point isn't it that you know we are focusing understandably on the missile strikes [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3292.74s)]
*  and the impact that has but we need to be talking about the collapse of the healthcare system the [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3297.62s)]
*  lack of water food the lack of the necessities for existence that's what's going to kill [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3302.18s)]
*  probably significantly more than a kill by missiles we need to be very very clear about [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3308.9s)]
*  that we talk about this slide tendency team 87 thank you Owen from America thank you too [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3313.3s)]
*  and it's so important that we build solidarity between those in the US and here because the US [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3317.94s)]
*  and Britain our governments are so complicit in in what is actually happening Dave Bratt how [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3325.7000000000003s)]
*  likely is this the damage care enough to get him out man has no more compass well look I mean [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3330.26s)]
*  you know you know the guy's likely to lead labor to the next general election I've always said [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3335.3s)]
*  myself I don't think someone whose career essentially is built on so much and and his [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3340.1800000000003s)]
*  leadership is based on so much deception warmth and deception I mean one of his pledges was to [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3346.02s)]
*  put human rights at the center of everything labor did in its foreign policy and to oppose legal [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3349.86s)]
*  wars I mean it's just a joke it's ridiculous and it's gaslighting suggests otherwise I think in the [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3356.02s)]
*  long term that will always be the undoing of him I think dishonesty on that scale is is is a fatal [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3362.5s)]
*  foundation and as I said you can join me on Good Morning Britain on ITV at 6 30 a.m. on Thursday [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTkdT2s8Dd4&t=3367.78s)]
