# Israeli ROGUE STATE attacks IRAN
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg)
*  Israel launching a war of aggression against Iran while simultaneously committing a live [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=0.0s)]
*  stream genocide underlines once again that this is a rogue state which the West will [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  allow to get away with absolutely everything. Now it is all too rare that I get an opportunity [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  to talk about, expose, Israel's genocidal behaviour on national television. Because [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=15.18s)]
*  of Israel's sudden attack on Iran, I was able to do so. Before we discuss this further, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=20.56s)]
*  here's what I said. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=27.0s)]
*  Owen, you go first on this. What's going on? Because even Trump said, please don't do this. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=28.16s)]
*  I'm sorry to say this, but I think it's absurd we never discussed this on this programme, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=32.08s)]
*  Israel and Palestine. There's a Western ally committing genocide in full view of the world. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=35.88s)]
*  And the last time this was discussed when I was on this programme was November 2023. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=40.04s)]
*  Like, it's ridiculous. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=43.56s)]
*  We discuss it a lot actually, but... [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=44.56s)]
*  Well, not when I'm on. And I've been on so many times since then. It's ridiculous the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=46.16s)]
*  way the British media has reported on this travesty. On the issue here, Israel is a nuclear [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=50.16s)]
*  armed state, which is allowed to have these nuclear weapons, despite being a state which [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=56.0s)]
*  is committing genocide in full view of the world. It's wiped Gaza from the face of the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  earth, is committing a pogrom against the Palestinians in the West Bank. It has invaded [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=65.32s)]
*  Syria and it has raised much of southern Lebanon off the face of the earth. In this particular [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=70.2s)]
*  case, under international law, you cannot launch a war of aggression, which is what [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=77.8s)]
*  this is under international law, without any provocation. You cannot do that. You cannot [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=82.72s)]
*  say, we think they might attack us in the future. You can't do that. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=87.72s)]
*  But they have done it and they've done all the other stuff you mentioned, although I [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=91.36s)]
*  might phrase it differently. So whatever they're doing, they're doing. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=96.2s)]
*  But this is the point, isn't it? Israel has impunity. Israel has been told by the Western [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=100.12s)]
*  states in essence, you can get away with anything. And that's the consequences. Look, the fact [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=105.68s)]
*  that Israel repeatedly invading Syria is not even judged to be newsworthy is itself telling. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  Israel can behave in ways that other states simply can't get away with. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=118.8s)]
*  Esther, what do you think? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=122.52s)]
*  You know, the fact we have a state, which is nuclear armed, by the way. I mean, Israel [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=123.52s)]
*  should not have nuclear weapons. But, you know, imagine another state bombed Israel [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=127.36s)]
*  to take out their nuclear weapons. That would be regarded as an absolute outrage. It has [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=131.72s)]
*  committed every possible war crime under the sun. Mass extermination of potentially [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=136.76s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of people at this point. Torture destroyed almost everything, all civilian [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=141.84s)]
*  infrastructure. We talk about nuclear bombs. They've detonated the equivalent of several [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=146.16s)]
*  nuclear bombs over Gaza in terms of explosive power. And the world has been told that if [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=150.16s)]
*  you are Arab or if you're Iranian, your lives do not matter. They don't matter. I mean, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=156.35999999999999s)]
*  that is the lesson that has been taught. And that Israel is a state which can break international [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=162.16s)]
*  law. It can just violate them willy nilly. And we are arming it. Our government is arming [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=167.84s)]
*  this country. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=172.72s)]
*  And we do talk about it on this show. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=173.72s)]
*  Well, not when I'm there then. Why not? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=174.72s)]
*  Well, you just literally finished talking about it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=176.72s)]
*  Well, I just said the last time I spoke about it on this show was November 2023. To be honest, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=178.28s)]
*  since Israel's genocide of the Palestinian people began, the Jeremy Vine show, whose [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=183.44s)]
*  team I have to say I like very much is one of the only shows who still let me go on television [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=187.76s)]
*  at all. I'm afraid at last this does go with the territory. Now Israel has stated that [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=192.88s)]
*  this is the beginning of a two week onslaught against Iran. The justification used by Israel, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=197.76s)]
*  it must be emphasized, is illegal. As the public law professor Adil Haq put it, the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=202.16s)]
*  right of self-defense must not be expanded to license the use of force to eliminate possible [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=206.68s)]
*  That was Russia's justification for invading Ukraine. It is incompatible with the UN Charter [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=212.64s)]
*  and eviscerates the prohibition of aggression. He wrote that in response to French President [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=218.83999999999997s)]
*  Emmanuel Macron backing Israel's onslaught, because the West has shown it is very happy [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=223.55999999999997s)]
*  indeed, to destroy what remains of the so-called international order to protect Israel as it [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=227.92s)]
*  commits genocide and every possible crime in the book. No Western leaders will loudly [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  cry that Israel has the right to self-defense. What is the legal basis then for saying Iran [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=237.4s)]
*  doesn't have the right to self-defense? Wanna hear an absolutely deranged version of reality? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=242.76000000000002s)]
*  In response to the missiles fired by Iran after Israel launched a devastating attack on the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=246.84s)]
*  country, the German Foreign Office literally tweeted, we strongly condemn the indiscriminate [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=251.24s)]
*  Iranian attack on Israeli territory. Iran's nuclear program violates a non-proliferation [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=256.12s)]
*  treaty and poses a threat to the entire region, especially to Israel. As well as everything else, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=260.92s)]
*  Israel is in violation of the non-proliferation treaty. Just a minor thing. You can't make this [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=265.72s)]
*  shit up. Now a whole range of Iranian military commanders and figures reported killed are injured [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=270.52000000000004s)]
*  so far, as well as civilian scientists and reportedly other civilians, including children, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=275.48s)]
*  have been killed, one hospital reported receiving the bodies of children aged 4, 5 and 6. Ali Veyaz, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=280.52000000000004s)]
*  an analyst with the International Crisis Group, says, by targeting population centres, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=287.56s)]
*  Israel is advising Iran to respond in kind. This will end in grief for all sides. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=292.36s)]
*  It should be noted that the pretext that Iran is immediately going to get a nuclear bomb has [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=297.32s)]
*  been claimed for decades. In 1993, Benjamin Netanyahu claimed that Iran would have a nuke by [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=301.56s)]
*  1999. In 1995, the New York Times headline was, Iran may be able to build an atomic bomb in [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=306.6s)]
*  five years, US and Israeli officials fear. Let's listen to this, however, from Richard Dalton, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=312.36s)]
*  the former UK ambassador to Iran. On the future of those US-Iran talks on Iran's nuclear activities, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=316.6s)]
*  do you think what's happened is going to basically mean those talks come to an end? Is it going to [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=323.16s)]
*  make Iran more likely, more determined to pursue nuclear proliferation? Yes, I think it will make [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=329.72s)]
*  Iran in the long term more likely to pursue nuclear proliferation. When a country has been exposed [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=337.88s)]
*  to an illegal aggression, as Iran has in the last day, it is not prone to surrender and it is prone [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=345.96s)]
*  to develop additional means of deterrence, bearing in mind, of course, that Israel has already got [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=356.12s)]
*  hundreds of nuclear warheads. Well, indeed. But as an example of the state of Western media coverage, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=363.08s)]
*  listen to this on Sky News and their so-called military analyst. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=368.76s)]
*  Well, our military analyst, Sean Bell, is in the studio with me now. Hello again to you, Sean. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=372.52s)]
*  You were saying to me that these series of attacks, and they continue, bear all the hallmarks of being [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=377.8s)]
*  a long time in the planning. Absolutely. As we discussed earlier, I think it was inevitable [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=384.52s)]
*  that Israel was going to have to do something militarily about Iran's fledgling nuclear capability. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=391.32s)]
*  All of the talks are one thing, but Iran has played those long, and we're getting closer and [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=396.92s)]
*  closer to the day when Iran would have a nuclear weapon. I think what we're seeing is in the past, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=401.32s)]
*  there's been a short, sharp shock between Israel and Iran. This time, there was a wave of strikes. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=406.04s)]
*  It's clearly been planned for a long time, potentially years. Mossad, as Ali was saying, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=412.44s)]
*  has clearly been doing a lot of very, very detailed work behind the scenes. They've been looking at [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=417.72s)]
*  the infrastructure, but also the people, the scientists, and the military leaders, because [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=422.68s)]
*  without them, it makes the whole thing very interesting. That's impartial journalism, is it? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=426.36s)]
*  A so-called analyst saying it was inevitable that Israel was going to have to do something militarily [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=430.84000000000003s)]
*  about Iran's fledgling nuclear capability. Well, that's not true, is it? This is just naked [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=434.68s)]
*  propagandizing for Israeli aggression dressed up as analysis. Now, predictably, opposing bombing [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=439.48s)]
*  things ends up with getting smeared. Nicole Lampert, who I have to say has tweeted about me, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=445.0s)]
*  God knows how many times over the years. I live in enough heads rent free to solve the [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=452.44s)]
*  world's housing crisis, frankly. She made the following smear in response to my opposition to [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=456.6s)]
*  a genocidal rogue nuclear armed state spinning out of control. She wrote, Owen comes out pro ayatollah. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=461.72s)]
*  As I wrote in response, if you oppose the Iraq war, you were smeared as pro-Syriac, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=468.36s)]
*  if you oppose the Afghan war, you were smeared as pro-Taliban, if you oppose the Libyan war, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=472.44s)]
*  you were smeared as pro-Gaddafi. Guess what? Those smears don't work anymore. And who was right [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=476.28s)]
*  about all of these? Someone called Katie Reed, who works in marketing, said, and is still invited [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=482.91999999999996s)]
*  on to UK television as commentator, really, Channel 5? Yeah, because only those who support [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=489.0s)]
*  dropping bombs on people's heads should be allowed on television, right Katie? Those who oppose [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=494.59999999999997s)]
*  dropping bombs on people's heads are clearly dangerous, violent extremists who should be banned [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=499.55999999999995s)]
*  from public discourse. That makes sense. And the former Labour MP Tom Harris responded, well, of [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=503.4s)]
*  course he has. The ayatollahs hate the West too, so they would have a lot to talk about as he was [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=507.47999999999996s)]
*  led up the gangway of the crane before they put the noose around his neck. Clearly having a little [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=511.79999999999995s)]
*  bit too much fun fantasizing about me being hanged there. He sounds a little aroused, frankly. As it [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=517.8s)]
*  happens, I'm a secular democratic socialist. I want to build a world of secular democratic socialism, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=523.0s)]
*  which I believe must be achieved freely through the free decisions and choices of the people of [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=527.16s)]
*  each nation. That doesn't mean, for example, the idea that human rights and democracy are [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=531.64s)]
*  imposed by blowing innocent people up and blowing things up. Not a great pedigree, has it? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=539.88s)]
*  I also know that polling by Stasis Consulting last year found that two thirds of Iranians [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=547.0s)]
*  opposed normalizing relations with Israel even before this attack. So good luck if people think [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=551.8s)]
*  regime change will lead to a pro-Israel Iran. While all this goes on, we should know Israel [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=556.52s)]
*  is continuing to commit heinous crimes against the Palestinian people of Gaza, who is starving [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=562.1999999999999s)]
*  to death and massacring. Israel has cut Gaza off on the internet, allowing it to commit even more [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=567.0s)]
*  unspeakable crimes hidden from the world. The truth is, Israel is a genocide of a rogue state, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=571.4s)]
*  which is guilty of some of the worst crimes of our age. And while the Western media continues [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=576.52s)]
*  to whitewash or defend its crimes, we're never going to do that here. Please like and subscribe [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=580.12s)]
*  if you thought in your comments. Help us take on the pro-genocide media at patreon.com [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=584.12s)]
*  for slash one, just eight four. And do share the video. You can listen to us on the podcast [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=587.24s)]
*  if you prefer. Wherever you download your podcasts, we'll speak to you soon. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2Ay_YNLkg&t=591.0s)]
