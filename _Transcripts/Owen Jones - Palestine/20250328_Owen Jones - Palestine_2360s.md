# Israeli Analyst EXPOSES Israel's Genocidal Mania - w/. Ori Goldberg
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c)
*  Now, the so-called ceasefire, which in practice wasn't a ceasefire in the conventional sense, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=0.0s)]
*  has obviously formerly been destroyed and huge numbers of people are again being violently [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=4.92s)]
*  killed in Gaza. There's been a total siege on Gaza now since the beginning of this month. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=9.52s)]
*  At the same time, within Israeli society, there's been some quite interesting developments [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=18.16s)]
*  concerning Netanyahu. There's the dynamic, obviously, with Donald Trump being in power [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=24.04s)]
*  and what that means, not least with the proposed, in practice, forcible removal of the entire [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=28.84s)]
*  Palestinian population from the home. There's always, I have to say, whenever I've chatted [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  to Ori Goldberg, people have always had a brilliant response. He's a great analyst based [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=41.84s)]
*  over in Israel. I've chatted to you a few times now, Ori, all the way through this horror. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=48.44s)]
*  And your analysis, your thoughts, your insights, people have always been delighted to hear from [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=53.879999999999995s)]
*  you. So great to speak to you again. How are you doing? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=59.239999999999995s)]
*  I'm okay. As well as can be expected, like you say, these are very, very dark times. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  Very dark times indeed. I'm just interested first, because I've not spoken to you since Trump [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=67.96s)]
*  was elected and became president again. What do you think about the change in dynamic? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=72.67999999999999s)]
*  I mean, what do you think the kind of real practical changes we've seen? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=80.27999999999999s)]
*  Well, we haven't seen much change in the United States support for Israel carrying out its [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=85.8s)]
*  genocidal policies. But I think we have seen a real change in the American orientation. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=91.88s)]
*  And it's not the change the Israeli right expected. I think Trump very clearly and overtly [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=100.11999999999999s)]
*  really doesn't give a damn. He doesn't care about Palestinian lives. But he also doesn't [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=109.72s)]
*  feel particularly beholden to Netanyahu. There's been tension there ever since the end of his [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=115.72s)]
*  previous term when Netanyahu tried to present himself as the whisperer in Trump's ear. You [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=121.24s)]
*  remember the whole scandal, the cartoon, I think, was it in the New York Times or in the London Times? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=128.84s)]
*  Netanyahu walking Trump on a leash. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=135.4s)]
*  So Trump doesn't like Netanyahu and doesn't necessarily trust him. He may feel obligated [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=141.32s)]
*  to some senior Republican donors, namely the widow of the late Sheldon Adelson, the gambling [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=149.0s)]
*  tycoon Miriam Adelson. But Miriam Adelson doesn't necessarily like the Netanyahu's either. So [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=155.24s)]
*  what Israel has is an America that supports it in terms of goods delivered. Trump freed up the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  bombs that had been held by the Biden administration. But Trump's emissary to the Middle East, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=168.52s)]
*  Stephen Witkoff, really genuinely doesn't seem like he feels as though he owes any of [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=175.8s)]
*  the parties in the region any particular debt. And that's very confusing to Israelis. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=183.72s)]
*  And certainly confusing to Netanyahu. In many ways, Trump called Netanyahu's bluff when he said, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=189.64s)]
*  I'm supporting Israel, whatever Israel decides to do. Because I think Netanyahu and the Israeli [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=195.48s)]
*  right saw this as an unconditional statement of support and as a fervent endorsement of their [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=201.24s)]
*  ideology. But what it in effect means, I think, in Trumpish is as long as you deliver what I need [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=208.2s)]
*  you to deliver, I'll support you. Once you don't, if you're seen as a loser, if you're seen as [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=214.28s)]
*  losing the people's confidence, if you're seen as teetering, if you're seen as faltering, then [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=220.84s)]
*  I don't think Trump will have any kind of compunctions removing his support from Israel [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=229.0s)]
*  or placing his weight behind a Saudi proposal or an Iraqi proposal. There's a lot of things going [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=233.96s)]
*  on there as well. So in that sense, Israel is confused. It's getting support from the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=239.88s)]
*  United States, but the support is somewhat mechanical. And the good relationship that [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=248.35999999999999s)]
*  Israel had with the Biden administration is not really there anymore. I don't think the Israelis [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=254.6s)]
*  know how to comport themselves with the Trump administration. I mean, what do you think about [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=259.71999999999997s)]
*  the plausible implementation of what is described, well, what in practice would be [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=264.28s)]
*  ethnic cleansing? I mean, I spoke to genocide scholars, they said it would be genocide [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=269.88s)]
*  lacked in itself. It would forcibly remove the entire people from their home. It's an [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=273.4s)]
*  incredible amount of genocide and violence involved in that. But what do you think about the, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=279.55999999999995s)]
*  I mean, do you think that's a likely prospect? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=285.0s)]
*  I don't at this stage, but not because it was floated fictitiously. It wasn't, and it certainly [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=287.8s)]
*  reflects or gives voice to sort of a collective Israeli fantasy that's shared by Israelis of all [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=297.71999999999997s)]
*  political stripes, which is not to kill the Palestinians, but that the Palestinians would [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=305.88s)]
*  disappear. I remember this question from, you know, just political chats among friends. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=310.84s)]
*  And the answer was always obvious. The question was, if you had a big red button, you could press [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=317.08s)]
*  the next day, the Palestinians wouldn't be here. Are you saying you wouldn't press it? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=321.56s)]
*  And the answer was always, of course I would. Nobody wants the Palestinians here. And if there [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=326.36s)]
*  were people who were particularly righteous during the time, they would say, obviously, the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=331.24s)]
*  Palestinians would answer the same way. They also pressed the same question. And I think [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=335.4s)]
*  the question was, if you had a red button, you could press the button. So I think the Trump plan, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=340.68s)]
*  as it was once called, I don't think it's its plan any longer, is a very big deal because it has [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=349.0s)]
*  allowed Israeli society and Israeli politics to begin speaking this language. Just today, we heard [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=355.48s)]
*  from Prime Minister Netanyahu in his beleaguered speech in the Knesset, where he said, if, or his [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=361.8s)]
*  friends get rid of Hamas, we will be forced to take their land. There's nothing to take that [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=369.88s)]
*  hasn't already been taken. Israel has already occupied Gaza six or seven times easily over the [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=377.72s)]
*  past year and a half and can do so very easily again. It's not facing any kind of threat. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=384.52000000000004s)]
*  But I think Trump himself has really distanced himself and his administration from this plan [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=389.72s)]
*  because he's basically said as much. He said directly nobody's going to be forcefully expelled. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=395.56s)]
*  And that's not because he's a great humanitarian, but because I think somebody sat him down and [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=400.2s)]
*  explained the logistics of ethnic cleansing to him, explained how he would appear in American [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=405.56s)]
*  media and in the global media, but also how much money it would cost and Israel's inability to pay [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=412.67999999999995s)]
*  for it and the need to process, that's the word Israelis are using now, 10,000 people a day leaving, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=417.23999999999995s)]
*  which is what our Minister of Finance Smotlich bragged about. So the main reason I think this [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=424.6s)]
*  won't be carried out is because it is too much of a hassle. But when I talk about that, we have to [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=429.88s)]
*  take into consideration the hidden debate that's going on in Washington right now over influence [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=436.6s)]
*  regarding the Trump administration between the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=443.96000000000004s)]
*  Saudi Arabia is the sponsor of the Arab League plan, so-called Egyptian plan. It talks about [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=449.32000000000005s)]
*  reconstruction. The Emirates want something a lot looser that would allow them to control [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=453.88s)]
*  Gaza through their own proxies. So they're encouraging Trump to apply pressure to Egypt [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=460.36s)]
*  to accept tens of thousands of Palestinians. I don't think Trump is leaning that way. His [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=467.15999999999997s)]
*  emissary, Witkoff, certainly isn't, but it's all there. So what I would say is it's not going to [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=474.04s)]
*  go through, I think, but because Trump would see it as way, way too much of a burden. Not because [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=481.24s)]
*  people are against it, because practically speaking, which for Trump is a big deal, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=486.76s)]
*  it's not particularly feasible. So judging by that quote you said before about Palestinians [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=493.16s)]
*  vanishing, Yaron Golon, the leader of the Democrats, supposedly the progressive opposition, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=499.24s)]
*  he once said, we'd all like to wake up one spring morning and find that seven million Palestinians [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=506.2s)]
*  who live between the sea and river have simply disappeared. I mean, the point there about [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=510.36s)]
*  what Israel's behavior is, it kind of has to work. It worked backwards from that point based on what [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=513.88s)]
*  it sees is politically, diplomatically possible at any given time. As you said, that would be [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=520.04s)]
*  a nice dream, which unites as far as much of the Israeli establishment is concerned. But the [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=529.08s)]
*  question is always about feasibility. So what we've seen over the last year and a half is that [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=535.5600000000001s)]
*  becomes, you know, what wasn't seen as feasible before becomes more feasible. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=540.04s)]
*  I'm not arguing. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=546.28s)]
*  Yeah, you're putting it out there. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=548.12s)]
*  Yeah, sorry, no, I was just putting it out there. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=549.0799999999999s)]
*  No, no, no, certainly it does. But I think what the... [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=550.12s)]
*  I don't even have words to aptly describe the atrocities of the past eight days since [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=556.68s)]
*  Israel broke the ceasefire. I think they may have been the worst days since this whole thing began, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=562.12s)]
*  in terms of just a sheer disregard for the sanctity of life. Really, just [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=568.12s)]
*  the horror is... it exceeds literal descriptions. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=579.96s)]
*  And I think what is visible though, if you're looking at it, try to look at it closely, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=587.96s)]
*  try and analyze what Israel is doing, is that really, Israelis just in a very, very simple yet [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=593.48s)]
*  profound way, don't care. They don't care. They've got bad guys. I mean, the narrative has been [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=601.16s)]
*  simplified to an almost ridiculous extent. The past events have not happened, there hasn't been [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=610.84s)]
*  a ceasefire, there's no deal, there's nothing there. Other than that, Israelis don't care in [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=617.16s)]
*  the sense that Palestinian lives are completely without value in their eyes, without significance. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=622.68s)]
*  They're not worth preserving, they're not worth defending. Israel goes after its so-called [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=629.4799999999999s)]
*  targets, which it alone defines through a vast web of misinformation and lies, as though [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=635.0s)]
*  targeting Hamas's political leadership right now is what destroys the existential threat that [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=643.9599999999999s)]
*  Israelis face. But the more important thing is that really Israelis are not even pretending [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=650.12s)]
*  to act legally anymore. They're just going after the targets because the targets are the only ones [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=655.48s)]
*  that matter. Palestinians have two choices. One is to be bad guys, officially recognized as such by [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=660.36s)]
*  Israel, and the other is just not to exist. Israel is not doing much of anything by causing them to [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=666.52s)]
*  physically evaporate, by eradicating them, because they're not really there to begin with as far as [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=674.04s)]
*  most Israelis are concerned. And if they are, then well, they chose Hamas, they support Hamas, and [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=679.64s)]
*  that's the path they took, and they could have taken another one, so they deserve to die. But [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=687.0s)]
*  most Israelis aren't even there. For most Israelis, I just read, this is an anecdote, but before we [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=690.6s)]
*  started talking, I just was browsing on my Hebrew Facebook feed. I'm that old, yes. And somebody [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=696.36s)]
*  has a Facebook group devoted to London. Okay, that's his pleasure. He uncovers London for [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=706.4399999999999s)]
*  Israelis. So he went on a trip and he caught a lot of theater during his time there. So he saw [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=715.8s)]
*  a play, I don't know what it's called in English, but the Hebrew name he presented, something like [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=723.9599999999999s)]
*  Knocking on the Roof, which is an Israeli protocol for warning Palestinians that they're about to [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=730.3599999999999s)]
*  bomb buildings. And he wrote, this is just an ordinary guy, he wrote, you know, I watched this [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=734.6s)]
*  play, it's pretty good. And then in parentheses, he said, of course, I didn't feel any pity, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=740.6s)]
*  because the whole premise is based on an attempt to erase October 7th. So why would I pity them? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=747.5600000000001s)]
*  But the play in itself was pretty good. This isn't a politician. This isn't a Hasbarat Taikun. This is [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=755.08s)]
*  a guy talking about plays in London. But he feels a need to add this disclaimer, because [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=761.0s)]
*  that is the greatest virtue Israelis can have right now, not caring. Okay, it's not even, yes, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=767.64s)]
*  we've got our share of death eaters. And there's certainly there, there's certainly people who are [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=775.56s)]
*  ideologically committed to wiping out Amalek and to killing Palestinians and so on and so forth. But [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=780.76s)]
*  most people derive a sense of virtue from statements like that. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=788.6s)]
*  Chris, why would I have any pity for them? Or why would I think about them? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=796.04s)]
*  There are endless expressions of this throughout Israeli discourse. Some of them have to do with [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=800.04s)]
*  for the demonstrations against Hamas that just took place. But in every case, Israelis need [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=804.52s)]
*  to either demonstrate their complete lack of care or respect for Palestinians, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=811.48s)]
*  or to place the burden of proof for why Palestinians should be kept alive on Palestinian [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=816.76s)]
*  shoulders. Show us why you're worthy of not being bought. That's also another [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=821.64s)]
*  trend that's coming to dominate Israeli discourse. Go into the streets and demonstrate, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=831.48s)]
*  and then we will have a discussion on whether our drones should bomb you as you demonstrate or not. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=836.76s)]
*  Are these demonstrations genuine? Israelis want to know. I'm sorry, I'm ranting. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=844.6s)]
*  They're not at all, no. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=850.04s)]
*  It's horrible. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=852.2s)]
*  Well, it's something I'm very interested in because it's become something of a [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=853.56s)]
*  click-take. You see a tweet from Israel and you hit the press translate button, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=857.5600000000001s)]
*  translate from Hebrew to English, and you're like, oh my God. It's just [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=865.5600000000001s)]
*  fascinating because there's always been the case, and this has happened in lots of societies, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=872.92s)]
*  in lots of ways, where people who otherwise show love and empathy and feel grief and all the rest [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=876.2s)]
*  of it. If they saw something terrible happening, they would, to a woman in the street or a [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=882.2s)]
*  man in the street or a child in the street and all, they'd be devastated, they'd be traumatized. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=887.16s)]
*  They cry at a sad film, they cry at an animal being killed in a film, and yet this hasn't... [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=892.6s)]
*  It's a disturbing case today. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=900.52s)]
*  Have you ever read Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=903.3199999999999s)]
*  As a child, I did, yeah. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=907.64s)]
*  So the third volume, Life, the Universe, and Everything, it starts with [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=909.4s)]
*  the story of the cricket wars, people of the planet cricket, whose planet was surrounded by [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=915.16s)]
*  a vast dust nebula. And for thousands of years, they lived precious, carefree, pleasant, good [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=920.2s)]
*  lives until one day a spaceship came crashing down from the nebula and revealed to them that [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=928.12s)]
*  they were not alone. And right there and then they decided to embark on a quest to destroy [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=932.92s)]
*  the entire universe because they were no longer alone. And Douglas Adams, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=939.8s)]
*  being the genius that he was, describes it very actually how just before the spaceship crashed, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=947.4s)]
*  they were walking along the cricketers singing a song about life and love. And a second after [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=953.4s)]
*  the spaceship crashed, they were singing songs about life and love and destroying the whole [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=960.1999999999999s)]
*  universe. So in many ways, this is what is happening here. Good people, smart people, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=964.12s)]
*  people who fully understand the concept of responsibility and the concept of consequence. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=971.16s)]
*  When it comes to the Palestinians, for a lot of reasons, some of them have to do with [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=976.28s)]
*  attrition because life in Israel is, of course, it's not life in Gaza, but life in Israel is [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=981.8s)]
*  deteriorating rapidly. But even if you don't want to talk about attrition or we don't want to talk [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=987.0s)]
*  about attrition, for a broad variety of reasons, these people are simply [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=991.48s)]
*  not there. They don't care, especially now when they can care about a lot of domestic Israeli [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=998.6800000000001s)]
*  events that are so volatile and everything is happening, protests are renewed and so on. But [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1004.04s)]
*  the consensus that is underpinning the great turmoil of Israeli politics [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1012.2s)]
*  is that Palestinians are not worthy of concern or respect or care. Their lives are [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1017.24s)]
*  ashes to be scattered. I was going to ask you about what's going on in Israeli society, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1023.88s)]
*  but just on this, in Ynet, the online portal of Yedioth Abenov, which is the biggest, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1030.52s)]
*  for those who don't know, biggest circulation newspaper in Israel, and this was an article [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1037.8s)]
*  about Herzl Halevi, the former chief of general staff of the Israel Defense Forces. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1043.0s)]
*  It said this about the aftermath of 7th October. When Halevi presented the IDF's operation to the [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1048.52s)]
*  cabinet in the first 48 hours of the war, he noted the air force had attacked 1,500 targets in Gaza. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1052.6s)]
*  This is a huge number requiring exceptional intelligence and operational capabilities. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1057.72s)]
*  Netanyahu erupted in anger, yelling and banging on the table, why not 5,000? He scolded the chief [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1061.16s)]
*  staff. We don't have 5,000 approved targets, Halevi replied. I'm not interested in targets, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1065.64s)]
*  Netanyahu retorted, take down houses, bomb with everything you have. I think that's got no coverage [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1070.28s)]
*  in the Western media. Not surprising, it's got no coverage in the Israeli media either, but [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1078.76s)]
*  I don't think it's an intentional attempt at centrifuge here in Israel as much as it really is. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1085.24s)]
*  What the hell are you talking about, dude? I mean, this quote unquote war is generally described as [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1091.96s)]
*  the most just war Israel has ever fought. There's no expiration date. We are always just ones here [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1098.92s)]
*  because what happened to us was, and here I'm using another mantra, the worst massacre perpetrated upon [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1106.1200000000001s)]
*  the Jewish people since the Holocaust. Once you've got massacre and Holocaust in one sentence, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1111.5600000000002s)]
*  you can't be beat. Yes, the IDF started right off the bat by basically carpet bombing. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1117.88s)]
*  Supposedly going after targets, but as this piece, which by the way, nobody bothered to deny, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1129.0s)]
*  which I suppose means it's true. I have an acquaintance who's a top ranking military officer, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1136.04s)]
*  and I had a conversation with him about two months after October of 23. I asked him if this [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1144.68s)]
*  activity really was as intense and as maximal as it seemed. He said it wasn't maximal because [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1152.12s)]
*  nobody had ever dropped so many bombs before. Not in any war. Israel fought in any war the [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1162.84s)]
*  Israeli military was familiar with. This just had never happened. Yes, the flood gates were open right [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1168.84s)]
*  at the beginning and nothing has really changed in that sense, which is why when people talk about [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1175.64s)]
*  a grand master plan coming to fruition here, this is Israel doing what it planned on doing all along, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1184.2800000000002s)]
*  I disagree. I don't think it makes it less horrible. I think it makes it more horrible. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1191.96s)]
*  I think that what happened really is that Israelis right from the start received a kind of [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1197.16s)]
*  receiving approval to treat their fantasies, which are not meant to be realized [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1204.28s)]
*  as practical goals. Again, the fantasy is for the Palestinians not to be there, so you take any [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1209.8s)]
*  means necessary. You establish a directorate for ethnic cleansing. You bomb the entire Gaza Strip, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1216.6799999999998s)]
*  lifting all the international humanitarian legal defenses for non-combatants. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1225.96s)]
*  You supposedly distinguish between civilians and combatants, but effectively you don't. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1231.16s)]
*  All of these things are kosher again because ultimately at their foundation lies nothing. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1239.0s)]
*  That is the point Israelis are trying to make. We don't care. Don't try to make us care because [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1246.28s)]
*  you're not going to succeed. We don't. And because we don't care, what does it matter if we killed [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1251.72s)]
*  one child or 10 children or 50 children? We got the bad guy we wanted to get. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1257.32s)]
*  Those Palestinians should have done their math and made the proper choice when they had a chance [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1262.4399999999998s)]
*  to do that. It's on them. It's not on us. With Israel, I want to ask you about what's happening [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1267.3999999999999s)]
*  there. Can you just kind of explain what's going on with the economy in Israel? Where do things [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1276.6s)]
*  stand at the moment? Oh, they're very bad and they're only going to get worse. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1282.04s)]
*  Netanyahu's government just passed the 2025 budget. It's a budget that's full of money [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1288.04s)]
*  earmarked for sectorial partisan needs by the parties that make up the coalition and it cuts [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1294.36s)]
*  severely into social services, into investments in infrastructure for the first, excuse me, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1301.3999999999999s)]
*  in decades. The defense budget is higher than the education budget. Generally speaking, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1307.8s)]
*  civic life in Israel has taken quite a blow from this budget. It's only going to get worse [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1315.1599999999999s)]
*  because Israelis have not really begun to pay in terms of salaries for the war. Cost of living [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1320.52s)]
*  rises preposterously. Prices rise nearly every week. We haven't reached Weimar Republic standards [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1326.2s)]
*  just yet, but that might be where we're going because there's no salvation on the horizon, no [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1332.92s)]
*  investors waiting to flock into Israel and care for all the orphaned high-tech developers. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1339.48s)]
*  This was always a speculative economy. That's something that this government did before it [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1348.44s)]
*  became the genocide government. It was the privatization government. If Netanyahu has an [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1353.72s)]
*  ideology, it's as close to Thatcherism economically as I've ever seen. That was what [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1360.04s)]
*  this government was doing. Our chickens have come home to roost now that we've lost the reserves, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1367.24s)]
*  the financial reserves that we had. It's all about plunder by specific political parties and [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1373.96s)]
*  a very severe and rapid erosion of the social safety net for ordinary citizens like me. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1381.0s)]

*  All of this is actually happening. But Israel or the protesters who protested against Netanyahu [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1459.9599999999998s)]
*  before the genocide began returned to the streets because of the scandal over the dismissal of the [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1467.32s)]
*  head of Shin Bet. I will remind your viewers that Shin Bet is not just Israel's domestic [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1474.76s)]
*  security service. It's also the security organ that's charged with the day-to-day maintenance [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1480.84s)]
*  of the occupation of Palestinian territories. The military upholds the physical side of it, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1486.9199999999998s)]
*  but Shin Bet directs espionage and other intelligence efforts that have to do with [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1494.44s)]
*  the territories because of their unique status. I don't know if you can even call it irony at [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1502.92s)]
*  this stage that Israelis clamoring for democracy are defending the one senior Israeli security [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1509.96s)]
*  official who's probably the least beholden to democracy in our less than democratic country. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1517.72s)]
*  Thing is, this all became very, very obvious and very clear to a lot of people. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1524.68s)]
*  The Shin Bet was investigating relations between people who were quite close to Netanyahu, who were [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1531.0800000000002s)]
*  close media advisors, and the Qatari government. I don't know if there's necessarily a whole lot [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1538.04s)]
*  to these allegations. Israel's relationship with Qatar is a complicated one. Qatar was the only [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1543.24s)]
*  Gulf country who was friendly to Israel and who had discrete diplomatic relations with Israel [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1549.72s)]
*  as far back as the 1990s. Qatar served as mediator at Israel's request between Israel and Hamas. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1556.36s)]
*  It was also Hamas's patron, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1563.32s)]
*  Israelis who were against Netanyahu and against Netanyahu's government and against the war, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1568.1999999999998s)]
*  but don't feel like they can again be against the war because of the genocide, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1572.52s)]
*  are using this Qatar-gate scandal to legitimate their protests and to suggest that the Prime [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1578.04s)]
*  Minister hastened to dismiss the head of Shin Bet because the head of Shin Bet was directing the [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1585.4s)]
*  investigation against him. Remember that Netanyahu is also on trial for four counts of bribery at [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1589.88s)]
*  various levels, and you'll get a sense of how beleaguered the Prime Minister is. It's now or [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1597.72s)]
*  never for him, both on the Gaza front and on the domestic legal front. He is apparently all in. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1603.4s)]
*  He's betting the house that he will win and that the protests will subside. My sense is [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1610.68s)]
*  that the protests are different than they were two years ago. They are much more angry. Netanyahu [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1617.48s)]
*  has really lost all inhibition in pursuing his own personal path to salvation. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1624.92s)]
*  And a lot of Israel's elites, but not just the elites, people who don't like him and don't [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1631.96s)]
*  trust him, now consider him much more dangerous than he was. The really interesting bit, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1638.6s)]
*  which I don't know if we'll get a chance to see it, has to do with real fears among Israel's [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1644.36s)]
*  military leadership and also political leadership that should the government decide on an [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1651.4s)]
*  occupation of Gaza, tens of thousands of soldiers will not report for duty because the war will be [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1656.92s)]
*  seen as a political war and because Israelis have served literally hundreds of days on the front [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1663.16s)]
*  lines and businesses have crumbled, families have dissipated, and generally the fabric of social [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1671.24s)]
*  life in Israel has suffered greatly because of this one. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1678.2s)]
*  Will Barron Benjamin Netanyahu, in response to all of these goings on, I guess, declared there will be no civil war. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1682.44s)]
*  And the sort of thing you listen to if you're concerned about a civil war, you would be more [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1691.64s)]
*  alarmed about, I would say. I mean, is that just completely fantastical nonsense? Is that just [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1698.0400000000002s)]
*  trying to rally unity around him? Benjamin Netanyahu Well, it's more of a mantra. In Israel, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1704.3600000000001s)]
*  the notion of Jewish supremacy is very closely linked to Jewish fraternity. Ultimately, there was [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1710.6s)]
*  a time when Jewish factions fought each other under the British Mandate and the Haggana, which later [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1717.0s)]
*  turned into the IDF, the central dominant faction that ultimately created the Israeli state, turned [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1723.0s)]
*  members of the Yilgun and Lehi to the British authorities and fired on a ship full of new [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1730.44s)]
*  immigrants that was sponsored by the right-wing militias. And ever since then, there's apparently [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1741.96s)]
*  a sacred oath that neither side will lift arms against the other side because ultimately, you know, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1748.68s)]
*  we're all in this together. We're all Jews. If we don't take care of each other, nobody will. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1756.1999999999998s)]
*  That is even more pronounced now because everybody hates us anyway. So unless we do it, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1760.6s)]
*  no one will go through the trouble. So again, it's more of a mantra than it is anything else. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1765.8799999999999s)]
*  Additionally, if you'd asked me two years ago, I would have said I don't really see the prospect [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1771.3999999999999s)]
*  of civil war as realistic because the ones who are talking about the war, the deaf eaters, are [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1777.7199999999998s)]
*  more like cowardly lions when it comes to actually acting. But things may have actually, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1784.92s)]
*  things may have changed. They've had a year and a half in the military. All their inhibitions have [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1793.3200000000002s)]
*  been lifted. They are used to killing. They've killed at an industrial level. I don't know if [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1798.8400000000001s)]
*  they will think much about killing in-house now. I think they will. I think there are still [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1806.28s)]
*  inhibitions in place. I don't see a civil war there. But it remains to be seen in Israel [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1814.84s)]
*  in some contrast to, let's say, a country like Romania, that the ethos of national unity is [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1822.84s)]
*  paramount. This idea that we have to stick together because if we don't, then all of our [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1831.16s)]
*  enemies will congregate and screw us royally is very, very powerful, very tangible. I think [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1837.72s)]
*  Netanyahu is counting on that. But the protests are not letting up. There are thousands of people [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1844.68s)]
*  in Jerusalem right now trying to do their best to disturb public life, disturb the peace, if you [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1852.52s)]
*  will. I don't think they'll stop the Netanyahu government from passing the laws at once. It has [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1862.6s)]
*  a solid parliamentary majority. But I can't be as certain as I was about where this will go. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1867.08s)]
*  Once again, though, it's worth reminding everybody listening and watching that this isn't being [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1874.68s)]
*  carried out because of the genocide. As far as the genocide goes, there's consensus. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1880.36s)]
*  The genocide is supported far and wide. This is another element of what I think of as our [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1885.72s)]
*  solipsism, our murderous solipsism, where we are concerned only with ourselves because we are the [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1892.92s)]
*  only real thing there. This, in a way, is another assertion of the fact that the only thing that [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1898.12s)]
*  matters is Israeli politics, not, for example, the plight of the Goslings who are being [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1902.92s)]
*  slaughtered as we speak by our sons. The pilots who bombed Gaza, I'm sure many other parents are [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1908.28s)]
*  out in the streets protesting. It didn't stop them from bombing Gaza. We've had several [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1916.52s)]
*  conscientious objectors come forth and refuse to serve. Very brave, but very few. The great majority [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1921.8s)]
*  have not done so. Just a couple of final questions. One was linked to where this is all heading. What's [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1929.6399999999999s)]
*  your sense of where things are heading in the West Bank? Well, I understand that a new plan has [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1935.4s)]
*  been issued. If I recall the language correctly, it meant to radically alter the narrative of [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1942.0400000000002s)]
*  refugeeism, tear down the refugee camps and make them into permanent settlements. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1950.3600000000001s)]
*  Except for the destruction and the mayhem and the deaths, all of Israel's statements [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1957.4s)]
*  regarding the West Bank at the moment are bogus. You can't trust them. You can't see a direction [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1963.56s)]
*  there. The settlers are using all the power they have because they are politically savvy. They [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1970.2s)]
*  understand that it's now or never. They are using all the power they have to try and establish their [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1975.8799999999999s)]
*  presence in the territories. More than 10,000 apartments have been approved for building in [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1982.28s)]
*  the territories during 2025. That's already about twice as much as were approved through the [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1987.56s)]
*  entirety of 2024. That deserves to be said. It's certainly a power grab. I don't think we can tell [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=1993.96s)]
*  much from that about where this is heading. I don't know where this is heading. This is [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2005.64s)]
*  virgin territory for Israel. We've never committed full-on overt documented genocide, [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2009.16s)]
*  certainly not at the level with which we're doing so now. We've never had a prime minister [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2017.72s)]
*  accused of and indicted on so many charges with public rage finally being fueled consistently. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2024.04s)]
*  Again, none of this is happening for the right reasons. None of this is happening because [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2034.84s)]
*  of Israel acknowledging its responsibility for the genocide. None of this is happening [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2040.6s)]
*  because of the genocide. The genocide is the consensus. But things are happening. Now it's [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2047.8799999999999s)]
*  coming down to the sociology of it, sociology and the economics perhaps. There are a lot of [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2056.52s)]
*  quiet parts that are not being spoken of that loud like the issue of whether soldiers will show up [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2063.96s)]
*  if a ground invasion of Gaza takes place. I don't think they will, so I don't think it will. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2069.96s)]
*  But Israel will shed a lot of Palestinian blood before anything resembling calm [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2077.3199999999997s)]
*  descends upon the region. I pray that the saner voices in the Trump administration prevail and [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2085.48s)]
*  find a way to bridge the gap towards enforcing the Arab League plan, which seems like the only [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2092.44s)]
*  real show in town. Nothing else actually exists. Even if there are devious Emirati wishes to [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2099.4s)]
*  try and divert this course, that's the only plan that exists. It's the only commitment that exists. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2106.36s)]
*  It's probably the only solution there is. I know where I want this to go and I know where it [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2111.2400000000002s)]
*  seems like the only place it can go. I can't see Israel continuing to do this forever, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2118.68s)]
*  despite Netanyahu's desires. This is all going to reach a boiling point sooner rather than later. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2125.0s)]
*  I'm afraid that in the time it takes to reach the boiling point, an enormous amount of Palestinian [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2130.92s)]
*  blood will be shed and the need to remember what is being done to the Palestinian people, not [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2139.16s)]
*  by Israel directly, but by a world enabling this, I think should be the punchline of any discussion [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2145.32s)]
*  we have about all of these events. That's what I was going to finally ask. You say it will end up [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2152.28s)]
*  at a boiling point at some point, but will it? I don't know. What's different here compared to [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2159.2400000000002s)]
*  many other atrocities committed, of which there are no shortage in our species gruesome past, [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2165.48s)]
*  is it's just this level of impunity. There's nothing really just stopping. There's no [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2172.6800000000003s)]
*  counter pressure. Not really. You've got to sit around outside. You can get away with anything. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2179.0800000000004s)]
*  Carl Zeiss You're absolutely right. The only thing that will stop this will be if the House of Cards, [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2186.36s)]
*  that is Israeli democracy, will tumble, will collapse. I think this case is fairly unique [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2193.56s)]
*  because of the length, the duration of time during which Israel has enjoyed this impunity, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2203.88s)]
*  which has allowed it to construct this very elaborate tower of lies. The lies are to some [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2212.04s)]
*  extent unraveling. I wish I could say more comforting things. I don't know. Maybe they won't. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2221.0s)]
*  Maybe they won't. Maybe Israel will keep battering Gaza for months now. Perhaps I'm being an optimist [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2230.12s)]
*  because I really can't envision life going on in Israel. I am Israeli. I live in Israel. This is [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2237.32s)]
*  where I am. I may be too much of an optimist, but looking around, I don't think [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2243.4s)]

*  again, no comparisons, obviously, but life in Israel really is deteriorating very quickly. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2262.2000000000003s)]
*  The sense of not impending doom, but the sense of unraveling is very powerful. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2267.48s)]
*  The sense that the state is no longer there, that there's no trust to be had in the state, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2275.32s)]
*  that this Jewish fraternity we talked about, which is much more accessible than the notion [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2279.7200000000003s)]
*  of supremacy, this Jewish fraternity exists no longer, is very much there. I don't know if this [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2284.92s)]
*  unraveling will be enough. I can, however, say that if it doesn't unravel from within, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2291.96s)]
*  it's unlikely to unravel from outside. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2296.84s)]
*  Always have fascinating stuff. Always very hard hitting. That's the nature of what we're talking [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2302.28s)]
*  about. And very sobering stuff as well, I have to say. It's always such a pleasure. For those [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2308.28s)]
*  listening and watching, do share this video. Make sure, as we've heard, press like, subscribe, [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2313.8s)]
*  all the rest of it. Leave comments, because then more people engage in why we're here. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2317.64s)]
*  Honestly, it's always such a pleasure to talk to you and hear your wisdom. Thank you, Zemma. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2323.64s)]
*  Thank you, Owen. It's always a pleasure to be. It's always a pleasure to talk to you. It's always [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2329.32s)]
*  a pleasure to have time, to have a conversation. Everybody needs more of this. Everybody needs [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2333.08s)]
*  more truth. And you do truth. That's very commendable. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2342.3599999999997s)]
*  I do my best, but so do right back at you. It means a lot for you. Cheers, buddy. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g5hzZLd_c&t=2346.6s)]
