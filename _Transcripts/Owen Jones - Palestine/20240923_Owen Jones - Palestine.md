# Israel's MURDEROUS Rampage In Lebanon Mass Slaughter Beckons
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [September 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnMCX9XTz98)
*  Not content with its genocide in Gaza, Israel has expanded a war of annihilation to Lebanon.
*  At least 365 people have reportedly been killed in Lebanon and 1,256 injured by Israeli attacks.
*  Dozens of women and children were reported to be amongst those butchered. This has been described
*  as one of the bloodiest days in the history of Lebanon. Let's humanise this slaughter for a
*  moment. One of those killed, Le'Oyazmina, just seven years old in south Lebanon.
*  Once again the world has been told, in no uncertain terms, that Arab life is cheap,
*  to the point of being virtually worthless. Now the way Israeli leaders communicate to the English
*  speaking world and to their own people is very different. This is a really important point. Let
*  me illustrate it. This is the Israeli Minister of Education. Have a listen to this.
*  What is said about the countries of the world that claim this. There is no difference between Hezbollah
*  and Lebanon. Lebanon will be destroyed in the light of how things are progressing. I am saying this
*  in a very stupid way. We are in an era where Lebanon is going to be destroyed. It will not be
*  the same Lebanon as they know it. I am not going to deal with Hezbollah's side-scratches.
*  The price of the occupation of Lebanon will be the same as the state of Lebanon.
*  There is no difference
*  between Hezbollah and Lebanon. Lebanon will be annihilated. It will cease to exist. A
*  straightforward call once again for genocide. This genocide of intent needs to be taken seriously.
*  After all, when Israeli leaders spoke about destroying Gaza and imposing collective
*  punishment on its people, they meant what they said, stuck to their word and acted on it. He
*  then claims to be correcting himself, who has not accidentally called for the annihilation of another
*  country. That he was without claims to wanting to annihilate entire countries, cast the first stone
*  He then claims to be correcting himself and declares the price of regression from Lebanon's
*  territory will be paid by the state of Lebanon, which in practice will mean its people. Bear that
*  in mind when Netanyahu says the following. I have a message for the people of Lebanon.
*  Israel's war is not with you. It's with Hezbollah. For too long, Hezbollah has been using you
*  as human shields. It placed rockets in your living rooms and missiles in your garage. Those rockets
*  and missiles are aimed directly at our cities, directly at our citizens. To defend our people
*  against Hezbollah strikes, we must take out those weapons. Starting this morning, the IDF has warned
*  you to get out of harm's way. I urge you, take this warning seriously. Don't let Hezbollah endanger
*  your lives and the lives of your loved ones. Don't let Hezbollah endanger Lebanon. Please,
*  get out of harm's way now. Once our operation is finished, you can come back safely to your homes.
*  I have a message for the people of Lebanon. Israel's war is not with you. It's with Hezbollah.
*  He then declares Hezbollah has been using the people of Lebanon as human shields, demanding
*  they get out of harm's way and then they can return safely to their homes. Well, bollocks,
*  we've heard this time and time again in the history of Israel. They drive people, the state,
*  from their homes and those people never return. That's exactly what's happening to Gaza. It
*  previously happened to the people of Gaza, the vast majority of whom are the families of those
*  forced to flee their homes in Anakba, in what is now the official borders of Israel in 1948.
*  No, he says all of this in English with English subtitles rather than Arabic. Why? Because this
*  is not aimed at the Lebanese people. It's aimed at a Western audience to try and sow confusion and
*  division amongst the Western public, increasingly repulsed by Israel's mass violence. Now, last
*  November, Yoav Galan, the defense minister who like Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
*  the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, has issued a request for a response against
*  them both. He made this promise. Hezbollah is causing Lebanon to be in a war that is likely to
*  happen. It is making mistakes. If it makes mistakes of this kind here, the one who will pay the price
*  is first of all the Lebanese citizens. What we're doing in Gaza, we know how to do in Beirut.
*  He said what we are doing in Gaza, we know how to do to Beirut or in Beirut. He then declared
*  who will pay the price. First of all, the citizens of Lebanon. None of this is subtle.
*  As even the BBC have noted, over 80% of the cross-border attacks between Israel and Lebanon
*  since last October have been perpetrated by Israel. And it is Israel with a hideous history
*  of mass slaughter in Lebanon. When they invaded in 1982, their mass butchery of civilians was so
*  hideous that even the US Republican President Ronald Reagan was repulsed. Ringing up the Israeli
*  Prime Minister Menachem Begin himself, the former leader of the Zionist terrorist organization,
*  the UGN, who slaughtered Palestinians and committed atrocities such as the King David Hotel bombing
*  in 1946. In that phone call, Reagan protested about what he called a Holocaust being perpetrated by
*  Israel. Israel's allies also perpetrated the mass slaughter of Sabra and Shatir, a refugee camp in
*  Lebanon in which Palestinian and Lebanese civilians were subjected to the most hideous
*  slaughter. And Israel's Minister of Defense, Ariel Sharon, at the time was found responsible
*  for this atrocity by an Israeli commission that did not stop him later becoming Israeli Prime Minister.
*  In the 2006 invasion, Israel also developed the Dahir Doctrine, which involved attacking
*  civilian infrastructure and civilian targets in order to try and make the civilian population
*  turn against Hezbollah, using violence against civilians for political ends. We have a word for
*  that in the English dictionary called terrorism. Indeed, other Israeli politicians speaking to
*  Israeli audiences are making their intentions clear, like Amekai Chikli, the Israeli Minister
*  for the Asper affairs. Today, he tweeted, in Hebrew, Lebanon, even though it has a flag and
*  even though it has political institutions, does not meet the definition of a country.
*  He's declared that the Lebanese government is not a sovereign entity and further declared
*  that neither Syria or Iraq qualify for the definitive state either. He's demanded a
*  re-roaring of the border with Lebanon, which means depopulation and annexing southern Lebanon,
*  justified as creating a security buffer. So when you see these absurd CGI graphic videos offered up
*  by the Israeli army as evidence that buildings across southern Lebanon contain missiles with
*  schools and hospitals shown as military bases, you should be horrified. This is what they did in
*  Gaza to justify the mass destruction of civilian infrastructure. The only evidence offered up
*  being exactly these sorts of absurd graphics. Indeed, the Foreign Minister of Israel, Israel
*  Katz, tweeted a truly bizarre CGI picture of Hezbollah's leader sitting in the home of a woman
*  crying. He tweeted,
*  Well, again, this is simply justifying the mass force displacement of civilians. We have a word
*  for that, a term for that, ethnic cleansing and the mass slaughter of civilians on the
*  grounds that every Lebanese civilian killed is in fact a human shield whose death can be blamed on
*  the enemy. How does civilian even know they were hidden? They were near such weapons if they were
*  hidden. Let's be clear about what's happening here. Israel has unleashed a genocidal frenzy against
*  Gaza. It has achieved mass destruction and death. No question about that, but it has brought very
*  few of its hostages alive through military means and it has failed to defeat Hamas by military
*  means. It will never do that. That itself is the basis of the conflict in turn with Hezbollah.
*  But Israel's only response is mass slaughter and now that threatens to massively expand the blood
*  bath on a regional level. Israel is already unleashing mass death as we see against Lebanon.
*  All of this is being licensed and indeed armed by the United States, which is allowing Israel to
*  unleash deadly mayhem on a mass scale. While the consequences are going to be grave,
*  not least for the West, which keeps telling the world, as I say, that Arab life is cheap to the
*  point of being meaningless. The world has listened and the blowback against the West, I fear, will be
*  brutal for generations to come. Please like and subscribe, leave your thoughts, your comments.
