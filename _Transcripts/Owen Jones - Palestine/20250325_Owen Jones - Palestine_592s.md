# Israel MURDERS Journalist Hossam Shabat - To SILENCE Truth About War Crimes
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU)
*  who was only 23. Hassan Shabat was a Palestinian journalist, a courageous journalist, an inspiring [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=0.0s)]
*  journalist who covered Israel's genocide against the Palestinian people whilst working [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=7.34s)]
*  for Al Jazeera. Yesterday he was assassinated by the Israeli army in a targeted attack on [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=13.06s)]
*  his car in northern Gaza. Just an hour before he had reported the killing of Mohammed Mansour, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=19.02s)]
*  a fellow journalist at Palestine Today, his last assignment was reporting on Israel's [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=25.78s)]
*  slaughter of a colleague just before he was to suffer the same fate. He was only 23. More [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=32.42s)]
*  than 200 Palestinian journalists had already been killed by the Israeli state before Hassan [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=40.900000000000006s)]
*  Shabat. This is the biggest massacre of journalists in human history. Hassan Shabat was someone [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=47.0s)]
*  who did his job in impossible apocalyptic conditions with courage, commitment, clarity [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=53.1s)]
*  and persistence. We learned so much about the depravity of Israel's genocide from [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=60.260000000000005s)]
*  his work. Dropsite News published his last ever piece written before he died, headlined [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=68.82000000000001s)]
*  report from the front line of Israel's war of annihilation. Let me read one paragraph [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=74.14s)]
*  so we can bear witness through Hassan Shabat's work. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=80.34s)]
*  In the first six days of this renewed military operation, northern Gaza witnessed four bloody [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  massacres. The most notable was the Mubarak family massacre, which took place as a family [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=89.74000000000001s)]
*  were gathering in mourning to offer their condolences to Dr. Salim Mubarak. In an instant, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=94.58s)]
*  their collective grieving was turned into a sea of blood and body parts. The entire [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=100.98s)]
*  Dr. Salim, his wife, his children, his parents, no one survived. One eyewitness summed it [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=107.06s)]
*  up plainly, they were all killed. The victims were not on a battlefield, but in a house [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=115.7s)]
*  of mourning. It was a crime in every sense of the word. Let me read another paragraph. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=121.98s)]
*  When I arrived on the scene, I wasn't ready for the horror before my eyes. The streets [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=129.42000000000002s)]
*  were filled with the dead. Under every stone lay a martyr. Dozens were crying for help [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=133.74s)]
*  from underneath the rubble of their homes, but there was no one to respond. Screams filled [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=138.94s)]
*  the air while everyone stood helpless. My tears didn't stop. The scenes were more [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=144.14000000000001s)]
*  than any human being could bear. The ambulances were filled with corpses, their bodies and [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=149.78s)]
*  limbs piled on top and entwined with one another. We could no longer distinguish between children [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=155.26000000000002s)]
*  and men, between the injured and the dead. He was only 23, and yet Hossam Shaba achieved [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=161.58s)]
*  far more and changed so many more people than the vast majority ever achieved in far greater [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=168.18s)]
*  lifespans. That's why the Israeli state killed him. They had repeatedly threatened him and [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=172.58s)]
*  bombed his home, as he recounted. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=177.34s)]
*  Last year, the IDF smeared six journalists as Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists, using [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=191.58s)]
*  the sort of confected evidence they're notorious for. A classic example, incidentally, of every [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=215.58s)]
*  accusation is a confession given the number of Israeli journalists who are IDF reservists. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=219.62s)]
*  One of the Palestinian journalists smeared by Israel was Hossam Shaba. As I wrote at [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=225.3s)]
*  the time, these are six of the last surviving leading Palestinian journalists in Gaza. Israel [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=229.78s)]
*  has just placed a target on their backs with no evidence. Now Israel seeks to exterminate [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=233.9s)]
*  some of the only remaining eyes the world has to see the war crimes committed in Gaza. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=238.54000000000002s)]
*  That's why they killed him, because he offered the world his eyes to see Israel's war crimes. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=244.1s)]
*  He was only 23, but he was loved not least by his own people. This interaction with [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=249.02s)]
*  the little girl in Gaza encapsulated that love. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=252.98000000000002s)]
*  Last month, he was reunited with his mother for the first time in 492 days. Less than [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=279.02s)]
*  six weeks later, she was mourning his slaughter at the hands of the Israeli army. He was only [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=302.74s)]
*  23, and yet tens of thousands of Israel's victims were younger than him, and he fearlessly [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=326.62s)]
*  covered a genocide which has slaughtered so many Palestinian children. So many of his [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=331.62s)]
*  also young colleagues were butchered as well, like Ismail Al Ghul, another Al Jazeera journalist, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=336.14s)]
*  and Hassan Hamad. Last October, with both killed, he posted a picture of him beside [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=340.7s)]
*  them both with his infectious smile, and the caption, I promise you guys I'm still carrying [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=345.54s)]
*  the torch. Rest in peace, my beloved Ismail and Hassan. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=350.7s)]
*  He was only 23, but he had wisdom way beyond his years, wisdom many people never gained. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=356.02s)]
*  That wisdom defined his last message, penned so it could be released in the event of his [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=360.54s)]
*  murder. And this is what he said. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=365.98s)]
*  If you're reading this, it means I have been killed, most likely targeted, by these [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=369.1s)]
*  Israeli occupation forces. When this all began, I was only 21 years old, a college student [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=373.14000000000004s)]
*  with dreams like anyone else. For the past 18 months, I've dedicated every moment of [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=378.98s)]
*  my life to my people. I documented the horrors in northern Gaza minute by minute, determined [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=383.42s)]
*  to show the world the truth they tried to bury. I slept on pavements and schools in [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=388.22s)]
*  tents anywhere I could. Each day was a battle for survival. I endured hunger for months, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=392.18s)]
*  yet I never left my people's side. By God, I fulfilled my duties as a journalist, I risked [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=396.62s)]
*  everything to report the truth, and now I am finally at rest, something I haven't [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=401.58000000000004s)]
*  known in the past 18 months. I did all this because I believe in the Palestinian cause. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=405.1s)]
*  I believe this land is ours, and it has been the highest honour of my life to die defending [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=410.06s)]
*  it and serving its people. I ask you now, do not stop speaking about Gaza. Do not let [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=415.66s)]
*  the world look away. Keep fighting, keep telling our stories until Palestine is free. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=422.74s)]
*  The least we owe to Hassan Shabab, the least we owe to the countless Palestinians murdered [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=429.74s)]
*  by Israel's industrialised killing machine, is to keep speaking about Gaza, is to not [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=436.42s)]
*  look away, and is to keep fighting. Those of us in nations such as the US, Britain, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=442.62s)]
*  Germany have special responsibilities. Our states have played pivotal roles in this genocide, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=448.06s)]
*  as they have played pivotal roles in the oppression of the Palestinian people. Indeed, our states [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=453.98s)]
*  have helped to murder Hassan Shabab and countless other Palestinians like him as well. Hassan [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=459.26s)]
*  Shabab had to speak the truth whilst living in an apocalyptic landscape, deprived of food [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=463.9s)]
*  and the essentials of life, constantly under bombardment, a tiny strip of land no bigger [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=471.42s)]
*  than East London, being bombed and bombed and bombed again. His friends, colleagues, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=477.94s)]
*  loved ones killed, constantly fearing for his life, knowing that every moment could [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=483.06s)]
*  be his last until it was. He was only 23, but it's up to us to ensure that his legacy [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=486.5s)]
*  lives on for the generations to come, and that must mean not just ending this genocide, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=491.3s)]
*  but the abomination that is Israel's Western facilitated subjugation of the Palestinian people. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=496.02s)]
*  And one final thing, most Western media outlets have had nothing to say about Hassan Shabab [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=502.5s)]
*  and his killing, or his colleague Mohammed Mansour also killed by Israel yesterday, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=508.02s)]
*  just as they've had nothing to say about the biggest slaughter of journalists in history. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=512.9s)]
*  Imagine watching your colleagues exterminated in an unprecedented murderous frenzy as they [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=518.9s)]
*  report the truth of what is being facilitated by your own government and say nothing, nothing [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=523.94s)]
*  at all, not a single word about their fate, nothing of any meaning or substance. Well, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=528.1s)]
*  to my colleagues with those courageous exceptions, you disgust me, shame on you and shame on you [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=533.3000000000001s)]
*  forever, you'll never be forgiven. This will haunt you for the rest of your life and we will hold [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=539.7800000000001s)]
*  you to account as well. You see, these are real journalists in Palestine who have risked everything, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=543.62s)]
*  who have paid the ultimate price to let the world know the truth about one of the great horrors of [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=548.1s)]
*  our age. And most Western journalists have chosen, freely chosen to be complicit in that crime. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=552.82s)]
*  History will damn them for it and they will, in time, be held accountable for what they have done. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=558.82s)]
*  So let's honour the memory of Hassan Shabab and take his courage, his clarity, his determination [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=564.6600000000001s)]
*  and keep speaking up and keep fighting until Palestine is free. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkbORMEWhU&t=569.62s)]
