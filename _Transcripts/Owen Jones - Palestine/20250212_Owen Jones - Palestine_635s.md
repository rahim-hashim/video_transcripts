# Israel Plots To DESTROY CEASEFIRE - Then Finish Gaza Off With Trump's Support
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI)
*  Here's where all this is heading. With Israel deliberately sabotaging the so-called ceasefire [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=0.0s)]
*  deal, Israel not simply resuming its genocidal onslaught against the people of Gaza this [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=4.96s)]
*  weekend, but escalating it to unparalleled levels. An Israeli minister has made clear [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=10.08s)]
*  what this means. Now before I read to you what this minister has said, a key ally of [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=15.56s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, and describing it as chilling, I'm afraid really doesn't do it justice, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=20.740000000000002s)]
*  let's just begin by listening to what Donald Trump said, which is what this Israeli politician [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=26.799999999999997s)]
*  is responding to. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=34.8s)]
*  So Trump has said that if all the hostages aren't released, let all hell break out. We [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=56.72s)]
*  should note that all the hostages being released this Saturday wasn't part of the ceasefire [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=81.8s)]
*  agreement. Three hostages were due to be released. And more to the point, it is Israel, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=85.24s)]
*  which has violated the agreement over and over again, killing multiple Palestinians in Gaza, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=89.32s)]
*  refusing, crucially, humanitarian aid, which was promised, preventing seriously ill patients from [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=94.44s)]
*  travelling to receive medical treatment, including children with cancer, blocking talks on the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=100.6s)]
*  second phase of the ceasefire deal from progressing. And that's before we even discuss the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=105.08s)]
*  murderous campaign against the Palestinians that they've unleashed in the West Bank. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=110.44s)]
*  Now, as the New York Times reports, the current standoff stems in part from Hamas's accusation [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=114.76s)]
*  that Israel has not upheld its promises for the first phase of the ceasefire. Israel was required [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=119.88000000000001s)]
*  to send hundreds of thousands of tents into Gaza, a promise that Hamas says Israel has not kept. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=125.64s)]
*  Speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, three Israeli officials and two [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  mediators said that Hamas's claims were accurate. The New York Times goes on to say, regardless, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=136.68s)]
*  officials and commentators say this dispute can be resolved relatively easily if Israel allows more [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=143.8s)]
*  aid to Gaza. The more serious issue is the widespread perception that Mr Netanyahu is [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=149.24s)]
*  undermining the negotiations over an extended truce. That's what the New York Times said. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=155.24s)]
*  Now, the Israeli newspaper Ma'ariv also reports that the Israeli and security establishment confirmed [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=159.8s)]
*  that so far, Hamas has not violated the ceasefire deal. And this weekend, the Israeli newspaper [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=165.16s)]
*  Haaretz ran a story headlined, Israeli sources believe Netanyahu intends to derail Gaza's ceasefire [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=171.0s)]
*  as delegation heads to Doha, with an Israeli source quoted as saying, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=176.84s)]
*  it's a show. Netanyahu is signalling quite clearly that he doesn't want to move to the next phase. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=180.6s)]
*  He's sending a team without a mandate and without the ability to do anything. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=185.4s)]
*  Another Israeli source said the following, the process is working, hostages are being released, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=189.0s)]
*  but Hamas is doing this with the expectation of a second stage, leading to a full ceasefire [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=193.56s)]
*  and Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Once Hamas realises there won't be a second stage, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=198.84s)]
*  they may not complete the first. That is, the Israeli state is lying through its teeth about [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=203.96s)]
*  the ceasefire deal and is preparing to regime its genocidal offensive come what may and is simply [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=208.6s)]
*  looking for an excuse. Now, it should also be noted that Yair Lapid, the former Israeli Prime [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=213.64000000000001s)]
*  Minister and opposition figure who nonetheless has supported his state's genocidal mayhem, said in [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=218.2s)]
*  an interview this week, Hamas cannot launch an attack on us. October the 7th is far away. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=223.0s)]
*  I believe there is a chance that this is another semi-artificial crisis that can be resolved by [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=228.84s)]
*  Saturday. We need to work with the mediators correctly and intentionally. Hamas is responding [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=233.08s)]
*  to the fact that the Prime Minister does not want to move to the next stage. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=237.56s)]
*  Now let me read to you what Shlomo Qaahi, Netanyahu's Minister of Communications [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=241.96s)]
*  and a member of the ruling party Likud, has come out and said about Trump's proposal. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=247.16s)]
*  This is the chilling, to say the least, tweet I was referring to in the context that I've just [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=251.56s)]
*  set out. When dealing with a Nazi terrorist organisation, one must be prepared for such [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=257.96s)]
*  violations. Hamas thinks it can gamble on the lives of our hostages, a grave mistake. No more [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=263.48s)]
*  beats, no more games. The response must be exactly as President Trump has suggested. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=268.68s)]
*  Completely halt humanitarian aid, cut off electricity, water and communications, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=273.16s)]
*  and use brutal and disproportionate force until the abductees return. At the same time, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=277.47999999999996s)]
*  clear Gaza of all, in quotes, uninvolved. The immigration plan must begin immediately. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=283.23999999999995s)]
*  It is time to open the gates of hell on Hamas and this time without any restrictions on our [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=288.67999999999995s)]
*  heroic fighters. There is nothing subtle about this. Cutting off all the essentials of life, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=293.56s)]
*  all of the things that make the continued existence of human life possible. Use brutal [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=298.12s)]
*  and disproportionate force. Ethnically cleanse the entire population. Behave this time without [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=302.6s)]
*  any restrictions on Israeli soldiers as if they were somehow acting with restraint over the last [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=308.04s)]
*  16 months of genocidal atrocities. Now Trump held a press conference with Jordan's unelected King [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=312.44s)]
*  Abdullah II and reiterated his commitment to the grave war crime of ethnically cleansing the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=318.28000000000003s)]
*  population of Gaza. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=323.16s)]
*  to buy. There's nothing to buy. We will have Gaza. What is that? No reason to buy. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=332.6s)]
*  There is nothing to buy. It's Gaza. It's a war torn area. We're going to take it. We're going to hold [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=338.84000000000003s)]
*  it. We're going to cherish it. We're going to get it going eventually where a lot of jobs are going [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=345.08000000000004s)]
*  to be created for the people in the Middle East. It's going to be for the people in the Middle East, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=352.04s)]
*  but I think it could be a diamond. It could be an absolute tremendous asset for the Middle East [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=355.96000000000004s)]
*  and you're going to have peace. It's going to bring peace in the Middle East. Gaza the way it [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=361.8s)]
*  is right now. Every 10 years you're going to have the same thing happening. I've watched it so long, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=365.56s)]
*  all the death and destruction of Gaza. The civilization has been wiped out in Gaza. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=370.92s)]
*  Now it's going to be a tremendous thing. It's fronting on the sea. It's going to be a great [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=376.76s)]
*  economic development job. It's going to put people to work, a lot of people to work, and those people [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=383.24s)]
*  are going to be from the Middle East. Clearly this is Derein stating we're not going to have [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=387.8s)]
*  to buy Gaza. We're going to have Gaza. Speaking here like a fascist dictator. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=393.64s)]
*  Notice well as discussing the death and destruction of Gaza, he says that a civilization [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=399.40000000000003s)]
*  has been wiped out in Gaza. Here he's admitting that Israel has committed genocide, though he [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=405.88s)]
*  probably doesn't realize it. Again, as article second of the Genocide Convention clearly states, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=410.52s)]
*  the definition of genocide includes deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=415.08s)]
*  calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part. Then listen to this. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=419.15999999999997s)]
*  Deranged, completely deranged. Again, speaking like a fascist dictator. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=430.52s)]
*  Then listen to King Abdullah the second. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=434.03999999999996s)]
*  Discussions in Riyadh. I think the point is how to make this work in a way that is [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=445.96s)]
*  good for everybody. Obviously we have to look at the best interests of the United States, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=451.0s)]
*  of the people in the region, especially to my people of Jordan. We're going to have some [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=456.44s)]
*  interesting discussions today. I think one of the things that we can do right away is take 2,000 [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=460.44s)]
*  children that are either cancer children or in very ill state to Jordan as quickly as possible [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=467.15999999999997s)]
*  and then wait for, I think, the Egyptians to present their plan on how we can work with the [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=474.28000000000003s)]
*  president to work on the Gaza challenges. Well, how utterly pathetic. That's certainly [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=478.52000000000004s)]
*  what I thought. Other observers would say that he's trying to bargain there, trying to flatter [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=484.20000000000005s)]
*  Donald Trump and find ways of getting leverage rather than antagonizing him. Now it should be [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=490.84000000000003s)]
*  noted that the brilliant journalist Richard Sanders, who mentions also another brilliant [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=497.08000000000004s)]
*  journalist Peter O'Born, says the following, King Abdullah had no choice in D.C. but to be [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=501.32s)]
*  placatory to Trump, but he's clearly playing for time to see the Arabs can agree a unified position. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=505.48s)]
*  When Peter O'Born and myself were in Amman last week, that's the capital of Jordan, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=510.68s)]
*  the dynasty's position was crystal clear. Now what that position was, which he wrote in an article [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=514.2s)]
*  for Middle East Eye along with Peter O'Born, was that Jordan would literally go to war if [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=519.64s)]
*  Palestinians were expelled into its territory, not least because Jordan would be fatally destabilized, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=523.48s)]
*  unable to accommodate an influx of refugees, regardless of facilitating the crime of ethnic [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=528.04s)]
*  cleansing. Now in a statement after the meeting, the King stated, I reiterated Jordan's steadfast [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=533.48s)]
*  position against the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. This is the unified [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=538.36s)]
*  Arab position. Rebuilding Gaza without displacing the Palestinians and addressing the dire [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=543.0s)]
*  humanitarian situation should be the priority for all. Furthermore, the Egyptian dictator, Sisi, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=547.4s)]
*  was reportedly furious with the U.S. and Israel, sending clear messages to Washington behind the [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=553.32s)]
*  scenes, cancelling an upcoming visit to C. Trump, telling the U.S. there was no prospect of the [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=559.24s)]
*  ethnic cleansing plan happening and no Egyptian land would be allocated for it. Indeed, instead, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=565.4000000000001s)]
*  the Egyptian regime has come up with a counter proposal, declaring its intention to present an [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=570.7600000000001s)]
*  integrated vision for the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip in a way that guarantees the survival [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=575.1600000000001s)]
*  of the Palestinian people on their land and in a manner consistent with the legitimate and legal [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=579.72s)]
*  rights of this people. Look, whether the ceasefire collapses this weekend or after, it's screamingly [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=584.0400000000001s)]
*  clear what's happening here. The Israeli state believes it has a unique opportunity, with the [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=588.52s)]
*  backing of the U.S. president, to finally dispose of the Palestinian people in Gaza and then do the [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=592.9200000000001s)]
*  same in the West Bank and then forge a greater Israel. A genocide in plain sight. No one can [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=597.64s)]
*  say they didn't know. And as I keep saying, all of those who cheered this on and facilitated this [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=604.12s)]
*  must face a reckoning. Please like and subscribe, leave your thoughts and your comments. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiqzvkHvRXI&t=608.76s)]
