# 'ERASE All Palestinians' - Popular Israeli Podcasters Claim Most Share Their Genocidal Fantasy
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [September 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uOJAKbGpg)
*  This is one of the most disturbing things that I've listened to for a very long time.
*  It's disturbing because of the content, which is unashamed, loud and proud,
*  genocidal, incitement and intense, and because of the casual, jokey, carefree manner in which the
*  two Israeli hosts speak about the mass extermination of the Palestinian people.
*  It's the two co-hosts of an Israeli podcast named Two Nice Jewish Boys,
*  self-described longest running Israeli podcast in English. The hosts are named Nior, Menenga,
*  and Eitan Weinstein. Let's start by listening to this first clip.
*  So I would, if you gave me a button to just erase Gaza, every single living being in Gaza
*  would no longer be living tomorrow. I would press it in a second.
*  That's just, I think, I mean, I think most Israelis-
*  If that's the choice. Yeah.
*  Yeah. No, even if it's not like right now.
*  Yeah. I would press it right now.
*  Yeah. Same with the territories.
*  I would press it right now. No choice. No, you know, Sean is safe at home.
*  God willing. I don't know. I haven't spoken to her in like an hour.
*  No, I'm saying for the chance.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  I would press it right now. Give me that button and press it right now.
*  There you go.
*  And I think most Israelis would. Yeah.
*  Most Jewish Israelis.
*  They wouldn't post, they wouldn't talk about it like I am.
*  They wouldn't post, they wouldn't say I pressed it.
*  Yeah. But they would-
*  They don't have balls of steel like you.
*  But they would press it, right? Like if they were in a closet alone,
*  they wouldn't even hesitate. Someone came to them and said,
*  no one will know. You press this, all the Palestinians are gone.
*  You'd be like, is there another one?
*  Now, before you think, well, who are these people?
*  Clearly, they're just two nut jobs who are totally unrepresentative.
*  One of them, Nair Menenga, worked for the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*  on his 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 campaigns. In his words, doing chatbots,
*  digital data projections and viral video creation.
*  He was also, in his words, responsible for managing
*  all the digital channels of the Prime Minister.
*  He says one of his main projects was Netanyahu's Facebook and Telegram chatbots,
*  which he initiated and managed and which he boasts received vast coverage across the Israeli
*  media. His website shows him posing with Netanyahu over and over again,
*  filming him at his desk, looking at their work together, which Netanyahu looks very pleased with.
*  They're wearing different clothes in the photos.
*  You can see that this is indeed a long standing working relationship.
*  Now, as a journalist who posted this disgusting clip put it,
*  this is Radio Rwanda in full effect here. This refers to the 1994 Rwandan genocide
*  perpetrated by Hutu extremists against the Tutsi minority when radio was used to whip up and incite
*  genocide against the Tutsi minority. Now, this clip isn't an outlier,
*  to say the least, in terms of their content. Let's listen to another clip.
*  It starts by discussing the outbreak of polio in Gaza.
*  Doing it to appease the...
*  Because we're looking for international legitimacy. No one actually gives a shit.
*  Zero people in Israel, if you go up to them, are you like,
*  do you care if this baby in Gaza gets polio? They'll be like, I don't fucking...
*  Yeah, leave open, I would care.
*  Yeah, okay, there'll be like 20 people who care and they're all wearing Meret shirts.
*  Fuck them. But seriously, nobody would give a shit. They'd be like, leave me alone, man. I'm
*  trying to like buy ice cream for Shabbat. Like, fuck off. I don't care about this Gaza polio.
*  Also, as long as they're in their Nakba state in their tents, you know, and we're
*  living still like, you know, if you put aside the news, day to day is okay.
*  Yesterday we went to a concert in a con park. We had lots of fun, me and my girlfriend.
*  We danced and it was amazing. And you can't help but think like, it's nice to know
*  that you're dancing in a concert while hundreds of thousands of Gazans are,
*  you know, homeless, like sitting in a tent and eating.
*  Makes it even better. More enjoyable concert. If only they put the live video footage of Gaza.
*  But seriously, you guys like that. That's what the that's what people don't understand. Look,
*  like I know that you guys might be appalled by this. Some of the listeners, but seriously,
*  this is how Israelis feel. And you might think that Eitan Weinstein and or who like refuses to
*  kind of back me up on it publicly. I'm from the UN. Yeah, he's the UN. But you might think I'm
*  extreme. But it's I have conversations with lots of people, co workers, friends, people enjoy
*  knowing that they are suffering. No, also, it's very prominent on Twitter.
*  Well, it's one thing not to care about babies dying of polio and stating it. It's also the
*  fact they overtly state that they actively enjoy the suffering of Gaza, that they actually enjoy
*  the contrast between their own happy lives and the suffering of Gaza. Because I've often thought
*  about the almost historically unique contrast between this tiny strip of land Gaza, the size
*  of East London bombed with the equivalent explosive power of several Hiroshima bombs,
*  tens of thousands slaughtered many, many more horrifically injured, almost its entire population
*  displaced the hunger, the disease, the destruction of the health care system, the utterly apocalyptic
*  conditions, the contrast between that, and just over the barrier people living the life of a rich
*  western nation going to sushi restaurants drinking until they're sick, going to yes,
*  concerts, nightclubs, having Tinder dates, going on luxury yachts, just doing mundane things like
*  going to the supermarket, or the cinema working in an office somewhere. The contrast between that is
*  so unbelievably insane and grotesque. It's just on another level. But what these podcasters are
*  saying is that they enjoy that contrast, they're getting off on that contrast, the knowledge that
*  they are living their best lives while so close to Palestinians who are suffering the most
*  extreme and disturbing fates imaginable. They enjoy it. Now I'm just going to share one of the
*  clip. He as a Jewish people bring flourishing to a place while the Palestinians just bring
*  shit culture and destruction. It's like, no one talks about the fact everything is about comparing
*  us, right? And saying, oh, well, what would we do in this situation? What would they do in this
*  situation? And trying to, it's like, no, we are, we're better. We're just better. We're better.
*  I don't know how else to put it. Sorry, not sorry. Sorry, not sorry. We're better. We have a better
*  culture. We're a better society. And yes, it would be a great thing if we took over all the West Bank
*  and they weren't there. Well, this is the rationalisation which is always given to colonialism,
*  which underpins colonialism, not least colonialism in its most murderous incarnation. We are a
*  superior people. They are inferior. Therefore we can steal their land and we can murder them.
*  Firstly, any society which commits genocide, and these two are clearly genocidal maniacs,
*  is not a superior society. To the contrary, it's a society which must be defeated. Now, to be clear,
*  doesn't mean defeating its people. It means a new society has to be born on that land in which
*  Jewish people and Palestinians are equal, where they have equal civil, political, religious rights,
*  the full shebang. Secondly, and I'm going to say this as a general rule, I do not invoke Nazi
*  comparisons when it comes to Israel and Israelis, but I have a very straightforward view, which is
*  whatever your background, whatever your ethnicity, if you are going to decide to sound like a Nazi
*  and both these two people don't just sound like Nazis, they sound like unsubtle caricatures
*  of Nazis, that does not apply. And the Nazis spoke exactly the same way as these two people.
*  They pointed to German civilisation and culture and emphasised its purported superiority over that
*  of Slavic culture, which they deemed to be monstrously inferior and therefore that was
*  justification for taking their land, for Lebensraum, stealing and colonising its land, and slaughtering
*  its people. Now these two disgusting little men have relished the outrage. Michael Rosen,
*  a brilliant Jewish British author, quoted them one of their despicable clips with forgive us if we
*  don't give a shit if everyone there dies, quoting them, and they responded with a gif of a man
*  hammering a red button very hard accompanied by a kiss emoji. Of course, they were talking about
*  hitting a big red button where they could exterminate the entire Palestinian people.
*  Just two final points in response to, I've seen this on Twitter, this is a fringe opinion,
*  their extremists are not representative. Well, we've already established that one of them
*  worked closely with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Okay, cool, if they're just
*  unrepresentative extremists, then it will be very easy for the Israeli state to prosecute them,
*  won't it? Because you see, Israel is legally obliged to prosecute these two people. The 1948
*  Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide prohibits five acts,
*  and one of those acts is the direct and public incitement to commit genocide. It makes that clear,
*  it is one of five offences under that genocide convention. Well, there's nothing subtle about
*  what they say, you can't use some pathetic weasel words to pretend these people didn't really mean
*  what they went out and said very clearly, explicitly and unapologetically. This is a slam dunk,
*  clear cut case. Israel was a signatory to this convention, born as it was out of the Holocaust,
*  and Israel put this convention, translated it into its own law on its own statute books in 1950.
*  And get this, it made under Israeli law, the direct public incitement to commit genocide,
*  a capital offence. That is, it is, theoretically at least, under Israeli law, a crime punishable
*  by the death penalty to incite genocide in the way these two gentlemen clearly have. I don't
*  support capital punishment in any circumstances, but I do believe Israel should abide by its own
*  law in this case on prosecuting the public incitement of genocide as per its legal obligations
*  under the Genocide Convention of 1948, which of course it implemented under its own law.
*  To further underline this point, the International Court of Justice, the highest court on earth,
*  in January, in its provisional orders, ordered Israel to prosecute those guilty of the public
*  incitement of genocide. So as per international law and Israeli law, these two men will not be
*  prosecuted, right? Won't they? What is there to lose? I mean, if they're just fringe extremists,
*  no one's going to care, are they? There'll be no outcry. Israeli society will rally behind
*  that decision. People will go, look, whatever you think about Gaza, oh my God, this is outrageous,
*  despicable. Of course, our own law says public incitement of genocide, this law, they definitely
*  publicly incite genocide, bankerite, lock them up. This brings shame on Israeli society, it brings
*  shame on Israel. We don't want the world to think this. The least we can do is to prosecute them
*  as per our own legal obligations under our own law. What will be the problem? Where's the obstacle?
*  It's a slandered case. They need to be sent to prison, not executed. I'm not saying Israeli law
*  should take it to quite the level which in theory it could be implemented. Now, just in
*  terms of what they represent, they gleefully retweeted a poll which a pro-Palestinian account
*  shared underlining how many Israelis share their genocidal ideations. Now, back in January,
*  when Gaza was already being completely wiped off the face of the earth, a poll of Jewish Israelis
*  found that 50.8% thought there was an appropriate use of force in Gaza. They thought this mass
*  obliteration of Gaza was appropriate, but 43.4% thought too little force was being used.
*  They looked at the mass destruction in Gaza and they thought, not enough, we want more. What does
*  that even look like? That just means presumably killing everyone. Just 3.2% thought there was too
*  much force being used. Now, the polling also finds that 60% of Jewish Israeli citizens oppose
*  all humanitarian aid being allowed into Gaza. That would mean all Palestinians in Gaza dying.
*  They would all die. They would have none of the necessities they need for survival
*  and they would die. You could not possibly not know that if you heard that question asked to answer
*  it. Another poll has found 47% of Jewish Israelis don't believe Israel should obey international law
*  as it prosecutes its onslaught against Gaza. Well, two thirds oppose criminal charges for soldiers
*  who raped Palestinian detainees. Now, there are courageous Israelis. It's very important to make
*  that point. They're very courageous Israelis. I've interviewed them on this channel and I'll
*  continue to do so. They stand in the best tradition of Jewish humanism and emancipatory politics,
*  without which I would note the left, as you and I understand it, would simply not even exist. They
*  are courageous in Israel, however, because they are so isolated. This is what settler colonialism
*  does. It requires the total dehumanization of those whose land you have stolen and colonized,
*  who don't like their land being stolen and colonized and act accordingly. That is a lesson
*  which has been learned with hideous consequences over and over again throughout our history.
*  And it invariably leads to genocide. So to conclude, listen to these two men as they relish
*  their genocidal incitement and intent and hatred. Believe them. They mean what they say.
*  And this underlines why those of us in countries which Israel depends on for its weapons, aid,
*  diplomatic support, it underlines why we must act. Because genocidal mania and radicalization
*  is simply too widespread and mainstream and respectable in Israeli society for any hope
*  for an end to this genocide to come from within Israeli society itself. Please like and subscribe.
