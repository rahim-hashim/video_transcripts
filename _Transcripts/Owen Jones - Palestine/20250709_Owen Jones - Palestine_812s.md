# Israel's OWN LAWYER Admits Grave War Crimes
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM)
*  Okay, this is big. Israel's own lawyer has denounced his own state for its intent to commit [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=0.0s)]
*  a war crime and crime against humanity. This is Eyal Benvenisti, who represented Israel, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=6.72s)]
*  the International Court of Justice, the highest court on earth. This is where Israel was forced [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=12.72s)]
*  to defend itself against genocide charges brought by South Africa. Let's be clear here by the way, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=18.0s)]
*  Benvenisti was completely and utterly wrong in his defense of Israel against the charge [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=23.6s)]
*  of genocide. Indeed, it is the consensus of genocide scholars, including Israeli genocide [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=29.36s)]
*  scholars such as Omar Batov, Rassigal, Amos Goldberg, Daniel Blattman, Dr. Shmuel Lederman, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=34.32s)]
*  that Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people in Gaza. The point here is that [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=40.16s)]
*  even Israel's own council, who was selected by his own state to defend it from accusations of [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=45.68s)]
*  genocide, has now come out to condemn Israel's plan to force the surviving population of Gaza [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=52.16s)]
*  into a concentration camp as a war crime and a crime against humanity. Now, indeed, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=57.68s)]
*  as Palestinian academic lawyer Nima Sultany notes, in 2020, Benvenisti authored a document [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=63.92s)]
*  rejecting the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court over Israel's crimes. Now, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=69.92s)]
*  some of you at this point might be going, well, duh, do we really need this Israeli lawyer to [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=75.92s)]
*  tell us that forcibly herding a civilian population to a concentration camp is a war crime and a crime [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=80.48s)]
*  against humanity? This is actually important, and let's explain why, and then I'll tell you what [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=84.56s)]
*  he said, as well as some other extremely crucial information that you need to know about the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=89.12s)]
*  genocide. This was brought to my attention by the brilliant academic Alonzo Gimendi, who of course [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  I've interviewed repeatedly on this channel, who tells me it's the big news of the moment amongst [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=99.04s)]
*  international legal scholars. If Israel's own lawyer, chosen by Israel to defend itself from [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=103.92s)]
*  criminal charges regarding its military conduct, is condemning it for war crimes and crimes against [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  humanity, there really is nowhere left to hide. Either for the Israeli state, or indeed the western [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=114.96s)]
*  governments who are facilitating this great crime of our age. E.L. Benvenisti has penned his article [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=121.44s)]
*  alongside the Israeli philosopher Chaim Gantz, and it's entitled Our Duty to Explain Israel's [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=126.63999999999999s)]
*  Operation to Concentrate and Move Population in Gaza is a Manifest War Crime. As they know, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=131.68s)]
*  this objective is not about temporary concentration and evacuation to minimize [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=137.68s)]
*  harm to non-combatants during the execution of the purported goal of defeating Hamas, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=142.16s)]
*  but rather concentration and evacuation as an objective in and of itself. It is a measure of [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  control that may even create conditions for, in quotes, voluntary and then migration. It's important [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=152.88s)]
*  to note or to emphasize that voluntary is correctly in scare quotes. If you wipe a land from the face [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=159.52s)]
*  of the earth, destroy its homes, schools, hospitals, all the other basic pillars of modern [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=165.04s)]
*  civilization, if you slaughter a significant proportion of its population, as well as [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=168.72s)]
*  repeatedly displacing, dispossessing, maiming, torturing, traumatizing, kidnapping, bereaving [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=172.88s)]
*  the survivors, if you deprive them of the essentials of life, like food, water, energy, shelter, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=177.44s)]
*  medicines, if in short you impose an apocalyptic, unlivable nightmare on them in their homeland, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=182.48s)]
*  discussing voluntary migration in these circumstances is clearly a depraved lie. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=188.64s)]
*  They quote Moshe Boghi Yalon, the former chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces, stating, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=193.76s)]
*  evacuating the entire population, call it ethnic cleansing, call it transfer, call it deportation, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=199.52s)]
*  it's a war crime, adding they're sending the soldiers to commit war crimes. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  They note that this isn't an evacuation of citizens from a war zone, which international [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  law recognizes the need or indeed obligation for in certain circumstances as long as certain [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=214.16s)]
*  requirements are met, such as protecting the evacuated population, ensuring the evacuation [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=218.96s)]
*  is temporary so they can return to their homes, that the areas they're evacuated to are protected, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  they can receive basic humanitarian assistance, the areas they're evacuated to are through defined [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=228.88s)]
*  humanitarian corridors, with civilians allowed sufficient time to reach those areas. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=235.12s)]
*  They note that what Israel is planning contradicts any of that, it's got nothing to do with it, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=239.84s)]
*  and thus constitutes deportation and or forcible transfer, making the operation they say, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=243.76s)]
*  a war crime. They say if this wasn't clear from the order, it was clearly explained by Israeli [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=249.67999999999998s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the Knesset, Israel's parliament in May, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=254.0s)]
*  we are demolishing more and more of their homes they've nowhere to return to. The only obvious [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  result will be the desire of the Gazans to emigrate outside the strip. Our main problem is the receiving [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  countries. It's just an example there by the way of the sort of statement which if the media did [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=267.36s)]
*  their jobs in the West would just be all everywhere, everyone would know about it. I mean that's his [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=272.24s)]
*  ready Prime Minister, he's not hiding his intent is he? He's just saying it out loud, but he knows [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=277.28s)]
*  he can say what he wants because he knows the vast majority of Western media outlets will just [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  pretend he never said it. But all these statements of criminal and genocidal intent just [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=286.4s)]
*  happen in a parallel universe, an alternative universe which has nothing to do their own, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=290.71999999999997s)]
*  and therefore instead Western media outlets can just instead regurgitate the press releases [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=296.23999999999995s)]
*  written in English by the press officers of the Israeli military which are tailor-made for gullible [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=301.52s)]
*  as slavishly loyal editors in the Western world. Now these two Israeli scholars add based on the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=309.12s)]
*  legal rulings following the wars in Yugoslavia, since the order constitutes part of a widespread [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=318.96s)]
*  or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, it fits the definition [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  for crime against humanity as stipulated by the Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=327.44s)]
*  They add another important detail, those who carry out this order will be forced to bear criminal [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=333.2s)]
*  liability for its execution. Indeed, while our focus here is on Israel's domestic criminal law, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=337.04s)]
*  it bears noting that the Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court, as well as the [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=341.6s)]
*  criminal codes of many countries specifically note that the defence of superior orders is not [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=344.88s)]
*  available for orders to commit crimes against humanity because such orders are manifestly [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=349.36s)]
*  unlawful. This refers to what was established in Nuremberg, that Israeli soldiers who act on [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=354.32000000000005s)]
*  this order are themselves criminally liable. This applies to the full range of war crimes and crimes [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=364.08s)]
*  against humanity committed by Israel. They conclude there is no moral or legal obligation [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=368.15999999999997s)]
*  to obey the order, but more importantly there is a moral and legal obligation to disobey it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=373.35999999999996s)]
*  It is not the violation of the order, but rather compliance with it that will express a refusal to [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=377.12s)]
*  obey the law on the part of the IDF, starting with the chief of staff who endorses the order [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=382.0s)]
*  all the way down to the soldiers who carry it out in Gaza. Now obviously I'm not here to praise [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=385.76s)]
*  E.L. Ben-Viniste, who fought against attempts to hold Israel to account for its grievous crimes, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=390.64s)]
*  both before and after the 7th October. He is an esteemed legal academic, the royal [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=395.92s)]
*  professor of international law at the University of Cambridge, and thus he has no excuses whatsoever. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=400.4s)]
*  The point is this intervention leaves Israel's cheerleaders once again with nowhere to hide, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=406.08s)]
*  it bolsters the case for the criminal complicity of Israel's allies such as the British government, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=410.56s)]
*  which for example continues to supply crucial components for the F-35 jets, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=414.88s)]
*  ready death and destruction of the people of Gaza, that alone makes it directly complicit in [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=419.2s)]
*  genocide. On this theme, let's hear from Ehud Elmah, the former Israeli Prime Minister, who was [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=424.08s)]
*  for decades in Israel's Likud party, Benjamin Netanyahu of course now leads that party. He was [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=429.44s)]
*  a key ally of Ariel Sharon, the former Israeli general and prime minister, and indeed war criminal. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=434.71999999999997s)]
*  Elmah recently publicly stated that Israel was committing war crimes involving the indiscriminate, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=439.28s)]
*  limitless cruel and criminal killings of civilians. Here he is being questioned by Andrew Ma on LBC. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=444.48s)]
*  He really wants to seem to want to remove all Palestinian Arabs out of Gaza if he possibly can. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=474.96000000000004s)]
*  Do you understand at this point which countries around the Arab world might conceivably take them? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=481.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, Elmah says that deportation is a fantasy, but in practice, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=504.48s)]
*  Israel will continue to impose and accelerate the imposition of intolerable conditions of life, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=532.64s)]
*  indeed by deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=540.16s)]
*  physical destruction in whole or in part, which of course is a crucial definition of genocide. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=544.8s)]
*  All of this facilitated by Israel's allies, including the British government, including [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=550.8s)]
*  the Foreign Secretary David Lammy. He was questioned in parliament this week, let's listen to what he [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=554.64s)]
*  said when he was asked about recognising the state of Palestine as other countries have done. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=559.04s)]
*  What's his argument here? That Britain can't support an independent state of Palestine because [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=577.5999999999999s)]
*  that will lead to Israel committing further war crimes and violations of international law? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=580.64s)]
*  Does he mean that diplomatic methods can't work? What exactly is his plan then? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=584.24s)]
*  What, how's he going to get Israel to do anything? To abide by his rhetorical calls for this or that? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=587.8399999999999s)]
*  Because he's sort of running out of everything, isn't he? I'll tell you what his plan is. It's [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=596.16s)]
*  to continue to arm Israel while occasionally getting one of his aides to penetrate, which is [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=600.64s)]
*  very disappointing what Israel's doing at the moment. He's asked about Israel breaching international law. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=605.04s)]
*  What way? That's a decision for a court, it's not a decision for the government. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=617.36s)]
*  The courts said it's a decision for the executive. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=623.92s)]
*  The courts in the recent F35 carve out case said that any decision in relation to sensitive and [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=627.4399999999999s)]
*  political issues are a matter for the executive, not the court. The court case that you're referring [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=633.52s)]
*  to, the Al-Hak court case, was in relation to arms exports and they've said that you're quite [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=640.0799999999999s)]
*  right that there was a decision for the executive. I've told you that I, as the executive, have made [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=645.6s)]
*  the decision. I made the decision in September. It has not changed. So even though Israel has [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=649.6800000000001s)]
*  committed every war crime there is to commit, every war crime in the block, the British government [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=654.32s)]
*  refuses to say they've committed war crimes, even though it's as obvious as the earth being round, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=658.48s)]
*  because that then would impose on them legal obligations like not supplying weapons, ending [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=662.64s)]
*  intelligence sharing, imposing sweeping sanctions. It would also expose their own legal liability [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=666.96s)]
*  because they have helped to facilitate these war crimes when they should have intervened earlier [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=672.24s)]
*  to end that complicity. They've got no problems whatsoever declaring Russia's committing war crimes. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=676.72s)]
*  They're not waiting for any court to declare that. I mean it's unfortunate that the MP didn't [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=681.04s)]
*  point that out. The court case referred to here is about the crucial components for F35 jets [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=684.48s)]
*  supplied by Israel in which government lawyers argued the decision over whether Israel was [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=689.52s)]
*  in violation of international law would be made by the government and now that's contradicted here. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=693.36s)]
*  So they just make a different case depending on the setting. Very convenient and helpful [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=697.76s)]
*  because then they can just keep getting away with saying not saying whether war crimes are happening [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=702.2399999999999s)]
*  which they know is happening. There's no, I mean again they're not going to be able to make, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ZQ2CRklHM&t=707.68s)]
