# Iran Attack On Israel Response Exposes Western Racism
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUvkus84H9I)
*  The ballistic missile attacks by Iran on Israel has certainly exposed one thing,
*  as if it wasn't exposed enough, which is the rampant, unashamed racism of
*  Western political and media elites when it comes to Palestine and Israel, how Palestinians are
*  dehumanised, how the worth of their lives is practically non-existent when it comes to those
*  elites. That's been clear for a very long time. But there are moments when this racism is so naked,
*  so shameless, so loud and proud, and this is one of them.
*  Now let's start with the official Israel Twitter account. And yes, it is deranged,
*  that a country has a troll Twitter account, appropriate in this case, and it posted video
*  footage of the Iranian missiles in the Israeli night sky. The caption of Israel's official Twitter
*  account was in capitals, this isn't normal, followed by every single one of these rockets
*  is meant to kill. That this isn't normal is deeply revealing. What they mean there is missiles
*  should only be raining down on the skies of Arab nations, not Israel. But what are the, every single
*  one of these rockets is meant to kill. What, unlike Israeli rockets, which are, what, tell me,
*  please enlighten me, are they designed to give their victims hugs and kisses? Now look, when
*  this was all happening, I had apologists for the Israeli state, a charming bunch at the best of
*  times, in my mentions on Twitter, going, oh, I bet you love this, I bet you're cheering us on,
*  I bet you couldn't enjoy this more, well, in slightly more colourful and abusive terms.
*  I'll also use some colourful language, no, you depraved bastards. You see, I'm on team
*  don't bomb things, you're the people who cheer bombing people, and bomb, bombs you have cheered on
*  a lot, a huge number of bombs you have been the cheerleaders for. Which unlike in this case,
*  I would know, not a single Israeli civilian was killed, but you have cheered on bombs which have
*  slaughtered tens of thousands, or indeed far more. Indeed, the captain of team bomb things is Israel,
*  which is responsible for the vast majority of bombings in the last year, slaughtering vast
*  numbers of innocent people, many of them kids. I don't want anyone to bomb anyone, and some of us
*  warned that continuing to do this in the case of Israel, engaging in genocidal mayhem, would only
*  cause a military escalation which people like myself oppose in all cases, while you line behind
*  a state which literally has officially declared its strategy to be escalate to de-escalate.
*  Now let's take this other example, shall we, from the Conservative Party leadership candidate
*  Tom Tuggenhout, who tweets, Iran's barbaric attack on Israel is a horrific escalation to
*  this conflict. Tonight, more than ever, I will be praying for Israel. If barbaric is the correct
*  term for this attack, which didn't kill a single Israeli civilian or soldier, and which was
*  objectively directed at military targets, what word would we use to describe the mass slaughter
*  of tens of thousands of people, including vast numbers of babies, toddlers, entire bloodlines,
*  whites from the face of the earth, incinerated, terrified families blown apart in their cars,
*  children shot in the head by snipers, most civilian infrastructure damaged or destroyed,
*  so Gaza now looks a different colour and texture when looked at from space. An entire population
*  Gaza deliberately starved by the Israeli state, don't take my word for it, take the word of two
*  US government agencies who have officially declared it to be so. I could go on. If this was barbaric,
*  then what words are used to describe the genocidal mayhem live streamed to us every single day?
*  Now Western leaders all publicly shared the horror, the fury, the condemnation.
*  As the brilliant British commentator Rachel Shabby put it, anyone can see the double standard in the
*  outpouring of sympathy from Western leaders for Israel after Iran's missile strike and the lack
*  of similar compassion for Lebanese or Palestinian people under the bombardment. Well indeed, spot on.
*  There is no subtlety at all about this racism, none at all, that an attack which kills no Israeli
*  civilians received an outpouring of condemnation and solidarity, while all Palestinians get,
*  with the mass butchery of their people, is some occasional feeble handwring gig.
*  Let's see one example, which I'm afraid is utterly infuriating,
*  if your blood pressure's high, maybe look away, it is from the British Prime Minister,
*  Sikir Starmer.
*  We stand with Israel and we recognise her right to self-defence in the face of this aggression.
*  Iran must stop these attacks together with its proxies like Hezbollah.
*  Iran has menaced the Middle East for far too long, chaos and destruction brought not just to Israel
*  but to the people they live amongst in Lebanon and beyond. Make no mistake, Britain stands full
*  square against such violence. We support Israel's reasonable demand for the security of its people.
*  That man, that shameless man, has not even shown 1%, 1% of the passion he showed there,
*  for tens of thousands of butchered Palestinians. No standing with Palestine, no sense whatsoever
*  that Palestinians have a reasonable demand, as he puts it, for the security of their people,
*  having their skulls ripped from their bodies, their babies cooked alive in the burning remnants
*  of what was once their homes. No saying it cannot be tolerated when so many have been butchered.
*  Israel is currently not just waging war against the Palestinian people in Gaza and the West Bank,
*  it's invading Lebanon and bombing Syria, but no talk of Israel bringing chaos and destruction.
*  Notice too how he keeps calling Israel her. Why that pronoun? Weird, creepy, why is he doing this?
*  He doesn't use that pronoun for other countries, as others have suggested to portray Israel as
*  some sort of damsel in distress, rather than a regional military superpower committing genocide,
*  including the weapons and fighter jet components provided by the British government. And notice
*  how he began his address by saying Israel has launched over 200 ballistic missiles at civilian
*  targets, as author Alex Nunn's and others' flight. That simply isn't true. As Alex Nunn's tweeted,
*  Israel has confirmed several Air Force bases were hit by Iran while civilian damage was only minor
*  and caused by shrapnel from interception missiles. It's clear that Starmer's team resorted to this
*  lie because they think everyone will be too scared to be smeared as a stooge of the Iranian regime
*  if they tell the truth, but this isn't about any apologism for the Iranian regime, it's the fact
*  that Keir Starmer shows infinitely more solidarity here for fictional civilian targets than he does
*  for the countless actual civilian targets destroyed so lethally by Israel. Again, this is
*  racism. Starmer behaves very clearly as though Palestinian life does not matter to him, because
*  we can see how he does behave when it comes to lives when he does deem them worthy, even when
*  none of those lives has been taken. Oh but just watch this, watch this for an example of out of
*  this world shameless racist double standards. Here is CNN. The US intel view that among the targets
*  were Israeli airfields but also, and this is crucial, the headquarters of Mossad, the international
*  intelligence service of Israel, which is inside Tel Aviv. It's in the northern part of Tel Aviv,
*  but it's in the city, it's in a densely populated area and of course the concern is if you're firing,
*  even though Iran might consider that a military target, it is in a densely populated city
*  with civilians around it and that's just one more layer of escalation.
*  You cannot make this shit up. This CNN journalist is pointing out that Mossad's HQ is in a densely
*  populated area with civilians around it and that therefore if Mossad's HQ is attacked, that's a
*  threat to civilian life. I'm nearly speechless. We have spent the last year having mainstream
*  media outlets constantly parroting the idea that Hamas, or indeed Hezbollah targets, are embedded
*  in civilian areas which constitutes using those civilians as human shields, justifying and
*  rationalising the mass slaughter of so many innocent people on the basis that military
*  targets are near them, as if any military force on earth is just supposed to pop their
*  headquarters on top of some deserted hill. Turns out no one does this, including the Israeli state,
*  leading this CNN journalist to worry about potential harm to civilians if Mossad's HQ was attacked.
*  I feel like I'm going mad watching all of this and I'm brutally aware that I'm a white guy who
*  grew up in Stockport. I'm not a Palestinian, I'm not an Arab, I'm not a Muslim. If I feel like this,
*  how are those with shared lived experiences with those facing the slaughter not going insane?
*  And I read, of course, every day, the messages sent to me, as well as, of course, my friends,
*  my comrades, what it's like watching this unfold. And I will just end on this. People like me
*  don't want escalation, we just don't. We genuinely don't. We don't want any civilians to
*  be killed, whoever they are. And the madmen who run Israel and their US patrons are determined to
*  plunge the Middle East into a cataclysmic war in which so many lives are at stake,
*  all because the US will not stop its client state Israel from committing genocide. But I think of
*  how angry I feel. And I know, and I know, that the West has sown a bitter harvest and the reaping
*  will have hideous consequences for generations to come. Please like and subscribe, leave your
