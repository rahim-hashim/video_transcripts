# Horrifying New Gaza Study Shows Worst To Come - Without Immediate Ceasefire w Zeina Jamaluddine
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [March 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzjlHMFkRdk)
*  This is a hideous thing to talk about, but it is extremely necessary. Gaza is one of
*  the most horrendous mass slaughters of our time. And it becomes very difficult in such
*  a horror to know exactly how many have been killed and how many are going to be killed.
*  But the scale of catastrophe which is enveloping Gaza from the combination of Israeli violence
*  in terms of weaponry and also now increasingly the collapse of the healthcare system, famine,
*  what we're looking at is truly one of the great completely artificial calamities of
*  our time. Now, the official death toll is hideous enough, over 30,000 now. As we'll
*  discuss that is likely to be a very, very significant underestimate, quite unlike the
*  claims of the country that is somehow inflated. But what we're going to talk about today
*  as well as that is how many are likely to die, to be killed because of the combined
*  effects of violence, the collapse of the healthcare system, famine, and the lack of the basic
*  essentials that make human existence possible. Now, I'm really delighted to be joined by
*  Zaina Jamaladeen. Now, she's worked on this extremely important project, which is looking
*  at projected deaths, excess deaths. For those who don't know, excess deaths are deaths above
*  what would have happened based on the average number of deaths in previous years. Excess
*  deaths, people became familiar with that because of the COVID pandemic. So you would look at
*  deaths before the pandemic and because it's difficult to know how many exactly would have
*  died, for example, of other conditions, excess anyway, despite the pandemic, excess deaths was
*  a way of looking at the more reliable figures. And so this study has been done by London School
*  of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Health and Humanitarian Centre's crisis and the John
*  Hopkins Centre for Humanitarian Health. First, Zaina, it's such an honour and privilege to be
*  joined by you in this absolutely seminal piece of research. So thank you so much for joining us.
*  Thank you, Owen, for inviting me.
*  Let's just start with that official death toll. So, you know, there has been repeated attempts by
*  those who have defended Israel's onslaught to sow doubt in those figures. Joe Biden notoriously did
*  that, which prompted towards a few weeks into this particular horror, the health ministry to
*  release the names and crucially IDs, which are Israel assigned IDs because Israel is still in
*  charge of the civil registry in Gaza. But also in previous conflicts, the official death toll has
*  been correct. It's been validated as well by various humanitarian agencies on the ground and
*  so on, as well as the Lancet Medical Journal. But can you just tell me why is it actually over
*  30,000, horrific enough, the population of Gaza to 2.2 to 2.3 million or so before this horror
*  began? Why is it likely to actually be a very significant underestimate?
*  So currently at the beginning of the war, when the Ministry of Health released that report,
*  we did look at the numbers that they released and we did try to understand the duplicates and
*  whether there might be fabrication in these numbers. And we found no reason to actually
*  to not believe these numbers. After that, in fact, and especially after the attack on
*  Al-Shifa Hospital, which is the main data center of the Ministry of Health, the data gathering
*  became harder for the Ministry of Health. What we know currently is that what they're reporting
*  and releasing are numbers of people who are coming to hospitals. And so basically people who
*  are killed and are reported by hospitals. So anyone who's killed and dies and gets buried at home
*  is not included in these lists. Also, people who are under the rubble missing, who have not gone
*  to the hospitals are not also reported. It's estimated that there's around 8,000 of these.
*  And so this is where you get some reports that say 30,000 and some people even say 38,000.
*  Which is your human rights monitor, for example, the NGO, they calculated it is over 38,000,
*  but those estimates are a week and a half old. So it doesn't include deaths since then. But they
*  say because these are officially missing, but because they're dead under the rubble, there's
*  no chance they're alive and therefore they should be added. Yes. And like any conflict, the more the
*  conflict goes on, the harder it is to count the death. And the systems are collapsing. Communication
*  is very hard in Gaza, especially with the communication cuts. And so hospitals are not
*  always able to report to the Ministry of Health the numbers. So I think the exact number currently
*  is very hard to get it, but it's between the 30,000 and 38,000 that's being reported and even
*  probably more. And in terms of, I mean, because I've seen also reports, I know people have posted
*  examples of large cases of, for example, a family being killed who weren't reported to the Ministry
*  of Health, therefore they're not included. But there's also people, for example, with cancer,
*  people with underlying health conditions such as heart problems who aren't able to access
*  healthcare. So I suppose this is why excess deaths becomes an important measurement because
*  if someone is killed by missiles or bullets, you can easily just attribute that directly to war.
*  What becomes more complicated is people who would be alive but are dead as an indirect consequence.
*  So in Yemen, around 60% of the death toll in the war is estimated to be indirect. So I suppose that
*  complicates it as well, doesn't it, in terms of the official death toll because someone with
*  leukemia, for example, they're not getting treatment and now they're dead as a consequence
*  when they'll be alive, that kind of thing. Yes. So this is really where we started from
*  understanding what's happening in this war and really to project the excess death in different
*  scenarios. In the case of a ceasefire, in the case of a status quo, so what happened before in the
*  war, in the case of an escalation, which is where we're seeing with attacks in Rafah. And so what we
*  wanted to understand, in fact, is at the beginning of the war, most of the mortality was happening
*  from injuries. In fact, Gaza, in terms of before the war, had a very good health care system with
*  only 3% of children were acutely malnourished, so like thin, what we call as wasting. We had 100%
*  vaccination. This is because of efforts from the Ministry of Health and UNRWA. And so basically,
*  mortality from infectious disease was not very high except when COVID happened. However, what we
*  were talking more about was actually mortality from non-communicable diseases. However, with the
*  war and the collapse of the health care system and actually children not being able to get vaccinated
*  and basically pregnant women not being able to go to hospitals to deliver where preterm babies who
*  need access to NICUs and all of that aspect actually will increase excess death among these
*  populations. So we will have excess deaths from infectious diseases, excess deaths from people not
*  being able to get treatment for their chronic diseases, cancer, heart attacks, other elements
*  would be maternal and newborn health. We know that mothers in general should be fine. However,
*  there's 30% who are likely to have complications and need hospitals. And we know we have studied
*  a lot in different universities the importance of access to hospitals for maternal and newborn care.
*  Then we have also excess mortalities from traumatic injuries, which is the one that
*  we've seen, but also the fact that some of these ones that could be healed are not being able to be
*  healed because of lack of access to health care. The other element that we also ended up projecting
*  is also the acute malnutrition as an underlying factor to all of this. So we know that pregnant
*  women need more caloric intake and we know that children under five are very vulnerable to acute
*  malnutrition and to wasting or call thin if they're not able to get proper access to
*  calories and nutrients. The same thing is for people who have injuries, who are in hospitals
*  and who don't have access to food because in fact you're very vulnerable when you're healing. So
*  all of that will need to excess death. This is what we tried to a bit show in these projections
*  is that the death is not only coming from traumatic injuries, but it will also come from
*  all other elements that we're currently seeing in Gaza with the health care system basically
*  collapsed. Currently only 10 hospitals are working out of the 36 that were before the war.
*  Primary health care centers, most of them are not working and so the mortality that we will
*  project to see would come from other aspects even within a ceasefire. Why is that? Because
*  currently there's around 500 people using one toilet in certain shelters. These are conditions
*  that will increase infectious diseases and so basically if a cholera outbreak happens
*  we would expect a very high excess mortality in these conditions and so we tried to project
*  these numbers. So if I just look at your projections now, if there was an immediate and lasting
*  ceasefire which was from the moment this study was published, so just to be clear when was the
*  estimates made? Is there a kind of specific date? So the estimates covered the 7th of February till
*  the 6th of August. So yes if there was a ceasefire on the 7th of February. So if there had been a
*  ceasefire on the 7th of February and we know now that we have an out of day death toll where you
*  get the official death toll, those who are definitely dead, those are definitely officially
*  killed and then we have those missing under rubble that brings it to 38,000. So that's an
*  underestimate which is old. So on top of those figures an immediate ceasefire in the past would
*  be 11 and a half thousand excess deaths. So even based on our underestimates that would mean 50,000
*  people killed out of 2.2 million people. So with no epidemics in the ceasefire, 6 and a half thousand,
*  status quo over 58,000, escalation over 74,000. If there were epidemics,
*  ceasefire 11 and a half thousand, status quo over 66,000, escalation over 85,000. So we're looking
*  under status quo or escalation 4 to 5 percent of Gaza's population being killed in 10 months.
*  Yeah and the other thing is you could also say is that if a ceasefire happens now,
*  we would be able to be saving 74,000 lives and just by providing immediate humanitarian support,
*  humanitarian access, opening hospitals, giving supplies to the hospitals, allowing access to
*  people to go to the hospitals and avoiding an epidemic of a cholera or others. So that would
*  be saving lives today and so this also could be looked at in that front is that a ceasefire
*  obviously is going to save 74,000 lives in the next six months. I mean just putting that in
*  perspective, those who are horrified by what's happened already and the sheer level of death,
*  those who have been killed, what we're talking about, even if there are no epidemics based on
*  status quo, that would mean 20,000 more on top of, sorry, it would mean, so people think now the
*  official death toll plus those missing, which is an underestimate, is 38,000. Under status quo with
*  no epidemics, 58,000. So significantly more than all the deaths already you would get on top of
*  that with epidemics far even more. So that's what we're talking about. We're talking about
*  that that would mean the current official death toll isn't even half of what would be by August.
*  Yes. And what you've done is you've broken it up, I can see in these figures here,
*  so it's traumatic injuries, infectious diseases, maternal and neonatal healthcare,
*  non-communicable diseases. So the collapse of the healthcare system is really very, very pivotal,
*  isn't it? I mean a modern healthcare system is something which prevents a huge amount of
*  deaths in any society. Yes. So if you talk about, for example,
*  traumatic injuries, traumatic injuries, wounds, basically people are sometimes able to be saved
*  if they get access to the hospitals because they have access to antibiotics and all the
*  treatments they would need. However, in the case of Gaza, this is not happening. Other aspect is
*  that these traumatic injuries could also lead to, in the case of a ceasefire, also an excess mortality
*  because most of the mortality in a war happens directly due to the bombs, but after that also
*  untreated wounds and all of that could lead to mortality. And so we use these in the projections
*  for the ceasefire scenario. We would see also some mortalities from traumatic injury,
*  also some ordinance and some that would also happen. The other element would be to also look at,
*  for example, like I mentioned, infectious diseases a lot is because you said with and without an
*  epidemic. In fact, children are not being vaccinated and the vaccination is going down
*  as we move along. So some of the protection will decrease and this would put children and
*  under five year old kids and very vulnerable states. And so this is where some of the mortality
*  would come. The other element would be from like, for example, COVID-19, especially now in the next
*  three months rather than in the summer because of seasonality with infectious diseases. The other
*  element would be if an epidemic happens or a cholera outbreak happens, this is where we would
*  see very high numbers. It's important to put all of this in perspective that we know infectious
*  diseases with acute malnutrition would be catastrophic because these two elements together
*  for under five year old children would increase mortality for these children. And this hasn't
*  really been put out in these projections. So we did project how much acute malnutrition is increasing.
*  However, it's also possible to see that if the acute malnutrition situation or the food situation
*  continues the way it is, it could also be more catastrophic if an epidemic occurs. The other
*  element we'll talk about is maternal newborn death. So if you see the numbers of maternal newborn
*  deaths, you see around 300 in the next six months. However, this is actually something that we study
*  in terms of looking at the healthcare system. So before the war, the maternal mortality rate was
*  actually very low. It was one of the best in terms of maternal mortality, around 20. However,
*  with the war, what we're seeing is an increase in maternal mortality rates, which gets numbers
*  of maternal mortality that were recorded in 1996 in case of an escalation. So that means
*  sort of like a healthcare system going back decades in terms of
*  healthcare system. And so the other element would also be to talk about NCDs, so chronic diseases.
*  Here we try to look at is people who have a heart attack, for example, and need to go
*  have access to a hospital in order to get the treatment they need. Currently, they're not able
*  to do that. And so basically the mortality is going to increase. The other element that's
*  happening is type 1 diabetic patients. What we know from old studies before the invention of
*  insulin is that the life expectancy is very low because in fact, insulin is life-saving for these
*  patients. And so without access to insulin, their mortality would be high. The same thing with
*  what we're seeing with chronic kidney disease patients. The more they miss the dialysis session,
*  the more likely their excess mortality will increase. And the other element is also cancer
*  patients. We know that the only cancer hospital was attacked in November. And so basically cancer
*  patients do not have access to treatment in Gaza. And so their excess mortality is going to be
*  quite high. And so all of that together is what the report tried to put into showing that in fact,
*  in case of a ceasefire, even with a ceasefire, we'd expect around 6,000 to 11,000 excess mortality
*  from all of these causes. In case of a status quo, we'd still expect around 50,000. And in case of an
*  escalation, it could reach around 85,000 excess mortality. And the main thing in the status quo
*  and the escalation is traumatic injuries. Of course, the bombing is still happening.
*  So there's still mortality coming from there. But the other conditions that are happening in shelters
*  and all of that and access to hospitals would lead to mortality that are quite high.
*  And again, on that, because I've interviewed specialists on hunger, they made the point that
*  families like a runaway train. So even if you immediately now, everything stopped, food got in
*  immediately, massive, kind of huge monumental effort to get all the food in possible, people
*  would still starve to death. People still died of malnutrition. So the terms of malnutrition,
*  what we show is before the war, around 3% of children were acutely malnourished. So that
*  means they were wasting or thin. This is under five-year-old children. What we did is projecting
*  actually what happened till now. And we got to levels of around 13%, which now even like some
*  independent reporting is showing around 16%. So one out of six. But now with the projections
*  that we try to see in the next three months, we could reach levels of 26%, which means one out of
*  four child would be acutely malnourished. And so basically, if we continue in the same way,
*  with the same number of trucks coming in and food assistance not coming in, we could expect in the
*  next six months, around 50% of children being acutely malnourished. And these are rates that
*  are extremely catastrophic. And it's like you said, it takes time for things to then,
*  even when food comes back in, to actually go back to levels that are lower of acute malnutrition,
*  even within a ceasefire, you would expect that. And this is also another push towards
*  food assistance coming into Gaza yesterday. I mean, on that, I mean, again, because if I'm
*  going on the figures of escalation, which people might think, well, that's the worst case scenario.
*  But what we're talking about there is an assault on Rafa, for example, which has been promised by
*  the Israeli state. So it's not like it's the worst case extreme scenario. It's what the Israeli state
*  is promising, which is an assault on Rafa. That would mean by August, going off out of date,
*  underestimated figures, that would mean over 123,000 people being killed by August, which is one in
*  every 18 Palestinians in Gaza within 10 months. I mean, I don't, there's not, the precedence for
*  that level of killing in a modern conflict is, I mean, it's an astonishingly high figure, isn't it?
*  I mean, how many other wars could you, if we call it something asymmetrical, is this a war? But
*  I mean, Yemen, I've spent a lot of time researching Yemen. I've done documentary in Yemen,
*  I've read lots of columns in Yemen, horrible, hideous war. The equivalent over seven years
*  of warfare in Yemen is 25,000 Palestinians being killed in Gaza, which has already long been
*  exceeded. And Yemen started from a worse place, didn't it? So this is, I mean, by modern standards,
*  and absolutely catastrophic. Even by August, we say five and a half percent, people will still die
*  after that. So it's not like that's the end of it.
*  Yes, and I think this different, more calls for a ceasefire and humanitarian assistance to come in,
*  to reestablish the healthcare system in Gaza. And yeah.
*  Yeah, what we're talking about is tens and tens of thousands of people's lives at stake.
*  If there was a ceasefire, tens of thousands of lives will be saved. Without a ceasefire,
*  and then assault or RAFA, we're talking about several times as many people being killed as
*  already been killed already. That's what we're talking about in brutal terms. Well, this work
*  is so important. It's so important that people use this work to make an argument, to make the
*  arguments for a ceasefire, because we're talking about death on a biblical scale. And if you're
*  already shocked and horrified by the number of deaths already in Gaza, around 39.5% of human
*  children, then you should be beyond horrified by what this research shows. Zaina, I can't thank
*  you enough for the time to just go through this research. It's of critical importance. It's
*  gruesome and horrifying and chilling, but it's desperately needed. So thank you so much for your
*  time. Please like and share this video so everyone knows. Zaina, thank you so much.
