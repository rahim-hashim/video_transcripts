# Israel Invades West Bank - Declares Will Be Treated Like Gaza
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [August 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_1r8_My6zE)
*  Over the last nearly 11 months now, our attention has, unsurprisingly, mostly been on Gaza. That's
*  where, of course, the focus has been of Israel's genocidal onslaught, Israel's wiping out of much
*  of Gaza's infrastructure from the face of the earth, the mass slaughter of tens of thousands
*  of its people. We could go on. But we shouldn't forget the West Bank, which is where over three
*  million Palestinian citizens live. That's an even bigger Palestinian population than Gaza's
*  pre-war population. Now, the West Bank has been under direct Israeli military occupation since
*  1967 as part of the longest belligerent occupation in modern human history. And in practice,
*  Israel has long been illegally annexing the West Bank. Now, as the International Court of Justice,
*  the highest court on earth, recently ruled, the West Bank is under illegal Israeli occupation.
*  Endorsed what international and Israeli human rights organisations have said for a long time
*  that a system of apartheid is enforced there. Now, there are around 700,000 Israeli settlers
*  living there and around 150 illegal settlements and 128 illegal outposts. And even before the 7th
*  of October, the Palestinian population were being terrorised. In 2023, before the 7th of October,
*  around 240 Palestinians that year in the first three quarters had been killed by Israeli security
*  forces and settlers. Around 40 of them were children. But since 7th of October, there has
*  been a pogrom waged against the Palestinian population in the West Bank with over 600
*  Palestinians being killed since then. Around 146 of them children, which is itself four times as
*  many Israeli children, killed on the 7th of October. Obviously, countless thousands of
*  Palestinian children and tens of thousands overall of Palestinian civilians have been killed in Gaza
*  since 7th of October. Meanwhile, Israeli forces have raised hundreds of homes in the West Bank
*  to the ground and displaced thousands of Palestinians from their homes and seized around
*  37,000 acres of Palestinian land. We've seen settlers on the rampage waging terrorist attacks
*  against the Palestinian population described as terrorism even by the head of Israel's security
*  agency, the Shin Bet, leading to denunciations from Israeli National Security Minister Itamir Ben-Gavir.
*  In practice, the settlers' reign of terror is facilitated, enabled, protected by the illegal
*  Israeli military occupation and apparatus. Now, today, the Israeli state has launched an invasion
*  of the occupied West Bank. According to Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, this is an attack
*  on terrorist infrastructure. Well, we've heard that before and we've seen the consequences.
*  But he also said something very striking. He said, we must deal with the threat just as we deal with
*  the terrorist infrastructure in Gaza, including the temporary evacuation of Palestinian residents
*  or whatever steps are required. This is a war for everything and we must win it. As Palestinians
*  have learned with much bitterness over and over again since 1948, being driven from their home
*  is anything but temporary. This is again ethnic cleansing. Indeed, the Foreign Minister here is
*  explicitly stating that the West Bank must be dealt with the same as Gaza. The Gazification of the
*  West Bank therefore may beckon. This is the biggest Israeli military offensive in the illegally
*  occupied West Bank in nearly two decades in the midst that was back then of the second interfada.
*  At least 10 Palestinians have reportedly been killed today. There have been airstrikes,
*  including on Monday, with strikes in the Noor Shams refugee camp in which children amongst
*  others were killed. The United Nations warns that the situation in the occupied West Bank could
*  worsen dramatically if the Israeli security forces continue to systematically use unlawful
*  legal force. No, they said unlawful and ignore violence perpetrated by the settlers.
*  Let's listen to the Palestinian-American analyst Omar Bader, who I've interviewed on this channel.
*  What do you make of this military operation?
*  Yeah, I think the context of it is worth noting, which is the fact that Israel has been intending
*  to annex and ethnically cleanse huge parts of the West Bank for a very, very long time.
*  And in fact, has been actively doing that in slow motion. And I think that they saw an opportunity,
*  given that the world is distracted by the horror that Israel is unleashing on Gaza,
*  to kind of escalate in the West Bank. And so what we've seen over the past several months
*  is more than 650 Palestinians being killed by Israeli soldiers and settlers throughout the West
*  Bank. In any other context, this would be a crisis that everybody would be talking about.
*  But only in the shadow of the genocide that Israel is unleashing on Gaza has this kind of
*  passed without people really paying attention. And naturally, whenever you see this kind of violence
*  unfold, there's going to be resistance to it, and in some cases, violent resistance as well.
*  And now Israel sees itself as somehow compelled to launch this military operation.
*  Seemingly under this delusion that has been disproven over and over again,
*  that you can somehow kill and torture and maim and imprison and suppress and oppress Palestinians
*  into some kind of victory out of all this. But this is really the same tape being played
*  over and over again. And it's a recipe that will lead to endless violence and bloodshed
*  until there is a fundamental change in Israel's attitude towards Palestinians.
*  And what about the timing of this particular raid? Should we be reading anything into that?
*  I think Israel is under tremendous pressure of the fact that they are stuck in Gaza without
*  a strategic victory. They promised that they would be able to defeat Hamas quickly,
*  that they would be able to free the hostages. They've been able to achieve neither of these
*  things. In the North, they're stuck in a status quo where they're supposed to restore their
*  deterrence and intimidate Hezbollah across the Lebanon border. They have failed miserably at
*  that. And I think whenever Israel finds itself cornered and is in desperate need for a victory
*  for its public, all they know how to do is unleash indiscriminate violence against Palestinians.
*  And this is the playbook that they actually go to. And I think that this is the moment that we find
*  ourselves in is that Netanyahu is desperate for some sort of image of an accomplishment.
*  And he thinks by launching this massive large scale operation in the West Bank, in which,
*  relatively speaking, given the dynamics under occupation, Israel can claim some sort of victory
*  out of at the end of this, that this is somehow going to play well for Netanyahu politically
*  and try to salvage an image that has been completely tarnished over the past 10 months.
*  Well indeed, the genocidal onslaught against Gaza has slaughtered so many Palestinians,
*  unleashed so much destruction amidst some of the worst atrocities of the 21st century.
*  But it's also failed in its own terms. All Israel knows what to do in these circumstances is to
*  further export more violence. Now let's listen to Mustafa Bauguti. He's a Palestinian politician
*  who again has been interviewed on this channel. Can we just get your take on how troubling these
*  raids are? Israel's foreign minister describing it as a war. What has been the reaction there,
*  first of all? Well, these are not just raids. It's a huge military operation. It's actually
*  an act of war that is taking place in many major areas. But not only that, they are invading so
*  many communities and villages all over the West Bank to arrest people. The most important thing
*  here for the audience to understand is that the West Bank is an occupied territory by the Israeli
*  army. We've been under Israeli military occupation since 1957 years. And what Israel is doing now is
*  conducting a war on occupied people, which is a total violation of any international law that
*  rules how an occupying power should behave. They are using air strikes. They are using
*  air force. They are using tanks. They are using bulldozers. And what they try to do now in the
*  West Bank is to transfer the acts of genocide and ethnic cleansing that they are doing in Gaza into
*  the West Bank. And that is all done by this Israeli fascist government, which is run by illegal
*  settlers like Smotrich and Bingviya, who are trying to destroy the whole infrastructure of these areas.
*  And their goal is clear. Katz, the foreign minister of Israel, has just declared
*  that ethnic cleansing should be conducted for the cities of the West Bank, including these
*  refugee camps. So there we go. Absolutely gratuitous violations of international law. But Israel has
*  the protection of the world's hegemon, the United States, and so is treated as being above international
*  law. Now, in terms of settlers, and there are obviously huge numbers of settlers in the West
*  Bank. Now, let's listen to a settler from Texas, the United States, who wishes to
*  settle illegally on an annexed and ethnically cleansed Gaza. She was interviewed on Channel 4
*  News. The idea of you coming from America to here, settling in potentially in Gaza,
*  kicking Palestinians out. A lot of people would see that as settler colonialism. It's not really
*  colonialism. It's a return. My grandparents were kicked out of Israel by Arabs who were trying to
*  establish a Palestinian stand. They had to leave for their survival, and I'm just coming back and
*  fulfilling their dream. That would be the first thing. The second thing is I think that,
*  and I know this is a minority view, I think colonialism gets a bad rap. Like genocide is bad,
*  but colonizing places that are genocidal and they have bad ideology, it's good to come in
*  and correct their views. What do you think should happen to the people who were already in Gaza?
*  So I think that there's a couple of possibilities. The one that I think is the most realistic is
*  we got to help ask other countries for help. I know that Spain was willing to take a couple
*  of million. I know Russia said they would take a couple of thousand. To a lot of people that would
*  sound like you're advocating for ethnic cleansing. I don't think so because Palestinianism
*  and ethnicity, it's an ideology and it's an ideology that says that they want Jews dead,
*  and so we want them as far away from Jews as possible. The rictus grin at the end there,
*  shudder. You can hear the mentality there which drives Israeli settler colonialism, and indeed a
*  genocidal mentality, which is that Palestine is not real. That to be a Palestinian is an ideology
*  that says they want Jews dead, therefore basically portraying, defining Palestinians
*  as an existential menace. Throughout history we know what happens when entire peoples are defined
*  as an existential menace. That is always a precondition for genocide, which is again,
*  the world turned upside down when she talked about genocidal mentality, but again we've seen this
*  throughout history. The Hutu extremists when they murdered the Tutsis in the Rwandan genocide
*  justified that on the basis that the Tutsis would commit genocide against the Hutus unless they
*  killed them first. Now she talks about indigenous Palestinians who've lived on this land for
*  generations, centuries even, as she moves there from Texas. It is clear that the Israeli state
*  wants to drive the Palestinian population out of Gaza and out of the West Bank. What you hear from
*  that settler, as extreme as it sounds, is merely an honest exposition of what the Israeli state is
*  seeking. The Israeli state will in practice slaughter those who do not leave in a genocidal
*  frenzy, slaughter, terrorise, you name it. All of this is enabled and indeed facilitated by the US
*  and key Western allies and unless it is fought, the genocidal mayhem we've seen in Gaza is only
*  going to be the beginning. Please like and subscribe, do leave your thoughts, your comments,
