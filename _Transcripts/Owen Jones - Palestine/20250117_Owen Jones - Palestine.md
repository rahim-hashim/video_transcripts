# Biden ADMITS Israel's War Crimes - And So Accidentally Confessed Own Guilt
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs)
*  Joe Biden has admitted that Israel has committed grave war crimes. Not an exaggeration, this clip [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm going to show you should be treated for what it is. It is a confession. A confession of [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=6.4s)]
*  complicity in genocide. Take a listen. When I went to Israel, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  immediately after their attack by Hamas, eight days later, whatever it was, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=17.68s)]
*  and I told them we were going to help. I said, but Bibi, I said, you can't be carpet bombing these [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=23.439999999999998s)]
*  communities. And he said to me, well, you did it. You carpet bomb, not his exact words, but you [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=30.88s)]
*  carpet bomb Berlin. You drafted nuclear weapons. You killed thousands of innocent people because [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=39.36s)]
*  you had to in order to win a war. I said, but that's why we came up with the UN. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=47.44s)]
*  New mess, new deals by which how, what would we do relative civilians and military. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=52.4s)]
*  So he was comparing 21st century war tactics, battle tactics with World War II. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=58.96s)]
*  Well, what he was really doing is he was going after me for saying, you can't indiscriminately [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=66.0s)]
*  bomb civilian areas, even if the bad guys are there. He was the bad guys there. You can't take [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=71.28s)]
*  out 2, 10, 12, 1500 people, innocent people in order to get the one bad guy. And he made the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=78.4s)]
*  legitimate argument in his perspective, look, these are the guys that kill my people. These [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=84.4s)]
*  are the guys that are all over in these tunnels. Nobody had any idea the miles of tunnels were [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=88.64s)]
*  down there. It's amazing what they built. And they're sometimes 200 feet underground. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=94.16000000000001s)]
*  Well, the way to get to them is take out the places where they were under which, under which [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=101.12s)]
*  they got to the tunnels. And so that's the first time I had, first time I had the discussion about [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=106.08s)]
*  bombing civilian areas was when I went over after the 9 11, after the, the massacre that occurred. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=114.0s)]
*  So on that first trip, 10, 11 days after October 7th, you already raised. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=123.68s)]
*  I raised. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=129.04s)]
*  The issues of how to get to a ceasefire. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=129.68s)]
*  Well, not a ceasefire, how to prevent innocent deaths. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=132.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=138.88s)]
*  And then I pushed really, really hard for more humanitarian aid to go in. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=139.52s)]
*  When I studied history at university, they taught us how to approach source material like this from [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=145.84s)]
*  a particular time. And when you read back at the interventions of a political leader, whether it's [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=150.96s)]
*  a speech, an interview, something they wrote publicly or privately, what we're supposed to do [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=156.0s)]
*  is contextualize it. And that is not to simply take their words at face value, but to understand [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=160.96s)]
*  the purpose and real meaning. In this case, why is Joe Biden the 46th president of the United States [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=165.52s)]
*  on the very eve of his presidency ending publicly declaring that he had told the leader of a foreign [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=171.12s)]
*  state, he has armed to the teeth for 15 months to stop carpet bombing civilians at the beginning [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=176.4s)]
*  of what was and has been an incessant genocidal onslaught. And the answer is Biden thinks this [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  will help his place in history. He knows history is set to return a damning indictment of his time [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=189.2s)]
*  in the White House. One poll for PBS news finds that over a third of Americans believe he will [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=195.44s)]
*  go down in the history books as one of the worst presidents ever compared to 5% who say one of the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=200.39999999999998s)]
*  best. That places him right down at the bottom of the league of US presidents, just above Richard [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=207.44s)]
*  Nixon and below George W. Bush. He thinks this clip will lead historians to believe that he [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=212.88s)]
*  remontrates with Benjamin Netanyahu, he did implore him to stop unleashing barbaric indiscriminate [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=219.84s)]
*  firepower against the innocent people of Gaza. Well this clip is damning. It is in actual fact [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  a confession. If Joe Biden ever ends up, or if he did end up at the International Criminal Court, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  this clip alone would be sufficient to find him guilty of complicity in grave war crimes. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=237.6s)]
*  Because it proves what should be obvious, that Joe Biden knew exactly what the Israeli state [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=244.08s)]
*  was doing from the very beginning. Israel has been the biggest recipient of military aid of any [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=250.0s)]
*  foreign state in the post-war era, but since the 7th of October 2023 that surged to nearly [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=255.84s)]
*  $18 billion worth since then. Which is obviously a vast sum of money. The US sent thousands, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=261.12s)]
*  for example, of £2000 bombs to Israel since October 7th, despite knowing full well that [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=270.08s)]
*  they were slaughtering civilians en masse. The New York Times, which has had a dire record of [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=276.4s)]
*  reporting this horror, made clear in December 2023 that Israel was dropping £2000 bombs on areas [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=281.52s)]
*  that Israel told civilians to flee to. In October 2024, a Harvard study found that between the 7th [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=288.4s)]
*  of October and 17th November 2023, the Israeli military dropped nearly 600 £2000 bombs with [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=297.6s)]
*  the capacity to damage hospital infrastructure or kill or damage injury hundreds of metres away, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=306.96000000000004s)]
*  and one third of those bombs identified were within dangerous proximity of hospitals across [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=313.52000000000004s)]
*  Gaza. Biden knows that the entire healthcare system of Gaza has been destroyed. Essentially. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=318.48s)]
*  Most hospitals have been violently put out of operation. Some of them just reduced to [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=324.88s)]
*  rubble. Not least Al-Shifa Hospital, which was the flagship hospital. They killed over a thousand [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=331.04s)]
*  medics. He knows all this in his more sentient moments. Whilst in a recent study, for example, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=335.2s)]
*  the NGO Air Wars published 606 incidents of civilian harm reported in the first three weeks [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=340.8s)]
*  of the onslaught. So Israel was in the midst of doing that when he said this. That was halfway [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=347.84000000000003s)]
*  through the first three weeks the Air Wars looked at. I mean, obviously that onslaught carried on. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=352.56s)]
*  I'm just talking about this particular timeframe Air Wars was talking about. They found in that [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=358.16s)]
*  timeframe a minimum of 5,319 civilians were killed by the aerial onslaught in the first three weeks, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=362.32s)]
*  concluding by almost every metric the harm to civilians from the first month of the [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=369.12s)]
*  Israeli campaign in Gaza is incomparable with any 21st century air campaign. It is by far [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=373.28s)]
*  the most intense, destructive and fatal conflict for civilians that Air Wars has ever documented. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=380.24s)]
*  This is what academics and journalists uncovered. The US security services, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=386.08s)]
*  bear in mind, have vastly more resources to know what their ally is doing. And we can hear [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=389.84000000000003s)]
*  from this clip, which should always be obvious, Biden knew exactly what was happening and he [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=396.56s)]
*  kept arming what are under international law grave war crimes. I just want to take on the comparison [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=401.04s)]
*  he brings up here that Netanyahu apparently spoke about, which you hear a lot from Israel's [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=407.84s)]
*  cheerleaders. It's a comparison with World War II. It is so disgusting, so offensive. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=413.52s)]
*  At the outset, comparing the primitive unguided bombs of that era with what is supposed to be [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=420.32s)]
*  one of the most technologically sophisticated militaries on earth is outrageous. Then there [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=426.47999999999996s)]
*  is the fact that the Axis powers, that is Nazi Germany, fascist Italy, Imperial Japan and so on, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=432.48s)]
*  directly caused 85% of all the deaths of World War II. It's not like this idea, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=439.44s)]
*  you keep coming up, it's like, well, look at all this, we were killing mass slaughtered civilians. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=445.6s)]
*  The vast majority of people slaughtered violently were by the Axis powers, not by the allies. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=450.72s)]
*  I just want to add this as well, let's be clear, World War II was a righteous, just war [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=458.0s)]
*  against fascist barbarism waged by the likes of Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=462.56s)]
*  but actually the allies did commit war crimes. Just be very clear about this, the firebombing [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=468.48s)]
*  of Dresden, for example, that was a grave war crime, served no military purpose and was seen [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=472.40000000000003s)]
*  as such by people at the time, I might add. Out of World War II, we had something called [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=477.2s)]
*  the Geneva Conventions. I don't quite understand why Joe Biden is talking about the United Nations [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=482.56s)]
*  in that context, the Geneva Conventions, which criminalized some of the things the allies had [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=485.84s)]
*  done. But all of that aside, Nazi Germany was a military superpower, which was conquering the [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=490.64s)]
*  whole of the European continent, waging a war of annihilation on the Eastern Front, committing [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=498.08s)]
*  multiple genocides, of course, the Shoah, the extermination of 6 million Jews, other genocides [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=504.55999999999995s)]
*  as well, and they had a genuine shot at world domination, the whole world dominated by Nazi [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=508.88s)]
*  Germany and its hideous allies. Gaza is a tiny sliver of land, no bigger than East London, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=517.2s)]
*  which before all of this was legally defined as being under occupation, as per the United Nations, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=524.96s)]
*  under the longest siege of our time, mostly made up of a refugee population, indeed, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=531.04s)]
*  mostly the families of people who'd been violently ethnically cleansed in 1948, people driven out of [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=538.64s)]
*  their homes, as is, not a military superpower conquering the world, frankly, a small ragtag militant [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=545.1999999999999s)]
*  force. Not to say, by the way, that terrible war crimes weren't committed on 7th October, I've [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=552.16s)]
*  always been clear about that, I've always had moral consistency on this one, unlike my critics. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=556.56s)]
*  Clearly, the context of decades of brutal occupation, ethnic cleansing, siege, mass [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=562.3199999999999s)]
*  slaughter of Palestinians, colonisation, so on, stripped away. The point is, there is no comparison. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=567.8399999999999s)]
*  What Netanyahu said there, to justify unleashing several times worth the firepower of Hiroshima [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=573.5999999999999s)]
*  on a strip of land, no bigger than East London, is disgusting, as you'd expect, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=581.84s)]
*  from one of the great monsters of our time. And as for that point about pushing, Biden says pushing [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=586.96s)]
*  for humanitarian aid to get in, how did that go? How did that go then, buddy boy? What did you do [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=591.9200000000001s)]
*  about it? Nothing. Nothing. Two of your own government agencies concluded by April, so months [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=596.4s)]
*  after this pointless conversation you apparently had, that Israel had deliberately blocked humanitarian [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=603.84s)]
*  aid, and was deliberately blocking humanitarian aid, from getting into Gaza. Guess what? By the [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=609.12s)]
*  US's own laws that then compelled the US to stop sending Israel arms. Guess what the US did? Broke [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=614.8s)]
*  its own laws, carrying on handing Israel a load of weapons. But you did have that private conversation [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=622.72s)]
*  about humanitarian aid, so who's to say that that was meaningless? Now all the way through this horror, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=628.16s)]
*  Joe Biden has occasionally done his hand-wringing act, and it serves one purpose and one purpose [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=635.84s)]
*  alone, and that is to try and deflect pressure, both domestically from people who aren't, let's say, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=641.6s)]
*  that inclined, favourably, towards murdering huge numbers of people, as well as internationally, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=649.5200000000001s)]
*  because lots of people around the world and foreign governments, quite understandably, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=655.2800000000001s)]
*  think this is disgusting. So he had to do this act. 12th December 2023. He warned Israel risks [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=660.24s)]
*  losing support over what he said was indiscriminate bombing in Gaza. What did he do? He carried on [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=667.44s)]
*  giving Israel weapons. Then, 12th February 2024, Joe Biden apparently vented his frustration in [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=673.76s)]
*  multiple private conversations about his inability to persuade Israel to change its military tactics, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=680.64s)]
*  and he said he was trying to get a ceasefire, but Netanyahu was giving him hell, was impossible to [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=686.48s)]
*  deal with, he was the obstacle. What did he do? He carried on giving Israel weapons. In March 2024, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=690.16s)]
*  Joe Biden warned publicly an onslaught by Israel against Ra'far was a red line Israel must not [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=698.7199999999999s)]
*  cross. Israel crossed it. What did he do? Carried on giving Israel weapons. Sorry, I don't want to [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=704.0799999999999s)]
*  be entirely unfair, apparently he did call Netanyahu an effing liar, privately. 3rd of April 2024, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=709.8399999999999s)]
*  Israel killed some white westerners by killing seven world central kitchen workers. One of [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=718.72s)]
*  them was Palestinians, but clearly the fact some white westerners were killed was a bit too much [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=724.64s)]
*  for even some in the western media and western politicians. So what happened then? Joe Biden [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=729.76s)]
*  said he was outraged at Israel. What did he do? He carried on giving Israel weapons, didn't he? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=734.08s)]
*  10th of April 2024, Biden said Netanyahu's handling of the onslaught against Gaza was a mistake, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=740.72s)]
*  and said I don't agree with his approach. Sounded like he was some sort of detached commentator, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=746.0s)]
*  rather than the guy running a superpower facilitating the whole bloodbath. What did he do? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=749.92s)]
*  He carried on giving Israel weapons. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=755.76s)]
*  28th of May 2024, he said there is every reason for people to draw the conclusion that Netanyahu [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=759.92s)]
*  is prolonging the war for his own political self-preservation. What did he do? Carried on [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=764.9599999999999s)]
*  giving Israel weapons. I could go on. Joe Biden knows that Israel has committed multiple unspeakable [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=768.56s)]
*  war crimes in what is a genocidal onslaught. He's known that all the way through. He knows, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=773.92s)]
*  he's not stupid. He might not be entirely with it, but he knows what they did. He has the most [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=778.4799999999999s)]
*  sophisticated intelligence agencies on earth. He is one phone call away from pretty much any expert [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=783.1999999999999s)]
*  on earth he wants to talk to. He knew, and he facilitated everything. He's a war criminal. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=788.4799999999999s)]
*  He belongs in jail. At the very least, we must make sure he's remembered for what he is. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=794.56s)]

*  Help us expand the operations. I've hired, I keep saying, a brilliant social media video person, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=804.96s)]
*  so we're doing more. Instagram, TikTok, X, Facebook. We're going to build that up. We need [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=809.0400000000001s)]
*  to reach more people. In the age of Trump and the rise of fascism, obviously what we're going to try [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=814.1600000000001s)]

*  depressing. We're not going to be depressing now. We're going to try and use this platform [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=826.64s)]

*  my personal relationship with you, so to speak. I think that's what it is. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=840.8s)]
*  And obviously using this platform to speak out against this horror. A lot of the media will go [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=846.0s)]
*  quiet about this, about Gaza, Palestine. That is never going to happen here. I can promise you that. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=850.8s)]
*  I'll speak to you in a bit. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-_8wvEDmYs&t=857.12s)]
