# Israeli Newspaper PROVES Netayanhu Planned Genocide
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro)
*  This is a devastating smoking gun, and one of countless existing smoking guns, which [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=0.0s)]
*  underline which prove Israel's genocidal intent, including that of Israeli Prime Minister [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, who was of course wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=11.26s)]
*  of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Now it is important not to let Netanyahu become [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=16.0s)]
*  the fall guy, of course he is a mass murdering war criminal, but Israel's genocide against [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=22.04s)]
*  the Palestinian people is a collective endeavour by the Israeli state, facilitated not least [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=27.08s)]
*  by the United States of America. At the moment divisions have opened up at the top of the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=31.919999999999998s)]
*  Israeli state, driven partly by Netanyahu's growing authoritarianism and his alleged corruption, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=36.16s)]
*  which led the Israeli government to dismiss the head of the Shin Bet, Israel's internal [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=42.64s)]
*  security services, which critics say is due to scrutiny of alleged ties between Netanyahu's [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=47.56s)]
*  office and the Qatari regime. That's led to mass protests, and Netanyahu has pronounced [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=52.92s)]
*  that there will be no civil war, which is not normally regarded as a reassuring statement [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=57.72s)]
*  to have to issue. But Netanyahu has been Israel's leader during Israel's genocide, and just [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=62.92s)]
*  because elements of the state may or may not have motives for say leaking things doesn't [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=68.48s)]
*  mean it's not true. And with that in mind, we turn to a story in an Israeli newspaper. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=72.72s)]
*  Online, Wynet, is the portal of Yedioth Aranoth, which is the biggest newspaper in Israel by [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=76.96s)]
*  circulation. It's a story about Herzl Halevi, who was the chief of the general staff of [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=83.52s)]
*  the so-called Israel Defense Forces from January 2023 to this month, that is, during 7th October, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=88.91999999999999s)]
*  and almost the entirety of the genocide. The article is in Hebrew, but when translated [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=95.08s)]
*  into English, it says the following. When Halevi presented the IDF's operations to the cabinet in [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=100.9s)]
*  the first 48 hours of the war, he noted that the Air Force had attacked 1500 targets in Gaza. This [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=107.10000000000001s)]
*  is a huge number, requiring exceptional intelligence and operational capabilities. Netanyahu erupted [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=113.10000000000001s)]
*  in anger, yelling and banging on the table. Why not 5000? He scolded the chief of staff. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=118.74000000000001s)]
*  We don't have 5000 approved targets, Halevi replied. I'm not interested in targets, Netanyahu [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=125.02s)]
*  retorted. Take down houses. Bomb with everything you have. You have here a revelation of straightforward [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=131.1s)]
*  genocidal intent by Netanyahu at the beginning of the genocide. The journalist here goes on to write, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=140.54s)]
*  the outburst was part of what was later described by Gaddi Isengott and others as a collapse in [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=146.46s)]
*  Netanyahu's performance in the early days of the war. The officers I met in those days said that [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=151.5s)]
*  Netanyahu had lost his judgment. Now Gaddi Isengott is himself a former chief of staff of the IDF and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=157.18s)]
*  served in Israel's post-7th October unity government as a minister without portfolio. The officers [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=163.5s)]
*  referred to, of course, are military officers. Well, regardless of what the military officers [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=169.5s)]
*  wanted, and many of those may well fear themselves being slapped with international arrest warrants, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=172.7s)]
*  which they should be slapped with, like Netanyahu, the fact is he was the leader of the country [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=177.42s)]
*  making those demands and what he was demanding was extermination. He was demanding indiscriminate [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=181.42s)]
*  bombing and the destruction of houses, of people's homes. That's what he's calling for, people's [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=186.61999999999998s)]
*  private homes and the use of Israel's entire armory to do so. As the US lawyer Dylan Williams notes, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=192.06s)]
*  this Netanyahu quote reported by an Israeli outlet constitutes prima facie evidence of the war crime [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=199.42s)]
*  of intentionally directing an attack against a civilian population and intent to kill, to destroy, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=205.66s)]
*  in part, a national or ethnic group, elements of the crime of genocide. Now this anecdote is [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=211.98s)]
*  corroborated by what Joe Biden said when describing his conversation with Netanyahu after the first [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=220.62s)]
*  week or so after 7th October. He said that Netanyahu had been warned by himself. He said he [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=225.42s)]
*  said to Netanyahu stop carpet bombing communities. But clearly there was no shift in Israeli policy, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=232.06s)]
*  so the US just facilitated that carpet bombing with the relentless supply of weapons. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=237.5s)]
*  Now as research by the NGO Air Wars found, at least 5,139 Palestinians were killed by the Israeli [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=241.9s)]
*  army in October 2023, that's the period the article was discussing, and of those at least 1,900 [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=248.06s)]
*  were children. Air Wars concluded it is by far the most intense, destructive and fatal conflict for [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=255.66s)]
*  civilians that Air Wars has ever documented. They concluded that of the incidents examined in this [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=260.78s)]
*  indiscriminate destruction demanded by Netanyahu, 99.4% of incidents killed civilians and 0.6% [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=265.5s)]
*  killed militants. So we can link the genocidal intent of Netanyahu expressed in the article [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=272.05999999999995s)]
*  with the genocidal consequences. It's just worth taking a moment to reflect on something. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=277.5s)]
*  All the way through this genocide, the claims that the Israeli state was merely targeting Hamas [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=283.26s)]
*  militants in a so-called war, that Israel was doing its best to avoid civilian casualties, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=289.1s)]
*  that civilian deaths were caused by Hamas' use of so-called human shields, all of these claims [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=293.98s)]
*  were treated not only as risable, they formed the dominant narrative in the Western media. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=298.3s)]
*  The few with a mainstream platform who dissented from such obscene absurd claims were the ones [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=302.78000000000003s)]
*  treated as fringe, as extreme, the ones promoting outrageous smears, blood libels, indeed anti-Semitic [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=308.38s)]
*  or Hamas apologists smears against Israel, even as Gaza was reduced to rubble before our eyes, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=314.06s)]
*  even as tens of thousands were butchered and this tiny strip of land was turned into a mass grave. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=320.22s)]
*  It was obvious from the very beginning what Israel was doing given the incessant public genocidal [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=325.1s)]
*  statements made by Israeli leaders, by Israeli officials, that Israel was deliberately killing [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=331.5s)]
*  civilians on a mass scale. This is a very important point. The killing of Palestinian [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=336.94s)]
*  civilians was not simply the inevitable unfortunate consequence of disproportionate military action, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=341.98s)]
*  which is about as far as some Western media outlets were prepared to even debate, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=346.86s)]
*  the killing of civilians was and is deliberate. The slaughter of civilians is intentional, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=350.62s)]
*  it is by design. It is also worth reflecting on an article published again in the Israeli newspaper [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=357.02000000000004s)]
*  Haaretz in July 2024. According to this article, as soon as the war with Hamas began on October 7, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=363.26s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered that the Army's recording system be turned off [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=369.42s)]
*  in the command centre at Army headquarters, which is where all security cabinet meetings and other [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=373.90000000000003s)]
*  defence-related meetings were being held in those days. The Army complied with this order. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=378.86s)]
*  According to Haaretz, the recording system is automatically in operation, records everything, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=384.86s)]
*  but Netanyahu demanded that security cabinet meetings, and indeed any other meetings he specified, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=389.42s)]
*  would no longer be recorded or transcribed by the IDF, but only by the Prime Minister's office. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=395.1s)]
*  This is an extremely convenient way of suppressing evidence of criminal and indeed [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=401.90000000000003s)]
*  genocidal intent of the sort reported in that Israeli newspaper. But what of the plans being [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=405.74s)]
*  proposed now? Well, the Financial Times explains that the Israeli military has drawn up plans to [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=411.58000000000004s)]
*  reconquer Gaza in a bid to finally defeat Hamas. It has not yet been approved by the security [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=416.46000000000004s)]
*  cabinet. It had been devised by the new IDF Chief of Staff with the unofficial backing of [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=420.94s)]
*  Fire-Rite ministers. Frankly, it's terrifying. Gaza is already one of the most densely populated [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=426.14s)]
*  communities on earth, although we don't know how many of its pre-genocide population has been [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=431.02s)]
*  slaughtered. It was about 2.3 million. It has a land area similar to East London. This plan [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=436.78s)]
*  proposes confining what remains of this population into a tiny area of Gaza, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=444.22s)]
*  coded the Al-Mawazi humanitarian area. The plan would then mean administering Gaza and [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=449.5s)]
*  reoccupying it, but not like last time, because this population would be forced into what in [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=454.94000000000005s)]
*  practice would be an intolerable concentration camp. Indeed, chillingly, the Financial Times [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=459.58000000000004s)]
*  reports, one of the people familiar with the deliberation said Israel could take over the [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=464.86s)]
*  distribution of all humanitarian aid and had recently assessed how many calories each Palestinian [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=469.74s)]
*  would acquire. You see, this whole crime involves no subtlety. From the beginning, it was executed [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=474.86s)]
*  in plain sight. I want to end by referring to another story in the Israeli newspaper, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=481.82s)]
*  Haaretz. It's about an Israeli academic named Dr. Sebastian Ben Daniel from the Computer Science [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=487.42s)]
*  Department of Ben Gurion University. He said that Israeli soldiers have been taught to be baby [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=492.7s)]
*  killers. 20 senior faculty members at the university have publicly demanded he be fired. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=497.9s)]
*  In Israel, you see, if you speak the truth about the genocide being committed by your state, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=503.73999999999995s)]
*  you will face the consequences. Whilst you can openly incite genocide against the entire people, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=507.26s)]
*  issue the most extreme racist, dehumanising and murderous statements about Palestinians, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=511.65999999999997s)]
*  and not only not suffer adverse consequences, but be treated as respectable, even be venerated. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=516.38s)]
*  Hell, you're probably a cabinet minister. What the evidence for Israel's genocide is overwhelming, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=522.38s)]
*  and those who denied what was obviously the case from day one will be held to account. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yStvhHCRro&t=527.1s)]
