# He Shot Two Israelis... Thinking They Were Palestinian
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g)
*  This is so messed up, so disturbing that it frankly sounds like a dark satire in a very [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=0.0s)]
*  edgy comedy. Well, alas, it is all too real. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  Morkai Rathmann is a 27 year old plumber from Miami in Florida, the Sunshine State. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=10.0s)]
*  He is Jewish. On Saturday night, using a semi-automatic handgun, he fired 17 bullets [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=15.68s)]
*  at two men who were in a car. His motive? Well, when he was caught, he told the police that he [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=21.84s)]
*  had seen two Palestinians and shot and killed them. Here is yet another grim example of where, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=27.84s)]
*  the normalisation of anti-Palestinian hatred leads. This time though, there was a twist. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=35.04s)]
*  The two victims were not Palestinian at all. They were in fact Israeli tourists. Ari Rabi [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  and his son Yaron Rabi. They had only just arrived on their Florida holidays, probably looking [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=47.84s)]
*  forward to temperatures in the late 20s. As it happened, they were not killed. Indeed, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=53.12s)]
*  they were only lightly injured. But they had concluded that they had been attacked by an Arab [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=58.64s)]
*  assailant. And so the son posted the following in the aftermath on social media. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=64.24s)]
*  My father and I went through an attempted murder with an anti-Semitic background. They tried to [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=70.16s)]
*  murder us in the heart of Miami, but God is with us, so it didn't work out for him. I want to say [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=74.72s)]
*  thank you to everyone for the support and that we don't take it for granted. Am Israel Hai, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=79.44s)]
*  before the message ended with Death to Arabs. So, let's just get this straight. In a story [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=85.52s)]
*  where this man shoots two Israelis, the overriding feeling in the hearts of both perpetrator and [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=92.72s)]
*  victims is hatred of Arabs. Interestingly, when the victims then appeared on the Israeli [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=99.12s)]
*  television channel Channel 13, they took a rather different tack from their post. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=104.64s)]
*  So they conclude that interview by saying no human being has the right to take the life of [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=134.79999999999998s)]
*  another human being. Do you agree with me? If you don't mind me saying so, this is quite the leap [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=142.39999999999998s)]
*  from Death to Arabs. It is not unreasonable to presume someone who writes those words as [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=147.6s)]
*  No Peasnick and is almost certainly a supporter of Israel's genocidal onslaught in Gaza and its [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=152.16s)]
*  murderous rampage in say Lebanon. So it'd be interesting to hear how he squares, no human being [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=158.16s)]
*  has the right to take the life of another human being with that. This remains an anti-Palestinian [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=162.8s)]
*  hate crime by the way. In truth, I'm not entirely aware of how Miami law operates in this area, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=168.16000000000003s)]
*  but in British law, perception and motive matter. For example, there's been multiple examples of [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=172.88000000000002s)]
*  British Sikhs being attacked by racists who believe them to be Muslim. This is then treated [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=177.36s)]
*  by British law as an Islamophobic hate crime. In Palestine itself, the genocidal frenzy of [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=182.8s)]
*  the Israeli state has led to the slaughter of Israelis. In December 2023, three Israeli [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=188.4s)]
*  hostages who were shirtless, thus clearly not armed, and waving a white flag and shouting in [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  Hebrew were shot dead by the Israeli army. Quite reasonably, the conclusion then was if these three [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  Israeli hostages were killed, then what hope for Palestinian civilians? A large number of Israeli [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=203.04000000000002s)]
*  hostages are known to have been killed by the Israeli state. We don't actually know how many, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=209.6s)]
*  but it is certainly significantly more than have been rescued by military means by the Israeli [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=215.68s)]
*  state. In the current so-called ceasefire in Gaza, Israel has reportedly violated the ceasefire [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=222.32s)]
*  266 times and killed 132 Palestinians. That we still call the ceasefire is indicative of just how [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=227.84s)]
*  devalued Palestinian life is. By contrast, a single Israeli has been killed in Gaza during [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  the so-called ceasefire that I'm aware of. His name? Jacob Avetan. He was a 39-year-old civilian [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=241.2s)]
*  contractor with Israel's defence ministry. And who shot him dead? The Israeli army, because they [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  thought he was a Palestinian. Now look, this all speaks to the nature of racism. What are known as [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=252.64s)]
*  races are social constructs. Racism is about how people are racialised. As a piece in the times of [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=259.76s)]
*  Israel noted back in 2016, many of today's Palestinians are descendants of the original [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=264.64s)]
*  Jews. They since converted to Christianity or Islam, or both. Christianity then Islam. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=270.48s)]
*  An article in Science Journal the turn of the century found that as per their genetics, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=275.52000000000004s)]
*  many Arabs and Jews are closely related. It noted that the Y chromosome in Middle East and Arabs [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  was almost indistinguishable from that of Jews. Another, more recent study in 2020 found that [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=284.8s)]
*  most of today's Jewish and Arab speaking populations share a strong genetic link to the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=290.64000000000004s)]
*  ancient Canaanites. And yet the Palestinian people are widely presented as subhuman Israeli society. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=295.6s)]
*  That's because this isn't about race. It isn't about religion. It's about dispossession and [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=301.36s)]
*  colonialism. A people would dispossess from their land, occupied and ethnically cleansed. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=306.56s)]
*  Accordingly, they are racialised as inferior in order to justify the fate imposed upon them, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=312.24s)]
*  much as the European colonisers racialised black Africans in order to justify enslaving them, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=317.76000000000005s)]
*  subjugating them, stealing their lands, thieving their resources and murdering huge numbers of [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=324.0s)]
*  them. What we do need to talk about is anti-Palestinian racism, which has only [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=329.2s)]
*  accelerated since Israel's genocide began. Morkai Rathmann, shooting two Israelis thinking they're [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=333.68s)]
*  both Arab and Israeli victims, believing their attacker was Arab and responding with death that [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=338.96s)]
*  Arabs is part of that. Now there's been endless talk about antisemitism and Jewish safety. Well, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=343.76s)]
*  antisemitism is real. It's an evil and Jewish people in the diaspora have the right to feel safe. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=350.16s)]
*  The problem of course is that real actual antisemitism and evil, which needs to be fought [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=357.36s)]
*  and is rising, has been conflated with any signs of sympathy with the Palestinian people, any signs [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=363.28000000000003s)]
*  of solidarity with the Palestinian people, objections to Palestinians being murdered. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=370.16s)]
*  A particularly shameless example of this was written by Melanie Phillips in the Jewish Chronicle [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=374.56s)]
*  headlined, If you support the Palestinian cause in any form, you're facilitating [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=379.28s)]
*  Jew hate. The subheading then singles out preposterously the governments of Canada, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=384.08s)]
*  the UK and Australia as some of the worst offenders. This is actually a helpful contribution [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=388.71999999999997s)]
*  for Melanie Phillips because it is simply honest about what Israel's cheerleaders have sought to do. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=394.47999999999996s)]
*  And while pro-Israel cheerleaders have sought to portray the left as the real danger when it comes [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=400.0s)]
*  to antisemitism, thanks for our solidarity with the Palestinian people, they not only let the far [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=404.23999999999995s)]
*  right off the hook when that's where the real danger of antisemitism comes from, the overriding [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=408.88s)]
*  danger comes from, they're often allied to that far right. Think Viktor Orban in Hungary amongst [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=414.32s)]
*  Israel's staunchest allies, which repeatedly uses antisemitic tropes against the opposition. Think [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=420.64s)]
*  of course Donald Trump who has made repeated antisemitic comments, and Elon Musk who not only [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=427.12s)]
*  did what many of us regard as two very clear cut Nazi salutes and told the far right German AFD [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=431.36s)]
*  that its country should move beyond its past guilt, but even endorsed the claim that Jewish [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=436.72s)]
*  communities promote hatred against whites. But note how anti-Palestinian racism and anti-Arab racism [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=441.12s)]
*  has simply been airbrushed on the conversation, underlining how Palestinian and Arab life simply [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=448.8s)]
*  doesn't matter. In October 2023, in Illinois, the United States, the 71-year-old landlord Joseph M. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=454.48s)]
*  Gazzouba stabbed to death a 6-year-old Palestinian American boy, Wadiya Al Fayoum. This little boy [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=461.52s)]
*  was stabbed 26 times, and his mother, 32-year-old Hanan Shaheen, was stabbed more than a dozen times. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=469.76s)]
*  Fortunately she survived. Investigators determined the victims were, and to quote the [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=475.44s)]
*  sheriff's office at the time, targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the ongoing [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=479.68s)]
*  Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis. His trial is now only due to start, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=484.56s)]
*  and the family have also launched a civil suit. In November 2023, three 20-year-old Palestinian [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=489.44s)]
*  college students were shot in the US state of Vermont whilst wearing traditional Palestinian [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=495.76s)]
*  scarves. They were walking near the home of their grandmother and stated they believed the shooting [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=500.8s)]
*  was a hate crime. One of them, Hisham Awatani, was left paralysed from the waist down. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=504.64s)]
*  Now these sorts of horrors are just memory hold. Where is the widespread denunciations of this? It's [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=511.6s)]
*  indicative of a very real danger which has been whipped up and incited. Again, it's not there. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=518.4s)]
*  Now this anti-Palestinian racism often merges with broader anti-Muslim hatred. Indeed it is today [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=526.24s)]
*  reported that Islamophobic assaults have surged by 73% in 2024 in Britain. In the US, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=532.24s)]
*  anti-Muslim incidents rose by about 70% in the first half of 2024. US politicians and media [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=539.6s)]
*  outlets have engaged in outright genocide against Palestinians. In November 2023, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=545.6s)]
*  a Republican state lawmaker, Michelle Salzman, was asked, we are at 10,000 dead Palestinians, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=552.0s)]
*  how many will be enough? She replied, all of them. In February 2024, the Tennessee Republican [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=557.76s)]
*  representative Andy Ogles was asked about the deaths of Palestinian children in Gaza and [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=563.6s)]
*  responded, we should kill them all. In July 2024, the US Senator Lindsey Graham described the [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=568.4s)]
*  Palestinians in Gaza as the most radicalised population on earth. Trump's pick for US [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=574.0s)]
*  ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, once declared, there's really no such thing as a Palestinian. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=579.6s)]
*  And indeed, broadly, we can see for example, false claims about the beheading of Israeli babies on [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=585.92s)]
*  the 7th of October, which never happened, used to whip up general fear and hatred of Palestinians [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=592.16s)]
*  as a whole. Within Israeli society, anti-Arab hatred is completely mainstream. In 2016, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=599.76s)]
*  long before 7th of October, nearly half of Israeli Jews reported they wanted to remove the entire [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=605.6s)]
*  Arab population of Israel, that is the Palestinian citizens of Israel, as in its official borders, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=611.6s)]
*  not the West Bank or Gaza. The mass ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian fifth of the Israeli [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=618.16s)]
*  population. In 2022, Israel Katz, now Israeli defence minister, warned Palestinian citizens [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=624.56s)]
*  of Israel that they would suffer another Nakba if they flew the Palestinian flag, the Nakba being [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=630.3199999999999s)]
*  the murderous ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in 1948. Israel's nation state law passed back in [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=635.52s)]
*  2018, enshrines the idea that only Jewish citizens of Israel have the right to self-determination. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=641.1999999999999s)]
*  A new poll finds that 72% of Jewish Israelis don't trust Palestinian citizens of Israel, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=646.9599999999999s)]
*  who again make up a fifth of that population, with 45% saying they're not willing to have [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=652.8s)]
*  social friendships with Arabs. Nearly three quarters support ethnically cleansing the [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=657.5999999999999s)]
*  entire population of Gaza, in line with Trump's genocidal proposition. 60% consistently oppose [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=662.4799999999999s)]
*  all humanitarian aid to Gaza, which would mean all Palestinians are dying. And, I'm afraid to say, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=668.7199999999999s)]
*  polling has suggested that the Israeli Jewish population is divided between those who think [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=675.04s)]
*  enough firepower has been used in Gaza and those who think not enough firepower has been used in [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=681.4399999999999s)]
*  Gaza. Now Israel of course imposes apartheid with the three million Palestinian citizens of the West [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=687.6s)]
*  Bank, subjected to the longest occupation of modern times, depriving them of basic rights, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=692.48s)]
*  imposing mass incarceration either through kangaroo courts or without charge or trial at all, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=698.64s)]

*  amongst other citizens, we could go on. Anti-Palestinian racism is simply the [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=710.0s)]
*  inevitable underpinning of Israeli settler colonialism. It's used to justify dispossessing [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=714.32s)]
*  and subjugating the Palestinian people. It's nothing specific to Israel and Palestine. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=719.92s)]

*  of an Israeli life or Western life. Anti-Palestinian hatred is embedded in Western media, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=759.12s)]
*  in Western politics and Western culture. It's not even acknowledged, let alone challenged, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=764.32s)]
*  instead it's promoted by our elites. That's the context in which driven by anti-Palestinian racism, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=768.56s)]

*  illness. Racism is not caused by mental illness. In this case, that hatred is caused by a Western [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUr0qjQe28g&t=791.68s)]
