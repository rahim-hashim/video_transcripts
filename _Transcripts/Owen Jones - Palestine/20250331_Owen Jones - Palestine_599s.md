# This Israeli Crime Will SICKEN YOU
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA)
*  There is no crime that Israel can commit in full view of the world that it can't get away with. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=0.0s)]
*  No crime too grotesque, no crime too depraved, no crime too sadistic. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=5.12s)]
*  Here is a brutal lesson that we have been forced to relearn over and over and over again. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=9.84s)]
*  Just over a week ago, as Israel launched its latest onslaught against what remains of Ra'far [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=16.32s)]
*  in the south of Gaza, 10 members of the Palestine Red Crescent were dispatched to [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=21.52s)]
*  collect those injured already by the Israeli military so that they could receive medical [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=25.44s)]
*  assistance. They were accompanied by six civil defence first responders. What happened next? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=29.6s)]
*  As the United Nations' Jonathan Whittle put it, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=34.88s)]
*  all five ambulances and one firetruck were struck along with a UN vehicle that arrived later. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=37.28s)]
*  Contact was lost with all. He goes on to say, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=43.040000000000006s)]
*  one survivor said Israeli forces had killed both of the crew in his ambulance. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=46.16s)]
*  For days, OCHA, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=50.48s)]
*  coordinated to reach the site but our access was only granted five days later. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=55.839999999999996s)]
*  On the way there, the OCHA team saw horrors, some of which they videoed, which I've watched, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=60.239999999999995s)]
*  which are too shocking to share here. While travelling, Whittle reported encountering [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=64.47999999999999s)]
*  hundreds of civilians fleeing as the Israeli army shot at them. They watched as a woman [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=69.36s)]
*  was shot in the back of the head and when a young man sought to retrieve her, he was shot as well. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=74.48s)]
*  They were able to recover her body with their UN vehicle. He goes on, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=81.36s)]
*  Returning the next day, we were finally able to reach the site and discovered a devastating scene. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=86.16s)]
*  Ambulances, the UN vehicle and a firetruck had been crushed and partially buried. After hours [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=90.64s)]
*  of digging, we recovered one body, a civil defence worker beneath his firetruck. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=95.76s)]
*  Just to be clear here, the Israeli army even sought to bury the ambulances, the firetruck [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=100.56s)]
*  and the UN vehicle after massacring the medical staff. He goes on, yesterday on the first day of [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=107.92s)]
*  Eid, the team returned. He said that they recovered the bodies of eight Red Crescent medical staff, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  six civil defence and one UN staff. He says they were killed in their uniforms, driving their [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  clearly marked vehicles, wearing their gloves on their way to save lives. This should never have [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=129.12s)]
*  happened. Now, the Israeli army, who are as pathologically addicted to lying and gaslighting [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=135.04s)]
*  as they are to extermination, claimed on Saturday that Israeli troops had opened fire towards Hamas [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=140.88s)]
*  vehicles and eliminated several Hamas terrorists. They go on, a few months afterward, additional [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=145.68s)]
*  vehicles advanced suspiciously towards the troops. The troops responded by firing towards the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=151.28s)]
*  suspicious vehicles, eliminating a number of Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists. The statement [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=155.44s)]
*  added that after an initial inquiry, it was determined that some of the suspicious vehicles [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  were ambulances and firetrucks and condemned what it claimed was a repeated use by terrorist [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=165.44s)]
*  organisations of the Gaza Strip of ambulances for terrorist purposes. Now, we know that the Israeli [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=170.4s)]
*  army lie and lie and lie again about their atrocities, relying on the fact that Western [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=175.44s)]
*  media outlets treat the Israeli authorities as credible, as respectable sources, and that while [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=180.32s)]
*  the truth about many Israeli atrocities is later established, the world's attention, generally [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=185.92s)]
*  speaking, moves on by then. What we do know is that according to the testimony of one surviving [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=190.88s)]
*  member of the rescue team, these medical staff and civil defence personnel were handcuffed and then [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=195.44s)]
*  executed before being buried in the sand. It is reported that almost all had gunshot wounds to [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=200.72s)]
*  their head and chest and that they were buried deep. So according to this evidence, medical [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=207.76s)]
*  workers and ambulances with civil defence first responders and a UN member staff were surrounded [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=212.32s)]
*  by Israeli army, in many cases handcuffed, executed and then buried deep in a mass grave. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=216.64s)]
*  The names of the ambulance crew members and their photographs have been released. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=222.95999999999998s)]
*  I'm going to read out their names. Let's remember them. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=226.23999999999998s)]
*  Mustafa Kavadja, Ezzedine Shad, Saleh Mohamad, Rifaat Radwan, Mohamed Beloul, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=229.12s)]
*  Ashraf Abu Labda, Mohamed Al-Hilal, Raeed Al-Sharif. Their funeral took place earlier today. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=237.2s)]
*  Another ambulance worker is missing, possibly kidnapped by the Israeli army. These ambulance [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=258.08s)]
*  workers, known as medical staff, defamed after being slaughtered by the Israeli army, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=262.96s)]
*  have been terrorists. The International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=267.59999999999997s)]
*  issued a statement in which they say they are outraged at these deaths, noting that their staff [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  disappeared when they came under heavy fire in Al-Hashashin on the 23rd of March, with seven days [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=276.24s)]
*  of silence and access being denied to the area of Rafa where they were last seen. The social [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=282.4s)]
*  general of the IFRC is quoted as saying, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=287.2s)]
*  I'm heartbroken these dedicated ambulance workers were responding to wounded people. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  They were humanitarians. They wore emblems that should have protected them. Their ambulances were [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=294.64s)]
*  clearly marked. They should have returned to their families. They did not. Even in the most complex [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=298.8s)]
*  conflict zones there are rules. These rules of international humanitarian law could not be clearer. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=303.2s)]
*  Civilians must be protected. Humanitarians must be protected. Health services must be protected. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=309.84s)]
*  And yet media outlets continue to strip away accountability from the Israeli states. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=315.35999999999996s)]
*  In classic BBC style, the original headline about this story was Red Cross [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=319.52s)]
*  outraged over killing of eight medics in Gaza. After widespread outrage online, this was changed [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=324.0s)]
*  to Red Cross outraged over killing of medics by Israeli forces in Gaza. I would note that this [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=329.2s)]
*  doesn't even make the BBC News Online's front page. Massacring medical workers and burying them [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=335.03999999999996s)]
*  in a mass grave. You would have once imagined that there would be a consensus that this sort [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=340.88s)]
*  of crime was an obscenity. I hardly need to tell you how the Western media would cover [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=344.88s)]
*  Israeli ambulances being attacked by Hamas militants who then mass execute the medical staff [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=351.28s)]
*  and civil workers and dump their bodies in a mass grave. It would dominate every newspaper front [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=358.64s)]
*  page, every news bulletin and be offered up as evidence of the utter depravity and evil of [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=364.08s)]
*  Hamas. But the victims here are Palestinians and their lives are judged to have little or no meaning [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=369.68s)]
*  and the perpetrator is the Israeli state and they are our allies. They are judged to be us, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=374.48s)]
*  the civilised West. The civilised West which butchers ambulance workers and then tosses [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=379.36s)]
*  their bodies into mass graves. This is not an exception. No, no, far from it. You can forget [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=383.84000000000003s)]
*  five-year-old Hind Rajab and her desperate, terrified phone call to the Palestine Red Crescent [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=388.72s)]
*  after an Israeli tank just metres away in broad daylight repeatedly fired on the vehicle she was [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=393.52000000000004s)]
*  in, slaughtering four of her cousins as well as her aunt and uncle. Two paramedics were sent in an [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=398.48s)]
*  ambulance to rescue her. Its movements coordinated with the Israeli so-called defence forces. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=403.52s)]
*  The IDF then blew the ambulance up. Several days later, the decomposing bodies of Hind and her [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=409.03999999999996s)]
*  family were found but very little remained of the incinerated paramedics. According to the United [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=414.24s)]
*  Nations, at least 1,060 healthcare workers have been butchered by the Israeli state in the 18 [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=418.96s)]
*  months of genocide in Gaza. They have been shot, they've been burned alive, they've been shredded [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=424.71999999999997s)]
*  by bombs and shells, they've been tortured and indeed raped to death as was reported by Dr Adnan [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=429.52s)]
*  al-Bush, the former head of orthopaedics at Al-Shifa Hospital. According to the United Nations [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=435.12s)]
*  inquiry into what's happened to the healthcare system of Gaza, as they found last October, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=441.2s)]
*  Israel has perpetrated a concerted policy to destroy Gaza's healthcare system as part of a [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=446.64s)]
*  broader assault on Gaza, committing war crimes and the crime against humanity of extermination, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=451.59999999999997s)]
*  with relentless and deliberate attacks on medical personnel and facilities. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=456.72s)]
*  Who could forget the slaughter of the World Food Kitchen aid workers last April? A rare example of [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=461.6s)]
*  an atrocity which got massive media attention because the victims, other than the Palestinian [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=467.36s)]
*  driver, were Westerners. When you look at all the evidence there, you would find it frankly impossible [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=472.48s)]
*  to imagine how the Israeli army could have killed them any other way than deliberately. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=476.72s)]
*  The consequences then of course were that multiple aid agencies suspended their operations in Gaza, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=480.96000000000004s)]
*  which I'm sure the Israeli authorities were devastated about, bearing in mind they have sought [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=485.28s)]
*  to deliberately starve the Palestinian people. After this latest massacre, medical agencies [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=488.88s)]
*  will judge it to be more dangerous to take part in rescue missions. This will mean more of the [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=494.47999999999996s)]
*  Palestinians who were injured by the Israeli military will die, thus helping Israel's genocide. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=498.79999999999995s)]
*  Right now, the genocide launch in Gaza has been heightened to new levels as we will discuss [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=504.79999999999995s)]
*  including Israel demanding all Palestinians flee Rafah in the south. But as I must emphasise, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=509.76000000000005s)]
*  and I will keep on emphasising, normalising this level of depravity will come at a huge cost. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=515.6800000000001s)]
*  It will come at a huge cost in so many ways. It will come at a huge cost because once this [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=522.72s)]
*  depravity is normalised, in this case, then it will be normalised in all cases. It will just lead to [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=528.4s)]
*  a cycle of barbarism. The level of hatred being whipped up against the West, because this is a [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=535.2s)]
*  Western crime, Israel for all intents and purposes is part of the West. The West is the civilisation, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=541.76s)]
*  if you like, which bankrolls and arms Israel as it commits these atrocities, makes all these [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=551.5200000000001s)]
*  atrocities possible. We will all suffer the consequences because the level of hatred being [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=554.88s)]
*  whipped up by this depravity is frankly going to spiral beyond any of our current imaginations. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=560.64s)]
*  This is grotesque and sickening and we will talk more about how Israel's genocide has been heightened [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knaBrE6_cPA&t=568.3199999999999s)]
