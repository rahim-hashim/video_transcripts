# Rafah Invasion Shows Israel Has LOST
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHTvL__zwd8)
*  Israel has lost this so-called war. Now before we discuss the murderous onslaught against Rafa,
*  which is in the south of Gaza, bear in mind what I just said there. Israel has suffered a
*  catastrophic defeat, militarily, strategically, politically, morally. It has failed in its stated
*  war aims, defeating Hamas, who will never be defeated by military means, as any seasoned
*  military expert will tell you. Indeed, they have taken over much of the destroyed areas of Gaza
*  that the IDF has withdrawn from. They haven't brought back the hostages, well, the vast majority
*  of those who were released, of course, only were so because of a ceasefire and negotiated
*  prisoner exchange. And Israel has killed far more of its own hostages than it has rescued by
*  military means. Israel's international reputation has all but completely collapsed. In the states it
*  depends on for weapons and diplomatic support, public opinion has swung decisively and irreversibly
*  against it. In the months and years ahead, the uncritical support it has received from those
*  states will unravel. Too many people have seen things they cannot unsee, heard things they can't
*  unhear, read things they cannot unread. That goes particularly for younger generations who will
*  increasingly assert themselves politically. Now much of the world already treated Israel as a rogue
*  state. That position will now be cemented. The fact that a new generation of younger Jewish
*  Americans repudiate what Israel stands for should terrify it the most. If the Israeli state was
*  capable of acting rationally, that is even in its own narrow selfish strategic interests, it would
*  understand all of this. Alas it cannot because it has been overwhelmed by genocidal fervour and is
*  suffering the fate of a settler colonial state which refuses to come to terms with what it's done
*  to the indigenous population it has displaced and oppressed. And it is trapped in an eternal cycle
*  of hateful radicalisation which will end very badly for it and crucially which has catastrophic
*  implications for its allies and patrons. Now that is not much consolation for the people of Gaza in
*  the here and now of course. Let's focus on Ratha which itself offers profound clues about Israel's
*  impending loss. Netanyahu's regime has no interest in a ceasefire, one which will lead to Netanyahu's
*  fall from power and potential domestic prosecution for corruption and potential war crimes indictment
*  by the International Criminal Court. If any such ceasefire happens it will be because it has been
*  forced on Israel. Now as an article in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz puts it,
*  to keep Netanyahu's partners on board and prevent them from preempting an election in which
*  Likud will be decimated and he will be turfed out of office, he needs to keep the total victory myth
*  alive and that is only possible by avoiding a deal with Hamas. Now if we just turn to look at what
*  Hamas accepted as a ceasefire deal because that left the Israeli state blindsided. Cheers went up
*  in Gaza amongst the desperate and traumatised population when they heard the news but Israeli
*  officials briefed the proposal that was approved by Hamas was a watered down version of Egypt's
*  offer and included elements Israel could not accept adding this would appear to be a ruse intended
*  to make Israel look like the side refusing a deal briefed an Israeli official. Well yes the appearances
*  are based on what Israel is in fact doing. Now crucially Israel turned on the US protectors
*  claiming CIA Director Bill Burns and other Biden administration officials involved in negotiations
*  knew about the proposal but didn't tell Israel and the last touches were made in Doha with the
*  Biden administration's knowledge they say that those they about the Israeli officials say that
*  the Israel got played by the United States but according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz according
*  to a foreign diplomatic source familiar with the negotiations the outline Hamas accepted
*  Munda Nile is that it's called the same as the Egyptian proposal which Israel had already
*  approved. Now since Sunday the CIA Chief William Burns and Qatari Prime Minister have had several
*  meetings during which an outline was reached based on the existing proposal and it was this that
*  enabled the breakthrough to Hamas's acceptance of the deal. Another diplomat closely familiar
*  with the proposal said that the ball is now in Netanyahu's court so that very much contradicts
*  what the Israeli state has said about the circumstances of Hamas accepting its CISRA.
*  Now the US has played of course a pivotal role in Israel's genocidal campaign providing the weapons
*  and diplomatic support but with US public opinion swinging decisively against Israel it turns out
*  like most of us most Americans don't actually like watching innocent civilians including huge
*  numbers of children being slaughtered so the Biden administration which faces possible defeat
*  against Donald Trump in November's presidential election decided they just couldn't contain the
*  consequences of an onslaught against Ra'far. That is of course where most of Gaza's population
*  have been forcibly displaced by Israel are now sheltering. Most of Gaza of course has been
*  destroyed. Ra'far is the last place which hasn't been ravaged by an Israeli ground assault. Now
*  Palestinians were told if they fled to the south they would be safe that was a lie. Israel has
*  repeatedly dropped 2 000 pound bombs on so-called safe zones in the south and crucially the nearby
*  southern city of Karn Younis has been virtually destroyed and they said over and over again
*  made it clear that the south would not suffer the sorts of fate of the north and yet we can see what
*  happened to Karn Younis estimates of 90 percent of its buildings ruined perhaps the most ravaged
*  part now of Gaza. Now the Ra'far crossing that's what connects Gaza to Egypt is also absolutely
*  crucial for any humanitarian aid to enter Gaza as this spokesperson for the Norwegian Refugee
*  Council made clear yesterday. If a Ra'far offensive takes place in full force that would lead to the
*  collapse of the aid response that is really reliant on the Ra'far hub to distribute aid to
*  organize aid throughout that area. When Israeli forces have seized control of the Ra'far crossing
*  Israeli soldiers film themselves crushing an I love Gaza sign well that's the perfect visual
*  metaphor for an onslaught defined by mass slaughter destruction and attempt to erase Gaza from the face
*  of the earth. Now let's focus on the humanitarian consequences of seizing the Ra'far crossing. Let's
*  just listen to this spokesperson from Gaza's main humanitarian agency UNRWA. What impact this border
*  crossing has had? The closure of the crossing I should say. Yeah the closure of the crossing
*  since Sunday is having catastrophic impacts on everyone in Gaza since October this has been the
*  main entry point for goods coming into Gaza there has only been a trickle of goods coming in and
*  since Sunday the crossing has been closed completely and this has devastating impacts
*  for the people of Gaza who are already on the verge of famine so no aid coming in means no aid
*  distributed after a couple of days and and equally importantly Ra'far, Karim Shalom are the only entry
*  point for fuel in Gaza so without the fuel there's no ability for trucks to move around there's no
*  ability for desalination plants to operate and provide safe water there's no electricity
*  it cuts off everything Ra'far, Karim Shalom they're the lifeblood for the small amounts of goods
*  that have been coming into Gaza since October so absolutely devastating. Now Israel has pursued a
*  deliberate policy of starvation it has explicitly and publicly and repeatedly promised it would do
*  that from the start and what it did was blockade from getting in impose lengthy and intentionally
*  onerous screening processes arbitrarily banning crucial aid from getting in over and over again
*  refusing to open sufficient crossings waging an all-out war against UNRWA the biggest humanitarian
*  agency with a smear campaign based on no evidence then blocking it in particular from accessing the
*  worst hit areas of northern Gaza allowing far-right Israeli protesters to block aid from getting in
*  destroying roads in Gaza so aid can't travel killing more aid workers than in any other
*  conflict in recorded history including foreign aid workers so that foreign NGO suspended their
*  work killing police officers charged with protecting aid convoys repeatedly massacring
*  Palestinians when they were searching for that food and at the same time destroying Gaza's domestic
*  food production agriculture we could go on you know blocking fuel from getting in so you can't get the
*  aid around now they seized the Ra'far crossing where aid comes in most of it well everything we
*  know about Israel's behavior suggests that spills catastrophe for Gaza as a whole the Ra'far crossing
*  was also the only place Palestinians could flee this genocidal carnage main target was to control
*  a rough crossing in fact what we have been seeing is that Israeli military tanks where it were
*  stationed inside the Ra'far crossing as we have been seeing images emerging there for these tanks
*  as they have been just moving on the yards of the crossing from inside and that's absolutely
*  devastating because this is the only point that Palestinians have been using for travel uprooted
*  and to leave the Gaza Strip but now no longer Palestinians will be able to leave the territory
*  let's listen to the brilliantly courageous Al Jazeera correspondent Hind Kaudhry on the
*  mood amongst Palestinians there all of these people have no idea where they're going because
*  it's and the central area is also packed we're talking about UN host UN facilities hospitals
*  schools even empty agricultural lands are now tents and hundreds of thousands of people
*  settle there displaced multiple times from place to another from central to the south Palestinians
*  are left in despair and fear not knowing where to go where no place in the Gaza Strip is safe
*  here's a Palestinian refugee in Rafa reporting just how grave their plight there is all the
*  options are finished for us there is no safe place to go to especially that we have family members
*  children and elderly sick people it'll be very hard for us to move from Rafa to another place
*  there is no other place let me tell you about Nahadeh who is a former Palestinian journalist
*  who I interviewed on this channel earlier this year now we raised enough money thanks to you
*  over 85 000 pounds to get him and his family out of Gaza including not just his children but the
*  kids of his brother who was killed by the Israeli state fortunately it's not that straightforward
*  we thought we were close to getting him out but we haven't managed to get him out yet and more to
*  the point we haven't managed to get him and his family out in time given what's just happened in
*  the night before last from Rafa he sent us a message he said it's three o'clock now after
*  midnight we didn't sleep at all the rockets around us from every side just tens of meters
*  numbers of close neighbors have been killed it's partly of killing kids newborn women and old in
*  addition to men and young people we do not know if we will survive or not if this continues till
*  morning it is one of the hardest nights in Rafa love you all my friends salam when I messaged
*  him later he said they forced us to leave Rafa from its eastern area to Kanyar city
*  we just reached I can't describe what is Kanyunas it's totally destroyed it's something like end of
*  the world movies horrible sad empty death everywhere no inhabitants he told me to share
*  these messages with the world to tell the people what those criminals do he added it's part of
*  their military operation against the civilians that destroy the city as they did previously
*  with Gaza and Kanyunas they are blood thirsty he adds I asked him about food and he says they have
*  the bare minimum quantity and the worst quality now I've seen hideous footage of the horrors
*  unleashed by Israel since the Rafa offensive including two children crushed to death the
*  tongue of one of them squashed out of his skull the eye of the other squashed out of his skull as well
*  in other videos first responders pick up the organs and remains of bodies from rubble
*  while a child her clothes incinerated her skin scorched off her body screams with pain
*  if these victims were not Palestinians if they were westerners these kids those responsible for
*  these barbarities would be denounced quite correctly as amongst the worst monsters of our time
*  but indeed one of the great atrocities of our age continues facilitated by our governments every
*  step of the way despite their hand-wringing now it's much much too late now Netanyahu declares
*  the entry to Rafa serves two of the main objectives of the war returning our hostages and eliminating
*  Hamas we've already proven in the previous release of hostages that military pressure on Hamas is an
*  essential condition for the return of our hostages I mean he's just rewriting history here given that
*  was a ceasefire agreement that's what allowed those hostages to be released and because of the
*  cessation of fire now he says the Hamas proposal yesterday was designed to torpedo the entry of
*  our forces into Rafa that did not happen as the war cabinet unanimously determined the Hamas proposal
*  was very far from Israel's core demands in the rest of his statement he declares he won't allow
*  Hamas to restore what he what he calls its regime of evil that a delegation will be sent to Cairo
*  for ceasefire talks with that in mind but meanwhile Israel will continue the war on Hamas as he puts
*  it in truth of course a war on the Palestinian people of Gaza now the Israeli anti-war academic
*  Ori Goldberg suggests the Rafa offensive is for domestic consumption and for the appeasement
*  of Netanyahu's base that a deal will be signed within the week that Netanyahu is doing this to
*  look tough on Hamas while bringing hostages home via deal that is and hopes that the Israeli public
*  is so used to him that he will remain in power and the this academic adds it's this only makes the
*  situation more shameful for the international community for Gaza and it concludes the genocide
*  in Gaza is even more serious for the indifferent careless way it was carried out seemingly at no
*  cost when this horror is over the international community should acknowledge its complicity
*  and Israel should face the consequences of his actions well whatever the treatment of this
*  analysis and obviously we must desperately hope for the violence to end his final conclusion is
*  of course correct yes Israel will continue to inflict horrific suffering and mayhem there's
*  no question about that I'm afraid to say but it has lost Israel will never recover from this
*  it spent seven months raising a war of annihilation against a strip of land no bigger
*  than East London and it has failed in its war eggs exposed its weakness brutally widened its
*  own internal divisions and turned global public opinion not least in the states which propped
*  it up against it they have lost and whatever happens if Rafa now will simply underline that loss
*  if they commit more atrocities more suffering then they will pay an even greater price
*  than they're already going to pay but it's up to us to turn that loss into justice that is justice
*  for the Palestinian people because as things stand they are a desperate cornered animal
*  and I think we all know that desperate cornered animals can inflict the worst damage yet please
