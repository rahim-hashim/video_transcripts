# Netanyahu Arrest Warrant From ICC Imminent
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyHAi6lGl4U)
*  Could Israel's leaders really face justice for some of the worst crimes committed in the 21st century?
*  Now, there's increasing chatter that the International Criminal Court will issue arrest
*  warrants for both Israel's leaders and Hamas leaders for war crimes. Now, some might find
*  this just impossible to believe, given the level of impunity which Israel has long been given,
*  but that impunity has been falling apart in real time for the last few months. Now, it's extremely
*  clear that, first of all, Benjamin Netanyahu, the blood-soaked Prime Minister of Israel,
*  believes that such an arrest warrant is imminent. On the 26th of April, he tweeted out,
*  Under my leadership, Israel will never accept any attempt by the ICC to undermine its inherent
*  right of self-defence. The threat to Caesar soldiers and officials of the Middle East,
*  only democracy in the world, only Jewish state, is outrageous. We will not bow to it. Israel will
*  continue to wage to victory our just war against genocidal terrorists, and we will never stop
*  defending ourselves. While the ICC will not affect Israel's actions, it would set a dangerous precedent
*  that threatens the soldiers and officials of all democracies fighting savage terrorism
*  and wanton aggression. Now, if you want a concise distillation of these words, it's rattled,
*  very rattled. The prospect of arrest warrants has done, has absolutely nothing to do with the
*  fact that Israel declares itself a Jewish state. And as for democracy, well, there was no democracy
*  experienced by the Palestinians subjected to its brutal occupation. It has everything to do with
*  the obscene crimes committed, of course, by the Israeli states. Now, in terms of what that means
*  for other states, it just means that they are less likely to commit war crimes because they think
*  there might be a response, regardless of whether they're a democracy or not, or they call themselves
*  a democracy. Not relevant. Now, such is his desperation that he's retweeted a piece by the
*  hard-wired commentator Douglas Murray, headlined, International Criminal Court's Vicious Smear
*  Tactics Against America's Allies. This piece makes some pretty outrageous insinuations, I have to
*  say, declaring about the court, not least because it is at least as open to corruption and
*  politicisation as any other court in the world, as Khan may be about to show. What's the suggestion
*  here then, that if he doles out arrest war crimes to both Israeli leaders and Hamas,
*  and Hamas, then that must mean corruption? What would the evidence be there for corruption,
*  other than them doing something you don't like? You can't just point to a decision you don't like
*  and say that's because of corruption, can you? What's the actual evidence? Now, this is a
*  particularly desperate line of attack because the International Criminal Court has actually
*  dragged its feet now for nearly seven months as hideous crimes, as I've said, some of the worst
*  of the 21st century are committed on a daily basis. Indeed, the chief prosecutor, Garry McCown,
*  the brother of a former Conservative MP, was nominated by a Conservative government,
*  elected with the support of the US, and indeed, after becoming chief prosecutor,
*  dropped the investigation into war crimes committed by US-led forces in Afghanistan,
*  as well as an investigation into the US's use of secret CIA prisons to torture detainees in Poland,
*  Romania and Lithuania. He, of course, also rightly slapped Vladimir Putin and one of his allies
*  with an arrest warrant for their crimes. Now, given what's rumoured is that he will also
*  slap Hamas leaders with arrest warrants, not sure the whole pointing at everything which calls out
*  war crimes and calling it Hamas is going to stick this time, guys. Now, according to the Israeli
*  newspaper Haaretz, the justice ministry and army officers are working hard to prevent this from
*  happening. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, strategic affairs minister Ron Durmer, the
*  United States and other Western countries are also striving to convince Garland to delay or
*  prevent the issuing of warrants, but it's not clear that they're succeeding. Interesting that,
*  isn't it? Just what's funny, given that Murray, Douglas Murray, wrote in that article, because
*  that sounds, what I just read, a lot more like politicisation and corruption to me. Various
*  foreign powers trying to lean on the ICC to stop it doing what it believes is in the interests of
*  justice. It's not knock-off, that is it. Israeli leaders say they believe the warrants will be
*  served sometime this week against Netanyahu, defence minister Yoav Garland and the chief of staff
*  of the Israeli defence forces, Herzl Halevi. Officials below them will be spared. Furthermore,
*  it adds, if warrants are served, each ICC member state, there are around 123, is obligated to arrest
*  and hand over the defendants of the Hague if they enter its territory. While there is no way to
*  appeal an international arrest warrant, any country can theoretically tell the court that it
*  is handling the case itself. It goes on to quote a former Israeli deputy attorney general who says
*  that issuing arrest warrants could lead to, say, an arms embargo and economic sanctions, as well
*  as placing Israel in the same category as countries that are considered transgressors against
*  international law. Well, I mean, Israel is a serial transgressor against international law,
*  but this really is a choice quote here. I mean, the many in this article, to be honest.
*  Some experts in international law say the attorney general and army officers are partly to blame
*  for not doing enough to prevent Israeli violations of international law.
*  Whatever could have given that impression? Let's just hear what the former Israeli chief military
*  advocate general and attorney general had to say at the start of this horror. He said,
*  if you want to destroy Hamas, then you have to destroy Gaza, because everything in Gaza,
*  almost every building there, is a stronghold of Hamas. Well, you see, if the current military law
*  is anything like that guy, then I think there might be a problem there for Israel. If that's
*  the advice, the sort of advice they're giving. What's the legal advice, boys? We're just going
*  to just destroy everything. Whatever, literally, whatever. Yeah, every building. Do you see the
*  problem? Yeah. So when you see an article, military lawyers didn't do enough to stop. Well, given one
*  of the top military lawyers in the country just openly said we need to destroy every building in
*  Gaza. It's a problem, isn't it? It is a problem. The problem actually is impunity has kind of sunk
*  Israel here, because it's led to all these people saying things out loud on the basis they think
*  they can get away with anything. But because so many of them said so many things out loud,
*  combined with the fact that Israel went and did all the things they said they were going to do
*  out loud. I mean, it's just like an open and short massive crime and a series of many, many
*  crimes. The article further goes on to quote Professor Eliev Liblik of Tel Aviv University,
*  who says, belligerent statements by Israeli politicians have not helped the Israeli cause.
*  One way of phrasing it, isn't it? I mean, to quote a viral tweet, well, well, well, if it isn't the
*  consequences of my own actions. Two examples are actually given there. For example, Israel Katz,
*  the former minister of Israel, demanded that the Gaza Strip's water supply be shut cut off,
*  because that's what murderers of children deserve. Just open collective punishment with a
*  blatant genocidal implication. They're saying that we should cut off everyone's water supply. I think
*  everyone is aware with just aware of basic human biology that you need water to live. On the basis
*  that everyone receiving that water, because that's the entire civilian population,
*  they're all child murderers. I mean, given 36 Israeli kids were killed in October,
*  which incidentally is a terrible crime. Every single murder of every child is a terrible crime.
*  It's unfortunate just saying that the entire population of Gaza are collectively responsible
*  and need to be punished for 36 kids being killed when it includes those buried under the rubble.
*  That's pretty good evidence to suggest 20,000 Palestinian kids have been killed.
*  And you know what? I don't believe that as a consequence, we need to cut off the water
*  supply of Israel, because I'm not a massive psychopath. Now, there have been so many examples
*  of genocidal statements by Israel's leaders that I actually forgot the one I just quoted there.
*  There were that many. Indeed, David Cameron, our foreign secretary, made it clear that Israel had
*  deliberately turned off the water supply to northern Gaza, despite his obviously ignored
*  hand wringing about it. Another example they cite here is the Diaspora Affairs Minister,
*  Amchai Chikli. He really is a delight that one. I mean, none of them are. He said that dropping a
*  nuclear bomb in Gaza was an option because Israel must find ways to cause suffering in Gaza.
*  Do you know what? I actually also forgot that one because there's another minister who also
*  called for nuclear bombs to be dropped from Gaza and I didn't realize there was actually two of them.
*  Now, let's be clear, as Raz Segal, the Israeli American associate professor of genocide and
*  Holocaust studies, told me months ago, there have been so many examples of genocidal rhetoric since
*  then. So we're talking about up to that point. He said, rarely has intent been so openly spoken
*  by a state. Normally, you see, the point he's making is they go to great lengths to cover
*  what they want to do for good reason. They fear the consequences. It's just Israel was granted
*  impunity, which clearly has backfired. So it believes quite rationally up to this point,
*  and it can behave how it wishes, which is one of the many reasons we are in this terrible horror
*  show. In the first place, they realize or thought to themselves, do we can do what we want? We can
*  do what we want. No one's going to stop us. Let's just talk about the next paragraph in this Harret's
*  article and just why it's just kind of, I mean, I don't even know where to start with this.
*  So, Leibniz said that such statements tie in in the international discourse with the widespread
*  destruction of the ground to claim that Israel intentionally harms civilians. He knows that such
*  statements played a key role in the lawsuit of the international justice. What's he saying here then?
*  What's he saying here? What? He's saying that maybe Israeli leaders declared over and over and
*  over again that they want the total destruction of Gaza and believe in the collective guilt of
*  the entire Palestinian population and often just publicly relish sadistically their suffering.
*  Do you think that might be relevant to what the Israeli state actually went and did?
*  That is the sound of pennies dropping. A little late in the day has to be said. I think he might
*  be onto something, this guy. I can see why he's a professor. This is known, what he's talking about,
*  is intent, you see. Now, very basic concept, very basic concept. I'm sure a professor understands
*  this, but clearly somethings just have to be explained. So what happened is the Israeli state
*  via its cabinet, war cabinet, various politicians, soldiers, generals, army officers,
*  what they did is they declared their intent from the very start. So in order to work out what Israel
*  was going to go and do, you just had to just listen to what they said. And they said these things,
*  their intent, over and over and over again with blood curdling honesty. And indeed, as I've said,
*  what they said they were going to do is what they went and did. Now, let's just flesh this out a
*  little bit in case, you know, because it seems like at the moment what's happening is Israeli
*  leaders and what they said and did is colliding brutally with reality. And they're probably
*  finding that a little bit disorientating because they really are used to getting away with anything.
*  Now, for example, if someone says, I'm going to torture someone and chop up their body
*  and throw their remains into a lake. And then they go and torture somebody. And then they chop
*  up their body and they throw their remains into a lake. What they said they were going to do would
*  indeed be a crucial element of the court case against them. I mean, it's weird that has to be
*  spelled out, but they did it to themselves, didn't they? They did it to themselves. Well,
*  they didn't. They slaughtered a huge number of Palestinians and now they're finally panicking
*  because they might actually have to face some consequences. Now, I'll just give you an example.
*  Jov Galan, defense minister on the 9th of October, declared Israel was imposing a complete
*  siege on Gaza. No electricity, no food, no water, no fuel. Everything is closed. We are fighting
*  human animals and we are acting accordingly. Now, I remember here because some people went,
*  he meant Hamas with the human animals. I mean, just park the fact that Israeli leaders
*  repeatedly made clear they see no demarcation between Hamas and Gaza civilians. After all,
*  Isaac Herzog, the president, declared it's an entire nation out there that's responsible.
*  It's not true, this rhetoric about civilians not aware, not evolved. It's absolutely not true.
*  We will fight until we break their backbone. Let's just park that for a minute. It doesn't make any
*  sense in the context of what Galan said because it means cutting off all the essentials of life to a
*  civilian population. You will note you can't survive without the things he listed. Indeed,
*  to drive that home, on the 9th of October, the Israeli army coordinator of government activities
*  in the territory, Major General Ghassan Ali, actually just made clear what was meant by
*  human animals. What he said is Hamas became ISIS and the citizens of Gaza are celebrating
*  instead of being horrified. Human animals are dealt with accordingly. Israel has imposed a
*  total blockade on Gaza. No electricity, no water, no damage. You wanted hell, you will get hell.
*  Do you see the problem here? You see the problem, guys? You see what happened there is he just went
*  and explained that they don't see any demarcation between civilians and Hamas. They regard civilians
*  as human animals. They're imposing a total blockade with all the basics of life being stopped
*  and that they were going to cause total devastation and that the civilians were going to get hell.
*  There's no real room for ambiguity there, is there? You see, the mistake made, I would say,
*  the Israeli leaders at this point is what it is they publicly declared they were going to commit
*  hideous war crimes on an industrial scale, which they then went and did. What's also open and short
*  about this, to be honest, I mean everything is, is the 1948 Genocide Convention prohibits the public
*  incitement of genocide. Israel itself signed that into law in 1950. The International Court of Justice
*  and its provisional orders ordered Israel to prosecute those engaging in genocidal incitement.
*  It hasn't done so. The Haredat's article notes that the attorney general, Gali Baharav Miera,
*  her refusal to investigate dozens of cases, dozens has been pretty generous there,
*  dozens of cases of suspected incitement to Israel, even after the ICJ's orders forced the ICC to act.
*  She was legally obliged, let's be clear, she was legally obliged to prosecute these people.
*  Under Israeli law, incitement to genocide carries the death penalty.
*  I don't support the death penalty under these circumstances. I think these people should be
*  locked away for the rest of their lives, don't get me wrong, but I don't believe in the death
*  penalty. But I'm just saying what Israeli law is. They've defied international law and their own
*  laws here. That's why the ICC has to act. Indeed, just on Yoav Gallant's statements,
*  and this is crucial because it is believed that the deliberate starvation of the Palestinian people
*  is a very important plank of all this in terms of what is possible in terms of the arrest warrants.
*  His statement that Israel very clearly did cut off the basics of life, as well as destroying
*  agriculture and domestic food production in Gaza, destroying roads and infrastructure,
*  which allowed aid trucks to get around, conducting the biggest slaughter of aid workers in recorded
*  history, waging war against UNRWA, Gaza's main humanitarian agency, based on unevidence smear,
*  specifically blocking aid to reaching northern Gaza, the worst affected, we could go on.
*  As David Cameron, UK Foreign Secretary, noted, Israel has deliberately thrown up multiple
*  obstacles to block and delay even limited aid getting into Gaza. In a letter that led to
*  Elon Levy, the Israeli spokesperson being fired, there was all of this a famine. Now,
*  the Halit's article gets better and better. Professor Lee Blick there from Tel Aviv University,
*  let's keep creating this guy. He goes on to note the sense that the high command does not fully
*  control the forces on the ground. He says, almost every day videos are servicing online where
*  soldiers are documenting improper conduct. This leads to distrust in official statements
*  about the IDF acting in accordance with the laws of combat. I'm not going to let you get away with
*  that one, professor, that level of contrived naivety. On the 10th of October, Jov Galan,
*  defence minister in charge of the soldiers he's talking about, specifically told those soldiers
*  on Gaza's border, he said he had released all the restraints on them, adding,
*  you'd think that's kind of enough, but in case anyone was scratching their heads thinking,
*  what does that mean? Well, he added to that Gaza won't return to what it was before. We will
*  eliminate everything. If it doesn't take one day, it will take a week. It will take weeks or even
*  months. We will reach all places, eliminate everything, released all the restraints.
*  Two days later, he declared publicly that he had removed every restriction on Israeli forces.
*  Well, how's that going to be interpreted by troops then? Just be clear about this. These
*  very angry troops have been whipped up to impose vengeance on human animals. All the
*  restrictions and all the strains lifted on them. I think most people would understand that as,
*  do what the hell you like. The Russian minister of defence has said this, we wouldn't even have to
*  debate this. Indeed, given the idea of soldiers are posting their war crimes, as noted, and
*  boasting about their war crimes, as noted, all over social media, why not just discipline them?
*  It's not like the idea of hasn't sent soldiers to prison before. In fact, they did join this horror.
*  If people think they're just a soft touch, guess what it was for. Go and have a guess. Why were
*  these soldiers sent to prison? Killing children? Destroying civilian infrastructure? Torture?
*  No. Two soldiers were sentenced to 20 days in prison. Guess what their crime was? Making hot
*  dogs. Hot dogs and shabat. That's what they were sent to prison for. Not like they can't discipline
*  soldiers when they really want to. Now, here's another amazing paragraph. Doreen Lustig, an
*  assistant professor at Tel Aviv University, notes that the shooting at aid convoys, the destruction
*  of hospital and university buildings, and especially the killing of world central aid workers,
*  have worked against Israel. The framing here is really quite extraordinary. Israel committing
*  terrible war crimes has worked against Israel. Yeah, I'd imagine that would happen. Israel's case
*  that it isn't committing war crimes has been undermined by Israel committing war crimes.
*  Yeah, that's true. I can't argue with that logic. The facts really are just extraordinarily clear.
*  You see, what Israel leaders did is they promised they would commit terrible crimes.
*  What they then did is go on to commit the terrible crimes they promised, and indeed,
*  they continue to commit the terrible crimes that they promised, including Benjamin Netanyahu himself,
*  who quite deliberately twice invoked the story of Amalek in the Bible, specifically in a letter to
*  soldiers, in which the Israelites were commanded to respond to an attack by the Amalek nation
*  by killing all men, women, children, babies, and livestock. Israel has devastated most of
*  the civilian infrastructure of Gaza. It has destroyed its healthcare system. It has destroyed
*  its means of producing its own food. It has besieged the essentials of life. It has forcibly
*  displaced the vast majority of its population. It has, according to multiple reports, engaged in
*  torture and indeed sexual abuse and rape. It has violently slaughtered tens of thousands of people,
*  mostly women and children. It has slaughtered aid workers. It has slaughtered journalists,
*  and has often slaughtered them alongside their entire families, and the crimes could just go on
*  and on and on in terms of listing them. It has done so openly, without shame, for the whole world
*  to see. In fact, it's ludicrous, frankly, and shows what an absurd world we're in, that we even
*  have to debate whether the ICC should be issuing arrest warrants, which they should have done a
*  long time ago. This, my friends, is an open and shut case. If this isn't a litany of grotesque
*  and undeniable war crimes, then there is no such thing as a war crime. And the consequences of
*  publicly declaring that, which is what the ICC would do if it doesn't issue these arrest warrants,
*  is to further destabilise an already increasingly violent, unstable world. You see, impunity imposed
*  on Israel has had catastrophic impacts for the West, because the West has an ill-deserved moral
*  authority, which most of the world does not take seriously. But my God, how does the world now look
*  at these claims by the West after they facilitated crime after crime after crime in full public view?
*  Indeed, a brilliant piece by Amos Goldberg, who is a Holocaust and genocide researcher at Hebrew
*  University in Jerusalem, answers the repeated nonsense, defence of Israel's leaders and their
*  apologists. The claim is it can't be genocide. That is often made by Israel's leaders because
*  this is self-defence. Now, forget a minute the erasure of decades of what the Palestinians have
*  been subjected to. Ethnic cleansing, occupation, siege, apartheid, repeated mass slaughters, of
*  course, torture, land theft and colonisation. We could go on. Park the fact that legally self-defence
*  applies to being attacked by another state, which under international law, Gaza was still legally
*  termed as being under Israeli occupation when Hamas and other armed groups committed undeniable
*  atrocities on the 7th of October. The point made by Goldberg is many genocides have been framed by
*  the perpetrators as self-defence. You see, education about the history of genocides
*  has led to widespread ignorance about genocide. So the Holocaust becomes the sole reference point
*  for most people. But you see, when it comes to genocide, the Holocaust is actually an outlier
*  as an industrialised attempt to exterminate an entirely defenceless civilian population.
*  I mean, it is an outlier very much in that sense. And he references the work of Israeli journalist
*  Yuval Abraham based on briefings by Israeli military intelligence sources about the use
*  of artificial intelligence services to select targets and carry out assassinations, writing,
*  the fact that the military allowed, for example, the killing of 300 innocent people and the
*  destruction of an entire residential quarter in order to take out one Hamas brigade commander
*  shows that military targets are almost incidental targets for killing civilians
*  and that every Palestinian Gaza is a target for killing. This is the logic of genocide.
*  And he references some other key examples like Bosnia, where the Bosnian Serbs had suffered
*  genocide in World War II, which they used to justify claims of feeling threatened. And they
*  suffered atrocities, thousands actually of Bosnian Serb civilians were killed. That did not mean the
*  Bosnian Serb army did not commit genocide. Indeed, Rwanda with its minority Tutsi population,
*  which once that's where its rulers were drawn from until it was displaced, allowing Houthi majority
*  rule. And the Tutsis then suffered oppression, discrimination driven from their land in many
*  cases. And then Tutsi army in 1990 invaded Rwanda from Uganda. And guess what? They committed many
*  atrocities. They killed people and they actually raped people. That's documented. Now, Houthi
*  extremists claim the Tutsi were going to commit genocide against them. It was kill them or be
*  killed. That's what they said. And the Tutsi forces continued over the next four years to
*  commit terrible atrocities, including during the genocide itself. He writes, as a result in the
*  eyes of the Houthi regime, the Tutsi became collectively identified with an actual military
*  enemy. There was a parallel there, but the Houthi extremists did commit genocide. Self-defense
*  wasn't an excuse. This was one of the great crimes of our age. So to end, right now,
*  Western states are doing everything they can to pressure the ICC to stop justice from happening.
*  That's an outrage. This is one of the great crimes of our age. And we've got to have justice,
*  obviously, because otherwise these evils will just multiply and we'll be stuck in a doom loop of death
*  and destruction. And by the way, it's absolutely right Hamas leaders are also tried for war crimes,
*  which they did commit, for which there is no justification, none whatsoever. The point is
*  that Israel's war crimes are far graver, far bigger, and were armed and backed by the West
*  and legitimized by Western media outlets. So it's not just Israeli leaders who should be feeling
*  pretty nervous right now. We've got to hold to account the Western leaders and Western media
*  outlets, which made this atrocity possible. That's why these Western leaders are trying to stop this
*  from happening because they know this implicates them. If the ICC issues these arrest warrants,
*  and it is an absurd disgrace if they do not, then everyone who made this horrendous atrocity possible
*  must be held to account. Please like and subscribe. Do share your comments. Do you share your thoughts?
