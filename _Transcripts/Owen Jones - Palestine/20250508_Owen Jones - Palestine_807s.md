# Tide TURNS On Israel As Rightwing Newspaper And Conservatives DENOUNCE West's Shame
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI)
*  This feels like a big moment. Western complicity in Israel's genocide against the Palestinian people [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=0.0s)]
*  is being denounced by a right-wing newspaper and Conservative MPs in the UK. What does that tell us? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=5.68s)]
*  It tells us that it's increasingly clear what the judgement of history will be on this [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=12.72s)]
*  grotesque crime, as well as the judgement of the courts. Let's begin with the Financial Times, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=17.12s)]
*  a pro-business newspaper which is mostly about the Conservative Party in the last few general [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=23.6s)]
*  elections in the UK, that's Labour last time, reflecting how it believed that Kirsten Amir had [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=28.24s)]
*  shifted to a position of defending the status quo, but before that the Conservative Party [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=35.68s)]
*  over and over again repeatedly. The editorial which reflects the official position of the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=39.2s)]
*  newspaper is headlined, The West's Shameful Silence on Gaza. It begins with, after 19 months [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=43.28s)]
*  of conflicts that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and drawn accusations of war crimes [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=50.08s)]
*  against Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu is once more preparing to escalate Israel's offensive in Gaza. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=55.52s)]
*  Well yes, look, technically they are accusations because nobody has been tried and convicted in a [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=61.92s)]
*  court of law yet, despite the International Criminal Court issuing public arrest warrants [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=67.12s)]
*  against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence minister Yoav Galan for both [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=72.0s)]
*  war crimes and crimes against humanity. It's understood that the ICC will issue further [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=77.84s)]
*  charges and arrest warrants that have been ordered to keep those secret. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=84.0s)]
*  But it is as obvious that war crimes have been committed by Israel against the Palestinians [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=89.68s)]
*  as it is that the earth revolves around the sun and that autumn follows summer. Every war crime [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=95.04s)]
*  possible has been committed. They have been publicly confessed to and boasted about by Israeli [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=102.08s)]
*  leaders, officials and soldiers. They've been recorded on film, documented by experts and [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=106.72s)]
*  Palestinian journalists who often paid the ultimate price for telling the truth, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=112.0s)]
*  often alongside their entire families. Amongst legal experts there's a consensus that war crimes [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=116.64s)]
*  and crimes against humanity have been committed, just as there is a near consensus among genocide [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=121.28s)]
*  scholars that genocide is being committed. It goes on, let's carry on reading. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=125.76s)]
*  The latest plan puts Israel on course for full occupation of the Palestinian territory [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=131.84s)]
*  and would drive Gazans into ever-naering pockets of the shattered strip. It would lead to more [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=136.24s)]
*  intensive bombing and Israeli forces clearing and holding territory while destroying what [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=141.04s)]
*  few structures remain in Gaza. This would be a disaster for 2.2 million Gazans who have already [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  endured unfathomable suffering. Each new offensive makes it harder not to suspect that the ultimate [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=151.68s)]
*  goal of Netanyahu's far-right coalition is to ensure Gaza is uninhabitable and drive [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=158.23999999999998s)]
*  Palestinians from their land. Well look, there's no reason to speculate about this because the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=162.95999999999998s)]
*  Netanyahu government has simply gone out and said what they intend to do. At the end of March, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=168.24s)]
*  Netanyahu said publicly that Israel will allow the realisation of the Trump plan for [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=171.52s)]
*  voluntary migration. This is the plan, he said. We're not hiding this on our ready to discuss it [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=176.24s)]
*  at any time. No nuance there, no room for interpretation. Now clearly voluntary migration [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  is a nonsense. Palestinians don't want to leave their home. Israel has objectively sought to make [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=185.28s)]
*  Gaza uninhabitable, as the Financial Times suggests, with the hope that the survivors feel [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=190.08s)]
*  there is no other choice but to flee, because there are no homes left standing, because the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=194.8s)]
*  healthcare system is destroyed, because agriculture and food production is destroyed, and aid is not [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=198.96s)]
*  allowed in, that reliable access to clean fresh water is destroyed, that there is no education [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=204.08s)]
*  system, that there's no plan to offer any reconstruction to offer a future for the people [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=209.36s)]
*  who are living there still. In any case, the finance minister Bezalel Smoczic simply declared [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=213.68s)]
*  this week, Gaza will be entirely destroyed, civilians will be sent to the south to a [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=218.4s)]
*  humanitarian zone without Hamas or terrorism, and from there they will start to leave in great [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=222.96s)]
*  numbers to third countries. There was no subtlety there. From the very start, all you had to do is [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=227.12s)]
*  take the statements issued by Israeli leaders and officials literally, just out of their word, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  but Western media outlets refused to do this. It's like those statements were being issued in a [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=236.56s)]
*  parallel universe as far as the Western media were concerned. If they had done their job, they would [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=240.8s)]
*  have framed their coverage around the often nakedly genocidal statements being issued by the Israeli [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=246.32s)]
*  leadership because they exposed intent. Even now, that does not happen. Here is a crucial passage. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=251.2s)]
*  For two months, Israel has blocked delivery of all aid into the Strip, child malnutrition rates [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=257.92s)]
*  are rising, the few functioning hospitals are running out of medicine, and warnings of starvation [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  and disease are growing louder. Yet the US and European countries that tout Israel as an ally, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=267.36s)]
*  that shares their values, have issued barely a word of condemnation. They should be ashamed [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=272.64s)]
*  of their silence and stop enabling Netanyahu to act with impunity. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=276.72s)]
*  Here the Financial Times refers to a straightforward war crime. It is, as they know, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=280.32000000000005s)]
*  an objective fact that Israel has imposed a total blockade on Gaza since the 1st of March. Israel [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=284.72s)]
*  has publicly declared this. It's not a contestable assertion. It's not open to debate. Imposing a [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  total blockade on all the essentials of life reaching a civilian population is inarguably [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=293.76000000000005s)]
*  a war crime, which is why the Financial Times does not earlier on in this editorial need to [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=299.52000000000004s)]
*  refer to accusations of war crimes against Israel. Nonetheless, the Financial Times makes [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=304.24s)]
*  a striking point. Israel's Western allies have issued barely a word of condemnation, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=309.52s)]
*  and this right of centre establishment newspaper, read by city slickers, hedge fund managers and [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=314.24s)]
*  the like, says that Western governments should be ashamed of their silence. The sort of words we [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=318.72s)]
*  have heard for a long time from the platforms of pro-Palestinian protests, now printed as the [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=323.68s)]
*  official position of the Financial Times. It should be noted of course that it goes far beyond [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=328.08s)]
*  silence. After all, many of these states have armed Israel to the teeth. They have offered [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=332.16s)]
*  diplomatic support and political support. They have demonised and clamped down on and silenced [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=336.24s)]
*  those who have sought to oppose this genocide. They are not just complicit with their silence, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=340.8s)]
*  they have directly facilitated this monstrous crime. The Financial Times notes that Trump has [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=345.28000000000003s)]
*  acknowledged Palestinians are starving and claims he'll help get food to Gaza, but says, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=350.56s)]
*  so far, the US president has only emboldened Netanyahu. That deal was struck in which Hamas [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=355.76000000000005s)]
*  agreed to free hostages in phases while Israel withdrew from Gaza and a permanent ceasefire [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=360.16s)]
*  struck, but then Trump announced what the Financial Times described as an outlandish plan for Gaza to [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=364.72s)]
*  be emptied of Palestinians and taken over by the US. Now come on now, emptying Gaza of its [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=370.24s)]
*  Palestinians, describing that as outlandish, I think euphemistic is putting it mildly given the [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=376.56s)]
*  circumstances. Outlandish suggests unfeasible, far-fetched, not practical, rather than a grave [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=383.04s)]
*  crime. Nonetheless, the Financial Times say in March, Israel collapsed the ceasefire as it [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=387.92s)]
*  sought to change the terms of the deal with Washington's backing. What is disturbing here [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=392.96000000000004s)]
*  is just reading this feels like coming up for air because even this incontrovertible fact is [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=397.6s)]
*  barely being treated as such by other Western media outlets. It goes on, senior Israeli officials [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=402.0s)]
*  have since said they are implementing Trump's plan to transfer Palestinians out of Gaza. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=408.48s)]
*  On Monday, far-right finance minister Bezelow Scrupum-Motchart said, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=413.28000000000003s)]
*  we are finally going to occupy the Gaza Strip. Okay, so we don't need to suspect anything, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=416.48s)]
*  do we? I mean, I quoted Bezelow Scrupum-Motchart's actual full statement from Tuesday. It's an [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=420.8s)]
*  objective fact what they're intending to do. Now the article goes on to condemn Netanyahu further, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=427.52s)]
*  noting the renewed onslaught will impair all the lives of Israeli hostages as well as further [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=432.56s)]
*  undermine Israel's tarnished standing. Well, I think it's fair to say that particular boat has [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=436.88s)]
*  sailed a long time ago. A state which commits genocide in full public view has crossed the [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=441.76s)]
*  Rubicon and is not going to return. Now the article goes on to rightly critique Arab leaders [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=445.52s)]
*  for being infuriated by Netanyahu but compromised by Trump's promises of multi-billion dollar [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=450.0s)]
*  investments and arms deals demanding Arab states stand up to Israel. The article concludes as [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=454.32s)]
*  follows, the global tumult triggered by Trump has already distracted attention from the catastrophe [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=460.0s)]
*  in Gaza, yet the longer it goes on, the more those who remain silent or cowed from speaking out will [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=465.28s)]
*  be complicit. As I've said all the way through, those with power and influence who have stayed [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=469.76s)]
*  silent are complicit. Those who still support this grotesque abomination will be on the pale [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=477.44s)]
*  from the start. I mean, they by this point should just be regarded as deranged sociopaths. It's the [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=482.64s)]
*  silent who needs to be damned as well. Every atrocity in history was made possible by the silent [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=488.64s)]
*  and the silent does not exclude when I use that term. It doesn't exclude those who say, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=495.03999999999996s)]
*  well it's also complicated and issue platitudes about how sad it is about the suffering of the [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=499.28s)]
*  Palestinian people. It's those who failed to call a crime what it is who are still complicit. That [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=503.12s)]
*  still counts as silence. Not speaking out about what is actually happening. Not defining a crime [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=509.68s)]
*  as a crime. Now as well as the Financial Times, British Conservative MPs who were previously [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=514.88s)]
*  staunch supporters of Israel have begun to speak out. More than a dozen Tory MPs have broken [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=519.84s)]
*  ranks to demand the immediate recognition of Palestine. And listen to this Tory MP, Mark [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=524.8s)]
*  Pritchard. Of course Israel is an important security trade and democratic partner but that [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=530.3199999999999s)]
*  doesn't give it a blank check. The fact is that 13,000 children have been killed, 25,000 have been [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=536.0799999999999s)]
*  injured, maimed, wounded, orphaned, some of them. And for many years, I've been in this house 20 [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=543.52s)]
*  years, I have supported Israel pretty much at all costs quite frankly. But today I want to say that [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=550.08s)]
*  I got it wrong. And I condemn Israel for what it is doing to the Palestinian people in Gaza and [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=556.5600000000001s)]
*  indeed in the West Bank. And I'd like to withdraw my support right now for the actions of Israel, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=564.24s)]
*  what they are doing right now in Gaza. Of course the hostages should be released. Of course [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=571.44s)]
*  that Israel has the right to exist. Of course the Israeli people, the Jewish people, should have the [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=578.32s)]
*  right to live in peace. But so do the Palestinian people. And I've said it before and I'll say it [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=583.6s)]
*  again, that the life of a Palestinian child is as precious as the life of a Jewish child. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=589.2s)]
*  And this particular moment in time, we've had lots of statements over the last 18 months, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=597.0400000000001s)]
*  this is not only this Parliament's not greatest hour. I'm really concerned that this is a mode [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=602.64s)]
*  in history when people look back where we've got it wrong as a country. Can the Minister stand up [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=610.0799999999999s)]
*  to our friends and allies in the United States and make a strong stand for humanity, for us being on [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=617.1199999999999s)]
*  the right side of history, for having the moral courage to lead, not just to follow the United [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=625.76s)]
*  States and to make a difference? That's why we're all elected here. Let's stand up for life. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=631.6s)]
*  Let's stand up for all children, not just Jewish children. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=637.12s)]
*  This is quite astonishing. He says there straightforwardly he got it wrong, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=641.6800000000001s)]
*  having been a loyal supporter of Israel. This illustrates how people are beginning to realise [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=645.52s)]
*  the savage judgement that will befall all those who fail to do something when they have the chance. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=650.64s)]
*  You see, MPs of all stripes, Labour, Conservative and so on, they knew what was happening. They knew [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=656.72s)]
*  what was happening from the beginning. I'm not having this nonsense. I didn't know. How could I [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=665.28s)]
*  have known from the beginning? Now it's all spun out of control, obviously. I didn't sign up for [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=670.4s)]
*  this. I warned at the beginning. I warned at the beginning they'd try and do this, you know. I [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=674.24s)]
*  warned they'd say, well, if I knew then what I knew now, I'd have spoken out. You know, this just [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=678.48s)]
*  went too far. They said what they were going to do, guys. They told you. They were not in any way [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=685.36s)]
*  holding back their intent. They just told the world what they were going to do and they did it. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=692.16s)]
*  Within weeks, Gaza appeared a different colour and texture from space because it had been so [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=698.48s)]
*  thoroughly pummeled. This is not new after 19 months. This atrocity was an obvious grave evil [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=705.44s)]
*  from the beginning. I can say that because some of us said so at the beginning, not because we were [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=713.76s)]
*  prophets or geniuses, but because we could hear what was being said and see what was being done. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=721.04s)]
*  It's really very straightforward. Now, after 19 months of relentless abominations, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=729.12s)]
*  the silence begins to break. Even the financial times that even conservative MPs who were [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=736.56s)]
*  previously Israel supporters have spoken in these terms underlines how this will end. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=744.56s)]
*  This is one of the great crimes of our age and some of us knew from the very beginning that this [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=749.4399999999999s)]
*  would be one of the great crimes of our age. We took literally what Israeli leaders and officials [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=753.68s)]
*  said. We saw the apocalyptic devastation unleashed by Israel from the very beginning. We saw the war [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=758.56s)]
*  crimes being live streamed every single day. There was no excuse for not knowing. No one can [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=762.72s)]
*  claim ignorance, not anyone with power or influence. And now that silence is beginning to disintegrate [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=770.24s)]
*  as the obscene scale of the crime is impossible to ignore. Well, accountability is going to come. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFzPZSG-EjI&t=774.88s)]
