# Israel Deliberately Kills Kids - Hind Rajab's Murder Exposed As DELIBERATE
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [June 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWhrQAXkOWY)
*  The Israeli state deliberately kills children. This is a fact. That's what a new study has
*  decisively proven. Now, some context before I go into this study. We've constantly heard claims by
*  cheerleaders of the Israeli state and indeed leading figures of the Israeli state that Hamas
*  deliberately kills civilians while Israel does not. This is an attempt to claim that Israel's
*  violence has more superiority over that of Hamas, even as Israel has slaughtered countless more
*  civilians. Indeed, we should all be agreed that each and every of the 36 Israeli children killed
*  on the 7th of October represented a heinous crime. That this therefore means the around 14,000
*  Palestinian children we know to have been killed is a crime of unimaginably obscene proportions,
*  and that, forget, is itself likely to be a drastic underestimate. More on that later. Indeed,
*  it should be noted that many of the Israeli children killed on 7th of October were killed
*  by untargeted Hamas rockets, while Israel claims it has more superiority because it uses targeted
*  missiles, which given the biblical death toll is rather hard to process. Around 3.5% of those
*  killed on 7th of October were children, including one baby who was killed after Hamas militants
*  shot bullets through the door of a safe room. Approximately 40% of Palestinians killed by
*  the Israeli state since 7th October are children. Now this new study is a joint venture between
*  Forensic Architecture, a research agency based at Goldsmiths at the University of London,
*  and Al Jazeera Journalists. It's a study into the killing of Hind Rajab, who was six years old,
*  along with her family, including four other children, her cousins and two adults,
*  on 29th January this year. Her family had been attempting to flee their neighbourhood in Gaza
*  City as Israeli forces invaded. The Israeli army had posted an evacuation order on social media
*  telling residents of West Gaza City, including where they lived, to go south, with satellite
*  imagery showing it wasn't possible for them to move south in the morning because of debris
*  from a recently destroyed high-rise building. Now her 15-year-old cousin, Lion, had roomed the
*  Palestine Red Crescent to beg for help. And then you could hear her being shot to death
*  by Israeli forces. Hind then rings the Red Crescent herself and begs for help,
*  emphasising how scared she was and that she was scared of the dark. You can hear the ambulance
*  operator being extremely emotional as she chats, talks to a deeply traumatised and terrified little
*  five-year-old girl. Both Hind and her cousin reported clearly that there was a tank nearby.
*  Only the Israeli state has tanks. The Red Crescent sent an ambulance with coordinates sent to the
*  Israeli forces. The Israeli forces then destroyed the ambulance, killing both paramedics. Their
*  bodies were found two weeks later, as well as the bodies of this family. In this car,
*  which had been riddled with bullets, and it should be said in terms of the paramedics,
*  almost nothing remained of their bodies, they were found about 50 metres away.
*  Now according to the Forensic Architecture study, the mother of Hind, who wasn't in the car,
*  saw shots fired at the car from an intersection to the north of the home. The satellite images
*  showed Israeli military vehicles with the shape and size consistent of Israeli Macava tanks.
*  The analysis of these experts suggests the shape of the depression of the windshield
*  of the car suggests it was run over by a light vehicle, likely an Israeli military
*  bulldozer made by Caterpillar. They've used the visual evidence to map the bullet marks and mapped
*  a total of 335 bullet holes on the body of the car. The analysis of the recording of the phone
*  call made by 15-year-old Lion, Hind's cousin, finds that there was a total of 64 gunshots during
*  that conversation, which could be heard, fired in just six seconds. Those firing the shots were
*  firing at a range of 750-900 rounds per minute, which exceeds that of an AK-type rifle, most
*  commonly used by Hamas. They suggest instead the experiments are consistent with weaponry issued
*  by the Israeli army, like the M4 assault rifle or the type of machine gun used on a Macava tank.
*  The analysis finds that the tank could only have been between 13 and 23 metres away from the car
*  when Lion was shot. At such proximity, it is not plausible that the shooter could not have seen
*  that the car was occupied by civilians, including children. They add,
*  Earshot audio ballistic analysis supports the final words of Lion Hamada. The gunfire came from
*  a tank that was next to them. The experts go on to conclude the following. From the tank position
*  indicated by the greatest alignment between entry and exit holes, we concluded that the shooter
*  would have had a clear view of the car and its passengers. In other words, they would have been
*  aware of the presence of two children. That is of course Hind and her cousin Lion. This research is
*  extremely clear. It's not credible. It's not plausible that this Israeli tank did not repeatedly
*  fire on this car, shooting so many bullets to ensure that no one could possibly have survived
*  without being entirely aware that the car was full of civilians, including children, including
*  little children. The soldiers in that tank killed those children and two adults deliberately.
*  That is the only possible conclusion you can arrive at based on the evidence. If just this one
*  atrocity had happened on the 7th of October, Israeli kids, one of them five, begging for their lives,
*  terrified on the phone to an ambulance responder, all deliberately gunned down by Hamas militants,
*  who can see very clearly that they're slaughtering children with bullets. And then an Israeli
*  ambulance coming to rescue them is blown up by Hamas militants killing two Israeli paramedics.
*  If that one atrocity had happened, it would have been regarded as one of the most
*  abominable atrocities of that day. It would have been presented as evidence to the despicable
*  barbarism of Hamas. It would have been one of the main crimes which politicians and media outlets
*  in the West would have focused on. It would have been described as akin to Nazi atrocities. It would
*  have been front and centre as evidence used to justify the obliteration of Gaza, which then took
*  place. You know when I say that I'm saying the obvious truth. We all know that's true.
*  Here is just one case study that illustrates that Israel's genocidal campaign against Gaza,
*  one backed and owned by our governments, one legitimised and supported by our media outlets,
*  is deliberately murdering children and perpetrating some of the worst atrocities
*  of the 21st century in full public, shameless view. We know from reports earlier this year
*  that foreign doctors who have gone to Gaza have reported receiving children who had sniper shots
*  to the head. The kids we're talking about include five, six, seven year olds. Now,
*  it gets worse. It gets even worse. Today Save the Children have issued a press release.
*  This press release is absolutely chilling. Save the Children, of course, one of the most credible
*  international NGOs on earth. They say, up to 21,000 children are estimated to be missing in the chaos
*  of the war in Gaza, many trapped beneath rubble, detained, buried in unmarked graves or lost from
*  their families. That includes those who are unaccompanied and separated, with 4,000 kids
*  likely missing under the rubble and an unknown number in mass graves. Others say they've been
*  forcibly disappeared, including an unknown number detained and forcibly transferred out of Gaza with
*  reports of ill treatment and torture. That's on top of the more than 40,000 children officially
*  declared by Gaza's authorities to be killed, around half of whom haven't been fully identified,
*  partially due to their bodies being harmed beyond recognition. A really important point
*  because there's this attempt to discredit the official death toll as though it's been inflated
*  when actually the evidence shows is extremely likely to be a drastic underestimate. Not least
*  because now, given the sheer level of destruction and chaos in Gaza, it's become extremely difficult
*  to keep the reporting system up. As regards death, the children also report children being
*  found in mass graves. They say that many of these graves show signs of tortured summary executions
*  as well as potential instances of people buried alive. What world do we live in?
*  When it's those who oppose some of the worst atrocities of our age, who are the ones who face
*  being silenced and marginalized, arrested, sacked. Well, those who cheered on and facilitated
*  this genocidal rampage are treated as respectable and moderate. Well, these crimes are too extreme,
*  too big, too repulsive to get away with. People have seen too much to be unseen, heard too much
*  to be unheard, read too much to be unread. Israeli impunity is collapsing in real time. We can see
*  that from the International Criminal Court with the Chief Prosecutor's request for arrest warrants
*  against the Israeli Prime Minister and his Defense Minister with, it's believed, more crimes to be
*  added to the list and potentially more people subject to arrest warrant requests to the
*  International Court of Justice. So, as I began, the Israeli state deliberately kills children.
*  That itself is all you need to know. One of the great crimes of our age,
*  and everyone who's complicit in this, has to be held to account. Please like and subscribe,
