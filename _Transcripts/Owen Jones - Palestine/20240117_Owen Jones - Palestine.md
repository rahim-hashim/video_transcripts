Video Description: This is dangerous stuff. When Zarah Sultana - one of the few Labour MPs taking a courageous stance over Gaza - spoke in Parliament, Tory PM Rishi Sunak and his sidekick made a truly grim jibe.

Zarah Sultana joins me to talk about how dangerous racist rhetoric is used to shut down solidarity with Palestinians, how the atmosphere is getting worse - and how she's taking on Israeli arms sales.

# Rishi Sunak's DANGEROUS Gaza Jibe Taken Down By Zarah Sultana
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3p7FWTnWS1Y)
*  Hello. Now, whilst many, most British politicians have either actively cheered on the great atrocities being committed,
*  one of the great crimes of our age, and the onslaught against Gaza and the Palestinian population of Gaza,
*  many of the politicians just failed to speak out, we have had some courageous leaders who have spoken out
*  and who have stood up against war crimes, but also consistently in defence of human rights
*  and just the basic building blocks of international law, frankly, which have been disregarded systematically by the State of Israel and its allies.
*  And one of those hugely courageous voices is Zahra Sultana.
*  However, Zahra has come under attack, like many who've been standing up for the Palestinian people.
*  But whilst many have been attacked, it comes with a particularly racist bent with often, I would say, disproportionate women of colour.
*  And that has been the case with you, Zahra.
*  So firstly, solidarity.
*  In fact, what we'll do now is we will show the clip of what happened.
*  Past mistakes in the Middle East should have taught this House that military intervention, starting out as limited, can quickly escalate,
*  risking a sequence of events far larger and more terrible and risk even dragging us into war.
*  It is for this reason, according to reports in the Times, that foreign office officials were, and I quote,
*  incredibly nervous about last week's military assault in Yemen.
*  Driving the region's instability is Israel's horrifying assault on Gaza, which has now lasted more than 100 days.
*  So rather than giving Israel the green light to continue its brutal bombardment of Gaza and risking a wider conflict,
*  will the Prime Minister seek to de-escalate the situation and call for an immediate ceasefire?
*  Perhaps the Honourable Lady would do well to call on Hamas and the Houthis to de-escalate the situation.
*  Andrew Percy.
*  Thank you, Mr Speaker.
*  Too many people give a free pass to the terrorists who perpetrated the worst murder of Jews,
*  and we've just seen an example of that, just as we saw examples of that on our streets this weekend.
*  At the point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, and in line with the House's rules,
*  I informed the Member in question that I would be referencing him.
*  In the previous statement, the Member for Brigham Gould implied that I had just, and I quote,
*  given a free pass to the terrorists who carried out the October 7th attack.
*  Mr Deputy Speaker, that claim is grotesquely untrue.
*  My question to the Prime Minister in no way had that implication.
*  I was calling for a de-escalation in the region and for an immediate ceasefire,
*  and his accusation is absolutely untrue.
*  In this House and elsewhere, I have repeatedly condemned the actions of Hamas
*  and called for the release of all hostages.
*  Moreover, the Member's gross accusation is playing to a racist trope,
*  implying that because I am a Muslim, I support Hamas.
*  So with rising Islamophobia and racist tropes asking British Muslims to prove their loyalty,
*  can I ask you for guidance on how to get a full retraction and apology from the Member for Brigham Gould?
*  Further to that point of order, Andrew Percy.
*  As loathed as I am to engage in this silliness, let me be absolutely clear to the Honourable Lady.
*  Not only did I not reference her, I have on numerous—
*  If she would listen to the response.
*  On numerous occasions, I have said too many people have failed to call out what I think is unacceptable.
*  I have said that before.
*  I am not going to stop saying that I think people have given a free pass on occasions
*  to behaviour and have not dealt with this with a fair hand.
*  That is an open point of debate.
*  I have called people out on my own side for that.
*  If she could sit here and listen to me.
*  It has absolutely nothing to do with the thing, but I don't want to engage in this silliness.
*  So I will say to the Honourable Lady, I have absolutely no intention of infairing at all
*  that she is in any—
*  Let me respond.
*  That she is in any way in support of any of that.
*  I'm sure she isn't.
*  I never said that.
*  I would never say that.
*  But I'm also, Mr Deputy Speaker, not going to not say what I think on issues in this
*  House and call out what I think is on this issue.
*  Too many people in this place giving a free pass to one side whilst not acknowledging
*  the horrors that the other side suffered.
*  I mean, just listening to all that.
*  Firstly, I mean, isn't this quite dangerous, do you think?
*  I mean, do you actually—
*  When you hear this kind of rhetoric, does it actually leave you a little bit worried
*  about the impact on your actual own personal safety?
*  And just explain why you think that's the case.
*  It's dangerous.
*  If it did.
*  Absolutely.
*  It leaves me worried.
*  It leaves my loved ones worried because we all know that two of my colleagues, two MPs,
*  have been killed in recent years for their political beliefs.
*  And at a time where Islamophobia, anti-Semitism are on the rise,
*  seeing a Tory minister using the platform of the House of Commons
*  to air these views, saying that I am giving a pass, a free pass to terrorists,
*  is incredibly dangerous.
*  It is irresponsible language and words have consequences.
*  There are people who will see that there and potentially might believe what he is saying,
*  although thankfully he did withdraw that accusation because it was completely and utterly wrong.
*  But words have consequences.
*  As a young woman, as a woman of colour, I have received so much abuse since getting elected
*  four years ago.
*  If anyone looks at my Twitter profile, every time I post anything remotely related to
*  Palestine, immigration, it could be talking about supporting trade unions,
*  I just receive a barrage of hate.
*  And that has definitely grown ever since the war on Gaza has escalated.
*  So there is a definite danger, but I am taking all the measures.
*  But I think it is irresponsible for an MP to use his position to accuse me of giving a free pass
*  to terrorists.
*  I mean, just that context of Islamophobia, which has been on the rise in this country
*  for a very, very long time.
*  And we've seen that in terms of on the streets, anti-Muslim hate crimes and polling,
*  you know, whilst thankfully there are huge numbers of people who do reject Islamophobia,
*  there is a constituency in this country which clearly embrace it with huge enthusiasm.
*  So just, I mean, in terms of how that comes, because it's the media, it's politicians.
*  I mean, that's the context, isn't it?
*  This doesn't come in a vacuum, even just of what's happened.
*  It's that kind of demonisation, particularly of people who are Muslim, from Muslim heritage,
*  linking to the idea of dangerous extremists, terrorists, that kind of thing.
*  I've always highlighted that Islamophobia comes from the very top.
*  We had Boris Johnson, former Prime Minister, who accused women of who wore the niqab as
*  being letterboxes and bank robbers.
*  And there was a direct correlation in terms of Islamophobic hate crime increasing following that.
*  Yesterday was a clear demonstration of Islamophobia in the House of Commons chamber.
*  Just because I'm a member of parliament doesn't give me a free pass from that.
*  And Rishi Sunak used an Islamophobic trope suggesting I had some kind of special relationship,
*  connection, way to get through to Hamas and the Houthis.
*  And then that then gets picked up on.
*  And then it was Andrew Percy, who spoke directly after him, who made that awful remark.
*  And this is the Tory party in their truest form.
*  They have pushed through policies that harm the most vulnerable people.
*  And Islamophobia in the Tory party isn't something that is new.
*  It's not just something that has happened to me.
*  And we know that they have a history of this.
*  But on that, do you think this is part of a kind of strategy as well to deflect from the crimes
*  being committed against the Palestinian people with the active complicity and support of Rishi
*  Sunak and his government?
*  And it's actually quite sinister as well, because the onslaught against the Palestinian people is
*  kind of linked to this kind of trope, isn't it?
*  It's that the Palestinian people collectively are dangerous extremists.
*  There are no innocents or involved as various Israeli ministers and their apologies to keep
*  saying. So just wondering, is this part of that kind of general, there's that context,
*  but it's deflecting from what the government is doing?
*  So my question was about limited, supposedly limited interventions and how they can quickly
*  escalate. And then we find ourselves drawn into wars.
*  We can look at Afghanistan, we can look at Iraq, we can look at Libya, for example.
*  So I was quoting the Times and the Foreign Office in terms of officials who were incredibly
*  nervous about the strikes that took place in Yemen.
*  So I'm making this really reasonable point and using these establishment quotes.
*  And then I get this Islamophobia in return.
*  And it's to delegitimize a point that I'm making to not really address it at all and kind of
*  completely deflect from the point.
*  And we know that this is something that Palestinian people have experienced for a very long
*  time. It is not new. In fact, when we look at some of the reporting around what is happening
*  in Gaza, there was the Guardian headline that referred to Palestinian children as being 18
*  and under. And that has a purpose.
*  There's a point to doing that.
*  And it has a response in terms of how the public react and their empathy towards victims of war
*  crimes. And it also allows the media to devalue Palestinian life to make the point that they are
*  less worthy or less valuable than other people.
*  And I think that's what we have seen for quite a bit of time now.
*  I mean, it's interesting. There's been research which has shown, for example, on the BBC's
*  coverage showing how Palestinian deaths are given far, far, far less media coverage for
*  Palestinian deaths than Israeli deaths.
*  Now, obviously, it's important to talk about, for example, Israeli civilians who've been
*  killed, but the same weight which is rightly given to Israeli civilians is not given to
*  Palestinian civilians. And also the sorts of language which is used, such as killed versus
*  died. And there was other studies.
*  New York Times, Washington Post found exactly the same thing, a separate study.
*  So I mean, do you think that's kind of linked to this systematic defunding?
*  And we see it in the chamber as well.
*  We see news or allegations that aren't factual, that aren't cross-checked being repeated in
*  the chamber.
*  We know that the British government and the British establishment, especially our news
*  coverage, simply don't value the lives of Palestinians.
*  So it's really important that as a member of parliament, I'm able to challenge that
*  and actually humanise Palestinians.
*  When we talk about the death toll, which is well over 23,000, that is not just a number
*  that we should be comfortable with.
*  We should remember that these are people with lives, with dreams, with hopes, with family
*  members, with stories.
*  And it's really easy to kind of forget that or ignore that.
*  So it's really important that all of us who have a platform try to use those to humanise
*  the lives that I've lost and try to stop more lives being lost.
*  I've repeated numerous times that a ceasefire yesterday would have saved the lives today.
*  And that's my job to continuously remind not just the government, but my own front bench
*  that that immediate ceasefire is what we should be pushing for.
*  And every day that we don't push for that, we find ourselves complicit in what is happening.
*  Before I ask you partly, just linked to that, it says, I want to ask you,
*  about your very important bill, but just before I do, I mean, have you noticed, for example,
*  in your own constituency, Coventry South, anti-Muslim racism, hate crimes increasing
*  since this particular round of horror began?
*  I've heard anecdotally from friends in London, not in Coventry, where following Palestine
*  demonstrations, their loved ones have faced abuse on the Tube.
*  People are worried about wearing cafes and holding placards after demonstrations because
*  of this delegitimisation effort, especially from our former Home Secretary who tried to portray
*  anyone who's calling for a ceasefire, anyone who's taking part in these peaceful demonstrations,
*  has taken part in hate marches, which again is to delegitimise the solidarity movement,
*  which has seen hundreds of thousands of people regularly come to London and also across the whole
*  country in Coventry and across the country, we have seen regular demonstrations. So it's really
*  important to reiterate that. And people are worried and it's really important that we come together.
*  The best form of safety is through solidarity and that is what we have to do here.
*  Finally, I wanted to just ask you about this bill. So it's on arms sales to Israel. So just tell
*  us about that and why it's so important right now.
*  So your viewers, Owen, will know about what's going on in Gaza. They'll know that there are
*  lawyers far more intelligent than me who know the legal case around genocide and what is
*  happening in Gaza and have presented that case, especially the South African lawyers who have
*  presented that case at The Hague. And that is my view too, that what is happening in Gaza is
*  genocidal because Israeli officials have repeatedly issued remarks that show their intent
*  in terms of erasing Gaza off the map and making it unlivable. So my bill is addressing the fact
*  that there is British complicity with British-made weapons. Since 2015, the British government has
*  issued arms licenses to the value of over 474 million to the Israeli military and that includes
*  F-35 military jets. Those are fighter planes that are unleashing hell in Gaza right now.
*  So when we see those harrowing images of parents and children after buildings, hospitals and schools
*  have been bombed, it's very likely that that airstrike has taken place using British-made
*  weapons. So my bill is trying to stop arms sales to countries where there is a risk that they will
*  be used in violations of international law. And we know that that is clearly the case with Israel.
*  It would also launch an inquiry into arms sales and finding the weaknesses in the current export
*  regime that we have and ensuring that British weapons are never again used for war crimes,
*  not just in Israel but also in places like Sri Lanka, also in terms of the sales that we made
*  to Saudi Arabia and their war on Yemen. A really important point, not least because
*  history is always erased and people are not being told often about the facts. I mean Yemen is something
*  I've covered, I've been to a Yemeni refugee camp that Britain has been in a de facto proxy war
*  against Yemen for years by supplying the Saudi dictatorship with weapons, which is unleashed
*  horror against innocent civilians for years, apparently now just directly doing it
*  via British and American plays is going to make it different somehow. But it's a really important
*  point and I'm glad we do have voices still in parliament who can make these crucial cases when
*  so many lives are at risk. So please like and subscribe those watching or listening on the
*  podcast, whatever. Thank you so much, Sarah, I really appreciate it. Thanks Owen.
