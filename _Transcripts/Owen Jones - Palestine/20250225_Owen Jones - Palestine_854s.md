# "Kill ALL MEN In Gaza": Netanyahu Ally's Genocidal Demand Gets No Media Coverage
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0)
*  The fact that almost the entire Western media hasn't reported on this tells you all you need to know. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=0.0s)]
*  Now sure, the deluge of genocidal statements coming from Israeli leaders, politicians, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=6.08s)]
*  officials, media outlets, journalists, soldiers, ordinary citizens is so vast, so incessant, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=12.72s)]
*  that it is very difficult to keep track of. That doesn't mean it shouldn't be reported on [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=20.0s)]
*  properly. After all, it speaks to Israel's genocidal intent, which is crucial in establishing [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=24.8s)]
*  the fact that Israel is perpetrating genocide, which of course it is. It also speaks to the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=31.36s)]
*  genocidal atmosphere and how it is created in Israel. We know there is overwhelming evidence [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=36.8s)]
*  of Israeli soldiers chanting, graffiting, and so on, genocidal statements from Israeli politicians [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=43.040000000000006s)]
*  as they commit war crimes. Now, meet Nassim Vaturi, the deputy speaker of Israel's Knesset, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=49.52s)]
*  which is their parliament. He's also a member of Likud, the governing party, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=56.160000000000004s)]
*  the main governing party, whose leader Benjamin Netanyahu is prime minister. Vaturi is a very [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=59.92s)]
*  loyal defender of Netanyahu, whilst declaring, thanks to Netanyahu we still exist. If he had [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=66.16s)]
*  listened to defence minister Yoav Galant, we could have reached destruction. It is striking that he [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=71.28s)]
*  sees Galant as too moderate, given the now former defence minister is, alongside Netanyahu, a wanted [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=76.4s)]
*  man by the international criminal court with an arrest warrant for war crimes and crimes against [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=82.88000000000001s)]
*  humanity. In an interview on a Haredi radio station in Israel, Kol Bararama, which was reported on by [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=87.76s)]
*  Israeli investigative outlet The Seventh Eye two days ago, he said the following, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=94.72s)]
*  Who is innocent in Gaza? Civilians went out and slaughtered people in cold blood. We need [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  to separate the children and women and kill the adults in Gaza. We are being too considerate. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=103.36s)]
*  He described the people in Gaza as scum and subhumans, claiming no one in the world wants [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=108.16s)]
*  the civilians in Gaza. Referring to Jenin in the West Bank, currently subject to a five-week Israeli [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=114.08s)]
*  siege, he said, we will soon turn Jenin into Gaza, adding, Erase Jenin. Don't start looking for the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=119.28s)]
*  terrorists. If there's a terrorist in the house, take it out. All of this is straightforward [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=126.0s)]
*  genocide and incitement. He specifically calls for the extermination of all Palestinian men in [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=129.92s)]
*  Gaza. It should be noted that the Srebrenica massacre in the Bosnian war in 1995, when Serb [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=134.16s)]
*  forces slaughtered specifically Bosniak men, was judged to be genocide. As the Seventh Eye notes, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=139.51999999999998s)]
*  reminder, incitement to violence and calls for murder and crimes against humanity are prohibited [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=146.23999999999998s)]
*  by law, but they add, the prosecutor's office and the police will do nothing. Indeed, specifically, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=150.56s)]
*  the public incitement of genocide is a criminal act. The Genocide Convention of 1948 criminalised [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=156.64s)]
*  the public incitement of genocide. Israel legislated to make that convention law in 1950, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=162.16s)]
*  and believe it or not, the public incitement of genocide remains a capital offence in Israel. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=167.92s)]
*  Obviously, that's not acted on, otherwise they'd have to execute virtually their entire [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=173.27999999999997s)]
*  political and media establishment. Now, last year, one of the provisional rulings of the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=177.67999999999998s)]
*  International Court of Justice ordered Israel to take action against the public incitement of [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  genocide. On this point alone, given the incessant stream of genocide or rhetoric [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=185.76s)]
*  in that state, the failure to take legal action against those inciting genocide [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=190.48s)]
*  leaves alone Israel in violation of the genocide convention. And yet, his latest genocidal statement [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=196.0s)]
*  has, at the time I recorded this, received no meaningful coverage in the Western media that [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=203.44s)]
*  I confined. Middle East Eye, who've done consistently brilliant coverage, have reported on it, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=208.0s)]
*  but not mainstream newspapers or broadcasters. And indeed, this Likud politician is a repeat offender. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=212.8s)]
*  Listen to what he said earlier this month. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=219.60000000000002s)]
*  He says that every child born there in Gaza is already a terrorist from the moment of his birth. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=221.44s)]
*  There is a repeated pattern of children and babies being described as incipient terrorists [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=246.64000000000001s)]
*  on Israeli television, thus helping to justify their slaughter of at least 17,000 Palestinian [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=251.36s)]
*  children and 1,100 babies, according to the official statistics, which are, according to [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=257.36s)]
*  repeated expert analyses, underestimates. Here he is last May. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=262.64s)]
*  So he's there admitting to blocking aid deliveries to Gaza in an effort to starve its population [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=276.56s)]
*  of the essentials of life, like food, fuel and medicine, which would, of course, inevitably lead [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=304.72s)]
*  to the mass deaths and is leading to mass deaths of people in Gaza in terms of being deprived of [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=310.16s)]
*  the basics of life. In November, 2023, Nissan Vettori declared, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=315.20000000000005s)]
*  All of this preoccupation with whether or not there is internet in Gaza shows we have learned [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=320.0s)]
*  nothing. We are too humane. Burn Gaza now, no less. Even Twitter under Elon Musk suspended [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=324.16s)]
*  account for that until he apologised and deleted the tweet. Two months later, he said in a radio [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=330.8s)]
*  interview, I stand by my words, it is better to burn to destroy buildings than for soldiers to be [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=337.68s)]
*  hurt. When asked about innocent Palestinians in Gaza, he said, We saw their celebrations before [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  the army came in and we saw their crocodile tears after the army came in. I have no mercy for people [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=348.0s)]
*  like that. Now, throughout the genocide, the western media has consistently failed to report [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=353.52s)]
*  on genocidal statements by the likes of this Israeli politician. The Israeli media has done [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=358.24s)]
*  a better job of reporting on such statements. This includes genocidal statements from the very top, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=363.36s)]
*  from the very beginning. In a video published on the 10th of October 2023, addressed in part to the [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=368.64s)]
*  residents of Gaza, fronted by Major General Ghassan Alyan, then in charge of Kogat, the civilian arm [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=375.2s)]
*  of the Israeli army, the general declared, Hamas became ISIS and the citizens of Gaza are [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=381.36s)]
*  celebrating instead of being horrified. Human beasts are dealt with accordingly. Israel has [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=387.12s)]
*  imposed a total blockade on Gaza. No electricity, no water, just damage. You wanted hell. You will [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=391.92s)]
*  get hell. There is no pretenses here. He's clearly referring to the civilian population of Gaza's [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=398.48s)]
*  human beasts. He's declaring they have collected guilt and he's also declaring they will accordingly [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=403.44s)]
*  suffer collective punishment in the form of the illegal deprivation of the means of survival [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=407.76s)]
*  as well as getting just damage and hell. That's a slam dunk example of genocidal intent and it was [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=412.64s)]
*  barely reported on by Western media outlets at the time. This is deceit by omission because [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=417.92s)]
*  Western media outlets did not explain to their readers and viewers what Israel's publicly stated [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=423.04s)]
*  intent was from the beginning. Instead framing this as so-called self-defence and simply an attempt [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=427.12s)]
*  to rescue hostages and defeat terrorists. The link between genocidal statements and [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=432.56s)]
*  genocidal behaviour is straightforward, which is why the Genocide Convention criminalised the [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=437.04s)]
*  public incitement of genocide in the first place on the grounds that all genocides begin with words. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=442.16s)]
*  Indeed, the Israeli President, Isaac Herzog, at the start of the genocide declared in a press [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=448.24s)]
*  conference, it is an entire nation out there that is responsible. It is not true, this rhetoric [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=452.96000000000004s)]
*  about civilians not being aware, not evolved. It's absolutely not true. They could have risen up. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=457.92s)]
*  They could have fought against that evil regime which took over Gaza in a coup d'etat. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=462.32000000000005s)]
*  And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the Israeli soldiers, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=466.88s)]
*  You must remember what Amalek has done to you, says our holy Bible. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=470.56s)]
*  This is the biblical story of how the nation of Amalek attacked the Israelites, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=474.48s)]
*  and the Israelites responded by killing all their men, women, children and livestock. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=478.32s)]
*  In South Africa's case alleging genocide against the Israeli state, the legal team showed a video [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=482.72s)]
*  of Israeli soldiers joyously chanting and regurgitating both Netanyahu's reference to Amalek [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=488.16s)]
*  and Herzog's reference to uninvolved civilians. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=494.08s)]
*  These are the soldiers reputing the inciting words of their Prime Minister. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=498.24s)]
*  The [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=528.32s)]
*  failure of the Western media to report on these genocidal statements, which reveal Israeli intent, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=555.5200000000001s)]
*  is one key feature of the complicity of the Western media in Israel's genocide against the [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=561.6s)]
*  Palestinian people. Yet right now the Israeli state is acting on that genocidal intent. That's [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=567.2s)]
*  what has led to the mass slaughter of so many civilians, including so many children. And that's [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=572.32s)]
*  not just in Gaza. We must emphasize this is also the West Bank where Israel's deputy speaker [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=577.5200000000001s)]
*  declares he wants to make another Gaza. Now, Sky needs to have credit of actually reported [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=582.56s)]
*  on Israeli snipers killing a 10-year-old Palestinian boy, Saddam Rajab. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=587.4399999999999s)]
*  10-year-old Saddam Rajab was shot one week into the operation when he was on the phone to his [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=592.0799999999999s)]
*  mother. In CCTV footage, the child screams in pain and struggles to move. His father, who is on crutches, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=596.9599999999999s)]
*  finally reaches him two long minutes later. We called an ambulance. It came and carried my boy. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=608.56s)]
*  I tried to join him and before I knew it, 20 to 30 Israeli soldiers turned up. Where they came from, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=618.4s)]
*  I have no idea. They detained us for almost an hour. In two separate journeys, the ambulances [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=624.2399999999999s)]
*  carrying Saddam to hospitals were stopped and searched by the Israeli defense forces, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=630.4s)]
*  critical time that was lost. He never regained consciousness and died in hospital two weeks later. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=635.04s)]
*  The IDF say they are investigating Saddam's case. Shot for no reason by Israeli snipers, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=642.7199999999999s)]
*  left to die in pain. The ambulance deliberately obstructed by Israeli soldiers, ensuring that [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=647.76s)]
*  this little boy died. This sort of atrocity is made possible because of dehumanization [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=654.0s)]
*  and genocidal incitement. These children are simply not regarded as humans, not just by Israeli [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=660.8s)]
*  soldiers, not just by the Israeli state, but by the Western media. Because the vast majority of [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=665.3599999999999s)]
*  that media refused to report on the absolute horror of thousands and thousands of Palestinian [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=670.16s)]
*  children being butchered. There was far more outrage, far more horror, far more disgust [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=675.68s)]
*  over the fictional beheading of Israeli babies than the actual mass slaughter of so many Palestinian [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=682.4s)]
*  babies, toddlers, teenagers, you name it. Little children burned alive, suffocated under rubble, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=689.2s)]
*  shot dead, including as several US-based medics testified in the New York Times with evidence [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=697.5200000000001s)]
*  deliberately shot in the head and chest by Israeli snipers. Frasher little bodies [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=704.8000000000001s)]
*  blown apart by explosions. Where is the anger? Where is the outrage? These are children, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=710.0s)]
*  children just like the kids playing down your road, like the kids bussed to school in the morning, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=717.04s)]
*  like the kids kicking a football in the park here. No different, kids. But these children [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=723.68s)]
*  are not seen as human, not by our Western media, not by our Western politicians, and certainly not [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=731.4399999999999s)]
*  by the Israeli state. It is one of the most disgusting displays of racism that is possible. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=738.0799999999999s)]
*  There's no pretence that their lives mean anything. How has it been possible, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=747.04s)]
*  just take a step back, how has it been possible that the mass butchery of so many children alone, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=752.88s)]
*  because there were so many men and women who were grown adults who did not deserve to die either, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=760.0s)]
*  but so many little children being so violently massacred and that is tolerated, is normalized. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=765.36s)]
*  Well that's paving the way to hell, I can tell you that, because we're not going to be forgiven. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=774.32s)]

*  in 20 years. All of this is made possible by an atmosphere of genocidal mania in Israel which [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=798.8s)]
*  goes unchecked because Western media outlets and politicians refuse to challenge that genocidal [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=804.9599999999999s)]
*  incitement. This is the consequence of the impunity which is granted to Israel by the Western media [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=810.9599999999999s)]
*  and by Western politicians and that impunity has led to one of the worst crimes of our age. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjvJhlmBM0&t=818.16s)]
