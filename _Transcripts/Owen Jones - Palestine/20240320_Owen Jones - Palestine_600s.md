# BOYCOTT Eurovision Over Gaza and Palestine
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [March 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24)
*  Eurovision is a big cultural highlight for many people, lots of songs of, if we're going to be [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=0.0s)]
*  honest here, questionable quality, some cracking costumes, the thrill of the nil point, lots of [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=4.4s)]
*  bitchy commentary. As a geriatric millennial I can't disentangle Eurovision from the late Terry [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=10.08s)]
*  Wogan and his ever increasingly barbed acerbic jokes since he quit in 2008 saying I don't want [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=14.88s)]
*  to be presiding over yet another debacle. Well, calling Eurovision a debacle this year is putting [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=21.52s)]
*  it kindly. The last two years I've gone myself to a big Eurovision party hosted by a leftist [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=28.16s)]
*  Israeli-American Brit, but this year he's cancelled it and he's far from the only one. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=33.6s)]
*  The biggest Eurovision screening in London hosted by the Rio cinema in Hackney has also cancelled, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=38.88s)]
*  which to be fair is pretty big news. Why have they cancelled? Because Israel has been allowed [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=46.16s)]
*  to participate in the contest despite the mass slaughter of Gaza perpetrated by the Israeli [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  state. When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, it was quite correctly excluded from participating [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=56.88s)]
*  in the touring Italy contest by the European Broadcasting Union who's in charge. Let's be [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=65.04s)]
*  clear, Russia has committed terrible war crimes in Ukraine, so that decision is more than justifiable. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=70.4s)]
*  What Israel has done to Gaza is much worse, which isn't to diminish the horror of what [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=75.12s)]
*  Ukraine has suffered, but to emphasise the scale of the crime being committed against the Palestinian [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  people of Gaza. In their statement, the Rio cinema says, collectively with the organisers of Eurovision [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=84.72s)]
*  party London, they decided not to screen the grand final while Israel remains in the competition. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=89.84s)]
*  They add, we firmly believe that the European Song Contest has the power to bring people together [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=96.08s)]
*  across the world and when its core values of inclusivity and universality are upheld, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=100.32s)]
*  it can be a genuine force of good. With its own slogan in mind, we hope that we can all be united [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=106.88s)]
*  by music again soon. We will continue to organise fundraising events for the charities we support, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=112.0s)]
*  including Doctors Without Borders and Medical Aid for Palestine. This is a very courageous [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=116.64s)]
*  stand and they are now predictably being dogpiled by apologists for Israel's murderous onslaught, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=120.88s)]
*  who wish to dole out punishment beatings to anyone who crosses them in order to deter anybody else [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=127.04s)]
*  from also speaking out and taking such action. So we all need to speak out and support the Rio [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  cinema. I'll be buying tickets there for a film shortly. I hope in London you do the same as well. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=136.48s)]
*  Now the Boycott, Direction and Sanctions movement, BDS, a Palestinian led and founded movement [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=142.39999999999998s)]
*  based on the successful struggle against South African apartheid has called for a boycott, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  specifically stating, we urge all participating broadcasters, national competitors, finalists, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=152.64s)]
*  production crews and viewers to boycott the contest following the refusal of the organisers, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=157.92s)]
*  the European Broadcasting Union, to ban genocidal Israel. Palestinians call on supporters to launch [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=162.64s)]
*  creative strategic initiatives that can pressure broadcasters to withdraw and appeal to all [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  participants to refuse to be complicit in the EBU's whitewash of apartheid Israel's genocide [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=173.2s)]
*  against 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza. Venues and events organisers planning Eurovision [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=178.79999999999998s)]
*  screenings parties should refuse to do so and instead hold apartheid free or genocide free [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=184.16s)]
*  alternative Eurovision events including teachings, workshops, panels about Israel's [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=188.8s)]
*  cynical pink washing and art washing. So it's really important we all build pressure to achieve [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=193.36s)]
*  all of this. They know that Israel's artist Eden Golan has publicly made clear she wishes to [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=198.4s)]
*  use her performance to achieve a political end to show up Israel's destroyed international reputation. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=203.76000000000002s)]
*  I mean she said publicly it's a dream in particular this year, particularly this year, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=208.8s)]
*  when it has even more meaning. It is to show the whole world who we really are and to bring [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=212.72000000000003s)]
*  our country in three minutes to the stage and to show our emotion and our strength and our people [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=217.12s)]
*  that we are here forever together. Well again you can see what she's trying to do there can't you? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  I would note she is actually Russian Israeli raised in Russia and performed in Crimea in 2016, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=227.12s)]
*  three years after it was occupied by Putin's Russia. Now there's ever growing pressure over [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=232.32s)]
*  this but we need to build further. In January over a thousand musical artists from the Eurovision [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  host country Sweden signed an open letter demanding Israel's exclusion citing its brutal [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=241.52s)]
*  warfare in Gaza adding quite rightly that the European Broadcasting Union is exhibiting a [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=246.8s)]
*  remarkable double standard that undermines the organization's credibility. They added the fact [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=252.16000000000003s)]
*  that countries that place themselves above humanitarian law are welcome to participate [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=257.36s)]
*  in international cultural events, trivializes violations of international law and makes the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=261.6s)]
*  suffering of the victims invisible. Quite right. Does Palestinian life matter or not? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=266.32s)]
*  Now I know in practice Palestinians life is treated as worthless by ruling establishments [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=272.56s)]
*  but we're under no obligation to normalize this flagrant and unapologetic racism. We're [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=277.12s)]
*  duty bound to fight it. It's not just Sweden more than 1,400 Finnish artists have also very [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=281.44s)]
*  commendably done the same as well. 200 artists in Portugal earlier this month also made a similar [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=287.36s)]
*  statement so well done as well to those Portuguese artists taking a stand. In fact the first were [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=295.12s)]
*  musicians in Iceland who similarly took such a public stand back back in December. Now there's [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=301.44s)]
*  been politicians as well including two Belgian ministers who called for Israel to be dropped. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=308.32s)]
*  They said if the Gaza war if Gaza war continues well clearly it is. Well another letter has been [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=314.32s)]
*  signed by politicians including Spain's left-wing Podemos party who are in a coalition government [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=319.04s)]
*  with the Spanish Socialist party as well as the Swedish left party as well. They've also called [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=324.32s)]
*  for a ban of Israel in the contest. Now there's a very catchy song made in support of a boycott [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=330.64s)]
*  when Tel Aviv hosted Eurovision five years ago. Let's have a listen. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=337.44s)]
*  Oh [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=360.64s)]
*  and I'm sure you will find now the time boycott apartheid [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=377.28s)]
*  stand up for justice [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=383.44s)]
*  be stand up for justice [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=388.24s)]
*  there's a movement out here everybody can join you don't have to be stand up for justice [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=394.4s)]
*  On its own terms more of a musical achievement than many Eurovision entries let's be honest. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=408.56s)]
*  I'd also note Israel's acts tried to sneak in lyrics clearly trying to reference the horrors of [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=413.20000000000005s)]
*  the last few months on Israel's own terms breaching rules on political neutrality [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=417.68s)]
*  and they were ordered to change lyrics which they only did after a fight. Now as a queer person I'm [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=421.92s)]
*  well aware that Eurovision has a big queer following and that Israel weaponizes the issue [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=426.64000000000004s)]
*  of LGBTQ rights to justify its murderous oppression of the Palestinian people this is known as pink [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=430.72s)]
*  washing. Now I've done a video on this entitled how Israel abuses queer rights to justify oppressing [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=435.52000000000004s)]
*  Palestine do check it out but I would say is listen to queer Palestinians who are imploring [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=440.0s)]
*  us to oppose Israel's murderous oppression I've spoken to many queer Palestinians and I've [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=445.04s)]
*  interviewed I've I've I have huge numbers of messages from queer Palestinians I've read [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=450.88s)]
*  interviews and literature in fact look up our cause a Palestinian LGBTQ group who have lots [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=455.36s)]
*  of information we should all read as queer people in countries in Europe the United States for those [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=460.56s)]
*  who are susceptible to the claims of pink washing. Now just as a basic point anyone who thinks wiping [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=465.92s)]
*  Gaza off the face of the earth and committing genocide against its population is advancing [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=470.88s)]
*  LGBTQ rights in any way is clearly deranged. If you estimate that around three percent of any given [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=475.2s)]
*  population is LGBTQ that means proportionately speaking 1200 queer Palestinians will have been [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=480.08000000000004s)]
*  killed by the Israeli state in Gaza since October and queer Palestinians have overwhelmingly been [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=485.36s)]
*  driven from their homes displaced like other Palestinians denied medical care maimed injured [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=490.08000000000004s)]
*  their loved ones have been killed as well as the huge trauma the the various horrors the hunger [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=495.52s)]
*  you know the lack of essential needs they're all going through the same thing. Now queer people [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=502.64s)]
*  should extend the principle of unconditional solidarity if you saw someone being attacked in [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=507.44s)]
*  the streets you wouldn't first rip out a questionnaire to ask them what's your views on very social [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=511.12s)]
*  questions before deciding whether to come to their defense we whoever we are those of us who suffered [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=515.36s)]
*  part of groups which have suffered oppression should never be oppression nimbies not in my [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=521.84s)]
*  backyard nimbies and where we only care about oppression that affects us personally especially [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=525.9200000000001s)]
*  in Palestinians whatever their sexual orientation have been butchered in unimaginable numbers. Now I [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=530.8800000000001s)]
*  love our entrant this year Olly Alexander he's a queer British icon who clearly stands for equality [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=535.36s)]
*  and who clearly opposes the current horror and has already taken a punishment beating over that [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=541.44s)]
*  and clearly I can imagine he must be relishing a role that he he would flourish in but Olly [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=545.6800000000001s)]

*  Gaza let's take on these diabolical and racist double standards and make it clear we will do [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=560.24s)]
*  everything we can to disrupt this contest unless and until the European Broadcasting Union does [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur2WtVzxO24&t=564.32s)]
