# Pope Francis Mourned By Gaza's HYPOCRITICAL Murderers
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8)
*  Let me take a wild guess, many of you are currently feeling a bit like me. You're sad because Pope [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=0.0s)]
*  Francis has died, not least because he's one of the few global figures who has taken a stand against [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Israel's genocide, but you will also be fairly nauseated, let's put it that way, because of the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  perpetrators of this monstrous crime, as well as those who are complicit, taking part in the public [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=17.68s)]
*  mourning of the pope and erasing what he actually stood for. This is a form of killing someone for [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=24.639999999999997s)]
*  the second time over, of sanitizing them, of airbrushing who they really were, of almost [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=30.4s)]
*  turning them into somebody else in order to protect the powerful from accountability. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=36.16s)]
*  The vice president, JD Vance, of course went to see the pope on Easter Sunday. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=41.84s)]
*  I pray for you every day. I bless you. So good to see you. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  Good morning, how are you? I'm fine. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=49.6s)]
*  Good, thank you. I've not been feeling great, but it's good to see you in better health. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=52.64s)]
*  The next day, the pope was dead. Here is Donald Trump standing on the White House balcony along [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=57.68s)]
*  with his wife and a giant Easter bunny. I just signed an executive order putting the flags of [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=62.08s)]
*  our country, all of them, all federal flags and state flags, at half mast in honor of Pope Francis, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=68.48s)]
*  so he was a good man. A good man, says Trump. Well, the pope, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=75.6s)]
*  of course, had rather different views about the US president. When Trump proposed his notorious [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=79.83999999999999s)]
*  wall along the US-Mexico border, the pope declared, a person who thinks only about building walls, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=84.88s)]
*  wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian. And in his last Easter Sunday [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  address, he declared, how much contempt to stirred up at times towards the vulnerable, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=95.91999999999999s)]
*  the marginalized and migrants. On this day, I would like all of us to hope anew and to [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=101.12s)]
*  revive our trust in others, including those who are different from ourselves, or who come from [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=105.2s)]
*  distant lands, bringing unfamiliar customs, ways of life and ideas. Well, given much of Trump at [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=109.84s)]
*  his very core is about stirring up contempt towards the vulnerable, the marginalized, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=115.04s)]
*  specifically migrants, and those from distant lands. Trump was, of course, mourning someone [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=120.16s)]
*  who held his brand of politics with total contempt. But it's the genocide facilitated by [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=124.4s)]
*  western politicians and media outlets which the pope damned, which makes all of this so nauseating. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=129.2s)]
*  Over the last 18 months, Pope Francis rang the only Catholic church in Gaza every day to offer [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=134.88s)]
*  solidarity and prayers to share in their suffering. In his last Easter address, just before his death, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=140.56s)]
*  he said to worshippers, I think of the people of Gaza and its Christian community in particular, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=145.28s)]
*  where the terrible conflict continues to cause death and destruction and to create a dramatic [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=150.16s)]
*  and deplorable humanitarian situation. In his Christian address of 2023, he condemned [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=154.8s)]
*  unarmed civilians being bombed and shot, the killing and injuring of civilians by Israeli snipers. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  My family, my children, sick people with disabilities, my sister, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=184.8s)]
*  a mother and her daughter, Mrs. Nadda Khalil Anton and my daughter Samar Komar Anton, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=191.28s)]
*  were killed and other people wounded by the snipers. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=199.84s)]
*  While they were in the bathroom, the house of my sister's mother Teresa's house was damaged, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  their generator was hit, someone says it's terrorism, it's war. Yes, it's war, it's [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=213.44s)]
*  terrorism. A crucial point he made there was calling Israel's onslaught terrorism. In his final book, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=223.83999999999997s)]
*  he wrote, According to some experts, what is happening in Gaza has the characteristics of a [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=229.51999999999998s)]
*  genocide. It should be carefully investigated to determine whether it fits into the technical [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=233.44s)]
*  definition formulated by jurists and international bodies. Now note what Joe Biden said, he's the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=237.68s)]
*  second Catholic president in US history, but also one of the chief architects of Israel's genocide. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=245.76s)]
*  He commanded us to fight for peace, says the US president who handed Israel around Â£26 billion [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=250.88s)]
*  worth of military aid to bomb and slaughter, kill, who offered diplomatic support and political cover [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  to Israel, who helped to whitewash and suppress Israel's war crimes. He promoted, according to [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=261.12s)]
*  Biden, an end to poverty and suffering across the globe, says the president who helped expand [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=266.16s)]
*  that suffering by facilitating the mass extermination of tens of thousands of Palestinians, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=271.04s)]
*  mostly women, children and the elderly, as well as the mass destruction of homes, hospitals, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=276.24s)]
*  schools, libraries, mosques and indeed churches. What of Keir Starmer, who declared Pope Francis [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=280.16s)]
*  was a pope for the poor, the downtrodden and the forgotten, the same British prime minister who [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=286.08000000000004s)]
*  stripped the winter fuel payment from so many vulnerable pensioners and then launched an assault [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=290.08000000000004s)]
*  on disability benefits, which is predicted to drive up to 400,000 Britons into poverty. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=293.92s)]
*  Starmer noted Pope Francis's work with Christians around the world, tracing war, famine, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=299.44s)]
*  persecution and poverty. Unsurprisingly, he didn't mention how the pope rang Gaza's only [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  Catholic church every day to offer solidarity and prayers, or how he rightly feared for a Christian [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=309.12s)]
*  community that faces erasure after having lived in Gaza for over 1,600 years. Indeed, Starmer talks [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=314.16s)]
*  there about the suffering of Christians, suffering he's helping to facilitate, like the Israeli [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=321.44s)]
*  attack on Gaza's church of St Porphyrios, or the recent attack on the Anglican Al-Ali Arab Baptist [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=326.64s)]
*  Hospital, or the butchery of many Christians, like when an elderly woman and her daughter was [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=332.4s)]
*  shot dead by an Israeli sniper in the Holy Family Church on the eve of Christmas 2023. That was the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=336.64s)]
*  very church the pope rang each day and its school was attacked by the Israeli military last July, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=342.24s)]
*  and that's to say nothing of the tens of thousands of Palestinian Christians in the West Bank [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=347.2s)]
*  languishing under a brutal and illegal Israeli occupation, who faced a crackdown over Easter as [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=351.12s)]
*  they sought to observe their faith. The pope condemned death and destruction in Gaza, and yet [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=356.48s)]
*  death and destruction in part is being rained down by F-35 jets. Guess who's ensuring those F-35 jets [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=360.72s)]
*  are being supplied with crucial components? The British government, led by Keir Starmer. The pope [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=366.96s)]
*  condemned these horrors, and yet Starmer's government can't describe a single Israeli war [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=371.52s)]
*  crime for what it is. A war crime. When the Foreign Secretary, himself a craven, cowardly, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=376.08s)]
*  unprincipled man, described Israel's blockade of literally anything and everything, entering Gaza [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=380.24s)]
*  for what it is, a violation of international humanitarian law, Starmer's goons ordered him [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=385.03999999999996s)]
*  to U-turn, which he did, as a pliant Foreign Secretary. After all, calling this monstrosity [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=390.08s)]
*  out for what it is would mean taking action, specifically imposing sanctions on Israel. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=395.68s)]
*  The pope, who spoke out against this suffering, who spoke of the humanitarian disaster, Keir Starmer, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=399.91999999999996s)]
*  talked about famine, Christians suffering famine, and that includes the Christians of Gaza, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=405.68s)]
*  suffering a famine at the hands of an onslaught Britain has facilitated. Indeed, Israel, at least, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=410.40000000000003s)]
*  generally speaking, had the rare good judgement of shutting up. Originally, its official Twitter [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=417.2s)]
*  account, which functions like a troll account, tweeted, Rest in peace, Pope Francis, may his [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=421.68s)]
*  memory be a blessing. That was then, wisely, abruptly deleted, clearly because of the pope's [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=425.84000000000003s)]
*  stance against Israel's genocide. Benjamin Netanyahu himself said nothing. Let's hope that sets [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=430.4s)]
*  something of a precedent. I actually think there's something commendable about the response of the [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=434.96s)]
*  far-right US politician, Marjorie Taylor Greene. Not a sentence you'll hear me normally utter, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=438.47999999999996s)]
*  don't get used to it. She tweeted, Today there were major shifts in global leadership. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=443.44s)]
*  Evil is being defeated by the hand of God. Don't get me wrong, that's an utterly repellent tweet. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=447.91999999999996s)]
*  Is it any more offensive than helping to facilitate a monstrous crime? And then when somebody [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=454.15999999999997s)]
*  used their position to speak out against that monstrous crime, dies, erasing their courageous [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=459.28s)]
*  stand in order to protect yourself. Take the New York Times. There wasn't a single mention of [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=463.2s)]
*  Palestine or Gaza in its obituary of the pope, same for the Washington Post. Obviously completely [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=467.92s)]
*  and utterly absurd. This is what they do to those public figures who resisted the status quo in their [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=472.64s)]
*  time and have too much respect to simply traduce. They try and erase what they actually really stood [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=478.56s)]
*  for. What is true is this. There is a tidal wave of McCarthyism sweeping the Western world, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=484.4s)]
*  the most extreme assault on free speech there for seven decades, with those who oppose Israel's [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=489.76s)]
*  genocide being deplatformed, threatened, sacked, expelled from universities, assaulted by police [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=494.8s)]
*  officers, arrested, imprisoned and now even facing deportation. But the one person you can't cancel [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=499.84s)]
*  is the pope. That isn't to say there aren't criticisms to be had of the pope, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=505.36s)]
*  or indeed the Catholic Church. But what matters here is the truth. Pope Francis spoke out against [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=508.32s)]
*  one of the great crimes of our age. Those now praising him are erasing that truth because it [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=513.36s)]
*  bams them. Well, one of the ways we can honor the pope is to keep speaking out against this genocide [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=518.24s)]
*  and make sure that those praising the pope while erasing what he stood for are held to account, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=524.48s)]
*  and that one day there is finally justice for what they have done. Please like and subscribe, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=530.88s)]
*  leave your thoughts and your comments. Help us take on the pro-genocide media, which is currently [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-rl5KZRTT8&t=535.36s)]
