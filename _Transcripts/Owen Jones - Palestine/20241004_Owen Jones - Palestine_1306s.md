# Israel's Lies Torn Apart - The Truth About Lebanon and Gaza Attacks Exposed By Omar Baddar
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw)
*  It's always such an honour to be joined by the brilliant Palestinian-American analyst, Omar Bada, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=0.0s)]
*  who's been one of the most important voices ever since what is now nearly exactly a year of genocide. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=4.92s)]
*  Omar, it's great to see you. You've been putting up with my... [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=11.0s)]
*  Just come back from Austria and everything technically has collapsed, which is why I'm using a slightly dodgy camera. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  I'm going to look slightly bedraggled. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=19.0s)]
*  But we move. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=20.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's the very least of our problems. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=22.0s)]
*  The most important thing is we can hear you and see you. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  Omar, just give us a big picture. Where are we at? 4th of October, middle of the day. Where are we at? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=26.92s)]
*  You know, Owen, I think we are at an extremely dangerous moment right now with the risk of an all-out war in the region. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=33.32s)]
*  That is entirely the responsibility and really the result of the abdication of responsibility by the Biden-Harris administration here in the US. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=41.92s)]
*  We have allowed the most fanatical right-wing government in Israeli history to just go on a completely insane rampage throughout the entire region [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=51.040000000000006s)]
*  and not just green-lining it, but arming and supporting what they're engaged in right now. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=58.84s)]
*  You think even though the Israeli government has made clear that they have no interest at all in any kind of ceasefire and hostage deal, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=64.04s)]
*  we've let them carry out a year of genocide in Gaza right now, and they've carried out assassinations. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=71.04s)]
*  They've bombed the Iranian embassy in Damascus. They've carried out an assassination in Tehran, the capital of Iran, on the eve of the Iranian presidential inauguration. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  And Iran was told not to respond and discouraged from responding on the idea that a ceasefire is close by. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=89.24000000000001s)]
*  And so they've been restrained. And what we've seen instead of working towards a meaningful de-escalation on a ceasefire is that we've then allowed Israel to invade Lebanon, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=95.84s)]
*  to bomb its capital city, to bring down high-rise buildings in Beirut. And the onslaught is just continuing to become more and more unhinged. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=105.04s)]
*  Now you have thousands of people who are dead in Lebanon as a result of Israel's actions. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  And so Iran now realizing that this whole thing has been a sham, did choose to respond, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=118.84s)]
*  but it did it also in a constrained way, bombing empty military facilities in Israel. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=123.84s)]
*  And suddenly now the G7 and the US are saying this is a grave threat to regional stability. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=129.44s)]
*  I mean, just think of that word for a moment. How insane it must be to describe the world up until this point as experiencing regional stability. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=135.24s)]
*  Apparently, regional stability is an order in which Israel gets to kill Arabs and destroy their countries without any consequence in complete and total impunity. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=144.04000000000002s)]
*  And that's just utterly deranged. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=151.64000000000001s)]
*  Imagine if you were a high school teacher and you walked into a classroom and you saw that there was a fight between the students. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=154.04s)]
*  The first thing you would do is tell everybody to stop fighting. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=160.44s)]
*  And once the fists start flying, that's the equivalent of a ceasefire, then you can start talking about addressing underlying causes, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=164.04s)]
*  asking what happened, what went wrong, and seeing what grievances are there and start dealing with them seriously. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=171.23999999999998s)]
*  But if a teacher walked into a high school classroom and said, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=176.83999999999997s)]
*  OK, everybody calm down, please sit back and do nothing, but then pointed to the most belligerent person in the room and said, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=180.84s)]
*  here's a baseball bat, you can continue doing whatever you want. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=186.84s)]
*  That obviously is not a way to end the violence. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=190.04000000000002s)]
*  This is a recipe for further violence. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=192.84s)]
*  And that is precisely what American policy has been so far, is insisting that Israel does not have to apply by the same rules that everybody plays with, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=194.84s)]
*  that they are somehow exempt, they're above the rules and above the law and they can carry out atrocities with complete and total impunity. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=203.44s)]
*  And you can see that now escalating to a point to where it's just a meaningless show of force, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=210.04s)]
*  where the West Bank, which is under Israeli control, Israel rules the West Bank, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=215.64s)]
*  they have a Palestinian Authority that is fairly pliant and subservient, managing the West Bank for them. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=221.84s)]
*  If Israel wanted to reach anyone in the West Bank, they can simply send police, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=227.04s)]
*  either Palestinian Authority police or even Israeli soldiers, to go and get whoever they want. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=231.04s)]
*  And yet in the West Bank just yesterday, they chose to launch an airstrike on a crowded cafe killing 18 people to get one person that they wanted. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=236.24s)]
*  You only do that if you're drunk with power. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=245.24s)]
*  Understand there are no consequences for your actions and you feel you can do whatever you want to terrorize and pummel your enemies into submission. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=247.64000000000001s)]
*  And that path is obviously pushing us to the edge of regional catastrophe. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  And it's mind boggling to see that President Biden seems to understand this. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=260.24s)]
*  A recent interview of his in Politico, he was quoted saying that he thinks Netanyahu is trying to escalate towards a regional war to help Trump get elected. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=265.04s)]
*  And yet Biden is still insisting on doing absolutely nothing. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=273.64s)]
*  It simply doesn't make sense that we have that much of a lack of a backbone in Washington that we're watching this horror unfold, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=277.04s)]
*  devastating the region and risking having Trump return to power as a result of that obligation of responsibility. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=284.24s)]
*  Just as a case study, we talked about Joe Biden. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  I just want to get this as a case study in terms of how Western leaders behaved this week and following Iran's ballistic missiles attacks on Israel in which no Israeli civilians or soldiers were killed. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=293.64s)]
*  Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, did a solemn address flanked by two Union Jacks to condemn Iran's attack, saying it was amongst other things that Israel had the right to live in security, that Iran was at the root of the violence and chaos. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=307.64s)]
*  And he said the Iranian regime has launched over 200 ballistic missiles at civilian targets in Israel. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=324.84s)]
*  I just want you to respond to that given what it as a case study, whose lives matter and whose don't, when just as a matter of fact, it's not an apology for the Iranian regime before people jump in. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=331.44s)]
*  They were not civilian targets and no civilian targets were attacked. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=345.24s)]
*  And yet there was huge anger and grief by him, but not even a fraction of that emotion to actual mass slaughter on an almost unimaginable scale when the victims are Arab. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=349.04s)]
*  Just on that note that you mentioned, Owen, it's funny because every time you bring up that argument and you talk about sort of this assault on Iran, people immediately attack you for being an apologist for the Iranian regime. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=358.44s)]
*  Let's be completely clear. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=369.04s)]
*  The Iranian government has a repressive record against dissidents, against women's rights, against a lot of things. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=370.24s)]
*  So this is in no way a defense, a blanket defense of anything that the Iranian government does. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=376.64s)]
*  We're simply arguing for a world in which the Iranian government has to play by the same rules as everybody else. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=381.24s)]
*  And the problem with Western policy is that it says that Israel can do whatever it wants, but Iran can't. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=386.64s)]
*  Israel can have a nuclear weapons program and develop hundreds of nuclear nukes. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=391.64s)]
*  But Iran developing a peaceful nuclear program is a threat to world peace and regional stability and requires an intervention. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=396.24s)]
*  Just that double standard, that hypocrisy. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=402.84s)]
*  When you say our friends get to do whatever they want and you can do nothing, that is ruling the world like a mafia rather than an order that you can get buy in from everyone, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=405.24s)]
*  in which we say the same rules apply for everyone. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=414.84s)]
*  You can't have that level of moral hypocrisy be at the core of your policy and expect to be received well by people who are on the receiving end of that hypocrisy and that double standard. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=417.84s)]
*  And again, it's breathtaking. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=427.23999999999995s)]
*  Just in the past 24 hours, Israel has killed 28 medics in Lebanon. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=430.03999999999996s)]
*  If there's anything that is deserving of a solemn address, you'd think that would be it. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=436.64s)]
*  To come out on TV and say Lebanon has the right to defend itself and attacks on Lebanese civilians that are material and consequential in a way that we actually see in the fact that you have dead Lebanese medical workers and children and families. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=440.84s)]
*  That does not merit coming out to give an address and give a condemnation. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=455.84s)]
*  We are simply declaring to the world through these statements that the lives of Israelis matter than the lives of everybody else in the region. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=460.03999999999996s)]
*  And as long as that is your posture, you are not going to get the agreement of other people in the region who believes their lives matter. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=467.24s)]
*  Think of the gall of Palestinians and Lebanese thinking that their children deserve to live in freedom and not be subjected to that kind of terror day in and day out. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=474.24s)]
*  Just when you look at images of what Israel is unleashing on Beirut right now as we speak, it is quite reminiscent of what Bin Laden did in New York on 9-11. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=482.64s)]
*  It is watching high-rise buildings being brought down, smoke and fire filling the entire capital city. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=492.84s)]
*  That is no way for anyone to live and no one should be excusing this kind of mass terrorism against a civilian population. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=499.44s)]
*  That is not the way that the world should work. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=506.44s)]
*  And just we lose every ounce of credibility. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=509.23999999999995s)]
*  We have an interest in saying that we want our words to matter when we talk in defense of freedom and humanity and human rights and democracy. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=513.44s)]
*  You just lose every ounce of credibility when you talk about these things and shout these slogans while empowering a brutal apartheid regime that is committing genocide to expand this war and commit all these violations across the entire region. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=523.44s)]
*  Nobody can take our rhetoric seriously. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=537.24s)]
*  And it is time to start putting our money where our mouth is. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=539.44s)]
*  If we want to use this kind of rhetoric and claim a moral high ground, we have to start living by it. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=542.44s)]
*  And it begins at minimum at this point with cutting off US military funding for Israel and Western military funding for Israel until Israel right now reaches a ceasefire as a starting point. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=549.24s)]
*  And beyond that, complies with international law, respects human rights and allows the Palestinians to live free of Israeli occupation and apartheid. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=562.24s)]
*  That is how you solve the problem long term. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=569.84s)]
*  I mean, just in terms of Lebanon, what do you think the Israeli strategy is there? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=572.64s)]
*  And people might not have heard or have heard of the diadoction which was developed in 2006 in the last invasion, which was you deliberately attack civilian infrastructure to try and get the civilian population to turn on Hezbollah. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=576.04s)]
*  Violates get civilians political ends, some call that terrorism. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=590.8399999999999s)]
*  What's your thoughts just on what you think the strategies and what your fears could be given what we've seen in Gaza? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=594.24s)]
*  What could happen in Lebanon? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=598.64s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's precisely it. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=600.4399999999999s)]
*  And so much of the discourse constantly portrays Israel as only targeting militants and accidentally killing civilians when the record is just it's so obvious. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=601.8399999999999s)]
*  Beyond just the military doctrine that you just mentioned, Israel's position has always openly been with, you know, Giora Island and many others talking about that their strategy is punishing the civilian population, destroying infrastructure, inflicting so much pain on civilians in order to get them to turn on the people who are fighting and convince them that they have to stop fighting to essentially surrender. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=612.24s)]
*  That is the Israeli strategy. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=635.64s)]
*  And it worked for them in one instance, which is in 1982 when they invaded Lebanon, and that was to convince effectively the PLO to be driven out of Lebanon. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=637.24s)]
*  And that succeeded in part because you could have a sense of separation between the PLO and Lebanon, where people in Lebanon watching their capital city get bombed to smithereens felt like, OK, maybe this is not our fight. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=648.04s)]
*  Maybe the PLO should go somewhere else. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=659.64s)]
*  This is a different situation right now because the forces that Israel is attacking in Lebanon, their fight with Hezbollah, Hezbollah is a fully Lebanese movement that is born out of Lebanon. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=662.24s)]
*  And the idea that you can turn the Lebanese population against Hezbollah by bombing Lebanese civilians, you know, it's unclear that that's going to meet the same fate as what they did with the PLO previously. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=673.9399999999999s)]
*  But that seems to be the thinking. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=684.14s)]
*  And there is absolutely Israel is facing very significant resistance in their military incursion in south Lebanon. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=685.9399999999999s)]
*  They are losing soldiers and tanks because Hezbollah is prepared to fight on the ground to defend their country. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=691.54s)]
*  And Israel then decides to take it out, to take their frustration out and that failure on the civilian population. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=698.04s)]
*  And you see it in that mass indiscriminate bombing of major cities throughout Lebanon. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=704.54s)]
*  And it is mass terrorism. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=709.74s)]
*  That is what it is. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=711.9399999999999s)]
*  You saw it again with that strike in the West Bank just yesterday. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=713.3399999999999s)]
*  You're seeing it with the intensification of bombings in Gaza once more. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=717.04s)]
*  That is what they do. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=720.84s)]
*  They do mass devastation of civilians as a means of achieving their political ends. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=722.24s)]
*  Israeli policy is terrorism. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=727.74s)]
*  That is their declared policy. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=731.0400000000001s)]
*  And the fact that we continue putting on this pretense that Israel is trying to target militants and we're going to try to help them do this and do that. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=732.74s)]
*  Nobody buys that. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=740.84s)]
*  Nobody in the world buys that. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=741.74s)]
*  Maybe some American and Western audiences buy it because of the sheer blind spots and the utter bias that we see in our media coverage of this that we still indulge this rhetoric. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=743.24s)]
*  But for anybody who reads human rights reports, anybody who listens to the doctors who go and visit Gaza, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=754.4399999999999s)]
*  who talk about the systematic targeting of Palestinian children with sniper fire, understands that this pretense is just utterly empty and ridiculous. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=761.04s)]
*  But it's a gap in education that we still have to fill. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=768.84s)]
*  And to have that education lead to a change in policy, we are seeing these massive protests in the United States and the United Kingdom and many other places. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=773.44s)]
*  And it's quite tragic that we have governments that are supposedly the beacons of democracy in the world who are refusing to listen to their citizens in this instance and bring about a ceasefire that is desperately needed. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=783.14s)]
*  So we can ask step one to just put an end to this mass slaughter so we can start looking at political solutions out of it. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=795.34s)]
*  I mean, just a couple of final things. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=800.64s)]
*  I mean, Israel is in a triumphalist phase at the moment. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=802.74s)]
*  I just want to see your response to that. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=806.44s)]
*  They'd go, I mean, from their perspective, their view is, well, if you don't care about Arab life, who cares? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=807.84s)]
*  We'll cause it, you know, mass slaughter, but we're Hezbollah. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=811.84s)]
*  We've killed much of their leadership. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=815.14s)]
*  They're in chaos. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=817.24s)]
*  And, you know, Gaza is being violently smashed into tiny little pieces. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=818.24s)]
*  We haven't defeated Hamas. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=823.24s)]
*  Fine. But, you know, what threat do they necessarily pose to us now? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=824.24s)]
*  Their perspective, as long as you don't care about Arab life, it's all going, we're pretty comfortable. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=827.44s)]
*  What do you think about that triumphalism, which is definitely happening at the moment? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=832.94s)]
*  Absolutely. Look, I think this has been a problem even before October 7th. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=835.94s)]
*  It was a dynamic in which Palestinians had no freedom. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=840.24s)]
*  They were living in a cage in Gaza. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=843.24s)]
*  No airport, no seaport. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=846.04s)]
*  Nobody can come in and out. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=847.44s)]
*  No economy, no trade with the outside world, no future for Palestine's children in Gaza. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=848.44s)]
*  And that was just fine with Israelis because who cares about Palestinian lives? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=853.6400000000001s)]
*  And the same with the West Bank, encroaching settlements, squeezing Palestinians into smaller and smaller areas. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=857.1400000000001s)]
*  Nobody has any rights. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=862.6400000000001s)]
*  If a Palestinian child commits the perfectly defensible act under international law of throwing a rock at a tank when they're living under occupation, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=864.6400000000001s)]
*  Israeli authorities process these Palestinian children through the military court system [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=876.1400000000001s)]
*  and give them draconian sentences where they languish in prisons for months or years for committing absolutely no crime at all, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=880.84s)]
*  for doing what is perfectly justified by any sane person, that if your country is occupied by a foreign army, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=887.04s)]
*  you have the right to resist. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=892.74s)]
*  And yet that is dealt with in the most brutal ways possible, including against Palestinian children. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=894.14s)]
*  Israelis were fine with that and they did have a triumphal attitude. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=899.54s)]
*  And when October 7th happened, it was how dare those people attack us back. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=903.04s)]
*  That is the dynamic, is that we are superior to them. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=908.94s)]
*  And the thought that these people that we've been trampling on, that we've been bombing and pummeling into submission for years, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=911.6400000000001s)]
*  would dare left a finger and commit an atrocity back at us, then that is something that must be punished. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=918.1400000000001s)]
*  And the way that you punish it is by this complete and total devastation. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=924.1400000000001s)]
*  You can see that the two primary goals that Israel declared are nowhere near being achieved, right? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=927.44s)]
*  They've killed far more of their own hostages in Gaza than they have retrieved. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=935.64s)]
*  And they're making absolutely no effort to free the rest of them meaningfully, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=939.4399999999999s)]
*  which is what you do through a ceasefire negotiation and a hostage exchange, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=942.64s)]
*  even after Hamas made clear that they're perfectly willing to give up all of the hostages in exchange for an end to that war. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=946.54s)]
*  And they have not defeated Hamas in any meaningful sense because Hamas is still operating in Gaza. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=952.24s)]
*  What they are succeeding at is their actual goal. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=957.4399999999999s)]
*  It's the goal of destroying Gaza and making it unlivable. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=961.24s)]
*  When you look at the sheer destruction of it, I mean, just satellite imagery, you look at videos, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=964.54s)]
*  you look at how people are living, mass starvation, it's not really fit for human habitation the way it currently is. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=969.9399999999999s)]
*  And it's not clear whether Gaza is ever going to be allowed to be rebuilt [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=976.8399999999999s)]
*  because Israel is going to restrict any rebuilding materials from coming into Gaza based on security grounds. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=980.54s)]
*  And there is no question that the numbers of people who have been killed in Gaza are far, far greater than the official count. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=985.8399999999999s)]
*  It's funny that Israel keeps disputing the official count, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=993.5400000000001s)]
*  but there's almost no doubt that when you look at the estimates of doctors who have visited Gaza, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=996.0400000000001s)]
*  who do this kind of research, when you look at the article that came out in The Lancet a few months ago, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1000.24s)]
*  the death toll out of this is going to unquestionably be in the hundreds of thousands when this thing is all said and done. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1005.5400000000001s)]
*  That is what they want. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1012.1400000000001s)]
*  They want to kill hundreds of thousands of Palestinians and make Gaza unlivable in order to get rid of the quote-unquote Gaza problem. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1013.34s)]
*  And they see this more as a campaign of vengeance and completing Israel's demographic control over the entire territory, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1021.84s)]
*  from the river to the sea, more than it is about retrieving civilians, retrieving hostages. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1029.94s)]
*  That's always been used as an excuse for a far, far darker vision that Israel is imposing on the ground right now. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1034.8400000000001s)]
*  And just finally, just circling back to the United States and all of this, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1041.64s)]
*  I mean, what do you think? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1044.74s)]
*  I mean, some are hoping, obviously, that people are desperate. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1046.94s)]
*  I get this, the stop Donald Trump, and I get that. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1050.14s)]
*  Tim Walsh, he became a bit of a darling of some progressives, is the vice presidential nominee of Kamala Harris. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1052.8400000000001s)]
*  And he said the expansion of Israel and its proxies is an absolute fundamental necessity for the United States. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1057.8400000000001s)]
*  I guess my question is, a lot of people would say as long as they've got their only superpower on their side [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1063.5400000000002s)]
*  and basically whoever wins, they do, they can get away with anything. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1069.3400000000001s)]
*  I mean, what do you think about that? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1073.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, look, I mean, that was thoroughly a disappointing debate performance altogether by Walsh on many, many fronts, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1074.84s)]
*  including this one where, like, Walsh's strength was supposed to be that he's a normal guy, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1082.04s)]
*  speaks in a way that normal people understand, just goes above and beyond politics in a way that you can really connect on a human level. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1087.1399999999999s)]
*  And there's nothing more off-putting to anyone than when somebody sounds like a bot [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1094.4399999999998s)]
*  that was programmed by party consultants to use the right talking points. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1099.1399999999999s)]
*  And so I think he messed up those talking points, but the more fundamental problem is that he was attempting to speak in talking points, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1104.14s)]
*  that he was trying to give the correct party line answer on this issue, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1110.3400000000001s)]
*  instead of speaking about it from the heart in a way that actually connects with people. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1114.8400000000001s)]
*  And yes, there is no question that I think both parties that have a chance of gaining power in Washington [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1118.24s)]
*  are going to have horrible policies on Palestine and Israel. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1124.14s)]
*  There remains to be seen whether there's a difference in degree of harm, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1128.0400000000002s)]
*  because for, again, and this is not defending it by any shred of the imagination, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1133.84s)]
*  obviously we've been talking about how horrific Biden's policy has been. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1139.9399999999998s)]
*  If Jared Kushner's official position is that we have to empty Gaza and let Israel take it over [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1143.6399999999999s)]
*  and build beachfront property for Israelis and there's nothing really for the Palestinians to come back to anymore, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1150.4399999999998s)]
*  and talking about fulfilling Israel's takeover of the West Bank, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1156.04s)]
*  and if the Trump administration is potentially going to be an ally in that effort, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1160.04s)]
*  having been the only administration in history to greenlight settlements and say they are legitimate and legal, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1163.8400000000001s)]
*  to move the embassy to Jerusalem and recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital in contravention to international law, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1170.14s)]
*  to recognize Israel's annexation of the Syrian Golan Heights as legitimate. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1177.04s)]
*  It's clear that Trump's orbit is filled with people who actually have less than zero regard for Palestinians. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1182.64s)]
*  It's just incredible to say that they are willing to, in the case of Biden, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1190.54s)]
*  he'll and probably Harris, continue indulging Israel while occasionally wagging their finger [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1195.04s)]
*  and calling for constraints and saying, no, we won't say okay to the reoccupation of Gaza and so on. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1200.94s)]
*  You can contrast that with potentially the Trump administration coming in and saying, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1207.24s)]
*  we are fully on board with a remaking of the Middle East in the way that Israel wants [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1211.04s)]
*  and that the US would participate in that directly. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1215.34s)]
*  That is a terrifying prospect. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1217.84s)]
*  I don't know what the chances are of the US jumping into a regional war right now. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1219.6399999999999s)]
*  It seems like we're on a path of escalation between Israel and Iran that is unavoidable at this stage. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1226.1399999999999s)]
*  Iran made it clear that they're not going to sit back if Israel hits again, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1232.24s)]
*  and Israel seems determined to restore a balance in which Israel can hit Iran and Iran does not hit back. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1237.6399999999999s)]
*  So they've made clear that they do intend to escalate further. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1243.6399999999999s)]
*  And that's what we're all waiting for. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1246.94s)]
*  Now, if a regional war breaks out, is the US going to step in and participate in Israel's war against the region? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1248.6399999999999s)]
*  And I don't know once more whether there's a contrast between Trump and Biden-Harris on this particular question. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1255.6399999999999s)]
*  There is a level of uncertainty, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1262.74s)]
*  but I think you're absolutely correct in saying that all options right now are pretty depressing ones. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1264.54s)]
*  There aren't any signs of hope in the short term for a major shift in American policy. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1270.04s)]
*  But to the extent that we can fight for a minor one, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1275.24s)]
*  I think that could still make the difference between life and death for potentially millions of people. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1277.74s)]
*  Quite this open place to end. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1285.6399999999999s)]
*  Omar, it's always such a pleasure to be able to talk to you, your insight, your wisdom, your humanity as well. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umE6UFMoTJw&t=1287.54s)]
