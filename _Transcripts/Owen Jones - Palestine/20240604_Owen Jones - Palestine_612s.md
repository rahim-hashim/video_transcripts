# Israel's Rafah LIES Fall Apart
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [June 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0)
*  Over a week ago, the Israeli state bombed displaced Palestinians sheltering in Ra'far, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=0.0s)]
*  slaughtering dozens of innocent people, including children, who were burned alive [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  and beheaded by the attack. The Israeli state then proceeded to execute their [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=10.48s)]
*  classic playbook when they commit these atrocities. Lies, deflections, distortions, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=15.6s)]
*  gaslighting, muddying the waters and so on, with the hope that we all move on, shrug our shoulders, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=21.6s)]
*  full of confusion, not really knowing or understanding what actually happened. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=27.84s)]
*  The Israeli state and its outriders tried to claim that this was a precise attack on two [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=34.32s)]
*  Hamas figures using precise munitions, far from the designated humanitarian area where civilians [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=39.12s)]
*  are concentrated, that it may have been a misfire Hamas rocket or that the explosion was triggered [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=45.84s)]
*  by stored Hamas munitions. You can hear this spokesperson of the so-called Israel Defense [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=51.76s)]
*  Forces, generally known by the Palestinian people as the Israel Occupation Forces, at the time. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=57.76s)]
*  Our efforts to minimize civilian casualties, he emphasizes, with a fire breaking out which was [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=81.76s)]
*  unexpected and unintended. It should be noted that the widely respected independent NGO [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=105.92s)]
*  Médecins Sans Frontières emphasized that the strike took place in a designated safe zone [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=111.84s)]
*  as soon as this attack happened. It should also be noted that the Israeli forces widely [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=117.52s)]
*  briefed that the strike was conducted using two munitions with small warheads suited for this [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=122.64s)]
*  targeted strike, boasting that the bombs only contained 17kg of explosive material, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=128.08s)]
*  which is the smallest munition they said their jets can use. The academic and my near namesake, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=133.04s)]
*  Mark Owen Jones, who specializes in taking on misinformation, said they appeared to be [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=138.88s)]
*  misleading everyone at the time by saying that the 17kg warhead used in the RAF attack is the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=144.0s)]
*  smallest they have. He says small doesn't mean not powerful. The 17kg warhead uses AFX 757. AFX [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  757 was introduced as a more powerful explosive than that used previously, adding 22kg of AFX [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=158.56s)]
*  757 is equivalent to 87kg of previously used explosives. It sounds small, but is enough [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=165.28s)]
*  to generate a powerful explosion. He also added that with Israel carrying out a targeted [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=174.0s)]
*  assassination, they could have probably used something like Hellfire RNX with pop-up blades [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=179.52s)]
*  instead of explosives they've used before, but in this case they used high explosives they tried [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=183.76s)]
*  then to suggest were small. He also points to the map of the area and the strike published by the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=188.95999999999998s)]
*  IDF themselves, indicating that the blast radius would have impacted something 100m away from the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=194.32s)]
*  impact, and that would mean the radius covers a huge amount of displaced people's tents. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=200.16s)]
*  The IDF claim rests with the idea that their so-called precision strike caused Hamas [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=205.6s)]
*  munitions to detonate 100m away. He has noted that no evidence has been offered up that [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=210.4s)]
*  Hamas munitions detonated, even if they had 100m away. That's not precision by any [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=216.16s)]
*  meaningful definition of that word. While we're discussing this, we should note that Joe Biden [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=222.96s)]
*  made a major offensive on RAFA, a supposed red line of his, saying that if it was crossed then [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=227.20000000000002s)]
*  the US would review certain weapons it was handing to Israel. After this massacre, he claimed his [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=231.84s)]
*  entirely meaningless nonsense hadn't been crossed. It then transpired that the Israeli [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=237.28s)]
*  strike which slaughtered these civilians used munitions manufactured in, you guessed it, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=242.4s)]
*  the United States of America. CNN has found images of four explosive weapons which it [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=247.2s)]
*  geo-located to the scene of the strike in RAFA, which experts identified as the tail of a US-made [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=252.4s)]
*  GBU-39 small-diametre bomb manufactured by Boeing. In theory, these are, according to the explosive [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=258.32s)]
*  weapons expert Chris Cobb-Smith, designed to attack strategically important point targets with [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=265.6s)]
*  low collateral damage, but then he adds a crucial clarifier, using any munition, even of this size, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=271.44s)]
*  will always incur risks in a densely populated area. The reason this is a crucial point is that [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=278.0s)]
*  the reason Biden was forced to issue his so-called red line after suffering a huge political cost in [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=283.52000000000004s)]
*  the run-up to the presidential election after facilitating genocide is because RAFA is where [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=288.72s)]
*  the majority of Gaza's population were forced to flee, under threat of violence supposedly because [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=293.84s)]
*  it was safe. And that, even despite citizens fleeing there subsequently, it was accepted [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=298.79999999999995s)]
*  that there was no safe way to attack RAFA because of the concentration of people there. You cannot [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=304.88s)]
*  drive a truck through a crowded street and then claim you're driving safely. Now in classic fashion, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=310.15999999999997s)]
*  the Israeli claims have been falling apart, albeit long enough after the atrocity for attention to [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=315.35999999999996s)]
*  That's why we're doing this video. We can't move on. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz have a new [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=321.2s)]
*  article entitled Bad Planning Poor Intel How Israel Struck Crowded RAFA Refugee Camp Killing [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=326.08s)]
*  Dozens. Now this article is very important. They report that satellite images and an Israeli army [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=333.04s)]
*  probe indicate that the IDF failed to properly evaluate the damage that the strike on two senior [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=340.48s)]
*  Hamas officials would cause. The two shacks the IDF targeted, they say, were part of dense makeshift [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=345.28s)]
*  accommodation later found to have housed dozens of civilians. Dire planning was found to be the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  cause of this bloodbath. According to this military investigation, there were preliminary [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=357.12s)]
*  inspections made to ensure there weren't civilians in the compound where the two Hamas leaders were [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=361.44s)]
*  staying, but no such verification was made about the nearby shacks which were made of thin metal. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=366.24s)]
*  Well that's just absurd isn't it? Why wouldn't you check that? I'm not a military expert, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=371.36s)]
*  but that seems like a rather obvious thing to do in those circumstances. Haaretz adds that the [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=374.96000000000004s)]
*  makeshift accommodation where the two Hamas members were staying was part of a compound made of 13 [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=379.68s)]
*  similar shacks with a small distance of just 1-2 metres between them. Three other nearby shacks [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=384.88s)]
*  were also consumed with fire. Whilst the IDF unusually revealed the specific type of weapons [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=389.68s)]
*  used, again warheads weighing 17kg, Haaretz notes that the total weight of each of the two bombs [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=394.72s)]
*  dropped in the shack was about 100kg. A pretty sizeable difference from the claim isn't it? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=400.24s)]
*  They write such a strike's peripheral damage reaches a radius of several metres, a figure [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=405.6s)]
*  that should have been considered before the attack, considering the possibility that there [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=410.32s)]
*  were indeed uninvolved civilians staying in the nearby compound. Sources in Israel's defence [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=414.24s)]
*  establishment said there were issues with the pre-tripe planning. I think it's worth zoning [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=419.2s)]
*  on that point. The International Criminal Court Chief Prosecutor has just issued requests for [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=423.12s)]
*  arrest warrants for Israel's Prime Minister and his defence minister. The International Court of [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=428.24s)]
*  Justice has issued a legally binding rule ordering Israel to cease its Rafa offensive. The main ally [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=432.72s)]
*  and patron of Israel, the United States, on which it is entirely dependent, has been forced into [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=439.76s)]
*  a position of growing public frustration and is at least theoretically threatening to suspend [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=444.32s)]
*  some weapon sales. Western public opinion, including in the United States, has turned [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=449.12s)]
*  devastatingly against the state of Israel. A new poll suggests that 30% of American Jews think [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=454.56s)]
*  Israel is committing genocide, with even more, a higher percentage of younger American Jews [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=460.96s)]
*  thinking the same. Now you would think in these circumstances the Israeli military establishment [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=467.76s)]
*  might go well look we're in a particularly vulnerable place right now, we need to wait for [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=472.4s)]
*  this to just blow over, let's just avoid anything which could cause any more problems, let's just be [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=475.76s)]
*  extra careful. So what exactly happened there then? These guys boast of being one of the world's most [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=480.32s)]
*  advanced militaries, they're under huge amounts of pressure and they immediately cause a huge [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=485.92s)]
*  massacre. Now look, let's be clear, the Israeli state clearly has no respect for the basic humanity [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=490.32s)]
*  of the Palestinian people, it's utterly dehumanised them, repeatedly, which of course is a [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=494.8s)]
*  precondition for genocide. Just imagine, now let's just imagine, the last eight months on earth for [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=499.52s)]
*  these fellow human beings, who were slaughtered, many of them undoubtedly dying in unimaginable, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=506.64s)]
*  agonising pain. How many times did they have to flee from one place to another, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=512.3199999999999s)]
*  desperately looking for safety? Six? Seven? Eight times? How many of their loved ones and friends [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=517.68s)]
*  who have already been killed have they wept for? How many were already injured or maimed? How many [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=523.6s)]
*  times has panic overwhelmed them as explosives detonate near them? How many have spent sleepless [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=528.24s)]
*  nights weeping over their predicament? How many have suffered from hunger, from thirst, from lack [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=532.64s)]
*  of access to medical treatment? How many of them have comforted themselves that whatever horrors [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=536.8s)]
*  they have endured, they still have each other? Miserable, desperate months, full of terror, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=542.08s)]
*  full of suffering, and then they were all wiped from the face of the earth in agonising pain [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=550.08s)]
*  by an Israeli state which has contempt for the Palestinian people as a whole who they [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=557.1999999999999s)]
*  want rid of. This was a criminal act. One more crime, but never, never let us say [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=562.16s)]
*  just another crime, because as soon as we become desensitised, as soon as we allow this to be [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=568.0s)]
*  normalised, well then they really have one. So when these atrocities are committed, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=572.88s)]
*  let's not forget them, and let's not let the Israeli state deflect and disassemble and gaslight [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=577.6s)]
*  and obfuscate and then hope we all just forget, left bewildered by what's true and what's not [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=583.36s)]
*  true in the so-called fog of war. Each of the Palestinians who were butchered by the Israeli [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=588.88s)]
*  state, each of their lives matter, and those who stole those lives should be held account [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Rastlwzi0&t=595.36s)]
