# Israel Backs Literal Pro-Nazi Leader
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [December 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs)
*  The Israeli state rushing to support an openly pro-Nazi politician in Europe. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=0.0s)]
*  In this case we're discussing Romania which just had an election, a parliamentary election, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=4.72s)]
*  where the far-right surged but was prevented from winning. They got 18.2% of the vote, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=9.76s)]
*  four points behind the ruling Social Democratic Party. Now the headline in the Israeli newspaper [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Haaretz is Romania accuses Israel of election interference after Netanyahu minister call with [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=21.6s)]
*  pro-Nazi candidate. Now interesting, if you read the subheading it says it notes, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=29.6s)]
*  Diaspora affairs minister Amitai Cicli, this guy's going to come up a lot, conversation with [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  presidential candidate Caelan Gheorghezcu was publicised by far-right media in Romania and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=44.72s)]
*  beyond. Gheorghezcu has previously praised the anti-Semitic iron guard known for its violent [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=49.36s)]
*  persecution of Jews. The phone call Haaretz notes was widely publicised and the Romanian [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=55.76s)]
*  ambassador to Israel who it turns out is an esteemed Holocaust historian said that such conduct [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=62.8s)]
*  hurt Romania's close relationship with Israel adding that Romania did not similarly intervene [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=69.92s)]
*  in Israel's affairs. Now as Haaretz says the far-right in Romania are strongly pro-Pyotin [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  and pro-Israel and in this call the far-right pledged to move the nation's embassy of Romania [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=81.04s)]
*  from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem as of course happened under Donald Trump's first term in the US and [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=89.36000000000001s)]
*  indeed crucially to refuse to honour the international criminal courts arrest warrant against Israeli [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=96.72s)]
*  leader Benjamin Netanyahu for war crimes and crimes against humanity. What's in this article [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=102.48s)]
*  offers a very useful explainer by the way to a phenomenon much broader than Romania. The phone [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=108.48s)]
*  call was publicised according to Haaretz by two types of media far-right media outlets and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  mainstream Israeli media outlets and why was this useful for the far-right? Because Gheorghezcu is [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=119.36s)]
*  very correctly denounced for praising anti-Semitic Nazi collaborators like the iron guard who [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=125.2s)]
*  slaughtered Jewish Romanians during World War II and the dictator Ion Antonescu one of Nazi Germany's [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=130.72s)]
*  key collaborators. Indeed he called these pro-Nazi killers of Jews heroes and martyrs and as Haaretz [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=137.12s)]
*  notes again has kept doing so even though Jewish organisations denounced him for it. The Romanian [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=147.68s)]
*  ambassador is quoted as saying for 31 years I was part of the senior management of the US Holocaust [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=154.08s)]
*  Memorial Museum based in Washington. I find it shocking to see a minister of the government of [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=160.32s)]
*  Israel be perceived as backing in a crucial electoral moment a Romanian political candidate [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=165.84s)]
*  who is loudly and proudly glorifying historical figures who are directly responsible for mass [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=171.84s)]
*  murder of Jews adding that his action is a direct insult to the memory of the Romanian Holocaust [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=177.84s)]
*  victims both dead and survivors and also a direct hit on all good faith efforts at Holocaust [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=184.0s)]
*  education Europe and building policies to fight anti-Semitism based on historical reality not on [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=190.4s)]
*  conveniently whitewash versions which serve contemporary political objectives. It turns out [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=197.2s)]
*  that the Israeli state has a history of doing this with Romania last year prior to the 7th of October [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=202.32s)]
*  the Israeli ambassador met the far-right alliance for the union of [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=207.6s)]
*  Romanians who we're talking about on the orders of the then Israeli foreign secretary. I mean again [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=213.68s)]
*  continuity there isn't that you have a far-right movement in Romania [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=219.52s)]
*  which openly supports the perpetrators of genocide in World War II and they continue now [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=223.52s)]
*  in the here and now to support genocide. Now there is a pattern here in July Amitai Chikli [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=230.48000000000002s)]
*  endorsed the French far-right leader Marine Le Pen as excellent for Israel declaring I think I and [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=238.56s)]
*  Netanyahu of the same opinion it's not a personal matter leading to protests from the French [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=243.84s)]
*  president Emmanuel Macron. He declared support for Le Pen because of her positions on Hamas [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=249.28s)]
*  and crucially opposing the international criminal court which of course as we have noted [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=255.76s)]
*  has demanded the arrest of Benjamin Netanyahu as well as claiming she's committed to the fight [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=263.36s)]
*  against anti-Semitism which is clearly just based on conflating support for Israel with [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=269.76s)]
*  opposing anti-Semitism. Now the Israeli state's closest ally in Europe is that of Viktor Orbán [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=274.88s)]
*  in Hungary that's a far-right quasi-dictatorship and the most openly anti-Semitic government in [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=279.92s)]
*  Europe constantly portrays the Hungarian opposition as the pawns of George Soros portrayed as the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=285.36s)]
*  sinister Jewish puppet master. Orbán was the first leader after the international criminal courts [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=291.2s)]
*  arrest warrants to declare he would invite Netanyahu to visit Hungary to thumb its nose [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=298.08000000000004s)]
*  his nose up at the ICC. Now back in March the Israeli president Isaac Herzog he hails from [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=304.08000000000004s)]
*  the Israeli Labour Party can't just say oh these are Israeli right-wingers all the rest of it [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=311.36s)]
*  clearly that's the political project it's become ever more extreme in terms of the Israeli state [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=316.48s)]
*  and its direction he's from the Israeli Labour Party and he met with the far-right Dutch leader [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=321.68s)]
*  Gert Wilders who is a viciously anti-Muslim politician wants to ban the Quran floats banning [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=328.72s)]
*  Islam all together they did a cozy photo call together Spain's far-right party Vox has visited [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=336.40000000000003s)]
*  Israel and the Israeli minister particularly the who there we spoke about the despondent minister [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=345.84s)]
*  declared that they had suffered a campaign of delegitimization like Likud the ruling party of [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=351.59999999999997s)]
*  course of Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel and in turn he attended a convention of the European far-right [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=358.55999999999995s)]
*  hosted by Vox in Madrid what's going on here then after all the European far-right is traditionally [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=364.0s)]
*  the bastion of violent anti-Semitism as indeed the 1930s and the 1940s underlined those murders of [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=371.36s)]
*  Jews being lauded by the Romanian far-right which is the same forces the Israeli state is keen to [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=379.28000000000003s)]
*  promote now clearly that anti-Semitism remains but much of the far-right also see Israel as a sort of [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=387.28000000000003s)]
*  bastion or example of European civilization which is keeping the Muslim and Arab hordes and barbarians [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=393.68s)]
*  at bay who they these days see as the primary enemy indeed they particularly admire Israel [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=400.64s)]
*  as an ethno-state that's why the US neo-Nazi Richard D Spencer calls himself a white [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=407.12s)]
*  Zionist praising the Jewish nation state law of Israel which commits to only the Jewish [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=414.32s)]
*  inhabitants of Israel having the right to national self-determination so even though these European [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=421.52s)]
*  far-right movements are racist riddled with anti-Semitism that is not the litmus test for [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=427.44s)]
*  the Israeli state despite claiming to be the protector of Jewish people everywhere now indeed [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=433.2s)]
*  the biggest killing of Jewish people since the Holocaust was committed by the far-right junta in [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=439.52s)]
*  Argentina which ruled the nation from 1976 onwards Jews represented more than 12 percent of that [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=444.56s)]
*  victims but constituted less than one percent of the population [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=452.64000000000004s)]
*  Nazism was celebrated by that junta with recordings of Hitler speeches playing while victims Jews [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=456.96000000000004s)]
*  among them were tortured including to death but who was an ally of that Argentine junta [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=464.24s)]
*  that's right Israel which offered it weapons and military training despite knowing full well what [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=470.40000000000003s)]
*  it was up to in terms of the Jewish population with the chief rabbi there visiting the US to beg [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=478.0s)]
*  for help in evacuating Argentine Jews Israel today sees its key allies as the far-right in Europe [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=484.32s)]
*  these are the same people who believe in ethno-states in racist domination in treating [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=493.12s)]
*  Muslims as dangerous enemies and we should be aware of the fact that they look at how Israel has [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=498.0s)]
*  treated the Palestinians as a potential blueprint fused with technologies of the future including [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCso-p5H6cs&t=502.72s)]
