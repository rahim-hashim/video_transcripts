# Israel's Dystopian Killing Machine Exposed
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBr_-JuAQl4)
*  Israel's dystopian killing machine has been exposed in truly chilling and gruesome detail.
*  Now you may have concluded that you're not capable of being shocked
*  anymore after six months of the genocidal slaughter against the Palestinian people of Gaza.
*  Well, I fear and I warn you, you may have to find some more room for some more shock.
*  A new piece, an extraordinary piece, has been published by the Israeli-Palestinian publication
*  Plus 972 magazine and it's penned by the superb Israeli investigative journalist Yuval Abraham.
*  It's based on testimony from six Israeli intelligence officers, all of whom have
*  served in the Israeli army during the current onslaught against Gaza and they detail an AI,
*  artificial intelligence based program which has been used to reduce Gaza to its state of murderous
*  ruin. Now this AI program is called Lavender and it's played a crucial role in a bombing campaign
*  which has severely damaged or destroyed most civilian infrastructure, leaving Gaza looking
*  a different colour and texture when looked at from space and slaughtering tens of thousands of
*  course of Palestinians, many of them children, will come onto that. According to the intelligence
*  sources who have briefed Plus 972 magazine, Yuval Abraham, the influence on the military's operation
*  was such that they essentially treated the outputs of the AI machine as if it was a human decision.
*  So what the system does is mark all suspected operatives in the military wings of Hamas and
*  Palestinian Islamic Jihad, including low ranking ones, really important, talk about that, as
*  potential bombing targets. Now here would be clearly instructed to know how these so-called
*  operatives were defined because work by human rights organisations in previous much much smaller
*  Israeli onslaughts against Gaza have revealed that Israel uses Hamas, let alone other armed groups,
*  as a catch-all term which includes so-called targets which by no definition are armed militants
*  who pose any sort of threat to Israeli forces of any description. We'll talk about that. Now
*  they relied the Israeli forces on Lavender when targeting as many as 37,000 Palestinians as
*  suspected militants and their homes for possible airstrikes. Now as a previous Plus 972 investigation
*  pointed out, which I covered at the time, imagine Hamas targeted the homes of Israeli soldiers
*  when they were with their families, at night, lying in bed, blowing them all up, including
*  their children. Well that would quite correctly be regarded as a truly hideous crime, would it not?
*  It's worth keeping that in mind as you listen. Now according to the piece, in the early stage of
*  the so-called war, the army gave sweeping approval for officers to adopt Lavender's kill lists without
*  requiring them to thoroughly check as humans why the machine made those choices or to examine the
*  intelligence data in which they were based. Dystopian doesn't really cover this, does it?
*  It's like the most warped version of Black Mirror imaginable, but it's real. Now apparently one
*  source stated that human personnel often served only as a rubber stamp for the machine's decisions,
*  so normally they would devote only 20 seconds to each target before authorizing a bombing.
*  Guess what the criteria for ensuring that this was the right target? It's whether the target was male.
*  So to return to the point I made earlier, we're relying on a machine here to decide who is an
*  actual so-called military target and the human oversight there is based on whether they're a man,
*  with a process deciding whether the target, and indeed often their entire families, live or die
*  based on 20 seconds of human insight. And the clincher, or one of them, listen to this,
*  this was despite knowing that the system makes what are regarded as errors in approximately 10%
*  of cases and is known to occasionally mark individuals who have merely a loose connection
*  to militant groups or no connection at all. In these cases, by the way, they were targeted,
*  for example, because they had a name or nickname identical to that of a Hamas operative. Although
*  we'd of course love to know the process which determines whether an error was made, but therefore
*  we know as a fact that people who are not legitimate targets of any kind have not only been
*  slaughtered themselves, but often including alongside their entire families, including their
*  children. As the piece notes, the Israeli army systematically attacked the targeted individuals
*  while they were in their homes, usually at night while the whole families were present, rather than
*  during the course of military activity. According to the sources, this was because, from what they
*  regarded as an intelligence standpoint, it was easier to locate the individuals in their private
*  homes. An automated system was used to specifically track the targeted individuals and carry out
*  bombings when they entered families' residences. Now listen to this, do you know what they call
*  that system? Where's daddy? The consequences, as the sources themselves have said, is that thousands
*  of Palestinians, mostly women and children and those with nothing to do with any fighting,
*  were slaughtered by airstrikes, especially in the first few weeks because of decisions made by an
*  artificial intelligence program. Well these sources have offered testimonies which I think
*  will prove invaluable in the future war crimes tribunal which we need to fight for.
*  Now the sources make it clear the IDF bombed them in homes without hesitation as the first option
*  because it's easier to bomb a home rather than look for them whilst fighting, which would at
*  least ensure that they were targeting a militant and spare their families from being exterminated.
*  Now as I said, I did a video in a previous Superb Plus 972 magazine investigation about the so-called
*  gospel AI machine which marks buildings and structures the army claims militants operate from,
*  that Lavender is about targeting people. It's an AI compiled kill list. Now as ever,
*  when discussing the horrors unleashed against Gaza, this only gets worse. When targeting what are only
*  alleged junior militants, often with their families, the army prefer to use unguided missiles known as
*  dumb bombs, unlike smart position bombs. You've seen the impact of these bombings. They can bring
*  down entire buildings, crashing down on everyone who lives in them, killing and maiming often large
*  numbers of people. One source says, you don't want to waste expensive bombs on unimportant people. It's
*  very expensive for the country and there's a shortage of those bombs. Well, Palestinian life is
*  cheap in the most literal of senses. Another source said they'd personally authorised the bombing of
*  hundreds of private homes of alleged junior operatives marked by Lavender with many of these
*  attacks killing civilians and entire families as collateral damage. Previously, the Israeli army
*  didn't authorise any collateral damage during assassinations of low-ranking militants. But of
*  what I must emphasise are alleged junior Hamas operatives. They could kill now up to 15 or 20
*  civilians. Just process that. Up to 20 civilians, they're not targets, that's the point.
*  They shouldn't be targets. Up to 20 civilians could be slaughtered for the sake of taking,
*  for killing, a low-level target who may not actually be whatever the AI machine has determined them to
*  be anyway. Now, the sources added that in the event the target was a senior Hamas official with
*  rank of battalion and brigade commander, on several occasions the army had authorised the killing of
*  more than 100 civilians when assassinating a single commander. The evidence just shows the
*  utter moral degradation evolved here from a place which was already morally degraded. In that in
*  previous onslaughts, because it was understood that killing someone in a private home when their
*  entire family was there was especially brutal, you're not kidding, in terms of how you kill someone,
*  what they did allegedly previously was to ensure that such human targets had previously been
*  marked very carefully, with only senior military commanders bombed in their homes to maintain what
*  was described as the principle of proportionality in international law. Since 7 October, or the so
*  called Operation Iron Swords, instead all operatives were designated as human targets. Their rank or
*  military importance not relevant. They're all targets to be bombed. Finding out their information,
*  like where they lived previously, was done by humans because there was a manageable number,
*  but when the kill list is tens of thousands of lower ranking operatives, that's not possible.
*  So that becomes automated software and artificial intelligence. 37,000 Palestinians as potential
*  targets. Then multiply that by however many relatives and civilians are nearby in one of the
*  most densely populated places on earth. Well this completely destroys, does it not, the narrative
*  about human shields. You can't talk about human shields when you're targeting low level operatives
*  in their private homes where they live with their families. That's clearly a nonsense, isn't it?
*  And to underline just how disturbing this definition of junior operatives is, a source says they didn't
*  know who they were previously because they weren't tracked routinely before 7 October. So they wanted
*  them to go especially the IDF for junior operatives. Why? Because they're done automatically,
*  so you get loads and loads and loads and loads of targets. So if Lavender decides an individual is
*  a Hamas militant, that was therefore to treat the IDF soldiers in question, had to treat that as an
*  order from an AI machine. No requirement to independently check why the machine made that
*  choice to look at the raw intelligence data and what it was based. As soon as the individual's at
*  home, they were there to be immediately bombed. But sometimes the individual wasn't even home
*  because military officers didn't verify the information in real time. The sources also made
*  it clear that there were times when a Hamas operative was defined more broadly, the point
*  I was making earlier. The machine brought them names of civil defence personnel or police officers
*  who they say the source on whom it would be ashamed to waste bombs. They help the Hamas government,
*  they say, but they don't really endanger soldiers. I'll be honest, this is a disturbing nightmare.
*  A disturbing sci-fi nightmare made real using AI to in practice legitimise the mass slaughter of
*  vast, vast numbers of people. That whole human shield fetus lies rotting in the rubble of Gaza,
*  along with so many tens of thousands of people using this entirely questionable concept of a
*  low level operative convicted as such by artificial intelligence with the knowledge that there is a
*  significant margin of error with no meaningful human oversight over who they are at all,
*  with up to 22 millions considered fair gain to take that one so-called low level target out.
*  We were told 14,000 plus kids, not including those buried under the rubble that is, have been
*  killed in Gaza in part because they were used as human shields by Hamas. The state waited until
*  that person returned home, then dropped in general a dumb bomb on that home, exterminating his entire
*  family. We already have enough information to know one of the great crimes of our age has been
*  committed. And this incredibly courageous work, which you must read by Yuval Abraham and Plus972
*  magazine, offers up the anatomy of a genocidal war. But there'll be far more evidence to come.
*  There's no doubt about that. And we can see now Israel's impunity collapsing, not least because
*  they wiped out, they killed, they slaughtered seven Westerners. And it is truly repulsive not
*  to detract away from the horror of what those families are going through now. That is only
*  Western blood being spilled that leads to Israel suddenly being held to account. So let's remember
*  the mass slaughter of so many Palestinians. And this crucial piece of work shows in part how that
*  has happened. Please like and subscribe. Do leave your comments. Do share the video. Do read the
