# Gaza ERASED From UK Election
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [June 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzg9lhicg1o)
*  Come on though, seriously, what travesty of a democracy is this?
*  Now the UK general election is devoid of any substance about anything meaningful,
*  it's basically an imploding Tory campaign set to the Betty Hill theme tune, all very amusing,
*  all very droll, but we're not debating what a government about to receive an epic landslide,
*  thanks to the total self-destruction of the Tories, is going to do with the half decade
*  it's set to have in power, at least with domestic policy all but erased, mere trivialities like,
*  spending, tax, the NHS education, just not even there, or say existential threats like the climate
*  emergency and how that can be turned into an opportunity, not getting a look in, what hope
*  was there ever for Gaza? That's right, a genocide, one of the great crimes of our age, which this
*  country, Britain, is deeply complicit in. Deeply complicit in not least firstly because of our own
*  imperial history within living memory, it was of course the British mandate for Palestine,
*  and the British Empire, which promised what was described as a national homeland for the
*  Jewish people, but which in practice was at the expense of the indigenous Palestinian population,
*  and deeply complicit because Britain backed Israel's genocide landslides from the start,
*  refused to use its diplomatic position to take on that genocide landslide, bear in mind that,
*  for example, Britain still has a seat at the Security Council of the United Nations,
*  and is at least nominally the closest ally of the US, offers weapons to Israel, shares intelligence
*  with Israel, we could go on. Now I've written a column on the erasure of Gaza in this election
*  for the Guardian newspaper, and I start by asking, is this a serious country or not? Because having
*  a general election in which you virtually erase a massive genocidal war your government and
*  opposition are complicit in is quite something. As I discussed in the column, this week alone,
*  Israel has threatened all-out war with Lebanon, while Hezbollah's leader threatens a war without
*  rules or ceilings, dangling the prospects of a far graver bloodbath than that unleashed by Israel's
*  genocide of rampage in Gaza. The spokesperson of the Israel Defense Forces has admitted that Israel
*  cannot be destroyed militarily, this amounts to a confession that the central war goal used to
*  justify the slaughter of tens of thousands is unattainable, and the United Nations has released
*  a report offering evidence as to how Israel's bombing campaign in Gaza may have systematically
*  violated the laws of war on protecting civilians and civilian infrastructure.
*  I don't think even the most attentive media outlets that have been reporting on the genocide
*  since day one and prior to October, I don't think that those media outlets have really conveyed
*  the full extent of the violence, the full extent of the barbarity of what is happening,
*  and the ways in which that has manifested. We're speaking here about hospitals that have been
*  unable to cope for several months, and they are functioning really by the sheer determination
*  of the Palestinian healthcare workers that are continuing to show up and are continuing to see
*  patients. But frankly speaking, even the most well-resourced healthcare system in the world
*  would not be able to withstand the level of trauma that is coming through the doors,
*  the sheer number of patients presenting with some of the most complicated and horrific
*  physical and psychological conditions that a healthcare professional will see in their
*  professional careers. Let me just digest this basic fact for a minute. An onslaught backed by
*  the British government and opposition then involved the International Criminal Court's
*  chief prosecutor requesting arrest warrants against the Prime Minister and defence minister,
*  who led that onslaught. That should be a national scandal. It means that Britain
*  is implicated in what are officially alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity,
*  but which in practice are self-evidently some of the worst atrocities committed
*  in the 21st century. Indeed, a case has been launched by lawyers in this country to prosecute
*  politicians for their complicity in these crimes. We had a Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, though not
*  for long, he's getting dragged out of number 10 pronto, but back in October he promised unequivocal
*  support for Israel for all time. Well, Keir Starmer, Labour leader who will inevitably become
*  Prime Minister in 13 days, did an interview backing Israel's right to cut off water and energy,
*  sent multiple allies and television to defend him after that and refused to condemn these
*  screaming war crimes. Then after two weeks claimed he never believed Israel had that right. He backed
*  the self-evidently genocidal onslaught despite the blood curdling promises of Israeli leaders,
*  who made clear from the beginning exactly what they were going to do. He then proceeded to
*  hound those who spoke out against this murderous onslaught, suspending Labour MPs for variously
*  describing the onslaught against Gaza as a genocide the day the International Court of Justice
*  put Israel on trial for hilarious genocide and one for calling for peaceful coexistence between
*  Palestinians and Israelis between the river and the sea. You can't make this shit up.
*  As dozens of predominantly Muslim councillors quit the party and discussed a Labour official brief
*  that the party was shaking off the fleas, Labour frontbenchers resigned because the party refused
*  to pack a ceasefire while the Labour leader remained a man who had backed the right of
*  Israel to commit war crimes. When the Scottish National Party put forward a motion holding
*  Israel responsible for collective punishment, which would then mean taking actual action on
*  Israel rather than simply empty words, hot air, Labour led the charge to gut that motion. Even
*  though it's clear that Israel has broken international law, egregiously so, and the
*  Conservative head of the Defence Select Committee told a public meeting that the government's own
*  lawyers had said this, the incoming Labour government still refused to commit to cutting
*  off weapons. Now where's the debate? Where's the discussion? Because both parties now talk about
*  a ceasefire, but they refuse to put any meaningful pressure on Israel or even obviously just not even
*  discussing stopping arming Israel. Imagine talking about a ceasefire as you hand over weapons to a
*  warring side, like saying stop, stop shooting at each other, here's a gun. All they actually do is
*  listen to what the US State Department is saying at any given time and then just follow them in
*  lockstep. There is no independent foreign policy here, surely that itself should be a matter of
*  public debate. And they both talk about an independent Palestinian state, but unlike say Spain,
*  Ireland and Norway, refuse to commit to recognising immediately a Palestinian state. They just mean
*  that sometime in the undetermined future, that's a meaningless platitude. Manana, manana, that's
*  their position in practice. And yet when the British Foreign Secretary David Cameron was
*  interrogated about his government record, say he was the British Foreign Secretary was on the BBC's
*  Today programme, I would say a pretty big opportunity there to talk about Gaza. They didn't ask him a
*  single question on it. That's insane. They just asked him out trust and house building. On the BBC
*  Question Time's leaders debate on the BBC yesterday, not one question not answering Gaza. Yet we know
*  huge numbers of people in Britain do care about Gaza. Hundreds of thousands of people have marched.
*  A by-election in Rochdale earlier this year was largely won over the issue. Polling shows that
*  a large majority of British voters believe Israel has committed war crimes and want it to immediately
*  end its onslaught and support an immediate end to arms sales and even want Israel to enter peace
*  negotiations with Hamas. So why aren't we talking? Why aren't we talking about this issue? Clearly a
*  lot of it is just brutal anti-Palestinian racism. There's not even subtlety about the lack of worth
*  given to Palestinian life. Palestinian life is given almost no worth at all. Much of the British
*  media simply follows blindly the foreign policy positions of the establishment that they are part
*  of while political reporting in this country reduces politics to a soap opera. Just one big
*  psychodrama. Well this is a travesty. Gaza matters. The Palestinian people matter. Peace
*  matters. And the attempt to erase Gaza and Russia's complicity from an election in which we're
*  supposed to talk about actual issues is a disgrace. Well we're not going to give up here. We're not
*  going to stop talking about it and nor should you. Please like and subscribe. Do leave your comments.
*  Would love to hear your thoughts. Please help us as ever try to take on the pro-war media and the
*  abysmal media ecosystem that exists in Britain. Listen to the podcast.
