# Palestinian Analyst DESTROYS Israel's Lies - / w. Mouin Rabbani
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [March 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo)
*  Now, every time I interview Marin Rabani, we always get inundated with, I think, pretty justified [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=0.0s)]
*  praise in terms of his analysis, his insight, his wisdom. He's the co-editor of Jadaliyah. He's a [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=6.4s)]
*  brilliant Dutch Palestinian analyst based in Canada, though, I believe. So very international [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=13.76s)]
*  in scope. But I really want to talk to you, Marin, because obviously things have got [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=21.76s)]
*  bleak since the last time we spoke, which I'm afraid is a constant theme with every conversation [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=28.4s)]
*  I think I've had with you. I just want to start with your thoughts, actually. Great to see you, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=33.68s)]
*  by the way. Yeah, great to be with you, and thanks for having me on again, Owen. It's always a [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=38.239999999999995s)]
*  pleasure. And as I say, you're always very much in demand. Just, I want your take on the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  destruction of the so-called ceasefire by Israel. Well, there never was a ceasefire to begin with. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=52.16s)]
*  If I can just take a moment to explain how we got here. As you know, there was a brief [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=60.31999999999999s)]
*  cessation of hostilities in November of 2023, which Israel then refused to extend. And on the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=69.19999999999999s)]
*  1st of December 2023, its genocidal military campaign resumed in full force. The mediators, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=77.92s)]
*  Egypt and Qatar, spent the first half of 2024 trying to formulate a proposal that could be [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=88.08s)]
*  accepted by all parties concerned, meaning not only Israel and Hamas, but also the United States. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=97.44s)]
*  Then finally, in May of last year, Joe Biden, US president at the time, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=106.0s)]
*  announced a proposal that he said had essentially been formulated by the Israeli Prime Minister, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=114.56s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu. That proposal was then accepted by Hamas in early July of last year. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  And it seems that it had been designed to be rejected by the Palestinians, because as soon [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=130.95999999999998s)]
*  as Hamas publicly announced that it accepted it, Netanyahu began introducing new conditions [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=136.95999999999998s)]
*  that there will be no formal cessation of hostilities, that Israel would not withdraw from [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=145.28s)]
*  the border between the Gaza Strip and Egypt, and various other conditions that Hamas, of course, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=151.12s)]
*  refused to accept. And then, you know, Biden, with his unconditional, limitless support for Israel, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=159.04s)]
*  he and his officials gave, you know, said that the only obstacle to a ceasefire was that Hamas was [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=169.12s)]
*  not accepting it, whereas in fact, Hamas had accepted the proposal, and it was Israel that [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=177.04s)]
*  was rejecting it. Then in November of last year, you have the US presidential elections, Trump won [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=181.84s)]
*  Harris lost, and what appears to have been the case is that the incoming president, Trump, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=188.32s)]
*  did not want to have a foreign policy crisis on his hands on the day of his inauguration. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=196.72s)]
*  Least of all, one that involved American hostages in the Middle East, Jimmy Carter had just passed [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=203.76s)]
*  away, you know, there was a lot of recollection of the Iranian hostage crisis of the late 1970s [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  and so on. And so he sent his Middle East envoy, a real estate developer with no prior diplomatic [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=215.92s)]
*  experience, Steve Witkoff, to the Middle East. And it took Witkoff only one meeting with Netanyahu [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=223.44s)]
*  to ensure that Israel accepted essentially the exact same proposal that Biden had issued in May. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=231.6s)]
*  Of course, he didn't need to put any pressure on Hamas because Hamas had already accepted it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=244.64s)]
*  Now, I'm sorry for all the details, but I think it's also important to point out that this wasn't [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  kind of a single comprehensive proposal to end this war and achieve a formal cessation of [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=256.88s)]
*  hostilities and so on, along the lines of what's apparently being discussed with respect to Ukraine [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  or other conflicts. At Israel's insistence, it was a three-stage agreement. The first stage, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=271.36s)]
*  which was meant to last 60 days or 42 days rather, and which went into force on the 19th of January [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=278.56s)]
*  of this year, consisted of a suspension of hostilities rather than a formal cessation [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=286.40000000000003s)]
*  of hostilities, a limited Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, a partial Israeli-Palestinian [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=293.6s)]
*  exchange of captives, permission for forcibly displaced Palestinians to return to those areas [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=300.96s)]
*  from which they had been displaced, primarily from the center and south of the Gaza Strip to [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=309.2s)]
*  the northern areas, and the surge in humanitarian deliveries. The second stage was supposed to result [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=314.71999999999997s)]
*  in a durable cessation of hostilities, in other words, a formal ceasefire, a completion of the [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=323.84s)]
*  exchange of captives, a completion of the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and a few other [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=330.56s)]
*  things. And although the objectives of the second stage had been specified in the agreement, the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=337.84s)]
*  mechanism to achieve them had not yet been agreed. So the way this was structured is that on the 16th [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=345.36s)]
*  day of the first stage of the ceasefire, negotiations would begin on agreeing mechanisms [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=353.36s)]
*  to reach the objectives set forth in the second stage, which I just enumerated. I'm putting the [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=361.76s)]
*  third stage to the side for a moment because that concerned mainly post-war reconstruction. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=366.96000000000004s)]
*  Now from the very outset, basically anyone who had any interest in this issue and had any knowledge [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=374.24s)]
*  of it was explaining that the key obstacle was that the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=381.76s)]
*  for a variety of personal, political, and strategic motives, would not accept to complete or to [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=390.08s)]
*  implement the second stage of the agreement because he did not want a formal cessation of hostilities [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=398.4s)]
*  or a comprehensive Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. And indeed, Netanyahu virtually, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=404.8s)]
*  immediately indicated that he would not accept entering into negotiations on the second stage, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=410.96s)]
*  which was supposed to begin on day 16. And there were a variety of other Israeli violations, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=418.47999999999996s)]
*  foot dragging, not fulfilling commitments, and so on. Hamas, for the most part, did fulfill [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=424.96s)]
*  its commitments. You know, there were a few significant incidents. In one case, they returned [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=432.23999999999995s)]
*  the wrong body of a hostage who had been killed in captivity, but then they returned the right one. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=439.04s)]
*  And so the question was always concerned how the Americans would respond. Would they or would they [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=447.20000000000005s)]
*  not force the Israelis to enter into serious negotiations on the second stage and to implement [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=455.52000000000004s)]
*  the second stage? And this was a broader question. Was Trump merely interested [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=461.84000000000003s)]
*  in having a smooth inauguration or was he genuinely interested in bringing this crisis [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=468.64s)]
*  to a resolution? And what happened is that his Middle East envoy, Whitcoth, rather than once [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=475.59999999999997s)]
*  again reading the riot act to Netanyahu, came with what he called bridging proposals, which basically [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=482.71999999999997s)]
*  met Netanyahu's main demand of indefinitely postponing a formal cessation of hostilities [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=491.44000000000005s)]
*  while ensuring that Netanyahu's main objectives, the exchange of captives, would continue. So it [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=499.20000000000005s)]
*  was basically an extension of the first phase at the expense of the second. Hamas insisted that [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=506.08000000000004s)]
*  whatever bridging proposal it would agree to would have to include negotiations on the second [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=514.08s)]
*  phase. And when Whitcoth wouldn't basically meet Hamas' demands on that part, rather than [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=521.36s)]
*  making the obvious conclusion that this thing is falling apart because Israel is refusing [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=532.0s)]
*  to meet the commitments it had accepted in January, once again the Americans put the [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=537.6s)]
*  illness on Hamas as the ones who rejected the ceasefire proposal and all the rest of it. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=544.08s)]
*  And indeed on the second of March, I'm sorry, I need to point out one more thing that was agreed, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=551.52s)]
*  the other issue that was agreed in this agreement was that at the end of the first phase, so at the [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=558.3199999999999s)]
*  end of 42 days, if the parties, as so long as the parties continued to negotiate, even if they [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=565.04s)]
*  hadn't reached an agreement, there could be no resumption of hostilities by either party. So what [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=573.04s)]
*  did Israel do? On the second of March, which was the day of the conclusion of the first phase, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=579.4399999999999s)]
*  it reimposed a comprehensive siege of the Gaza Strip, cutting off water, fuel, electricity, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=586.24s)]
*  food, basically prohibiting third parties from delivering anything to the Gaza Strip. And then [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=594.64s)]
*  when Whitcoth's bridging proposal, which basically met all of Israel's demands, but not those of the [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=602.08s)]
*  Palestinians, when that was not accepted, Israel resumed with massive raids on the Gaza Strip, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=609.2800000000001s)]
*  over 400 people killed in the space of the first 24 hours, nearly half of them children. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=618.0s)]
*  I believe that was the bloodiest day actually, since Israel began its genocidal military campaign [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=624.8s)]
*  on in October of 2023. So sorry for the convoluted explanation, but I think it's important to [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=633.68s)]
*  understand the pieces of the puzzle in order to see how we got here. There is one other [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=641.2800000000001s)]
*  issue here, which as you may recall, at one point, a second American envoy, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=649.0400000000001s)]
*  Adam Buhler, who has a much more restricted mandate than Whitcoth, he's the envoy for [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=655.36s)]
*  US hostages. In other words, the whole ceasefire package and so on really isn't part of his brief. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=661.84s)]
*  But with the approval of Washington, he traveled to Qatar and in unprecedented meetings held [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=668.2399999999999s)]
*  direct negotiations with Hamas leaders. And then he came out and in order to explain himself to [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=676.0799999999999s)]
*  both the US and the Israeli media, he said, you know, I talked to these people, it's important [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=683.68s)]
*  to understand what the needs and priorities and limits and red lines of the various parties are. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=689.5999999999999s)]
*  And I found that these are not people with horns growing out of their heads, that they were [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=697.44s)]
*  actually, I think the word he used is nice guys. And then he made the unspeakable error of saying, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=702.1600000000001s)]
*  we're the United States, we're not agents of Israel. And we never heard from him again. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=708.8000000000001s)]
*  My initial assessment was that basically, you know, given his restricted mandate, he went there for [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=716.1600000000001s)]
*  a specific reason, he fulfilled his mission. And that's why we no longer heard from him. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=724.0s)]
*  There appears to have been a concerted campaign from his opponents in Israel, of course, and also [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=729.92s)]
*  within the Trump administration to sideline him, at least for the time being. And it's quite possible, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=735.68s)]
*  you know, that Whitcough came to the conclusion he didn't want to experience a similar fate. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=742.88s)]
*  I mean, by the way, that you are never convoluted, that was crucial context. On the question of [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=748.96s)]
*  Donald Trump there, and I mean, again, you alluded to it, do you know, the people shift between, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=754.88s)]
*  you should take him literally, and to it's all just a stream of consciousness, to this is a [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=759.84s)]
*  negotiating bargaining position, you're in Canada, many people would actually say he literally does [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=767.6800000000001s)]
*  want to annex Canada, that's not a joke, it's not a negotiating position, he wants to annex Canada. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=773.84s)]
*  But on the question of Gaza, where he's talking about in practice, what would be the violent [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=778.48s)]
*  removal of the surviving population, which itself would require genocidal violence, it would be an [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=783.36s)]
*  act of genocide, as genocide scholars themselves say, how literally do you take that? And how much [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=788.24s)]
*  do you think that's feeding into Israel's current strategy, the current phase of its genocidal [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=793.12s)]
*  strategy? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=798.8s)]
*  Well, the problem is that you just gave me three or four different options. With any other [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=800.8s)]
*  politician, I would have to respond by telling you I think it's A, but not B, or C is more likely [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=806.16s)]
*  than A. In this case, probably all of them are equally accurate, even though they completely [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=813.52s)]
*  contradict each other. The issue here is that you're dealing with an exceptionally [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=819.6s)]
*  erratic, unpredictable, and impulsive leader who will say and do contradictory things within the [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=825.36s)]
*  space of a single day. And so it's very difficult, I think, to assess anything with confidence. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=834.64s)]
*  Having said that, he did make this Gaza Riviera proposal, then he seemed to pull back on it, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=844.64s)]
*  then he tried to elaborate it in different ways on different days. He may have intended it [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=851.6800000000001s)]
*  seriously. The other thing they say about Trump is that his position at any given moment tends to [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=859.6s)]
*  reflect the immediately preceding discussion he's had. But I think he may have intended it, it may [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=866.6400000000001s)]
*  have been a sock to his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who earlier had proposed something similar [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=876.0799999999999s)]
*  along the lines of, well, we'll try yours first and see how it works. And then I think he was [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=884.24s)]
*  genuinely surprised by the Arab response, because the Arab states, let's not forget, had assumed the [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=889.92s)]
*  position of inner spectators, at best, I should add, for over a year while Israel was systematically [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=898.56s)]
*  slaughtering Palestinians within their own homeland. The difference here is that he was [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=904.3199999999999s)]
*  making a proposal that from the point of view of Arab governments presented a direct threat to their [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=910.0s)]
*  individual and collective national security. The Arab government, the Arab government, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=918.9599999999999s)]
*  was a direct threat to their stability and legitimacy. I can get into the reasons for that later if you want. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=925.84s)]
*  But on that basis, I think it's fair to say that as an American proposal, I won't call it a plan, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=936.96s)]
*  because there never was one. It was more a verbal proposal initiative, if you will. That was still [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=944.4s)]
*  born and dead in the water. But that doesn't make it irrelevant, because what it did do was it once [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=951.44s)]
*  again put mass forcible displacement of Palestinians, primarily in the Gaza Strip, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=957.6s)]
*  but implicitly also from the West Bank. It put it back on the policy agenda. Biden and Blinken had [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=964.72s)]
*  tried something similar in late 2023 and had been rebuffed privately behind closed doors by their [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=970.96s)]
*  key Arab client regimes, but now it's out in the open. Israel has embraced this proposal as kind of [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=977.44s)]
*  giving it a license to now openly not only discuss, but even to plan for the mass forcible expulsion [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=988.48s)]
*  of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, or at least from the Gaza Strip. That doesn't mean it's going [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=997.44s)]
*  to happen in the organized manner in which it's being proposed, and that has primarily to do [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1004.16s)]
*  with the very firm rejection of cooperating with such a scheme by the Arab states, primarily Egypt [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1010.8s)]
*  and Jordan. But the idea that the Israeli government has now established a unit to promote [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1018.64s)]
*  the expulsion of Palestinians and so on, that I think is very alarming, particularly because [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1027.1200000000001s)]
*  there has been no firm international response. I mean, people are taking note of it, maybe here [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1035.92s)]
*  and they're expressing concern about it, but it has been entirely without consequence. I mean, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1042.8s)]
*  you have the new foreign policy supremo of the European Union, Katya Kales, I think her name is, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1047.92s)]
*  basically traveling to Israel, meeting with Netanyahu, who let's not forget is a fugitive [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1057.44s)]
*  from international justice, an indicted war criminal, meeting with him and extolling the [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1063.68s)]
*  closeness of the European-Israeli relationship. Now, to Netanyahu, this sends a clear message, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1071.04s)]
*  do whatever you please, there will be no consequences, your impunity is safe with us. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1077.2s)]
*  Speaking of impunity, Israel Katz, the defense minister, issued a blood-curdling statement. I [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1084.88s)]
*  mean, I know that doesn't narrow it down, given the number of genocidal statements of clear genocidal [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1092.32s)]
*  intent, which have been issued by the Israeli regime. But this one in particular was just very [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1099.04s)]
*  striking because it was addressed to the citizens of Gaza and basically said that if Hamas didn't [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1106.4s)]
*  cooperate, if the demands on Hamas weren't met, then the civilian population would suffer [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1112.96s)]
*  destruction and devastation and death. I mean, it's interesting because he then did another [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1118.72s)]
*  statement a couple of days later saying, we will abide by international law, which is completely [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1124.8000000000002s)]
*  contradictory from a genocidal statement of collective punishment. I don't know if that was [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1130.8000000000002s)]
*  because the Solicitor General of Israel went, can we just calm down for a minute or something? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1134.8s)]
*  Let's do something that contradicts what you just said. But also, he's equally then stating [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1139.92s)]
*  to the people of Gaza that we will annex your land in response to Hamas not meeting in advance. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1145.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, again, that's illegal. It's obviously collective and annexing land full stop is legal [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1151.2s)]
*  in those circumstances or any circumstances like that. I mean, what's your, I mean, because [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1156.64s)]
*  obviously that does speak to impunity. I mean, what do you think, I mean, Israel Katz is regarded [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1160.0s)]
*  even by many Israeli right wingers as a kind of crude vulgar, stupid man, to be honest, as I can [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1163.68s)]
*  tell from reading that wing of Israeli politics. What's your, but what's your, in terms of, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1169.76s)]
*  in financial times, it's been reported that the intention is the new Israeli General Chief, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1175.1200000000001s)]
*  Chief of the General Staff of the Israeli, the IDF, is to force the Palestinian population to [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1182.3200000000002s)]
*  a very small area and control their calories. Really reminiscent of certain dark periods in [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1188.64s)]
*  our history, I would say. But what do you think about all of that together? What that says about [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1195.92s)]
*  their strategy and their impunity? In addition to everything you've said about Israel's [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1199.2s)]
*  defense minister, Israel Katz, he's also the ultimate yes man in Israeli politics. I mean, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1205.5200000000002s)]
*  he's Netanyahu's minion, if ever there was one. So it's not as if he was taking an independent [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1211.9199999999998s)]
*  initiative. We were listening to his master's voice. And this gets back to my earlier point [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1219.76s)]
*  about the key implication of this Trump proposal is not whether you think the Americans are [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1226.1599999999999s)]
*  actually going to implement it or not. Quite clearly they're not, but the space and legitimacy [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1234.56s)]
*  for lack of a better word, that it gives for putting mass forcible expulsion back on the [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1241.44s)]
*  policy agenda. And in this case, Katz openly giving, directing blood curdling genocidal threats [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1248.3200000000002s)]
*  at an entire population, the Palestinians and the Gaza Strip. Now, the subsequent statements, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1256.96s)]
*  I completely agree with you, you know, some lawyer in the defense ministry got a hold of him and said, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1263.6000000000001s)]
*  you better make a clarification or you're going to end up with an arrest warrant like your [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1269.12s)]
*  predecessor, Yoav Gelandt, who's of course, also an international fugitive from justice. But it's [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1273.9199999999998s)]
*  quite clear that Israel is now confident that it can behave as it pleases without any restraints [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1282.08s)]
*  whatsoever. And while I would fully agree with those who would say that Trump is placing no [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1292.6399999999999s)]
*  restraints on Israel whatsoever, I think it would be both wrong and unfair to pretend that this all [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1298.96s)]
*  started in January of 2025. There were no restraints for a year and a half under the Biden administration. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1306.88s)]
*  You know, it's inconceivable to me that any president other than Biden, with his passionate [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1317.2s)]
*  attachment to Israel, a self-declared Zionist and all the rest of it, you know, even the most pro-Israeli [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1324.16s)]
*  predecessors that Biden had, you know, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, you name it. I don't think any of them [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1332.3200000000002s)]
*  would have been as indulgent of Israel as Biden was and would have allowed Israel to operate as [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1338.88s)]
*  free of any restraints whatsoever as the Biden administration did. And that, I think, crucially [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1345.52s)]
*  set the stage for what Trump is now allowing Israel to do. In other words, we need to look [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1352.96s)]
*  for continuities as much as we need to look for changes. In terms of developments at the moment, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1360.72s)]
*  new developments at the moment, which are, I think, a particular interest, which is the eruption of, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1369.84s)]
*  I would say, quite a significant process in terms of size in Gaza against Hamas, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1375.3600000000001s)]
*  particularly actually northern Gaza, which has been particularly ruined by Israel's genocidal [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1382.4s)]
*  onslaught. Many, of course, of those survivors returned to their homes and found annihilation. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1389.1200000000001s)]
*  You know, I've been speaking to Palestinians in Gaza who returned to northern Gaza, and it was [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1396.72s)]
*  a hugely traumatic event. Many of them marched back full of defiance and pride when the so-called [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1402.64s)]
*  ceasefire began and they just were met with horror. I'm just interested, I mean, you know, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1410.24s)]
*  in terms of the, what's your take on the nature of these protests, how significant they are, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1416.8000000000002s)]
*  how much they speak to broader sentiments in Palestinian society in Gaza? [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1424.0800000000002s)]
*  Well, I think these demonstrations are neither insignificant nor transformative. I think it's [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1430.24s)]
*  difficult to get a precise handle on them, exactly how they erupted, what their objectives are, and [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1436.4s)]
*  so on. So far as I've been able to ascertain, and this is speculative, is that they appear to have [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1442.6399999999999s)]
*  started as spontaneous demonstrations in Beit Lahya, in the northernmost area of the Gaza Strip, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1451.6s)]
*  in response to new so-called evacuation orders that were issued towards these people [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1459.12s)]
*  by the Israeli military. And they began as kind of, let's call them anti-war demonstrations, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1466.8s)]
*  directed at no one in particular to call for an end to the war, so if anything, directed at Israel. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1474.32s)]
*  But then also you began to see criticism and condemnation and slogans against Hamas [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1481.84s)]
*  in these demonstrations as well. And then you began to see a number of demonstrations in other [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1492.1599999999999s)]
*  areas of the Gaza Strip as well. So it's quite difficult, I think, to parse out to what extent [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1499.1999999999998s)]
*  these demonstrations are just generalized expressions of opposition to the continuation [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1505.3600000000001s)]
*  of Israel's genocidal campaign, and to what extent they are specifically directed at Hamas, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1514.0s)]
*  and the demand that Hamas end its rule over the Gaza Strip. It appears to be a bit of both, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1520.56s)]
*  but to suggest that this is somehow a popular uprising against Hamas, I think, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1528.48s)]
*  it's very premature given the size and scope of these demonstrations to draw that conclusion. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1534.5600000000002s)]
*  I would make several additional observations, which is that when Israel resumed its genocidal [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1541.2s)]
*  military campaign last week, and I should point out in response to your first question, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1549.52s)]
*  the ceasefire never really took hold because even prior to that, well over 100 Palestinians were [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1558.8s)]
*  killed in various Israeli strikes since January 19th. But anyway, when these large-scale massive [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1565.68s)]
*  bombings resumed last week, Israel seemed to be focusing much more on Hamas political leaders [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1572.72s)]
*  and on Gaza government officials rather than Hamas military leaders and military targets. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1583.84s)]
*  And it seemed to be that an objective was to paralyze Hamas's ability to maintain administration, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1591.44s)]
*  maintain law and order, maintain its own rule and hegemony in the Gaza Strip. And therefore, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1599.92s)]
*  it's quite possible that these demonstrations are in part a response to that of on the one hand, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1608.3200000000002s)]
*  the breakdown of Hamas's governing capacity, and on the other hand, Hamas has been ruling the Gaza [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1617.04s)]
*  Strip hegemonically since 2007. There's been dissatisfaction with Hamas and the Gaza Strip [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1624.48s)]
*  since 2007. So it's hardly a surprise that now, particularly under the current circumstances, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1633.44s)]
*  you would see these kinds of sentiments expressed. But when you now see the government that's [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1639.1200000000001s)]
*  responsible for the genocide, seeking to embrace these demonstrators as their own, quite clearly, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1646.64s)]
*  the main effect is going to be to delegitimize them rather than in any way empower them. And [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1653.68s)]
*  then, of course, there's also a question to what extent Hamas's Palestinian and Arab rivals are [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1659.76s)]
*  encouraging these protests. So you have, for example, Mohammed Dahnan, the former [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1668.72s)]
*  Fatah leader who's now based in the United Arab Emirates, who's still throughout this period since [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1675.28s)]
*  2007, even though he was the main target of Hamas's 2007 seizure of power, has maintained [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1682.24s)]
*  networks within the Gaza Strip and a level of support within the Gaza Strip. Given Abu Dhabi's [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1690.0s)]
*  opposition to the Arab League proposal that came out last month, to what extent is he implicated? [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1695.84s)]
*  To what extent is the Palestinian Authority and Ramallah involved in these demonstrations? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1702.08s)]
*  I'm not saying that those are the only ones. Quite clearly, there is at a certain level of [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1708.16s)]
*  popular dissatisfaction with Hamas. There always has been. I assume it's probably more now than it [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1715.68s)]
*  was in October of 2023. But that's hardly surprising. I mean, how many survivors of [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1723.0400000000002s)]
*  Uradur were marching in the streets saying, Vive la resistance? I suspect not all that many. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1732.8s)]
*  Because we mentioned Fatah there, I did want to ask you about the West Bank. You mentioned Fatah [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1740.88s)]
*  and Ramallah. We've seen their repeated pogroms, hideous pogroms. I mean, obviously, we've seen [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1745.92s)]
*  recently one of the directors, Noah the Land, being targeted. But that is the lived reality of [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1752.64s)]
*  people who obviously haven't had the huge platform he's obviously got because of a Oscar-winning, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1758.64s)]
*  widely lauded film. And we've seen that. I mean, the biggest act of ethnic cleansing there since [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1767.1200000000001s)]
*  1967. I mean, it's just so obviously partly obscured by the horrid Gaza, but obviously also just [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1771.92s)]
*  disinterest by the Western media. I mean, what's your take about what's happening in the West Bank? [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1779.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, there's also this question of annexation. And the reason, of course, they haven't done [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1785.12s)]
*  annexation actually is just because then, I mean, obviously, it's apartheid, but they're just, [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1789.12s)]
*  you would just, they would just declare to the world, this is apartheid. You can't not have, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1793.52s)]
*  might as well just call it an apartheid state themselves at that point. And I mean, there's [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1797.2s)]
*  other ways of annexing it, I suppose, where they just ring fence the Palestinian cities and then [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1801.2s)]
*  just supplicate them. What do you think is going on there? [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1807.84s)]
*  Well, you can compare it to 1947, where in 1947-48, where Israel's priority was getting [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1812.0s)]
*  international acceptance and international legitimacy for the principle of a Jewish state, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1824.9599999999998s)]
*  rather than necessarily how much territory was allotted to that state. So in November 1947, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1831.84s)]
*  the Zionist movement would have accepted the partition resolution, even if it gave only [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1840.3999999999999s)]
*  2% of Palestine for a Jewish state, because it established the principle of the legitimacy [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1844.72s)]
*  of a Jewish state in Palestine. And of course, they dealt with the territorial dimensions later, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1851.76s)]
*  and they still are to this very day. I think Israel is now in a very similar situation, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1857.04s)]
*  where its key priority is getting US recognition of Israeli sovereignty within the West Bank, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1861.6s)]
*  beyond East Jerusalem. And it's unclear, is the United States going to endorse Israeli sovereignty [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1870.08s)]
*  over the Jewish settlements in the West Bank, over Area C in the West Bank, you know, that 60% [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1879.68s)]
*  of the West Bank that remains under exclusive Israeli jurisdiction and has been largely [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1886.0s)]
*  depopulated of Palestinians? Or will it accept comprehensive Israeli annexation of the West Bank? [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1893.68s)]
*  And I think for Israel, the priority is getting the principle of acceptance of sovereignty over [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1902.72s)]
*  any part of the West Bank at that stage, because once you have that precedent, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1911.12s)]
*  then you can expand it. The second thing, of course, is that Israel is now involved in a very [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1915.1999999999998s)]
*  intensive and extensive initiative in the northern West Bank to try to crush it once and for all. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1923.28s)]
*  It has forcibly expelled tens of thousands of people from the Jenin, Turkkare, and Tubas areas. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1933.52s)]
*  It's now active in Nablus. According to some reports, it's engaged in a strategy similar to [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1941.12s)]
*  what it did in the Gaza Strip in the early 1970s, where it basically demolished hundreds of [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1950.48s)]
*  structures in order to broaden the roads in these very densely populated refugee camps so that Israeli [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1958.88s)]
*  tanks and orbit personnel carriers could drive through them at will. According to others, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1967.6000000000001s)]
*  it's engaged in a process of terminal destruction of these refugee camps because it has always seen [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1972.72s)]
*  them as the main focal points of resistance to its continued occupation. And we'll have to see [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1979.8400000000001s)]
*  how that plays out in the coming weeks and months. But again, it's quite right on the one hand to [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1988.32s)]
*  actually look at what Israel is doing and what it is trying to achieve. But in order to understand [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=1995.52s)]
*  that properly, we need to look equally carefully at what Israel's Western sponsors and allies are [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2002.08s)]
*  doing in Washington, in London, in Brussels, because ultimately Israel will only go so far as [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2008.3999999999999s)]
*  it's allowed to go by Washington, by London, by Brussels. When Brussels, Israel's largest trading [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2015.92s)]
*  partner, says either you stop or else, it will stop. When Washington, which is a main supplier [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2023.68s)]
*  of weapons to Israel, says far and no further, it will immediately halt. I mean, look at how simple [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2031.44s)]
*  it was for Witkoff to force Israel into this ceasefire agreement that Biden claimed he was [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2038.16s)]
*  having difficulty getting Israel to accept. So yes, let's indeed focus on Israel's policies and [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2046.96s)]
*  actions, but we need to understand them as Israel responding to a very permissive environment and [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2054.64s)]
*  being allowed to act with total impunity and without any restraint whatsoever. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2063.44s)]
*  I mean, just finally on that, just, I mean, to see how bleak that was, I mean, it's partly [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2069.76s)]
*  just building what you said. I mean, in the coming period, what do you, I mean, the bleak kind of [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2076.7200000000003s)]
*  read would be Israel thinks it has this great window of opportunity now. I mean, what do you [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2083.28s)]
*  think about versus the Trump unpredictability factor, which could throw up some unexpected [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2089.44s)]
*  results, I guess. But what do you think, I mean, do you think at the moment that the likelihood is [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2096.0s)]
*  Israeli impunity, you know, well, as you said, I mean, it prevailed under Biden. What do you think, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2100.56s)]
*  how much do you think the next few weeks and months will be Israel just awfully thinking it can [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2106.2400000000002s)]
*  basically execute plans it always has dreamt of? Well, that's the key question. I mean, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2112.8s)]
*  you have these contradictory forces within the Trump administration. You have one faction for [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2119.28s)]
*  whom, you know, a US war with Iran should have started yesterday. And then you have another [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2126.1600000000003s)]
*  faction, which is perfectly happy with what Israel does, but wants absolutely no further US involvement [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2133.52s)]
*  in the Middle East. No further US direct military involvement, I should add. So you have an Israeli [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2141.2000000000003s)]
*  agenda of seeking to fundamentally transform the strategic environment of the Middle East in its [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2149.2s)]
*  entirety, not just in Gaza, not just in the occupied Palestinian territories, but Lebanon, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2157.3599999999997s)]
*  in Syria, as we've been seeing in Yemen, as we're now seeing, and ultimately, in Iran. And [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2163.6s)]
*  Greg Kallstrom of The Economist recently had a very interesting thread on Twitter based on a period [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2172.7999999999997s)]
*  of time he spent in Washington. And he said, you know, the main issue here is that there's a certain [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2182.08s)]
*  level of, I think chaos was a term he used, but don't quote me on that, in Washington, where you [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2189.52s)]
*  don't really have people in charge enunciating or seeking to implement clear policy. And in this [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2195.76s)]
*  kind of environment where you don't really have anyone in charge calling the shots, that creates [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2205.76s)]
*  opportunities for Israel to do as it pleases and to try to drag the US along with it, even if it's [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2212.48s)]
*  not necessarily the US agenda. I think the key issue to look at in the coming months is how this [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2221.76s)]
*  US-Iranian relationship works out. Will there be negotiations? Will the US forcefully prevent [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2229.5200000000004s)]
*  Israel from either provoking or attacking Iran? And in that context, to what extent will the US [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2238.6400000000003s)]
*  recognize that its bombings of Yemen are of little use and that if it really wants to restore [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2249.76s)]
*  maritime shipping through the Red Sea and the Suez Canal, well, then you need a ceasefire in [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2259.1200000000003s)]
*  the Gaza Strip because nothing else is likely to work. Will it recognize that it urgently needs to [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2263.36s)]
*  reestablish US dominance over Israeli policy and actually implement the January agreement and go [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2271.36s)]
*  to the second stage? At this point, from what we've seen so far, I certainly wouldn't promote [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2280.56s)]
*  optimism. A bleak but necessarily realistic place to end, I fear. Always an honour, honestly. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cWs6oGndo&t=2288.7200000000003s)]
