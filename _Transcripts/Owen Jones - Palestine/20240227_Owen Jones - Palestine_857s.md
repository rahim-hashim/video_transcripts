# Outrage As Gaza Ceasefire Debate Shut Down By Speaker - w. SNP's Stephen Flynn
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [February 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhyFc3ZvkQI)
*  Public opinion on the one hand and what the political and media establishments think on the other,
*  they're often on a collision course. None more so than the Israeli onslaught against Gaza.
*  Now in the latest Yugo Polk, nearly two weeks ago, two-thirds of the UK population backed an
*  immediate ceasefire based on Israel ceasing its military action versus 30% oppose.
*  66% supported a negotiated peace and 45% thought Israel's entire post-October 7 onslaught was
*  unjustified compared to 24% who thought justified. It further showed a steep increase in support for
*  the Palestinian people and more importantly the polling way back in October had already showed
*  overwhelming support for an immediate ceasefire, it had just solidified. But that's not been the
*  position of the two main parties in Westminster, far from it. The Conservatives of government,
*  they've been arming and giving diplomatic support to Israel and Labour has offered political cover
*  for the government, protecting them from public pressure with Keir Starmer even early on supporting
*  the war crime of cutting off water and energy to a civilian population. Now the exception here has
*  been the Scottish National Party whose Westminster leader Stephen Flynn I'm about to speak to.
*  Their national leader and the First Minister of Scotland, Humza Yousaf, has backed a ceasefire
*  and condemned collective punishment within days of all this beginning and last week the SNP brought
*  a motion on one of the very few opposition days, three allotted to the party each year,
*  demanding an immediate ceasefire and condemning Israel for collective punishment. Labour then made
*  clear it would refuse to back any motion accurately describing collective punishment but fearing a
*  huge rebellion within its own ranks introduced its own amendment which it could have done on its own
*  frequent opposition days, 17 a year, a very wordy and verbose amendment replacing immediate ceasefire
*  with a more ambiguous immediate humanitarian ceasefire and stripping out reference to
*  collective punishment. Now according to Parliamentary protocol that shouldn't be called but the Speaker,
*  Lindsay Hoyle, a former Labour MP, defied the advice of the Clerk of the House to overturn precedent
*  with journalists reporting that Labour sources had boasted the Speaker had been blackmailed,
*  that unless he did what he was told by them then Labour would remove him from the chair when they
*  inevitably win the election later this year and Labour MPs allegedly were loudly boasting that
*  Starmer had fixed the Speaker. What this then did was trash the SNP motion so it wouldn't be voted on
*  unlike the Labour amendment even though it was an SNP opposition day and as I say they get through
*  a year unlike Labour 17. Now after a huge backlash the Speaker then solemnly promised
*  he would let the SNP have another debate this week. Let's just hear what he said this week
*  and then the SNP leader Stephen Flynn this week. I would say that we can have an SO24
*  to get an immediate debate. It's my understanding Mr Speaker that SO24 application
*  has not been accepted. The excuse given the government had a statement on the issue
*  incredible. So I start by asking Stephen Flynn his response to the Speaker's decision. Yeah I mean so
*  we should probably go back like two weeks now because it was effectively two weeks ago that
*  the SNP did something unusual and we publicly outlined the fact that we wanted to hold an
*  opposition day on having an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, recognizing the collective punishment
*  of the Palestinian people and also importantly the release of the hostages that Hamas still hold.
*  And so we were very public and open about that and then a week later following a background chat
*  in the corridors of Westminster, Lindsay Hoyle decided that an SNP opposition day should in fact
*  be turned into a Labour opposition day. Now we only get three bites of the cherry every year,
*  the Labour Party gets 17 bites of the same cherry so it's it was a little bit frustrating to say the
*  least and I think most folk who watch will understand why we were a little bit angry
*  about the way that proceedings unfolded. The big part of that that was positive was we did manage
*  to effectively change the Labour Party's position, they dragged their heels for months on even
*  talking about a ceasefire, they eventually said an immediate ceasefire so I was actually quite
*  happy to vote for their amendment but I also wanted the opportunity to vote on our motion which
*  again recognized the collective punishment of Palestinian people. Lindsay Hoyle through his
*  own actions meant that that was impossible, the Speaker of the House of Commons had broken the
*  rules and you know his apology he said to us quite clearly you can have a debate and a vote
*  in a time to come so acting in good faith listening to what he said in the chamber and
*  generally what the Speaker says goes so we acted in good faith put forward a motion for debate
*  yesterday which would have been on ending arms sales to Israel and indeed on making sure the
*  UK votes for an immediate ceasefire at the United Nations. We wanted to move the debate on from where
*  was into a better place into those next steps and having broken his word last week, broken his
*  the rules last week, Lindsay Hoyle chose this week to to break his words and you know that's a pretty
*  dangerous thing for any Speaker to do because he's effectively lied to SNP MPs, he's lied to
*  the entire chamber but in doing so he's lied to the population at large because we're only here
*  to represent them, he's at the heart of our democracy and he's quite clearly not fit for the
*  bullies in. I mean just on that last week Nicholas Swart who's the BBC News, BBC News and I political
*  correspondent reported that Labour sources had briefed that they told the Speaker that in the
*  event of a Labour government which is inevitable essentially he would lose his job unless he did
*  what they said I mean that many people just call that blackmail and in the Times newspaper it
*  reported Labour MPs yelling Keir Starmer's gonna fix the Speaker. I mean it doesn't sound subtle
*  the fact that they would brief this and just shout this doesn't suggest a certain amount of impunity
*  of us but what do you make of that? I mean that sounds like blackmail to most people. Yeah so
*  what actually happened that last Wednesday was we were all ready for debate and the Labour party
*  started filibustering on stuff, I mean Chris Bryant was boasting about the fact he was doing this
*  on Channel 4 just the other night and laughing about the fact that he'd effectively bent the
*  rules. Now he's perfectly entitled to bend those rules because the rules are there to be bent in
*  many respects but he shouldn't have done that by the way to be discussing Gaza. The reason he'd done
*  that was to facilitate time for Keir Starmer to nip into a wee room behind the back of the Speaker's
*  chair which is called the reasons room and I have no doubt that that meeting happened and there are
*  numerous sources who confirm that everyone on the Westminster estate knew that this was happening
*  and that privilege wasn't afforded to me, it wasn't afforded to anyone else to have a quiet chat with
*  the Speaker and as I understand it the clerks who obviously guided the Speaker's decisions were
*  kicked out the room for that discussion to happen with Keir Starmer. So there's obviously been a
*  conversation between the two which has led to Lindsay Hoyle changing his mind breaking all
*  parliamentary rules in order to satisfy the desires of the Labour Party. Now that's worrying
*  to anyone and it should be worrying that a future Prime Minister is willing to effectively bully
*  someone in that regard and you know all the denials are to be expected but I don't think
*  anyone actually believes them. So do you think that Lindsay Hoyle's position is just untenable?
*  Yeah of course it is. I mean you can't change unilaterally change all the rules
*  in Parliament to suit one political party which is what he did and in doing so effectively say to
*  the third largest party which is the Scottish Nationalists party that we don't matter and you
*  know for those of us in the Scottish National Party we're kind of sitting there going so
*  everything that we've been told about Westminster for generations that this is it this is what
*  happens when you come up against a Westminster establishment and you know that's pretty
*  disappointing. It's disheartening and I think for folk particularly watching in Scotland they'll
*  have seen the fact that we've managed to change the Labour Party's position to a certain degree
*  along with the public pressure that's been applied to them. They've seen the fact that we've been at
*  the forefront of this and just when things are getting to a next stage Westminster's
*  sought to close the doors and block us from taking things any further.
*  Just before I finally ask where are you going to take this in the future given this horror
*  unfortunately has a long way to run. What do you make of the fact that in terms of
*  collective punishment that was a key part of your motion last week Robert Peston the ITV news
*  ITV political journalist he said that Keir Starmer specifically and he used the term
*  hated that term that was the big part of the motion that they objected to. What do you make
*  of that and also about the fact that Labour have said they've been calling for a ceasefire for a
*  long time. Obviously been having those conversations in private because I've certainly not been calling
*  it for it publicly I mean I can recall Keir Starmer being on LBC trying to explain to everyone oh I
*  answered the wrong question when he was effectively condoning people being denied access to food and
*  water and medicine and electricity and the ability to leave whilst being shot and bombed. Look I was
*  on a I was on Andrew Marr with David Lamme last week and I got to see first hand David Lamme squirm
*  under questioning from Andrew Marr regarding collective punishment because the Labour party
*  don't want to talk about it but that's what it is. How can it be anything but if you are saying to
*  someone who's been bombed who's being shot at who's been people are being killed under whilst
*  walking under a white flag children being found in the back of cars after having to phone charities
*  for help they're being denied those things are happening to them but they're simultaneously
*  being denied food and water and medicine and the electricity and hospitals and the ability to leave
*  that is collective punishment this couldn't be any more serious which is which is why yesterday
*  we wanted to move things on we wanted to talk about those arms sales as well let's end that
*  why are we still sending arms to one of the most advanced nations in the world and advanced
*  militaries on the planet whilst they're bombarding a civilian population and any politician who calls
*  for an immediate ceasefire is doing so because they recognize the death toll which is and the
*  punishment that's being inflicted on a civilian population that is collective punishment so you
*  can't have one thing and not the other and we're very clear on that and we have been since
*  so just very funny where are you going to take this from now on what's the kind of strategy
*  because you're right labor have been forced to shift their position though you could say
*  the incident you know the u.s etc have shifted as well but i suppose from the position of israel
*  anyone who knows anything about the israeli government knows that the only pressure that
*  works is things like what you raised yesterday the question of arms sales that aren't by britain by
*  the u.s principally but other european states as well diplomatic aid britain has a un security
*  council seat hand-wringing rhetoric doesn't make any difference they can shrug that off they do
*  that over and over again what matters is concrete pressure so what's the sort of kind of you know
*  because labor haven't asked for that have they so what what do you think comes next in terms of the
*  s&p position yes so that that was that was effectively what we tried to do yesterday was to
*  ramp things up so that we would effectively have a meaningful vote to instruct the uk government to
*  go to united nations and next time there's a vote on an immediate ceasefire to vote in favor of one
*  and that's a tangible real step that we could have taken obviously the speaker blocked that from
*  happening and that builds upon trying to stop arms sales to israel but look there's a and i'm going
*  to paraphrase here but there was a quote from jeremy bowen in one of his books about the middle
*  east that i read some time ago now where effectively he talks about two clocks that start as soon as
*  israel starts any military conflict one clock is for the military to undertake what it wants to do
*  and the other clock is is counting down the time before which diplomats effectively in the west say
*  to israel enough is enough now it appears to be that we're getting pretty close to that point
*  that clock is is a way to to run out based upon some of the comments that we've seen from from
*  president biden today but why is it taking five months why is it taking 30 000 dead palestinians
*  civilians why is it taking 70 000 people being injured why is it taking 300 000 people who are
*  in the north of gaza who are living in what even the bbc described as federal conditions why is
*  there 1.5 million people sheltering in raffle which is usually home to 175 000 people why is
*  it taking 60 percent of the buildings to be damaged or destroyed or pretty much all of the
*  agricultural land to be destroyed for the west to say enough is enough and that that is that is so
*  hard to take for all of us who tried to try to be the voice of the voiceless in this tried to
*  genuinely push the debate forward and not let it slip onto the onto the the top shelf which is what
*  west minister would have liked to have happened for the last few months they didn't want to be
*  talking about and they didn't want to be talking about gaza we've kept it on the agenda i'm very
*  proud of my colleagues for for doing that obviously we've been led expertly by homs yousef
*  and all of this given given the devastating situation his his own life family face so
*  you know we've we've we've tried to be as as powerful an ally as we possibly can be for
*  for civilian soldiers in our lives and we'll continue to do that great stuff and i think
*  we can see obviously yousef called condemned collective punishment very early on within days
*  and call for it all the time then um stephen really really appreciate it thanks so so much and um yeah
*  something to keep an eye on certainly in the next few weeks and months but thank you so much
*  cheers i appreciate it thanks man huge thanks to stephen there we've got lots of videos and
*  interviews to come including with other smp politicians but obviously we're going to talk
