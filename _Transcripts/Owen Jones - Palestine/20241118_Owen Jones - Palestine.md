# Amsterdam Mayor I REGRET Claiming Pogrom And Not Denouncing Tel Aviv Thugs' Violence
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [November 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H_ozYgHpoM)
*  I promised you that I wasn't going to let this go, and I'm not going to. I'm going to discuss the
*  latest developments in terms of what actually happened on the streets of Amsterdam on the 7th
*  and 8th of November involving both Maccabee Tel Aviv football fans and local Dutch residents
*  following a Europa League game against Ajax. This was widely described, you will recall,
*  as a straightforward pogrom against Jewish people, an exceptionally serious accusation indeed.
*  In a series of videos, I've looked at how this narrative was riddled with deceit, not least
*  because we had the erasure of racist violence by Tel Aviv-Maccabee hooligans before anything else
*  had happened, including as an Israeli newspaper of old media outlets revealed, there were mobs
*  Tel Aviv-Maccabee fans trying to hunt down Palestinians to beat up on the streets of
*  Amsterdam. There was the targeting of cab drivers. There was attacks on local residents.
*  There were tearing down of Palestinian flags from private homes and then burning them. There was
*  objects thrown at private homes. There were Maccabee fans tooling up with iron bars, masking up
*  and rampaging through the streets. And of course, the chanting and singing of genocidal bile in
*  support of the extermination of Arabs and relishing the slaughter of Palestinian children. Now,
*  I interviewed a Dutch photographer who filmed Maccabee hooligans attacking Dutch residents
*  with several Western media outlets and took that coverage and used it to claim
*  it was the other way around. They presented that footage, which was actually Maccabee aggression
*  against people who were Dutch as evidence of a pogrom against Jewish people.
*  As I also said, that's not to say there is no evidence of antisemitism in the mix of what
*  happens next. There is, and there's never any excuse for hatred against people on the basis
*  that they are Jewish. Never an excuse. The point is Western media outlets and politicians
*  lied to you, blatantly lied to you and gaslighted you up to and including Sky News,
*  releasing an accurate report of what actually happened and then deleting it and replacing it
*  with a dishonest report. Now, the latest developments. The mayor of Amsterdam,
*  Fenke Halsema, was one of those who publicly described what happened as a pogrom. The fact
*  she did was cited as key evidence by Western media outlets and politicians and used to rebut
*  those who questioned the narrative that was presented to us. Now, she has retracts this claim.
*  On the current affairs show, Newsver, as per the translation of the Dutch website, Dutch News,
*  she said she wouldn't again use the word pogrom when discussing the violence and said the word
*  was now being used as, quote unquote, propaganda. She expressed her regret in not discussing
*  what Maccabee supporters did in terms of violence, in terms of their obviously obscene
*  chanting and singing before and after the game. As Dutch News note, it was only later revealed that
*  10 Maccabee fans were actually arrested on the evening of the game with several more on a Dutch
*  police wanted list. Now, this is what she's quoted as saying directly. She said,
*  What I wanted to emphasize was the sadness and fear experienced by Jewish Amphidamists.
*  But I have to say that the following days, I saw how the word pogrom became politicized
*  a lot of propaganda. The Israeli government spoke of a Palestinian pogrom on the streets of
*  Amsterdam and in The Hague, the words were used to discriminate against Moroccan Amsterdamers,
*  Muslims. That is not what I meant or what I wanted. What strikes is the political consequences of the
*  narratives pushed by the Israeli state. The Israeli state used what happened, the claims of what
*  happened, to demand action be taken against organizations in the Netherlands they claimed
*  were linked to Hamas. Now, let's be clear. The Israeli state basically thinks anyone who doesn't
*  toe Israel's line is Hamas. But they backed demands by the far-right leader Gert Wilders.
*  That's the far-right leader in the Netherlands for those involved to be deported. Now, it's very
*  striking, by the way, that the Israeli state very understandably regards the European far-right as
*  its staunchest, most loyal allies, up to including a far-right regime of Viktor Orban in Hungary,
*  which also happens, by the way, to be the most anti-Semitic government in Europe. Again, evidence
*  is proof needed that support for Israel does not correlate actually with opposing anti-Semitism.
*  This then led to calls for dual nationals judged to be guilty of anti-Semitism to be stripped of
*  citizenship, with the events used as a claim that there was a crisis involving the failed integration
*  of second generation Moroccan immigrants, which then nearly brought the entire Dutch government
*  down. Now, here's a familiar pattern of how the question of Israel is used to demonize
*  Muslims in European nations. We see this, frankly, in Germany in very stark ways.
*  Demonized is a hateful, extreme, dangerous enemy within. Now, the mayor of Amsterdam herself
*  expressed anger at how this narrative had come to take hold, and it's striking again,
*  she noted her regret that she did not discuss what Makabe Tel Aviv Houdini did. But what she said now
*  has led to the new Israeli prime minister, Gideon Saad, to say, the statement made by the mayor of
*  Amsterdam is utterly unacceptable. The failure that occurred on that night must not be further
*  compounded by a grave, by a further grave failure, a cover-up. He then restates the claim it was a
*  pogrom. He also says it was used, that word, by the Dutch politicians, including Geert Wilders,
*  as though that's a recommendation. That's the leader of the far right. He's got his own motives
*  here, specifically demonizing the Muslim population. Now, clearly, the Israeli foreign minister is
*  understandably angry on his terms that the narrative, which was dishonestly pushed, is
*  falling apart, not least because here's someone who actually pushed that narrative and is now
*  disowning it. Now, those of us who tried to rebut these claims came under severe, gratuitous,
*  defanatry attack, of course, but the reason it has been so important to stand our ground is precisely
*  because of the reasons outlined by the mayor of Amsterdam, that these incidents are used to
*  demonize Muslims, as well, of course, as to more broadly demonize those who stand against Israel's
*  grave crimes. Now, we keep seeing how Israel and its Western far-right allies are whipping up racism
*  and undermining social cohesion, whilst at the same time claiming the real racists are those who
*  oppose genocide. We can't allow that, even if coming under attack for telling the truth isn't
*  pleasant. It never is, but because the stakes are high, not least for people who lack a voice.
*  Let's listen now to journalist James North and Mark Owen Jones, who did a stellar job, by the way,
*  in combating disinformation. He's an academic who specializes, sorry, James North's a journalist,
*  Mark Owen Jones is an academic who specializes in taking on disinformation, did a great job here.
*  He's interviewed on Al Jazeera, both of them, about this.
*  If you had watched the first report, you would have an idea of what actually happened. And if
*  you've watched the subsequent report, you would have a completely distorted and inaccurate view
*  of what really happened in Amsterdam. People are being gaslit into accepting pro-genocidal,
*  really right-wing narratives, football hooligans, come to a European city and engage in vandalism,
*  violence and racism. In this particular case, the existence of user-generated content has been
*  really helpful. A 16-year-old young Dutch journalist, he essentially followed these
*  Maccabbie Tel Aviv fans, watching them engage in violent acts. That video became a key source
*  for people trying to debunk and counter those mainstream media narratives. But crucially,
*  not only will European leaders and media ignore this, they will lead us to believe that those
*  responsible are the Arabs living in Europe and anyone critical of Israel. And the European leader,
*  Ursula von der Leyen, the mayor of Amsterdam, have all condemned their own population
*  and not the Israeli fascist right who came and committed violence, right? And if we criticise it,
*  not only will we be ignored, we get blamed for condemning that.
*  Well, I think the strategy is very well described here. Clearly, we are meant to be scared into
*  silence. It ain't going to happen. Now, there's a very good piece in the Israeli-Palestinian
*  Plus 972, written by M. Hilton, who I know. She's great. She's one of the leading pro-Palestinian
*  Jewish activists, progressive activists here in the UK, entitled Weaponising Jewish Fear from Tel Aviv
*  to Amsterdam. Now, she denounces attempts to portray what happened as crystal-naked Mark II,
*  including by Netanyahu, denouncing the crassest parallels imaginable, which circulated on social
*  media. These are her words, including memes of Anne Frank wearing a McEmeigh Tel Aviv shirt,
*  which she says takes the debasement of Jews' persecution at the hands of the Nazis and their
*  allies to new levels. She points to how scholars of anti-Semitism genocide and Jewish history warned
*  of how particularly dramatic episodes in Jewish history used to justify Israel's onslaught on Gaza
*  and crackdown on those opposing it, points out how the word pogrom only served to obscure the reality
*  by creating mass hysteria. Now, she puts this in a broader context, which we all need to be discussing,
*  a tactic being deployed by the far right to generate chaos, as she puts it, and fear to
*  reassert its worldview. And the far right, well, it's on the rise everywhere, isn't it? She says,
*  and I quote, the erasure of the racist violence of McEmeigh Tel Aviv fans through negligent reporting
*  by much of the mainstream media only accelerated in this instance. At a time when genuine anti-Semitism
*  is on the rise and Jewish people feel particularly under threat around the world, this instrumental
* isation of Jewish fear was especially galling. Now, as she notes, that doesn't mean there wasn't
*  anti-Semitism in Amsterdam after the behaviour of the McEmeigh fans, which was raised in terms of the
*  order of events, but we have to always oppose and condemn that. There's never an excuse for that,
*  ever. There were people shouting cancer jeez during attacks on McEmeigh fans. The movement
*  for Palestinian justice is one driven by justice and those expressions are hatred. Now, she goes
*  on to point out that Israel continually declares its raging war on Palestinians in the name of
*  Jewish safety, with enthusiastic support, she says, of prominent Jewish establishment organisations
*  around the world. And she says it feels inevitable that slippage between anti-Israel hostility and
*  anti-Semitism will occur. Now, clearly as a Jewish person, she's not victim blaming there. She makes
*  clear that violence directed against Jewish people justified by anything but by Israel's
*  genocidal onslaught is obviously unacceptable. It needs to be fought. The point she's making is
*  Israel's behaviour, as she says, is making Jewish people around the world less safe. This really is
*  such a crucial point. The demarcation between the Israeli state on the one hand and Jewish people on
*  the other, that demarcation has to be partially defended. It is completely wrong to use the
*  genocidal behaviour of the Israeli state to attack Jewish people as a whole, to spread bigotry and
*  prejudice. We have to fight that. What is so striking is it is Israel and its cheerleaders
*  who keep trying to trust that demarcation. What they're trying to do is suggest that if you
*  attack what the Israeli state is doing, its genocidal behaviour, then you are attacking
*  Jewish people and you're being anti-Semitic and you are therefore inciting hatred against
*  Jewish people. They're trying to intentionally, willfully conflate. It is very clear that some of
*  them are doing this on purpose in the belief that it will lead some to take their rage at what Israel
*  is doing and turn it into hatred of Jewish people. The very direction it should not go in. In doing so,
*  as M. Hilton discusses, making Jewish people feel less safe and cementing a sense of Israel being a
*  necessity to protect them. A life raft that always exists if all else goes wrong. And to discredit
*  the movement for Palestinian liberation, which as I say is based on justice, not hatred. That doesn't
*  mean by the way we don't hold people to account who, rather than take on Israel's crimes and
*  support Palestinian justice on the basis of right for justice and go in the direction of hatred,
*  that we don't say they have agency. Of course, we all have agency and you still have to fight that.
*  But she's talking there about the context which we have to look at both in terms of to stop hatred
*  being ripped up against Muslims and Arab people for a start. To stop the attempt to hold Israel
*  to account for what it's doing being shut down. And because it's conflating Jewish people and
*  the Israeli state with very irresponsible consequences. Now, as we've seen in Amsterdam,
*  the truth matters. We must vigorously oppose attempts by the Israeli state and its cheerleaders
*  to turn reality on its head. We'll keep doing that on this channel. That's my promise. Please
