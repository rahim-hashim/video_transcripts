# Israel 'Ethnic Cleansing' Gaza ADMITS Ex-Army Chief and Netanyahu Ally
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [November 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pe-tlc3AKA)
*  He's the former chief of staff of the so-called Israeli Defense Forces.
*  He's the former Israeli Defense Minister who served under Benjamin Netanyahu for three years.
*  He's an Israeli right-winger guilty of war crimes, who back in 2009 even turned down an invitation to visit Britain
*  after being warned he might be arrested for having committed some of those war crimes.
*  But Moshe Yalom has, in a speech, said the truth.
*  Here is a clip from that speech, translated by the anonymous and ever-excellent anti-Zionist Israeli activist who goes by the Twitter handle
*  I really hate you.
*  I'll discuss this clip after you've had a watch and a listen.
*  Transfer, call it whatever you want.
*  And sit down, he's a Jew again.
*  This is the matter.
*  Now we're looking at the records, 70% in most areas, sometimes more, sometimes less, two thirds,
*  of the population in the State of Israel, a figure, on the other hand,
*  also a liberal, democratic Jew, and so on, also a refugee.
*  And therefore, here we must not be confused, because the one who wants to confuse us is the one who leads us, at the moment,
*  to no less than a refugee.
*  You said, uh, like, a bunch of words that I didn't think I'd ever hear from you.
*  Ethnic description in the Gaza Strip, is that what you think we're on our way to?
*  Why on the way? What's going on there?
*  What's going on there?
*  There's no shelter, no hospital, we're currently operating in Jebaliah.
*  And we're actually clearing the area from the Arabs?
*  Now, it really is emphasizing the politics of this man.
*  Avner Giroliu, a former IDF soldier turned peace activist and executive director of the NGO Breaking the Silas,
*  declares, this is, of course, accurate, but very surprising, coming from him.
*  On one level, some of you might reasonably go, why do we need to point to these statements at all?
*  The fact that Israel is committing war crimes is simply an inarguable fact.
*  It's as obviously true as water being wet, the sky being blue, gravity existing.
*  We could go on.
*  Israeli leaders and officials repeatedly made clear they were going to commit war crimes from the very start, in their public pronouncements.
*  They have then committed these war crimes every single day.
*  Many of them live streamed every single day.
*  We can see they have ethnically cleansed Gaza because they have ordered the people to leave northern Gaza and they have imposed a total siege there
*  and then used hideous violence and multiple war crimes to force those who have survived to flee.
*  On the 6th of November, the IDF publicly declared that Palestinians will not be allowed to return to their homes in northern Gaza.
*  In other words, ethnic cleansing.
*  Now, it matters because there could be no hiding places for those who help facilitate this crime, in word or deed or both.
*  Even the former head of the Israeli army, the former defence minister of Netanyahu no less, publicly declares this is ethnic cleansing.
*  We said what would happen from the very start and we were smeared and attacked for doing so.
*  On the 13th of October, I tweeted, Israel is now planning the mass ethnic cleansing of Palestinians.
*  It is not remotely practical, even if it was ethical for Gaza's population to flee their homes en masse.
*  This is collective punishment, a massacre, all with the direct approval of Western governments.
*  Two days later, I tweeted about the cheerleaders of Western bloodbaths in the 21st century and I said,
*  they browbeat us every time with, we have to do something.
*  Critics were monstered as useful idiots for the Taliban and Saddam Hussein.
*  Well, how many would now look back at Afghanistan and Iraq and think, well, thank God we did something.
*  I added, now these sage moderates cheer on ethnic cleansing and avert war crimes because Israel has to, in quotes, do something.
*  Look back at what doing something means.
*  You know what it means. You watched it happen. It means death on an unimaginable mass scale.
*  And for what? And then I said, this insanity has to stop.
*  They have to be held to account. They are not moderates.
*  They are extremists who have the blood of millions of people on their hands.
*  They're now cheering on something, which if it was Slobodan Milosevic doing it, they would be calling genocide.
*  And indeed, if we don't hold them to account, as they said, this is what I said at the time,
*  if we don't hold them to account for what will go down as one of the great crimes of the 21st century,
*  then as Gaza is flattened and thousands slaughtered, they will march, unfazed, onto the next crime scene.
*  And finally, I concluded we were right about Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.
*  There is no consolation to be had from those killing fields,
*  because the only point of that horrendous vindication was to stop it happening again.
*  This time, don't let them get away with it, or this horror will endlessly repeat.
*  The point isn't to go, I told you so, in order to pat ourselves on the back
*  and tell the world how smart we are like we won some public school debating society competition.
*  It's because the scale of the crime being committed by the Israeli state is simply too big
*  and will be recognised as a historical abomination, as I was saying there from the start,
*  that many of its apologists will try and claim that somehow they weren't to know.
*  We're living evidence that this excuse is a lie.
*  We knew what would happen, not because we're prophets, not because we're geniuses,
*  not because of some special insight, but because we listened to what Israeli leaders and officials said.
*  We looked at, we listened to the evidence with our eyes and our ears
*  and arrived at the only conclusion justified by the evidence.
*  We were told by the Israeli state over and over again they were going to commit war crimes.
*  They then committed those war crimes over and over again.
*  As I speak, they're committing war crimes.
*  This was all inevitable from the start because of what they said they were going to do.
*  Now I want to end with an interview or quoting from an interview
*  with the Israeli historian Adam Raz in the Israeli Palestinian media outlet Plus 917 magazine
*  in which he rightly calls Israel's onslaught a genocide.
*  He says, and I quote,
*  When World War II ended in 1945, the concentration camps opened
*  and the world was exposed to the most brutal form of extermination in history.
*  I think something of this kind will happen when the gates of Gaza are opened.
*  When that happens, the Israeli public will need to decide which road they're going to take.
*  Responsibility or denial?
*  I believe they will choose denial.
*  And this is why I think Netanyahu won the war.
*  I think there's a lot of truth in that, although Israel will undoubtedly do all it can
*  to suppress the physical evidence of its crime.
*  We must not allow that. We must document every atrocity we can.
*  And the Israeli public, the Israeli people, the courageous, truly courageous exceptions aside,
*  must be forced, like all the societies before them,
*  to confront the horror that has been unleashed against the victims of genocide.
*  But this is the point.
*  No crime in history of such a scale has been so confessed to and so evidenced as it was actually happening.
*  And as these latest comments by the former head of the Israeli army,
*  the former defense minister of Benjamin Netanyahu underline,
*  there is no hiding place for those who facilitated one of the worst crimes of our age.
