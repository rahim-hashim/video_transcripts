# UK Diplomat RESIGNS Over Israeli War Crimes - And UK Complicity
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [August 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZGjmLOMoUg)
*  Mark Smith, an official in the British Foreign Office, has resigned in protest at the continued
*  arms sales by the British government to the State of Israel. This matters. It matters a lot.
*  In his letter of resignation, first revealed by the journalist Hind Hassan, he declared
*  he could no longer carry out his duties in the knowledge that this department may be complicit
*  in war crimes. He says he's a former penholder on the Arms Exports Licensing Assessment in Menad,
*  the Middle East and North Africa Directorate, and says he's a subject matter expert in the domain
*  of arms sales policies. He says specifically, each day we witness clear and unquestionable examples of
*  war crimes and breaches of international humanitarian law in Gaza perpetuated by the
*  State of Israel. He adds that senior members of the Israeli government and military have expressed
*  open genocidal intent. Adds further, Israeli soldiers take videos deliberately burning and
*  destroying and looting civilian properties and openly admitting to the rape and torture of
*  prisoners. He goes on to highlight that over half of Gaza's homes and over 80% of commercial properties
*  have been damaged and destroyed, that whole streets and universities have been demolished,
*  humanitarian aid is being blocked, civilians left with no safe quarters to flee to. He notes that
*  Red Crescent ambulances have been attacked, schools and hospitals are regularly targeted.
*  Summing up, these are war crimes. He goes on, there is no justification for the UK's continued
*  arms sales to Israel and yet somehow it continues. He says he's raised it at every level of the
*  Foreign Office, including through an official whistleblowing investigation and all he's had
*  back is a thank you, we have noted your concerns. Damningly, he says that while ministers claim the
*  UK has one of the most robust and transparent arms exports licensing regimes on earth, that this is
*  the opposite of the truth. He believes having raised serious concerns of illegality in the
*  department, which are disregarded in this way, that this is deeply troubling. Now let's listen
*  to him being interviewed on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. For everybody watching their TV screens
*  now, what we can see are appalling acts of violence perpetrated on civilians, on civilian property
*  and so on. Most people I think watching that would think that is absolutely horrendous. For me
*  personally, my profession or former profession as of last week was to advise the government on
*  the legality of arms sales and when you look at what constitutes a war crime, it's actually
*  quite clear even from what you see in open source on the TV that the state of Israel is perpetrating
*  war crimes in plain sight. Anybody who has a kind of basic understanding of these things can see that
*  there are war crimes being committed, not once, not twice, not a few times,
*  but quite flagrantly and openly and regularly. Did you raise this internally, this view? Yes,
*  so I raised it with the new Foreign Secretary and I raised it at pretty much every level
*  in the organisation. That's my duty and that would be quite normal I think for
*  public servants. We're very used to upholding the law and so we would normally raise things internally
*  that we might have a question over, particularly if we have subject matter specialism as I do,
*  so I raised it internally. And how did the Foreign Secretary respond? I'm not at liberty to kind of
*  go into detail about exactly how that internal process went, but I resigned from my role
*  and I resigned because of this issue. So you can put the pieces together but suffice it to say that
*  the response was not satisfactory. So as he notes here, diplomatically, he is of course a former
*  diplomat, the response he's got after raising this at the very highest level up to and including the
*  Foreign Secretary is not satisfactory. Now a few things here, it's extremely rare for a British
*  official of this sort to resign in these circumstances, ending their career as they know it
*  and then putting themselves out there, something they would never have expected in the job that
*  they have. Not least, it should be said, the context which is important here, the viciousness
*  to which critics of the Israeli state are subjected to. He's clearly only done this because of the
*  gravity of the crime. Now this also exposes that changes in government policy which have come about
*  with a change in government require a big health warning, a big caveat. We know that the government
*  has rightly dropped the spurious legal objection lodged by the British Senate government to the
*  International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor's request for arrest warrants against Benjamin Netanyahu
*  and his defense minister as the bare minimum, just accepting international law, not trying to obstruct
*  international law and as a result, Benjamin Netanyahu snubbed the Foreign Secretary David
*  Villami but they failed to publish the last government's legal advice which would reveal
*  what they have adjudicated on the question of Israel committing war crimes and crimes against
*  humanity which legally necessitates ending weapons sales. We were told that the UK government was
*  going to end arms sales to Israel but then told that this wouldn't happen for a long time because
*  it would only be a ban on offensive rather than defensive weapons as if that clear delineation
*  could happen and as the campaign against the arms trade point out, it was meaningless without banning
*  exports of components of F-35 combat jets. So the UK government under Labour and Kirsten
*  to arm Israel as it commits flagrant war crimes every day in plain sight, it is therefore complicit
*  in what should be regarded as one of the worst crimes of our age. Now here's another reason why
*  the likes of Mark Smith resigning is so important, it must be made clear at a future date that there
*  were no excuses. Ignorance cannot be claimed, people, particularly those in power, must not
*  be allowed to say we didn't know what was really happening, we know exactly what's happening
*  because these obscene war crimes are being committed every day knitted together by as
*  Mark Smith notes the genocidal rhetoric of Israeli leaders which crucially exposes their intent. As
*  Rassigal, the Israeli-American associate professor of genocide and Holocaust studies pointed out,
*  he pointed this out back in October, back at the very start, it is extraordinarily rare
*  for intent to be so explicitly stated. We could not have more evidence. From the very beginning,
*  Israeli leaders and officials made it clear what they were going to do. The most clear predictor
*  of what was going to happen, the kind of, what foreshadowed what would happen, what told us what
*  was going to happen, was what Israeli leaders and officials said they were going to do from the very
*  start. They said it and then they did it. And we have more, ever since, documented evidence of these
*  war crimes and crimes against humanity than practically any atrocity ever committed in the
*  history of human civilisation. It is being live streamed to us every day. There is no subtlety,
*  it is there before our very eyes. Now, this is an important point because this knowledge,
*  of course, goes for the British government. They are aiding and abetting these heinous crimes,
*  despite having all the evidence. As Mark Smith notes, what we can see from the public domain
*  is sufficient, but the way he speaks suggests that's on top of information in the private domain.
*  But the point he's making is you don't need that private information because it's so obvious based
*  on what we have in public. We've got to hold them to account for that. I would know that the
*  International Centre of Justice for Palestinians, set up by lawyers and academics, is raising money
*  to take politicians to court for their complicity in this grave crime of historic proportions.
*  Now, Mark Smith has done a great service. He has shown great courage. Others must follow his
*  example. You know what's happening. You know the extent of the depravity of the scale of the crime.
*  You know our government has helped facilitate this monstrous crime from day one. Do you too
*  want to be complicit? If not, then speak out. Yes, you may fear consequences, but those
*  consequences are nothing compared to the fate of the Palestinian people. We are watching the genocide
*  of a people being live streamed every day. If we have any power, any power at all to do something,
*  anything about that, it is incumbent on us all to use it. Better that than to be tortured for the
*  rest of our lives by the knowledge that we did not do what we could in the face of one of the
*  worst horrors of our age. Please like and subscribe. Do you have your thoughts and your comments?
