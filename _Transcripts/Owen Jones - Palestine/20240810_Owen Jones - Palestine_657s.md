# Israel MASSACRES School - Because It Can
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [August 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0)
*  Never get used to this. Never normalise this. Never stop being shocked. As I speak, around [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=0.0s)]
*  100 Palestinians are believed to have been killed in a school in Gaza, but who even knows [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  what the final death toll will be. Slaughtered in a school, dozens of them women and children, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=12.92s)]
*  but also many men, who have committed no other crime than being Palestinian. Now as many [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=18.88s)]
*  slept in your beds, these Palestinian civilians were being burned to death. Some instantly [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=24.52s)]
*  killed, some suffering excruciating terrifying deaths. It came just after hours of Joe Biden's [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=30.6s)]
*  administration releasing six and a half thousand munitions and providing Â£3.5 billion worth to buy [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=39.400000000000006s)]
*  more bombs. And you have to wonder, you have to wonder don't you, whether these two things are [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=47.32s)]
*  related. The Israeli state, knowing as it is that it's protected by impunity, by the support [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=53.0s)]
*  of the USA, thinks it can get away with anything. And guess what? So far it has. We need to talk [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=60.12s)]
*  about this. We need to talk about this a lot. But first, let's listen to a report from Al Jazeera's [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=66.2s)]
*  Hany Mahmood about what happened and the context. And this is the fifth school in a row. That's an [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=71.4s)]
*  average of one school every two days and every school, apart from the fact that it's designed [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=77.72s)]
*  as a learning setting, not equipped, not prepared for large number of people in terms of sanitation, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=83.4s)]
*  hygiene, in terms of space. A thousand students maximum, or a couple thousand in larger areas. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=88.84s)]
*  But six thousand, seven thousand people crammed in a small space, sheltering from the horror of [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=94.36s)]
*  the war. And that's the case of this school, Taberin school in a Darj neighborhood in the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=99.56s)]
*  northern eastern part of Gaza city, where close to one hundred people were killed and dozens of [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=105.56s)]
*  other injuries that arrived to the hospital. Up till this moment, there's still more people [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=114.84s)]
*  being removed from the bombed sites and eighty bodies so far have been identified. There are [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=119.8s)]
*  twenty left that without any identification whatsoever right now. These are the twenty of [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=126.68s)]
*  intact bodies. But the horrific fact, there are at least an estimation of fifteen bodies that arrive [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=132.36s)]
*  in pieces, completely shredded. They either arrive in plastic bags or they were wrapped in a blanket [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=139.8s)]
*  just to get them to the hospital. There is no way to identify these bodies whatsoever. Family [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=146.36s)]
*  members who had other family members or children or relatives inside this school sheltering arrived [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=153.8s)]
*  to the Baptist Hospital to identify the bodies. But just the severe burns, the fact that they [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=161.4s)]
*  arrive in pieces make it very difficult for them to identify. They're looking for every possible [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=168.04000000000002s)]
*  sign. It could be a mark on the body or from the shape of certain body parts to identify them. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=174.04000000000002s)]
*  And this is the level of what people are reaching in order to identify these bodies and then offer [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=181.4s)]
*  them a proper burial. But this is not happening. All of this happened without any prior warning. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=187.08s)]
*  Anyone with a bit of logic would imagine that a situation like that would be many precautionary [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=193.64000000000001s)]
*  steps are taken to avoid this large civilian casualties. But judging from what happened and [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=201.8s)]
*  from the past incidents, the Israeli military is not interested in cutting down on the level [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=208.04000000000002s)]
*  of civilian casualties. It looks more of a deliberate attacks. It's more of a wholesale [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=214.44s)]
*  of civilian of civilian mass killing of civilians across the Gaza Strip. And it didn't happen once. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=220.84s)]
*  It happens more than one time. How can Israel be so brazen, so wanton it's salty may ask. And the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=228.12s)]
*  simple answer is it knows it can get away with almost anything because it has the support, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  patronage and assistance of the world's only superpower. Now the idea had spread, has spread [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=237.24s)]
*  their usual propaganda about Hamas and Islamic Jihad commanders operating in the school. First [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=243.32s)]
*  of all, just take this on its own terms under international law, under the laws of war, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=248.92s)]
*  you cannot simply blow up civilian infrastructure full of civilians and knowingly kill huge numbers [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=252.68s)]
*  of civilians. Any attack has to be proportionate to a military aim. They claim that these Jihadis, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=258.36s)]
*  Hamas or Islamic Jihad were using the compound to carry out terrorist attacks. Where? Where exactly? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=264.68s)]
*  In Israel, where are all the Hamas and Islamic Jihad attacks on Israel since the 7th of October? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=271.08s)]
*  What possible imminent threat to Israeli civilians can be claimed to justify wiping out dozens [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=275.88s)]
*  of Palestinian civilians? We also know from the work of, for example, the Israeli-Palestinian [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=281.64s)]
*  media outlet, plus 972 magazine, that the Israeli state routinely justifies hitting targets. It knows [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=286.59999999999997s)]
*  where there are huge numbers of civilians, including on the basis of a single Hamas [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=295.79999999999995s)]
*  commander, including low-level Hamas commanders. However, they have actually defined that. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=299.96s)]
*  In any case, we know that the Israeli authorities lie and lie and lie and lie again. After each of [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=305.23999999999995s)]
*  these atrocities, they lie, they deflect, they muddy the waters, they turn the truth upside down, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=314.12s)]
*  they gaslight, they hope everyone moves on and then eventually the truth comes out when attention [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=318.84s)]
*  is elsewhere in many cases. This has happened again and again and again and again. Now in a [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=323.24s)]
*  previous attack on a school, there have been so many attacks on schools of course, they released [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=327.16s)]
*  a list of supposed Hamas fighters. And do you know what? One of those they named included an [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=332.6s)]
*  eight-year-old Palestinian boy. Israel has attacked school after school after school. Schools where [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=337.64000000000004s)]
*  Palestinian civilians who have been forcibly displaced over and over and over again are [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=343.24s)]
*  sheltering because there is nowhere safe in the killing fields of Gaza. This is a genocide. The [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=347.32000000000005s)]
*  strategy of the Israeli state is that they do not want the Palestinian people to be there, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=354.04s)]
*  to exist. They think that the Palestinian people are an inherent problem and they work backwards [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=358.52000000000004s)]
*  from that point. But with the limits imposed by Western public opinion turning on the Western [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=364.76000000000005s)]
*  states, which provide Israel with the arms, diplomatic support and aid it needs to continue [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=369.16s)]
*  its murderous occupation and oppression and its genocide in Gaza. Based on the limits there, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=373.96000000000004s)]
*  it has achieved an astonishing amount. It has butchered tens of thousands. We don't know how [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=379.48s)]
*  many. We know that in these situations it's not the violence which kills most people, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=384.68s)]
*  it's other causes like the total destruction of the healthcare system. For example, imagine in say [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=389.32s)]
*  Britain or the US, every single hospital was destroyed without there even being a war at the [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=394.6s)]
*  same time. An invasion. That itself would impose a catastrophic death toll on our nations. That's why, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=398.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean that's just one factor, we've had one estimate of senior medical experts [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=406.76s)]
*  who sent in their estimate to the Landseer magazine, the most prestigious health magazine [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=413.48s)]
*  publication on earth. They estimated 186,000 Palestinians already killed out of a pre-war [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=417.96s)]
*  population in Gaza around 2.2 or 2.3 million. Gaza is being made deliberately inhospitable. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=425.15999999999997s)]
*  Its people are being terrorized. The basis of the strategy is to make Gaza a place which in [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=430.84s)]
*  the long term is emptied of the Palestinian people. Now look, I am glad that Joe Biden is [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=435.56s)]
*  not going to be the Democratic nominee. He is a monster, a butcher who has facilitated one of the [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=441.0s)]
*  great crimes of our age. This genocide was made possible by that man and his administration. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=445.72s)]
*  And I understand the great danger and evil posed by Donald Trump and that includes the threat he [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=450.76s)]
*  poses himself to the Palestinian people. But let me just replay how Kamala Harris, now the [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=455.48s)]
*  Democratic nominee, responded to anti-genocide protesters in Detroit, Michigan the other day. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=460.68s)]
*  Now some responded to that by going, yes Queen, she showed them, much presidential, ra ra ra. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=480.52s)]
*  I'll tell you, I was disgusted by it and everyone who cheered that on is lower than Pondlife. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=485.56s)]
*  They don't think Palestinians are human beings. They can't do. You wouldn't respond like that [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=489.64s)]
*  if you did. How messed up do you have to be to cheer that on? There are people protesting here, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=493.32s)]
*  those people protesting. Kids being incinerated in schools. That's what they were yelling about. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=498.12s)]
*  They were yelling about the mass slaughter of the Palestinians facilitated by US administration, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=503.96s)]
*  which includes the vice president Kamala Harris. Now she had a better response to protesters in [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=509.96s)]
*  Arizona where she spoke about respecting them. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=515.56s)]
*  Get a ceasefire deal and get the hostage deal done. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=545.56s)]
*  Now is the time and the president and I are working around the clock every day to get that [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=555.0799999999999s)]
*  ceasefire deal done and bring the hostages home. So she clearly knew that insulting a large [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=563.4799999999999s)]
*  swathe of her base was a big mistake and indeed the polling shows that a large majority of [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=573.48s)]
*  democratic voters believe Israel is committing genocide, but the formulation she's using there [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=577.48s)]
*  is pretty much the same as Joe Biden. Which is talking about getting a ceasefire deal and [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=582.6800000000001s)]
*  the hostage is out. That's been the same formulation. It hasn't achieved anything [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=589.0s)]
*  other than continued mass slaughter. Unless the US puts active pressure on Israel, including not [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=593.72s)]
*  providing it with weapons to murder people, this will never stop. Now I know US progressives are [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=601.4s)]
*  just desperate to stop Trump. I get that. But pressure has to be brought on Kamala Harris. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=607.0s)]
*  She can't just bank people who oppose genocide and therefore think she has no incentive to do [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=611.9599999999999s)]
*  anything about that. This is one of the great atrocities of our age. It is a genocide facilitated [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=617.0799999999999s)]
*  from the start by the US administration. And I know now with Biden gone, there was a sense of [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=623.4s)]
*  excitement among many in the United States about the possibility of stopping Trump. But don't throw [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=630.04s)]
*  the Palestinian people under a bus. They have been butchered in great numbers every single day. And [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=636.04s)]
*  unless pressure is brought on whoever ends up in the White House, then that mass murder, that [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=641.64s)]
*  genocide will never stop. Please like, please subscribe. Please leave your comments, your [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWkCQOJptV0&t=647.0799999999999s)]
