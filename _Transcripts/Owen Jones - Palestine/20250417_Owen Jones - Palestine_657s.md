# Secret Israel Meeting COVERED UP By UK Media
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o)
*  Why has the media covered this up? On Tuesday, the Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=0.0s)]
*  met with the British Foreign Secretary David Lammy in London. Yet you would only know about [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=5.12s)]
*  this visit to the UK by the Israeli Foreign Minister if you read Middle East Eye, which [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=10.24s)]
*  is where you often find stories much of the rest of the media ignore. Middle East Eye also [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  revealed, based on their sources, that the trip would be unannounced. Why cover it up? Saar, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=20.56s)]
*  as Middle East Eye notes, justified Israel's decision to cut off aid to Gaza. That is a total [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=27.44s)]
*  blockade stating aid that goes to Hamas is not humanitarian. Well, this is simply a rationale [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=33.6s)]
*  for the gravely illegal act of collective punishment prohibited by Article 33 of the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=39.84s)]
*  Geneva Convention because this is justifying a total blockade in Gaza, which was instituted [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=45.6s)]
*  on the 1st of March, which has led to the bakeries of Gaza closing and now supplies which entered [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  during the ceasefire running out. Bear in mind, Israel has destroyed agriculture and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=56.96s)]
*  food production in Gaza. As Middle East Eye know, this Foreign Minister opposes any Palestinian [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=61.44s)]
*  state, declaring, creating a Palestinian state today would be tantamount to creating a Hamas [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=67.36s)]
*  state. Well, here's maybe one reason why there's been an attempt to hide Gideon Saar's visit. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=72.48s)]
*  Because as Middle East Eye's Imran Mullah also pointed out, arrest warrants were sought both by [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=78.64s)]
*  UK based Global Legal Action Network, that is GLAN, and the Hind Rajab Foundation. That's [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=85.12s)]
*  the foundation which is seeking to prosecute those guilty of war crimes. It's named after the five [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=91.44s)]
*  year old little Palestinian girl who was slaughtered alongside her family as well as a paramedic sent [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  to save her. That's because of allegations against Saar, who's obviously one of the leading members [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=102.08000000000001s)]
*  of the Israeli government, about aiding and abetting torture and severe breaches of international law. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=106.88000000000001s)]
*  According to GLAN, the Global Legal Action Network, the charges focus on his role in the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=112.8s)]
*  siege of Kamal Adnan Hospital in Gaza, which culminates in its destruction December last year, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=117.84s)]
*  as well as the abduction and torture of Dr. Hussam Abou Safiya, the director of the hospital, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  who was taken hostage by Israel. They also killed his son. Now, they've submitted a request directly [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=128.0s)]
*  to the British Attorney General and Director of Public Prosecutions to apply for consent in order [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=133.44s)]
*  to secure such an arrest warrant. Now, Giriad O'Queen, GLAN's director, said, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=139.28s)]
*  Mr. Gideon Saar is directly linked to mass death, destruction, suffering in Palestine. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=144.96s)]
*  We've submitted extensive evidence detailing his role in and awareness of this. UK officials are [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=149.6s)]
*  failing to abide by the law by offering handshakes instead of handcuffs. This is why we have asked [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=154.88s)]
*  the courts to urgently step in. Last night, GLAN put out a specific statement saying, Urgent, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=160.72s)]
*  we are told that Gideon Saar is now cutting short his visit and fleeing the UK. He's a suspect [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=167.12s)]
*  in a live investigation of serious crimes. If seen, contact the London Met Police immediately. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  Please do not approach the suspect as he's likely accompanied by armed security. Well, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  the International Criminal Court have, of course, already issued arrest warrants for the Israeli [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=180.96s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence minister, Yoav Gallant, last November. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=184.96s)]
*  That was for war crimes and crimes against humanity, particularly centring on starvation. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=189.28s)]
*  It's very likely those charges will be added to and that more Israeli politicians and military [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  officers and soldiers will also face arrest warrants. Indeed, these arrest warrants might [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=200.4s)]
*  not be made public. There's no compulsion for the ICC to make the arrest warrants public at all. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=205.68s)]
*  They can be issued privately. But look, the West is determined to destroy what remains [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=210.8s)]
*  of the already tattered and hypocritical international legal order so as to protect [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=215.52s)]
*  Israel against accountability for war crimes with the ICC's signatory states coming out to say [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=221.12s)]
*  they won't enforce the arrest warrants such as Italy, France and Poland. Indeed, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  Hungary's regime just hosted Benjamin Netanyahu on a visit to Budapest specifically to flout the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=234.32s)]
*  ICC's arrest warrant. Hungary then went on to announce it was withdrawing from the ICC. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  In any case, the ICC has begun proceedings against Hungary over its refusal to cooperate [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=244.88s)]
*  according to its obligations under Article 87 of the Rome Statute. It should be noted that Hungary's [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=250.08s)]
*  authoritarian regime, which has destroyed democracy in the country, is flagrantly racist and indeed [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=256.24s)]
*  uses constant anti-Semitic tropes. Specifically, over the Jewish-Hungarian [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=262.0s)]
*  border financier George Soros, who is portrayed as a sinister puppet master, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=266.88s)]
*  Poland suggested Hungary is amongst the most anti-Semitic nations in terms of public opinion [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=270.8s)]
*  in Europe. Here's what's also mortifyingly embarrassing about this covered up visit. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=275.28s)]
*  Britain has bent over backwards to help facilitate Israel's genocide and, for example, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=279.59999999999997s)]
*  continues to supply crucial components for the F-35 jets which rain death and destruction on [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=284.08s)]
*  the people of Gaza. And yet, Israel has humiliated the Labour government by deporting two Labour [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=289.28s)]
*  MPs who attempted to enter the country on a fact-finding mission to go to the illegally [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=295.2s)]
*  occupied West Bank. They were accused of anti-Israel hate. Israel just wantonly humiliated [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=300.88s)]
*  its own pathetic ally because it's so drunk on impunity. And yeah, this is one of the only times [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=307.6s)]
*  David Lammy actually forcefully criticised Israel because obviously his big red line isn't the mass [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=312.8s)]
*  butchery of say little children but rather his own parliamentarians being treated poorly by the [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=317.92s)]
*  Israeli state. Nonetheless, off the red carpet to the Foreign Secretary of a State whose leaders [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  have arrest warrants against them for war crimes just after they humiliate Britain, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=328.4s)]
*  pathetic doesn't even cover it. What exactly did David Lammy say to this Israeli Foreign Secretary? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=333.28s)]
*  I think we deserve to know, do we not? Did he demand that Israel ends the grave war crime and [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=338.88s)]
*  genocidal acts which is the total blockade Israel imposed on anything entering Gaza at the beginning [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=344.23999999999995s)]
*  of March? What is so utterly pathetic here, pathetic is a word I am aware I have to keep using, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=350.08s)]
*  is last month that David Lammy did actually finally state the facts here. Israel is breaching [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=355.91999999999996s)]
*  international humanitarian law by imposing this blockade, that's putting it mildly. And then [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=359.67999999999995s)]
*  number 10, the government, or did he backtrack with weasel words that Israel was only at risk [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=365.03999999999996s)]
*  of breaking that law? Craven stuff to say the least. Did he demand Israel stop the mass slaughter [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=369.67999999999995s)]
*  of Palestinians which the Israeli Foreign Minister could legitimately have laughed in his face about? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=375.2s)]
*  What do you mean my dear David? You mean with the F-35 jets you help us equip? Did David Lammy demand [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=379.59999999999997s)]
*  an end to the destruction of hospitals and the slaughter of medics? Did David Lammy demand the [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=385.12s)]
*  release of thousands of Palestinian hostages who face industrialised torture and rape? Did David [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=390.16s)]
*  Lammy demand an end to the genocidal plan to drive the surviving Palestinian population into a tiny [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=395.44s)]
*  confined unlivable space in Gaza so that they either die or they're forced to flee? Let me say [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=400.4s)]
*  this about Labour's front bench overall, they're the pits, devoid of principles, spineless, making [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=406.64s)]
*  up for a lack of talent with their own burning desire to climb the ladder for the sake of it. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=412.72s)]
*  David Lammy deserves special contempt. In the past he's done this grandstanding about human [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=417.04s)]
*  rights and principle. Shame on Netanyahu, he once tweeted safely in opposition. This is a man who [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=421.92s)]
*  just wanted the trappings and prestige of high office and he got it and he morally disgraced [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=429.12s)]
*  himself. There's no greater sin for a politician than facilitating genocide and we must not rest [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=433.6s)]
*  until the likes of David Lammy end up in the dock charged with the role that they have played in the [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=440.88s)]
*  mass extermination of the Palestinian people. It sounds utopian, it sounds unthinkable. We think [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=445.12s)]
*  to ourselves these people will just get away with anything and everything. I don't accept that. I [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=451.12s)]
*  don't accept it at all. I'd note that wins can change very quickly indeed. This crime is too [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=454.8s)]
*  grotesque, too outrageous, too shameless, too diabolical and too confessive and its normalisation [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=459.92s)]
*  will spell catastrophe not just for the Palestinian people but humanity as a whole. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=465.76s)]
*  Normalising depravity will only ensure that we sink into the abyss. Now some politicians have [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=470.15999999999997s)]
*  commendably spoken out despite the blackouts. Aziz Altana, an MP who was suspended by Labour [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=476.32s)]
*  because oh she does something really wicked, really terrible. Not facilitate genocide, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=481.92s)]
*  didn't do nothing like that. No, no she voted against the Tory benefit cuts which drive hundreds [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=486.08s)]
*  of thousands of British children into poverty. Anyway she rightly said, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=490.0s)]
*  Gideon Saar and all Israeli officials complicit in the genocide of Palestinians, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=494.4s)]
*  you are not welcome in the UK. Let's see how history judges the likes of Zara Sultana [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=498.48s)]
*  compared to the likes of David Lammy, shall we? Now I want to finish with this voice note from [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=503.6s)]
*  Dr. Ahmed Sharafa. He's an orthopedic surgeon at Al Arab Hospital which was the last fully [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=508.16s)]
*  functioning hospital in Gaza. Again the shops, the main shops are empty. Many of the ones, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=513.52s)]
*  the very small shops that opened during the ceasefire have closed because they have nothing [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=521.6s)]
*  to sell. Just an example, the small and like small businesses like restaurants they have all [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=525.84s)]
*  closed because they don't have any sources of food to cook. We were so happy to see many of them [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=531.52s)]
*  re-emerge again on the service and start delivering whatever delicious meals they [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=538.56s)]
*  used to do before the war but they have all closed. Same for the small shops and with regards to the [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=545.1199999999999s)]
*  prices, I gave you an example of the cooking gas but for other prices if you are talking about a [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=553.52s)]
*  bag of flour we used to sell like or buy this during the ceasefire agreement nobody bought [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=561.2s)]
*  flour because it was basically being distributed every once in a while and almost we all had a [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=570.5600000000001s)]
*  plethora of you know flour bags but because of the cessation of aid into Gaza one bag is now [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=576.08s)]
*  250 to 350 ILS and the prices are expected to continue increasing if there is no aid allowed [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=584.24s)]
*  into Gaza. Eggs also it's the same one egg used to be less than one shekel during the ceasefire [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=594.3199999999999s)]
*  duration. Now if you find a single egg it's going to cost you eight ILS so the highest prices, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=602.0799999999999s)]
*  the lowest hike in prices could be like 300 percent more and the most severe increase in [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=610.32s)]
*  prices would actually reach 1000 to 3000 percent more in some of the market prices if they are [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=618.08s)]
*  available. Deliberate starvation that's a sort of war crime being facilitated by the likes of the [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=625.36s)]
*  Israeli foreign minister. He belongs in a prison cell not being welcomed by British government [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=629.7600000000001s)]
*  ministers. Well that accountability will come. Please like and subscribe leave your thoughts [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=633.6800000000001s)]
*  in your comments help us take on the pro-Jar [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=638.16s)]
*  protest. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbIyNNt4-o&t=655.44s)]
