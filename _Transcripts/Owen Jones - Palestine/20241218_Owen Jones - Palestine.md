# EXPOSED Facebook Silencing Palestinians - New Damning Report
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [December 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLUCw6-O9dE)
*  Facebook, which is owned by Metta, is systematically suppressing news produced by
*  Palestinian journalists. That is according to a new study which has been produced by BBC Arabic,
*  the BBC World Service and BBC Monitoring. This is a striking example of how there's been this
*  multi-pronged offensive to silence voices, not least Palestinian voices, who have sought to
*  expose the truth about a genocide which most of the Western media has helped facilitate.
*  Now, before we go into this, some might be going, hold on a minute, haven't you consistently been
*  claiming that the BBC itself has devastating questions to answer about its own coverage of
*  Israel's onslaught against the Palestinian people? Well, yes, indeed, my months-long investigation
*  into the BBC News website, the most influential news site with the biggest reach on the face of
*  the earth, finally drops tomorrow, that's Thursday, Thursday 19th. It's based on interviews
*  with 12 BBC journalists and it paints a devastating picture of the BBC's coverage, also with some
*  brilliant data journalists who've done a deep dive. It's been published by the brilliant news
*  website, Dropsite News, that is Thursday. Make sure you don't miss it. Now, the work here on Metta has
*  been done, it must be noted, outside of the BBC mainstream outlets. Indeed, BBC Arabic journalists
*  have tried to do brilliant work, often in extremely trying circumstances. Let's listen to this report
*  on meta suppression of Palestinian journalists. BBC analysis has revealed that Facebook severely
*  restricted the ability of Palestinian news outlets to reach an audience during the Israel-Gaza war.
*  In the first comprehensive research in the territory since the war start, data and tech
*  specialists at BBC News Arabic and also at BBC World Service calculated how many people interacted
*  with news content across hundreds of thousands of Facebook posts from journalists. In times of
*  conflict, access to reliable news is vital and today many turn to social media as their primary
*  source of information. On platforms like Facebook and Instagram, how people engage with content, so
*  comments, likes, shares, reactions, can increase visibility and shape public opinion. But for the
*  last year, Palestinian journalists have raised concerns that their posts are being suppressed
*  and according to our research, something has happened. In the first comprehensive data analysis
*  by territory since the start of the war in Gaza, we analyzed more than a hundred thousand Facebook
*  posts by different Palestinian news organizations. This bar represents the average engagement per
*  post in the lead-up to the October 7th Hamas attack on Israel. As you can see, it fluctuates,
*  but it's steady. And then, Hamas's attack and Israel's subsequent and ongoing war in Gaza became
*  one of the biggest talking points in the world. But look what happens to the engagement on those
*  same Facebook pages. It nosedives. In fact, since that date, there's been a 77% drop in average
*  engagement. One of the pages analyzed in our investigation is the well-established Palestine TV.
*  They have 5.8 million followers on Facebook and have had some posts about the war restricted by
*  the platform. We did the same analysis on similar news pages from Israel and neighboring Arabic
*  speaking countries and found that engagement went up. Meta confirmed that temporary product and
*  policy measures were brought in in response to the conflict. Well, this is remarkable actually
*  because at first I thought it was to do with something else. You see, Facebook was an important
*  part of my platform and other people's platform on the left, progressive outlets until last November
*  when suddenly traffic collapsed. It turned out they changed their algorithm, this is what they
*  said, to suddenly deprioritize political content. Other progressive and dissenting voices saw the
*  same phenomenon I did. Audience collapsed by 95% overnight as though someone had just flicked a
*  switch. That was awfully convenient as Israel's genocide began because it meant that mainstream
*  media outlets could be firing all cylinders while alternative voices relied on social media
*  and suddenly had their reach drastically reduced. But what this study shows, and this is why it's
*  so important, is that while Palestinian news sources were suppressed, the same fate did not affect
*  Israeli news sources. Yediyot Aronot, Israel Chaim and Channel 13, indeed exactly the opposite. Their
*  traffic, their engagement went up by nearly 37%. We can see on the graph what happened to Facebook
*  audience average engagement with Palestinian news outlets comparing pre-October 2023 with post-October
*  2023 when there was a huge slump in average engagement. Now, what makes this completely
*  utterly deranged is that clearly there was an explosion in interest in Palestine. Never in the
*  history of the Palestinian people has there been so many people engaged in the question of Palestine.
*  And this was the very moment that suddenly engagement on Facebook with Palestinian sources
*  Metta came back and admitted they took actions which they say balanced the right to freedom of
*  speech with the fact Hamas was both US sanctioned and designated as a dangerous organisation under
*  Metta's own policy. They acknowledged they may have made mistakes but denied deliberately suppressing
*  any particular voices. What I would say here at best is what they're saying is they simply reflect
*  the interests of US foreign policy. They're not designating Israel defence forces a dangerous
*  organisation, are they, despite the litany of war crimes committed by the IDF long before the 7th
*  of October. Now crucially the BBC say they spoke to five former and current Metta employees and
*  shared internal documents showing how Instagram algorithm changes toughened the moderation of
*  Palestinian people commenting on Instagram, part of the Metta empire. They said and I quote,
*  within a week of the Hamas attack the code was changed, essentially making it more aggressive
*  towards Palestinian people. This has been justified by Metta saying it was necessarily
*  because of what they said was a spike in hateful content coming out of the Palestinian territories.
*  Hold on a minute, hateful content? Has Metta seen and heard the sort of content being loudly
*  churned out by the Israeli government? Genocidal intent, genocidal incitement,
*  racist dehumanisation, commitment to war crimes over and over again, let alone Israeli soldiers
*  who are posting their war crimes on social media. Indeed in a society awash with genocide and
*  mania, all too many Israeli citizens, I mean pressing the translate Hebrew option on Twitter,
*  adopt the brace position in all too many cases. Courageous exceptions aside,
*  the brilliant Israeli voices spoken out of course, but the point of making here is striking isn't
*  it how these standards, how these standards applied, who they're applied to and who they're
*  not applied to. Now it should be said that the NGO Human Rights Watch have already done work on this
*  many months ago, which I covered at the time, but it was overwhelmingly ignored by other media outlets.
*  One exception was Al Jazeera. Let's listen to that report at the time.
*  Human Rights Watch says Metta has silenced posts in support of Palestine on Instagram and Facebook.
*  It says the suppression is systemic and global, amounting to what seems to be the largest wave
*  of censorship of content about Palestine to date. The rights group reviewed 1,050 cases of online
*  censorship from more than 60 countries. They were largely in English. Nearly all of them featured
*  peaceful content in support of Palestine. The organization says that in more than 300 cases,
*  users were unable to appeal Metta's removal of content or accounts effectively. It's identified
*  six patterns of censorship, content removal, suspension or permanent disabling of accounts,
*  and restrictions on liking, commenting, sharing or reposting. It's also found restrictions on
*  tagging or following other accounts, limited use of certain Metta features and shadow banning users.
*  That means a significant drop in the visibility of their posts, stories and accounts.
*  Well, look, this all raises striking questions about our so-called democracies. On the one hand,
*  we have, across the Western world, newspapers and broadcast outlets, which are the playthings of
*  oligarchs, of moguls, of the extremely bloody rich. On the other hand, we have social media
*  outlets, which are, yes, the playthings of oligarchs and moguls and the excessively rich.
*  And they could just suppress and amplify voices by pushing a few buttons on a whim.
*  We see how these moguls have sought to promote pro-Israel propaganda, with Israel, of course,
*  treated as a crucial Western ally by them in the Middle East. It's striking, isn't it, how much
*  Western public opinion has turned against this genocide despite the massive attempt to whitewash
*  Israeli crime, suppress the truth, silence voices standing against it. Well, as I say,
*  I have this detailed investigation coming out Thursday, 19th of December, depending when you're
*  watching or listening to this, into the BBC's coverage of Israel and Palestine. It's published
*  by Dropsite News. It's taken months and months of work. I think you'll be shocked by it. I have
*  devastating truths in it. I'm particularly thankful for those BBC journalists who came forward,
*  who just want to uphold the BBC's own stated commitments and due impartiality, by the way.
*  It cost me almost Â£20,000 to legal it before I handed it over to Dropsite News. You'll find out
*  why it was so important to legal it. I'm flashing the invoice up as proof. So, you know, I'm not
*  some ripoff merchant or grifter or whatever, but if you do want to help with that, one-off donations
*  to ko-fi.com forward slash Owen Jones. Very welcome. Link in the bio or patreon.com forward
*  slash Owen Jones 84. I say that because I want to do more of this kind of work, but obviously if I
*  keep getting landed with these sorts of legal fees, it's just not possible, I'm afraid. That's just a
*  lot of money, isn't it? I mean, let's, you know, anyway, click on the link if you want to, only if
*  you can, but it's just so I'm able to keep doing that kind of work. Stay tuned. Please subscribe
