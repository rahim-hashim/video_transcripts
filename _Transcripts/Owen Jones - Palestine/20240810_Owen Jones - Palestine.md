# Western Media BURIES Sickening Israeli Abuse of Palestinian
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [August 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2rGpKBMxm4)
*  This is truly hideous and extremely telling. You will know that Israel's genocidal campaign in Gaza has been justified repeatedly using allegations of rape on the 7th of October.
*  The former Israeli spokesperson, Elon Levy, is of course a classic of this particular genre. He tweets variously, for example,
*  This is on the basis of allegations he shared about an Israeli man being gang raped at the Nova Festival on the 7th of October.
*  Now he has repeatedly condemned what he calls the Hamas Rapist regime as justification for supporting this genocidal onslaught.
*  Now the allegations of sexual violence on 7th October have been used to justify the genocidal onslaught on the grounds that they show the utter depravity of the enemy,
*  that these are animals, subhuman, and that therefore you should raise any sense of pity or grief or anguish at the horrific human cost of laying waste to Gaza.
*  Now I'm not going to re-litigate the question of sexual violence on the 7th of October. I think all such allegations need to be investigated extremely seriously.
*  I would know, because it's relevant, given who I just quoted, that one of the worst allegations of rape, of two women who were allegedly raped and murdered, was printed in the New York Times.
*  The New York Times then later printed an article debunking this story based on video evidence.
*  It turned out the testimony had been provided by an anonymous military paramedic who gave such graphic details of what he had allegedly seen that you can only conclude that he fabricated this claim.
*  And who was the man responsible for offering up this anonymous military paramedic to news organisations like the New York Times to spread these specific false allegations? No other than Elon Levy.
*  Now, what I would know is that there was wall-to-wall coverage of allegations of sexual violence and rape on 7th October.
*  We now have overwhelming evidence of sexual violence and rape against Palestinian women, Palestinian men and indeed Palestinian children.
*  There is no wall-to-wall coverage at all. Most of the population in the West probably has very little idea at all about these allegations, given the dearth of coverage.
*  In the latest example, Israeli television broadcast footage of so-called Israel Defence Forces, IDF soldiers, raping a Palestinian detainee in a scene at the Stead Taiman Prison, a notorious complex where mass torture, killings and rape are taking place.
*  You see dozens of prisoners lying face down on the floor with hands on the backs of their heads, and one of the prisoners is led to a discreet corner.
*  Three soldiers use shields to block the view, while a military dog on a lead can be seen barking fiercely at the prisoner.
*  The unnamed detainee was hospitalised with a torn rectum, broken ribs, ruptured bowels and damaged lungs.
*  It gets worse. Israeli media report that it was a cell phone inserted into the rectum of this detainee.
*  The Israeli soldiers were reportedly calling the number and laughing. They couldn't get the phone out and were using other objects to try and remove it.
*  They were told that the Israeli cabinet was aware of all this before arrests were made.
*  When arrests were made, there were riots in Israel in support of the soldiers, backed by Israeli ministers who participated in these riots.
*  Given the extensive evidence for months of rape and torture, including dozens of detainees killed in detention,
*  we know that these arrests only happened in an effort to stop the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor issuing further requests for arrest warrants for torture,
*  on top of existing arrest warrants requests for war crimes and crimes against humanity.
*  You might expect this sort of horror to provoke a reckoning in Israeli society.
*  No such thing happened. Instead, they hosted a debate on television about the pros and cons of raping detainees, making it a topic where you can agree to disagree.
*  I'm not joking. That would be pretty messed up if I was. Let's have a listen.
*  That's not interesting to you?
*  No.
*  Not interesting to you, the way the soldiers were being treated?
*  No.
*  By the way, these are not soldiers. They're not soldiers. They're the victims.
*  Again, it's interesting to me what Hamas did to this man. I remember that the only thing that was a problem for me was that it wasn't a state-of-the-art policy to arrest the detainees.
*  Because in general, it's also, first of all, up to them, and that's a great point we need to give them.
*  And secondly, maybe it will also help us a little more than the arrest.
*  That is, the moment the other side, which needs to remember Josh and needs to remember it well, and not to be offended and not to be offended ever again,
*  these people connected 30 of our sons to the detainees on October 7 and did to them what they did, not less cruel, I don't want to make a mistake, cruel in an extreme way.
*  So first of all, it reaches them. It's a very reasonable point.
*  Only a mistake that they don't do it in a positive way, as part of the canon of being in the detainees.
*  Because then the guys who come to think of doing the detainees on October 7 will tell you, you see what they are doing in Israel, don't think about it at all.
*  First of all, I regret that these things are going on for a long time, because what Hoshlein Niggaz is doing here is simply a violation of violence.
*  Violation of violence.
*  Oh, really? Really a violation?
*  This man is now supporting in the absence of Inus, a very cruel enemy of Hamas, who want to kill you and rape you and beat you up like Moshe.
*  I'm just saying, I think that he is not, no one here is, I think Josh doesn't want to defend the accused.
*  I think that I'm not seeing the question, is it clear that a soldier of the IDF, for whatever reason, will kill you?
*  He's talking about Hamas, Isher, who raped children, who raped women, that his whole idea is to take everyone from us, to throw them away and do the most difficult act.
*  This is the punishment they need to get, and more than that, it needs to be a powerful force.
*  I regret that Josh's words...
*  Wait, he didn't say anything, he's already angry with you.
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
*  What to say?
*  Meanwhile, listen to this excerpt from a deranged interview from Tali Gottlieb, a member of the Israeli Knesset or Parliament for Likud, the ruling party that Benjamin Netanyahu is Prime Minister of.
*  Tali Gottlieb is waiting for us outside, they have already crossed to Lid, the soldiers and Tali Gottlieb are there, hello, good evening Tali.
*  Hello, Hello, 14th Street, because what you don't understand is that there is silence here, because it's 14th Street and because it's your hour, and it's important for us to tell you that you are being punished by the people of Israel and not by their cruelty.
*  What you see here is the people of Israel that are being punished for the good of our soldiers and our soldiers.
*  We have crossed this line of
*  soldiers and soldiers on the ground, you need to understand,
*  the soldiers that have been punished, you must stand up and stand up for our people.
*  Find a new ground, go and protest and deny that some soldier has been punished,
*  instead of pushing them out of all the steps, go and stop, face to face,
*  so she says that you need to understand the Nukhba terrorists who raped, sorted and abused our people have found a new method, they go and whine and snitch that some soldier touched them, that's what she said there.
*  Meanwhile, a soldier from the unit responsible for rape appeared on television with a mask to denounce the journalist who leaked it.
*  Guy Peleg, what did you do? Why did you
*  do this?
*  What do you think?
*  Your goal was a point of break that caused a commotion, you saw the flag that I did not see,
*  people came to protest, what do you really think about this thing that people so much
*  fought to protect you?
*  First of all, I am very happy that the right knows how to rebel in the Land of Israel, I do not want to enter right and left, but in the end it will be like this, it will not help anything because the right side is what it was.
*  The people of Israel know the work that they need.
*  Why did you slander our name to the world? That's what he said. I think it's you raping and torturing and murdering that's responsible for your names being slandered.
*  Now we have multiple examples of rape and sexual violence used by the Israeli army against Palestinians, including Save the Children reporting the sexual abuse of detained Palestinian children in the West Bank before the 7th of October,
*  to the reported rape of women in detention since, and the repeated sexual abuse and rape of men which is now even reported in the likes of the New York Times and CNN.
*  And rather than revulsion, we have seen support from within Israeli society, including riots and support of rape.
*  Now given the question of rape was used to justify the genocide of Gaza, where does that leave us?
*  The fact is Israel has committed and is committing some of the worst atrocities of the 21st century, shamelessly, unapologetically, in full public view.
*  And those who supported this and those who stayed silent should never be allowed to get away with their complicity.
