# EU Declares Israel Deliberately Starving Gaza
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [March 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW5vvU7N5jc)
*  No excuses, non, zero, the genocidal intent of the Israeli state in Gaza cannot be ignored anymore,
*  cannot be denied and it must not be denied. It should already have been obvious what with
*  the detonation of the equivalent of several nuclear bombs in an area the size of East London
*  in the space of just a few months, leaving most civilian infrastructure damaged severely so,
*  or destroyed, as can be seen from satellite imagery of Karn Younis, the second largest city
*  in Gaza. It should have been obvious from what one UN official has called the biggest rate of
*  killing since the Rwandan genocide 30 years ago, with one detailed academic study suggesting that
*  with an assault on Ra'far, over 5% of Gaza's population is likely to have been killed by August,
*  that is around one in 19 killed in the first 10 months of this horror beginning. It should
*  have been obvious from the repeated genocidal statements by Israeli ministers, officials,
*  army officers and soldiers on the ground, often posted for comic amusement on TikTok.
*  And now there is the question of Israel imposing starvation on Gaza. Don't listen to me on that,
*  instead listen to Joseph Borrell, the European Union's foreign policy chief.
*  I am coming from Washington and I dare to say, well, yes, Israel is provoking famine.
*  Oh, how do you say that? What evidence do you have? Come on, what evidence do I have?
*  Hundreds of trucks are waiting to enter. And it's absolutely imperative to make crossing
*  points work effectively, an open additional crossing point. And it's just a matter of
*  political will. Well, that's clear cut. He said Israel is provoking famine. He says the famine
*  is entirely manmade. He says that starvation is being used as a weapon of war that by definition
*  means genocidal intent. If you're accusing a state of deliberately imposing a famine on civilian
*  population, that is of course self-evident genocidal intent was the argument. Now, before you start
*  waving the EU flag in jubilation, if the EU thinks the state is deliberately starving a population,
*  why the hell aren't they imposing sanctions on them? Talk is cheap, Israel knows it can ignore
*  such statements and it does all the time. It's action that counts. Now bear in mind that Gaza
*  has suffered the fastest decline in a population's nutritional status ever recorded. Now, Oxfam has
*  just released a report explaining how Israel is blocking humanitarian aid and operations,
*  contradicting the lies spread by the Israeli state. Let's hear Noor Sharaz explain how Israel
*  is doing just that. The report also says, and you were making this point, Israel has made
*  the humanitarian response impossible. Can you explain that for our viewers?
*  The Oxfam is looking into seven constraints through humanitarian access that Israel has
*  deliberately put in place to ensure that humanitarian operations are blocked. So basically
*  this starts before getting into Gaza where there's a siege that does not allow us as humanitarian
*  organizations to get aid into Gaza. The aid that we have or the trucks that have been crossing into
*  Gaza are not all the aid that is available and queuing up at the borders away from 2.3 million
*  Palestinians who are desperate. Those trucks that are queuing are either going through an inspection
*  protocol that is unjustifiably long and inefficient that Israel has put in place. Our aid items are
*  being rejected and we do not understand or receive justification of why our aid items are being
*  rejected. This could be anything from water testing kits to sanitation material that is
*  considered life-saving given the situation in Gaza today. Even if our aid items are allowed into
*  Gaza, and this is only a trickle of the aid, we receive basically rejections through humanitarian
*  convoys that would be able to get to the north, but even in the south not all humanitarian convoys
*  are being allowed to finish or are being facilitated in order to get to the
*  people who are in need of this assistance. If the humanitarian convoys are allowed,
*  they are targeted and if they're not targeted then the people who are running to receive the aid
*  are targeted themselves. So this is how Israel is creating a perfect storm to ensure that our
*  humanitarian operations are completely blocked. Now they're responding to the integrated food
*  security phase classification hunger report which states that famine is imminent in northern Gaza
*  and if Israel continues its military onslaught and continues to restrict humanitarian access then
*  that leaves the whole of Gaza at risk of famine. Now don't forget that under international law
*  Israel as the occupying power is illegally obliged to ensure access, sufficient access to food to
*  the civilian population. Now as the IBC report there, this new report shows that the catastrophic
*  levels of hunger and starvation in Gaza are the highest ever recorded on the IBC scale, both in
*  terms of the number of people and percentage of the population. Never before have we seen such rapid
*  deterioration into widespread starvation. They add northern Gaza is days away from famine and the
*  rest of Gaza faces a similar fate. Children are already dying of malnutrition and starvation under
*  the gaze of the international community. Since December the number of people who have plunged
*  into catastrophic levels of hunger has nearly doubled. Now bear in mind their analysis was done
*  between the 26th of February and the 1st of March. Well that period ended 17 days ago as I record
*  this so we're likely looking at a significant underestimate things have clearly deteriorated
*  since. Now this report makes for horrifying reason, the reading. It says that this is the highest share
*  of people as I say facing high levels of acute food insecurity or IBC initiative has ever classified
*  for any given area or country. So what that means is there are 677,000 Palestinians in Gaza in phase
*  five, that's people in catastrophe, another 876,000 people classed as being in emergency, that's phase
*  four, 578,000 people in crisis, phase three, 96,000 in stress, phase two, zero people with food security,
*  phase one. What is now projected is between around now and mid-July is over 1.1 million people
*  in phase five catastrophe, 854,000 in phase four in emergency, 265,000 in phase three crisis,
*  zero people in either phase two or one. That is an astonishing collapse into humanitarian catastrophe.
*  Now I did not ever think that I would be favourably quoting David Miliband, he's now the president of
*  the International Rescue Committee but he's the Archbishop by history, former Labour Foreign Secretary
*  and leadership candidate and I certainly didn't think I'd be quoting him on foreign policy issues
*  but he's rightly said about these airdrops of food, air deliveries of aid to Gaza are unsafe, highly
*  expensive, ineffective and dehumanising. Authorities can and must do more to create safe and effective
*  land routes for distribution of aid, that's a very good point. Those airdrops have already killed
*  people they've landed on, they also encourage for example the risk of drowning because of
*  desperately starving kids trying to swim to get them when they land in the sea, they only offer
*  a pinprick in terms of what aid is actually needed. The US made a big song and dance about an airdrop
*  which represented enough food for a single meal for one day for 1.7% of the population. They're
*  ineffective because by definition they can't be targeted on the basis of need, they're self-evidently
*  dehumanising, expecting Palestinians to run like animals for food. He adds there's no good reason
*  why aid cannot reach Gaza by land today. The Israeli authorities have the ability to create
*  conditions for safe and effective distribution of aid but they are not doing so. Once again it
*  needs repeating over and over again. This is deliberate, deliberate starvation. Israel is
*  repeatedly lying to the world, it's allowing sufficient aid in but in practice what they're
*  doing is just sticking to what they promised from the start. After all Yoav Gallant, the defence
*  minister just after the 7th of October said there would be a total siege on everything,
*  literally everything, all the essentials of life on the grounds Gaza's population
*  were human animals. Now the lies of Israel are here taken apart by Sari Bash from Human Rights
*  Watch. Let's begin with the reports that a famine is imminent. Just give us your take on the
*  situation in the ground and quite how desperate it is in terms of that very basic human need of food
*  and water. Well the famine like conditions are man-made. From the very beginning the Israeli
*  military stopped the delivery of food, fuel, electricity and other life-saving goods and later
*  allowed only a trickle of aid in through the land crossings, very little of it reaching the north.
*  The Israeli military has delayed or denied humanitarian missions to the north, actually
*  bombed trucks bringing in aid and killed a record number well over 100 UN aid workers for Unra.
*  Well the Israeli military of course says that it has provided corridors for aid to reach where
*  it's needed. More than half of the requests for missions to the north from the south to bring the
*  aid in have been delayed or denied and the Israeli military has refused to allow the aid in through
*  plentiful truck routes that would allow it to go directly to the north. When you bring it in from
*  the south it is very difficult to bring it all the way to the north because we have waited until
*  people are desperate. Hungry people are looting the trucks because there's not enough. There is
*  a choice. The Israeli military can open up adequate land routes, fulfill its obligation to secure
*  those convoys and protect people so that they can actually have enough to eat. This doesn't have to
*  be this way. Now Israel smear campaign against Unra, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees and
*  the main humanitarian agency in Gaza, were never backed up with evidence but they led several
*  western donor states to cut funding for the likes of the EU and Canada reinstating that funding but
*  only after the damage had been done. Financially strangling the main humanitarian agency in Gaza
*  during a humanitarian catastrophe is genocidal in itself. Yet today Philip Lazzarini, Commissioner
*  General of Unra, was denied access to Gaza by Israel. He says, My visit today was supposed
*  to coordinate and improve the humanitarian response. This man-made starvation under our
*  watch is a stain on our collective humanity. Too much time was wasted. All land crossings must
*  open now. Famine can be averted with political will. Of course that political will is not there
*  because Israel is deliberately starving Gaza. Now the International Court of Justice of course issued
*  provision orders. One of them was to order Israel to ensure access to humanitarian aid to ensure
*  that genocide is prevented. It's not only failed to comply, it's done the exact opposite.
*  Now today we've seen Israel's impunity in full on a shame display. They've killed the commander of
*  Gaza's civilian police force in a new raid on our chief of hospital which is already being
*  repeatedly attacked. This is a new attack. This is itself linked to the question of famine because
*  the Biden administration themselves has asked Israel to stop targeting members of the police force
*  because they escort aid trucks in Gaza. Without them, given the desperation of a starving population,
*  you won't be able to get aid trucks safely in. We've seen what happens when the IDF supposedly
*  fill that vacuum. They've ended up massacring desperately hungry, starving Palestinians. Now
*  Israel has virtually destroyed Gaza's medical system. Another key plank of its genocidal onslaught,
*  if you destroy a healthcare system in the midst of this mass murderous onslaught in which
*  simultaneously the essentials of life are denied, how on earth can you not see the genocidal
*  implications? Now as I say they've already attacked the already largely non-functioning
*  Al-Chiv hospital which was Gaza's main hospital alleging the presence of Hamas militants and the
*  claims they made about that in the first place, about it being, I mean they originally claimed it
*  was the main headquarters of Hamas which fell apart completely, a detailed investigation by
*  the Washington Post revealed the claims made by Israel were nonsense. They arrested the entire
*  Al Jazeera crew in the hospital and destroyed their broadcasting vehicles. Now it's been reported that
*  includes beating up the Al Jazeera reporter Ismail Al Ghul before his arrest. Clearly what they're
*  trying to do is stop the outside world knowing about the war crimes, the atrocities being
*  committed in Gaza. Bear in mind Israel has overseen the worst killing of journalists in any conflict
*  in recorded history. Where is the outrage from my colleagues? Where's their outrage? Where's their fury?
*  Sickening. They've also demanded 30,000 civilians Israel living nearby must evacuate to the south. As
*  the Gaji newspaper notes there's very limited transport available in Gaza and many residents
*  of Gaza City, particularly children and elderly people, are weak after months without adequate
*  food. It was not immediately clear how they would be able to comply with the Israeli instructions.
*  A crime so vast it's often difficult to absorb all the different components of that crime isn't it?
*  So again let me just let me leave you with these haunting words of Aaron Bushnell, the 25 year
*  old former US soldier who died after setting himself on fire outside the Israeli embassy in
*  Washington in protest at the mass slaughter of Gaza. He said,
