# Israel's Terrorist Attack On Lebanon Exploding Pagers Kill Child, 10 Others, Maim Thousands
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [September 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFsPsdRedH0)
*  If, say, Hamas or Hezbollah managed to simultaneously detonate the pages or mobile phones of Israeli
*  reservists, whether or not they were on duty or not, wherever they happened to be, whoever
*  happened to be around them, that would be rightly classified as an obscene act of mass terrorism.
*  It would also rightly be judged to be a grave war crime. I'd also note that anyone who cheered on
*  such an attack in the West would be liable for arrest under their country's anti-terror
*  legislation. Today across Lebanon, and reportedly in Syria, pages suddenly exploded with reports
*  that more than 4,000 people so far have been injured, with at least 11 killed, including
*  one 8-year-old girl named Fatima Jaffa Abdullah. The reported target was Hezbollah, which is two
*  things, a Lebanese militia and a political party which is part of the governing coalition in
*  Lebanon. But it's not just Hezbollah fighters who use these pages, reportedly so do medics.
*  We need more information on that, that's what the questions will be asking. Who actually has
*  these pages and does Israel know? Can they be sure who these pages belong to? We'll talk about that.
*  But one widely circulating claim is that Israel intercepted a shipment of pages and then put
*  explosives in them, remotely detonating them. Hezbollah uses these pages or relies on them
*  rather than mobile phones to prevent Israel monitoring their activities. The other possibility
*  I've seen is some sort of cyber attack to remotely blow up these pages using their batteries.
*  I'm not a tech expert here, but this strikes me as extremely implausible, especially given these
*  pages appear to be primitive. If that were true, the implications of that would be even more
*  terrifying, though they are terrifying enough as we'll discuss. Apologists for Israel are in a
*  frenzy of ecstasy over this. One example is Avi Maia, he used to be the editor-in-chief of
*  Jerusalem Post. He says, note there are exactly zero reports of anyone but Hezbollah personnel
*  being wounded by the exploding pages. Whoever carried out this ingenious attack did so in a
*  manner that specifically targeted the Hezbollah men and spared uninvolved civilians. Let's remember
*  that. Now, Avi Maia has a history of denial when it comes to the killing of children. He was the
*  editor-in-chief of the Jerusalem Post when they posted false, disgusting claims that Palestinian
*  parents were faking the deaths, the murders, the killing of their babies by Israeli weapons by using
*  dolls. That's who this guy is. He's walked back this claim now. We have the confirmation, obviously,
*  of at least one child being killed. But this underlines that this claim, it's a highly targeted
*  attack on a terrorist group, is a nonsense. We can see the consequences. Indeed, I've watched the
*  CTV footage of two attacks. I won't share them because otherwise YouTube will age restrict this
*  video. One shows someone paying at a supermarket, paying for their goods, then the page explodes,
*  clearly injuring people around them. And another in a market, you can see the same again. I can't
*  show you the video though, the consequences, because otherwise YouTube will age restrict this
*  video and then limit the number of people who watch it. But I can show you this video of the
*  consequences of a page explosion in someone's home. Well, you can see there that that caused
*  significant damage. You can see how if this exploded on a person, it could cause serious
*  injuries and deaths to other people, particularly if the reports are true that the attack happened
*  after they received a message. So many would have taken the page out first. Now you just have to
*  ask yourself some basic questions about this attack or rather series of attacks. And that's
*  actually important. This is a series of attacks. By what definition are these targeted, legitimate
*  military attacks? We know that Israel has an all encompassing definition, for example, of Hamas,
*  where junior officials, civil servants, public administrations, and so on are defined as Hamas
*  and thus judged to be legitimate targets and thus attacked, even if that kills their entire families.
*  In this case, Hezbollah is a political party as well as a militia, which is part of the
*  internationally recognized government in Lebanon. Do we know who exactly has these pages? What is
*  the legality of the attempt to commit the mass extrajudicial killing of so many people
*  with no regard for what they have or have not done? And how is it at all possible to take
*  any precautions to protect other people? Well, you can't, can you? Think of someone sitting on
*  a crowded bus or train. Think of people driving cars or other vehicles. Think of people in public
*  spaces like a supermarket. Everyone with a pager turn into a walking explosive and becomes a threat
*  to everyone around them. According to the Geneva Conventions, indiscriminate attacks are prohibited.
*  Indiscriminate attacks are those which are not directed at specific military objectives,
*  those which employ a method or means of combat which cannot be directed
*  at a specific military objective, or those which employ a method or means of combat,
*  the effects of which cannot be limited as required by this protocol. Well, you cannot possibly argue
*  that this meets the terms of the Geneva Conventions. Now, a few things here. We all know what would
*  happen if Israel had been on the receiving end of such an attack or series of attacks.
*  If the phones or pages of Israeli reservists were attacked like this by Hezbollah or Hamas
*  or Iran and exploded wherever those soldiers happened to be and killed and maimed children
*  and bystanders, those cheering on this attack would be denouncing this as a despicable,
*  outrageous act of terrorism. I would agree with them. If there was a similar attack on Israeli
*  reservists as they went about their business in civilian areas posing a grievous threat
*  to those around them, I would condemn that as grievous terrorism. Some of us are morally
*  consistent, you see. This really doesn't align how terrorism is a term which is cynically redefined
*  to mean violence used by the West's opponents. You see, when I pointed out on social media that
*  this would be denounced as terrorism, were, say, Hezbollah the perpetrators and Israel the target,
*  Israel's apologists responded en masse to say, yeah, but that's because Hezbollah terrorists.
*  Well, if Hezbollah had committed such an attack, the method of the violence
*  and the consequences of the violence would be portrayed as central evidence that Hezbollah
*  are terrorists. Terrorism is defined here by whether the violence is perpetrated by an opponent of the
*  West. If it's committed by an opponent of the West, then it's terrorism. If it's done by Israel,
*  then it's just a daring attack. You see, the hideous consequences of this can be seen.
*  One Doctrine Bayreit reports, I smelled too much blood today and tried to stop
*  many slaughtered body parts from bleeding, which was pointless. What we are going through is
*  unbelievable. A Lebanese Amnesty International campaigner, Bisan Faki reports, my family and
*  friends in Sir described surreal and shocking scenes, people running through the streets,
*  women hitting their faces, mass confusion and hysteria, ambulances racing by, rescue workers
*  crying. It's also worth noting here that the horrors the Israeli state has perpetrated against
*  Lebanon go back decades, like during the 1982 invasion of Lebanon when the Republican president,
*  Ronald Reagan, was so disgusted at the horrors being perpetrated by the Israeli army that he
*  rang the Israeli defence minister to that's what he called a Holocaust. We're also currently in the
*  midst of the anniversary of the days long Sabra and Shatir massacre when up to 3,500 Palestinian
*  and Lebanese Shia civilians were massacred in Lebanon by Israel's allies, which the Israeli
*  defence minister was found culpable for by an Israeli commission. This makes me think of the
*  Dahir Doctrine, developed by the Israeli state in 2006, which basically pushed for attacking civilian
*  infrastructure, civilian targets, so civilians would turn against Hezbollah because of the price
*  they were paying. That is terrorism, where you terrorise civilians for political objectives.
*  Now I seriously believe the Israeli state thought through the terror this would undoubtedly cause
*  amongst civilians in Lebanon in an attempt to make them think that they must turn on Hezbollah
*  in order to achieve the political end of rolling back the tide against Hezbollah.
*  Now this also further degrades international law. We are seeing the constant mainstreaming
*  of serious war crimes by Israel, supported, made possible by the West, which will collapse
*  the already disintegrating international order. Human rights, abusing despots and organisations
*  will all take note of this precedent, now it has been granted the de facto legitimacy of the West.
*  We're also staring through the portal of a dystopian future, where technology can be harnessed
*  so that anyone can be instantly located and targeted and killed. I fear this is where we
*  are heading and you can see how an inescapable totalitarian world could be built that way one
*  day, where anyone who resists those forces with technology that just takes out anyone they deem
*  an opponent like that, I mean where's that technology going to be in 20, 30 years?
*  Think it through, in any case this is a terrorist attack, it is a terrorist attack, a deeply
*  disturbing terrorist attack with hideous consequences and we can see that Israel is
*  attempting to stoke potentially a regional war with catastrophic consequences and we're already
*  seeing a catastrophe as is. As ever the message is sent out to the world, Arab life doesn't matter,
*  well a bitter harvest is being sown and we will reap it for generations to come.
