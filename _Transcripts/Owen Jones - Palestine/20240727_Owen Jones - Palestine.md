# Palestine Wins Victories - Is Tide Turning?
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [July 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGX5S8YXLpg)
*  Discussing victories or wins for Palestine right now might seem delusional, insensitive
*  even. After all, Israel spent nearly 10 months on a genocide of rampage which has killed
*  tens of thousands of Palestinians, all facilitated and armed by the US and other Western governments,
*  including of course the British government. Now, according to an open letter signed by
*  45 American physicians, surgeons, nurses who've worked in Gaza over the last 10 months, signed
*  last week, it is likely that the death toll is already greater than 92,000, that is 4.2%
*  of Gaza's population or about 1 in 24 Palestinians in Gaza killed so far. But the scale of the
*  horror and the role of Palestinian journalists at such cost, suffering the worst slaughter
*  of journalists ever recorded in armed conflict in history and the shift in public opinion
*  in states which arm and back Israel and the political consequences of that, well, that
*  is having an impact. Now, in no way am I going to let off the British Labour government as
*  I go on to explain, and the bar really is on the floor here, what's going on. Because
*  what we're discussing here is in many ways the bare minimum. But when we're discussing
*  genocide, the bare minimum matters. And as I'll discuss, this is testament to the role played by
*  citizens using their voices in however flawed a democracy this happens to be to affect change.
*  Now, back in May, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan QC,
*  a British lawyer and indeed the brother of a former Conservative member of parliament,
*  issued requests for arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*  and his defence minister, Yov Galan, with proposed charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity.
*  Now, those requests must be approved by judges in a pre-trial chamber. Before the last general
*  election as a parting gift to Israel, the Conservative government of Rishi Senak launched
*  a wrecking attempt against these requests for arrest warrants. Now, the argument they were using
*  is that the ICC does not have jurisdiction over war crimes committed in Palestine, given Israel
*  is not a member of the ICC. This is a nonsense. Palestine became the 123rd member of the ICC
*  back in 2015, so the best part of a decade ago. And it's been clearly established the ICC has
*  jurisdiction to deal with war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Palestine, including
*  by states which aren't members of the ICC. In any case, the pre-trial chamber agreed to allow
*  the appeal to be heard, but given the UK general election, they extended the date for that to be
*  heard by whoever happened to take power. And of course, that was always going to be the Labour
*  Party. Now, all of this has caused significant delay to the process of actually issuing arrest
*  warrants against Netanyahu and Galan, who continue to commit some of the worst crimes and atrocities
*  of our age, today for example bombing yet another school, killing dozens of innocent people.
*  Now, it's been weeks since the election, and it was originally briefed that the government was
*  going to drop this wrecking attempt, but then an Israeli newspaper reported that following a visit
*  to Israel, the Foreign Secretary David Lame had backtracked and would continue this brazen attempt
*  at sabotage. I got in touch with David Lame's office for clarification, they didn't respond,
*  maybe they just didn't want to talk to me, which is a shame, I'm just a friendly little
*  lad who likes to chat after all. But then on Thursday, the brilliant media outlets Middle East
*  Eye and Navarra Media reported the government was going to drop the case, and this was then confirmed
*  this Friday. Now, it really should be emphasised this is the bare minimum, it's simply a case of
*  respecting international law and allowing a global institution, which Britain is a signatory member
*  of, to do its work without outside interference. The bar really is on the floor, I'm afraid,
*  I'll come on to that. Now, it should be noted that a new YouGov poll finds that 54% of Britons
*  believe an ICC arrest warrant should be issued for Benjamin Netanyahu, and the government isn't
*  taking that position, it's simply saying the ICC should be allowed to do its work unimpeded,
*  without taking a position on the validity of the arrest warrants, they're not even in line
*  with public opinion. But that doesn't mean we should dismiss progress, clearly we want arrest
*  warrants to be issued, many will go well, will they ever be brought to justice, very good question,
*  Israeli leaders would seek, of course, in that event, to go to states which are signatory to
*  the ICC to avoid arrest. We don't know, of course, how things will develop in the coming months and
*  years, clearly Israeli impunity is falling apart in real time, but if you'd said a year ago that
*  a request for an arrest warrant for war crimes and crimes against humanity were going to be issued
*  against Netanyahu, well, the discovery of an alien civilisation on Mars would have seemed more
*  plausible to a lot of people. It would also represent another devastating blow against the
*  Israeli state as public opinion shifts dramatically against it, given the genocidal onslaught it's
*  unleashed. It may, for example, all over the world, arguing for sanctions, for arms embargoes,
*  that would be much easier. Now, there has been other movement too, in Britain, the British
*  government has restored funding to UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees and the main
*  humanitarian agency in Gaza, that funding was suspended by the conservative government in
*  January, it must be said, Labour legitimise that decision at the time. Now, it should be regarded,
*  quite frankly, as direct complicity in genocide, trying to choke off funding for the main
*  humanitarian agency during a humanitarian catastrophe will inevitably have
*  lethal consequences. This decision was made on the basis of unsubstantiated smears made by
*  the Israeli state against UNRWA, with an independent report finding no evidence to back them up,
*  and a dossier offered by Israel being taken apart by the likes of the Financial Times and
*  Chalifal News. Other countries restored funding, I should say, to UNRWA months ago, the EU as a whole
*  reinstated that funding back in March, along with individually the likes of Sweden, France, Canada,
*  then in April, Japan, indeed Germany, Israel's staunchest ally really after the US. Well, again,
*  this is the bare minimum, it's not active, you know, not actively facilitating genocide,
*  by strangling the main humanitarian agency in Gaza months after other governments have already
*  reversed that decision. It's still progress though. Now, it's also believed that the UK
*  government will publish legal advice, as well as compliance with international law, which is
*  obviously believed to state what we all know, that Israel is in violation of international law,
*  to say the least. Anyone who doesn't believe that by now should be regarded it as an atrocity
*  denier of the worst kind. And that as a consequence of that advice, the UK will ban some arms sales,
*  that is offensive weapons rather than what is termed defensive weapons. Now, the UK doesn't
*  sell that many weapons to Israel in the grand scheme of things, compared to the US and indeed
*  after that Germany, but it still sells weapons which kill people. And those weapons help commit
*  egregious war crimes. It's believed the foreign aid workers, you'll remember the World Central
*  Kitchen attack, including Britons were killed in April with weapons it's believed were included
*  British components. Now, we need clarity on exactly what the ban means, it should mean all weapons.
*  But again, it's just a bare minimum. The British government is obliged to seek legal advice from
*  states that sells weapons, it's legally obliged to end arms sales to states in violation of
*  international humanitarian law. We are here simply discussing abiding by the law. But nonetheless,
*  it will put pressure on labor and well, sorry, it'll put pressure on other states to follow
*  the labor government's example, who arm Israel, principally, as I mentioned there, the US followed
*  by Germany to do the same. Now, even the bare minimum has caused outrage from apologists for
*  the Israeli state. Labor Friends of Israel has issued a legally illiterate statement in which
*  they call the Chief Prosecutors case, which is backed by an array of prestigious lawyers, which
*  I doubt LFI can say the same, as morally suspect and legally dubious, suggesting it's launching a
*  case against a country with a robust, independent and fully functioning judicial system that Israel
*  has jailed previous leaders and it's already investigating serious misconduct relating to the
*  war. Now, the only legal basis for Israel to avoid this ICC case, the ICC case, is if it can
*  incredibly show that its own judicial system would pursue the same charges against Benjamin Netanyahu
*  and his defense minister with a justice system with actual integrity. Now, the ICC intervenes
*  on the basis of war crimes and crimes against humanity, which will not credibly be investigated
*  by the justice system of the country in question. That's what they have to conclude. Now, they say
*  previous Israeli leaders have been jailed, have been doing digging there. What they're referring
*  to there, for example, is a previous Israeli president, Moshe Katzav, who was jailed for rape
*  and obstruction of justice, among other things, and the former Prime Minister Erhud Olmert, who was
*  convicted of bribery, sorry, well, bribery and breach of trust. Yeah. Now, they've never jailed
*  previous leaders, of course, for crimes committed against Palestinians. That's what we're discussing
*  here. There's no serious investigation to any of the atrocities being committed in Gaza or elsewhere.
*  I mean, it's a travesty to suggest that's happening. No evidence for that whatsoever. Now,
*  meanwhile, the Board of Deputies of British Jews has issued its own, frankly, extraordinary statement
*  in conjunction with the Jewish Leadership Council about a reversal of long-term UK foreign policy,
*  which they're bemoaning about how they say many in the Jewish community are assessing whether this
*  government still will stand by words in opposition about supporting Israel's rights of self-defence,
*  that they say it comes on top of restoring funding for UNRWA, which they previously suggested they
*  wanted abolished, and signal a significant shift in policy away from Israel being a key UK ally,
*  and that this would be not only a strategic area, but also a moral one. Now, I don't want to be
*  brutal here, but what the hell has it got to do with you? Why are you sticking your aw in? Now,
*  as a member of a minority group myself, I think it's really important that minorities have
*  collective, organised representation, and Jewish people in Britain and beyond have a very long
*  history of suffering violent and murderous persecution, and to this day still suffer
*  here in Britain bigotry and prejudice. We are discussing here the International Criminal Court
*  pursuing allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity against a foreign state.
*  A British communal organisation lobbying for the British government to wreck that, I mean,
*  what the hell? Similarly, the Chief Rabbi has requested a meeting with the Prime Minister to
*  express his deep concerns. Well, again, this isn't about the interests of Jewish Britons.
*  This is lobbying in support of not actually just the foreign state, but specifically the government
*  and Prime Minister of that state. Now, some may recall the controversy over the IHRA definition
*  of anti-Semitism, which has been accused of stifling criticism of Israel and has been adopted
*  across the Western world, including officially by the UK government with multiple institutions
*  following suit. Park that controversy for a moment. One of the examples given for anti-Semitism
*  in that definition is holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of the state of Israel.
*  Now, regardless of the wider controversies over the IHRA examples in particular, there shouldn't
*  be any controversy over that one at all. That is anti-Semitism, clearly. So how is the behaviour of
*  the Board of Deputies and the Chief Rabbi consistent with the demarcation we should all
*  insist on between the Jewish people, in this case specifically Jewish Britons and the Israeli state?
*  What they're doing here is trashing that demarcation. It's hideously irresponsible behaviour.
*  The British government should very politely tell the Chief Rabbi and Board of Deputies,
*  thank you very much for your correspondence. You're entitled of course to publicly express
*  your opinions and use your free speech as you see fit. But I'm afraid this actually has nothing to
*  do with you and we will not be meeting with you to discuss this issue further. But we are always
*  happy to discuss issues facing the Jewish community in Britain, not least to protect the rights of
*  Jewish people here to live happy and secure and safe lives. Does that sound unreasonable to you?
*  I think it's pretty fair, if I'm honest. Now finally, I want to refer to something posted by
*  one of the soarest losers in British democratic history. There's no dignity involved here
*  whatsoever. His name is Jonathan Ashworth. He's a former Shadow Cabinet Minister. He's been throwing
*  quite the tantrum since he was defeated in his seat of Leicester South at the hands of local
*  optometrist Shocker Adam, who I've interviewed. Lovely guy. Striking is it that when Labour lost
*  support in the so-called Redwall areas, the response then was we need to listen, we need to
*  learn, we need to rebuild trust, reconnect, which was often interpreted by politicians and practices
*  clamping down on migrants. But when areas with large numbers of British Muslim voters exercise
*  their democratic rights, in part, but not in whole because of their objection to genocide,
*  well, it's been quite a different story, hasn't it? And that's why you can't go, woo, Labour,
*  go you. Because in opposition, Labour could have put pressure on the last government
*  when public opinion was frankly onside from pretty much the beginning. They failed to do so.
*  At the start, Kirstama backed Israel's right to cut off water and energy, a war crime. They denied
*  he'd said what he said. Kirstama purged Labour MPs who took a stand. When predominantly Muslim
*  councillors resigned, Labour said they were shaking off the fleas. They backed Israel's genocide of
*  rampage for months. They opposed the end to arms sales. They legitimised pulling the plug on UNRWA.
*  They refused to vote for a ceasefire in November and kicked out shallow ministers who did. They
*  only voted for a ceasefire after 137 days of mass murder and tens of thousands killed.
*  And only when the Scottish National Party cornered them over it and then they stripped out references
*  to Israel's collective punishment, we could go on. We don't need to give them some special cookie.
*  And I'm not going to do that. And what Jonathan Ashworth said is false. You know, this idea,
*  all these, he keeps saying impotent and irrelevant independent candidates. They
*  would have any impact on policy on Palestine and Israel, presumably unlike the incredible work
*  he's been doing behind the scenes. Yeah, I'm sure you've been doing great stuff, Jonathan,
*  trying to shift Labour's position. The fact is, four pro-Gaza independents defeated Labour MPs,
*  including the Shadow Cabinet Minister Jonathan Ashworth, who has clearly been in personal
*  turmoil ever since. Because as well, at the same time, the Greens surged. They defeated the
*  shallow minister, Thangam Debener. The Greens came a strong second behind Labour in dozens of seats.
*  Other candidates, independent candidates, came close, including nearly defeating Health Secretary
*  Wes Treating and talking there about the young British Palestinian candidate, Lee-Anne Mohammed,
*  in Ilford. And Wes Treating is the heir apparent to Keir Starmer. Now, all of that happened before
*  Labour was even in power, when they really do start pissing off people, governments. And that's on
*  the basis of having won two thirds of seats based on a third of the vote at the lowest turnout in
*  democratic history, a Jenga tower landslide in danger of easily toppling over. Well, it's because
*  of all that they came under pressure. They're just responding to that pressure, because otherwise,
*  they're just risking losing more and more voters when they're in power, and bolstering Greens and
*  independents. They've just kicked out seven Labour MPs. They're just going to keep swelling the ranks
*  of a left opposition, which can win in seats. We've seen that already. I mean, I didn't even
*  make, you know, Jeremy Corbyn there, the former leader of the Labour Party, who they thought,
*  you know, they'd beat him in Islington North. I mean, I'm fine if they want to behave like that,
*  but obviously, the priority here isn't party down in political games. It's the people of Palestine
*  who are suffering a genocide. That's what I'm concerned about. And obviously, we'll support
*  anything which helps prevent this atrocity. But that's what this is really about, isn't it? It's
*  about how we build that pressure. And the lesson is to up the ante. The people running Labour would
*  never have done these things unless they felt forced to. You know, these are what we're talking
*  about the bare minimum. What we should really expect is action proportionate to what's actually
*  happening, namely a genocide being committed by Israel with Western arms and support. And
*  that should mean Britain imposing sanctions on Israel, immediately recognizing the state of
*  Palestine as most countries on earth have done, most notably recently the likes of Spain, Norway,
*  Ireland, as well as actively supporting the ICC case and the International Court of Justice case
*  as well. The pressure's working. We need to keep it up. Please like and subscribe. Do you
