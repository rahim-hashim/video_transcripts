# BBC Israel Bias DESTROYED By Gaza Doctor
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc)
*  This is such an extraordinary interview on the BBC by Dr Tanya Haj Hassan, an incredible [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=0.0s)]
*  paediatric intensive care doctor from Canada who has served in Gaza during this genocide. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=5.92s)]
*  She was last there a month ago. What she does is so important because she pushes back at one of the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  many diabolical failures of the BBC during this genocide, which is to treat official Israeli claims [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=16.88s)]
*  as credible, despite one overwhelming evidence of the Israeli state lying and lying and lying [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=22.96s)]
*  over and over and over again, despite two, the overwhelming evidence of what's actually happening, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=28.48s)]
*  and despite three, the overwhelming evidence of Israeli war crimes and indeed genocide, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=33.44s)]
*  including of course certified by international organizations and experts and scholars and so [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=38.8s)]
*  on and so forth. Now Dr Tanya Haj Hassan was there on the BBC to discuss Israel's butchery of nine [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=43.68s)]
*  of the children of Dr Alaa al-Najjar, a Palestinian doctor who had chosen to stay in Gaza during [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  Israel's genocide onslaught in order to treat the victims, as well as over a thousand of her colleagues [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=58.72s)]
*  being murdered. And she continues after her children have been butchered, she continues to do her job. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=64.88s)]
*  This is such an important interview that we're going to share the whole thing and then I'll just [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=71.52s)]
*  comment at the end. Joining us now is Tanya Haj Hassan who's a paediatric doctor from Medsan [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=76.24s)]
*  Son Frontier. She was in Gaza just over a month ago and she joins us now from Jordan. Tanya Haj [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=81.6s)]
*  Hassan, thank you for joining us here on BBC News. I understand that you know the doctor who [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=88.47999999999999s)]
*  accompanied Dr Alaa al-Najjar to identify her children who had died in this attack. What are [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=93.44s)]
*  you hearing via that doctor? Thank you, just to clarify I was in Gaza with the charity Medical [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=100.0s)]
*  Aid for Palestinians although I also do work for Medsan Son Frontier MSF. So Dr Alaa worked in the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=107.52s)]
*  emergency department of a Nasser hospital or works in the emergency department of Nasser hospital. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=114.4s)]
*  She was on call the day that her children were killed yesterday. She was taken to the hospital [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=118.72s)]
*  by her husband, also a physician, to work in the pediatric emergency department. Her husband went [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=126.64s)]
*  home and my understanding from her colleagues, my colleagues in the building where we all worked, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=131.52s)]
*  including Dr Alaa, is that as soon as her husband got home to be with the children while his wife [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=137.84s)]
*  was at work on call in the emergency department, the home was struck. Dr Alaa received word that [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=144.32s)]
*  her children's bodies were brought to the hospital so she went down with my colleague to identify [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=152.48s)]
*  the bodies and my colleague and friend, an intensive care doctor who was with Dr Alaa told me [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=159.44s)]
*  that she couldn't look at the bodies, that they were charred and disfigured and dismembered beyond [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=168.16s)]
*  recognition and that Dr Alaa's colleagues who went with her were all in tears. My colleague [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=172.72s)]
*  said she needed to faint. She was passing out just from the image of her friend and colleagues' [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=179.2s)]
*  children in front of her. So those were seven children. Two more children were subsequently [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=186.39999999999998s)]
*  retrieved from the remnants of the home, again charred beyond recognition and then her sole [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=191.11999999999998s)]
*  surviving child had to undergo emergency surgery in the hospital as Dr Graham just mentioned in [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=198.0s)]
*  the clip before me. Her husband's in critical condition in the intensive care unit. I just [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=204.96s)]
*  want to say this isn't new. This is part of a pattern of targeting civilians, of targeting [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  healthcare workers. Over 1,400 healthcare workers have been killed to date and that's just referring [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=219.52s)]
*  to the healthcare workers themselves, not all the healthcare worker families that have been killed. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=227.84s)]
*  Every single colleague I worked with in Gaza both this year and last year had multiple first and [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  second hand relatives who first and second degree relatives who had been killed to date. I have a [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  healthcare worker colleague who recently lost the majority of his family a year ago and recently [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=246.64s)]
*  while I was in Gaza received a phone call to say that his father and brother were also killed [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=252.79999999999998s)]
*  minutes prior and his sister is paralyzed from the neck down. This means his entire family [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=259.76s)]
*  for the most part is either killed or debilitatingly injured. What do we tell these people? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=266.8s)]
*  What do we tell these people about why we're not putting a stop to every single red line that has [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  been crossed to date? This is a systematic pattern. There's a group of renowned documentary [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=281.76s)]
*  makers who made a documentary commissioned by the BBC on a tax on healthcare called Medics Under [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=290.8s)]
*  Fire. The production's been delayed several months and I would really like to urge the BBC [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=297.12s)]
*  to push for its release as soon as possible. This needs to be documented. This needs to be made [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=302.64s)]
*  public. People need to understand that civilians, their families, healthcare workers are being [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=308.32s)]
*  intentionally and deliberately killed. Dr Hassan, I just want to say I'm not privy to the reasons [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=316.0s)]
*  why that documentary hasn't been released as you say. Let me just repeat what you probably heard [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=324.08s)]
*  me say that the IDF have said in their statement regarding this attack in Khan Yunis. They said [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=328.48s)]
*  that the IDF evacuated civilians from this area for their own safety and they are now reviewing [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=334.4s)]
*  the claim as they put it regarding harm to uninvolved civilians. You've been a pediatrician [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=342.4s)]
*  for a long time. How would you characterise if you can, and I can hear the distress in your voice, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=348.23999999999995s)]
*  how would you characterise what you're seeing in Gaza when you go there to work? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=354.64s)]
*  So first of all, in response to that retort or that supposed justification, we've been hearing [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=358.64s)]
*  these for 19 months and half of the time they're lies and they're subsequently debunked. We know [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=365.68s)]
*  there are lies and the rest of the time, frankly, they're just preposterous. Every 35 of 36 hospitals [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=373.36s)]
*  in Gaza have been targeted. The hospital I was working in, the same hospital that Dr Alaa was [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=380.0s)]
*  working in, was hit with a drone strike while I was there, just the floor above me killing two [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=384.48s)]
*  patients and injuring several others. It has been hit twice since then, so twice since March 23rd [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=390.08000000000004s)]
*  that same hospital has been hit. My colleague who I just mentioned to you from the pediatric intensive [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=397.36s)]
*  care unit called me and left me messages in tears telling me that the ICU is full. In fact, I can [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=403.12s)]
*  read her message to you. She says, the terror is all night and all day, continuous fear. She herself [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=411.35999999999996s)]
*  lost half of her family, her sister and her entire sister's family recently. She said, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=417.67999999999995s)]
*  we miss our loved ones and don't even know how to grieve for them. We don't have time to grieve. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=422.32s)]
*  The pediatric ICU is full. We've had to open an extension. It breaks your heart. What is their [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=427.11999999999995s)]
*  crime? All these small children, it's beyond imagination. And that was the reality for me [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=432.4s)]
*  while I was there. I had an intensive care unit that was filled with maimed children, orphaned [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=437.28s)]
*  children, children who were the sole survivors of their family, children who had lost every single [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=443.03999999999996s)]
*  sibling and whose parents weren't able to come visit them because they themselves were injured [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=447.44s)]
*  in the adjacent building. This was my experience this year. This was my experience last year. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=452.08s)]
*  To hear even air time being given to these preposterous justifications, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=458.0s)]
*  by the Israeli spokespeople, when every single credible human rights organization, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=463.52s)]
*  every single credible humanitarian organization is coming on delivering the same consistent [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=468.88s)]
*  message saying this is consistent with genocide, saying that these are crimes against humanity, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=476.15999999999997s)]
*  saying that civilian and humanitarian infrastructure is repeatedly and constantly being [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=482.88s)]
*  targeted. I just don't even understand why we're giving these claims air time anymore. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=490.56s)]
*  Dr. Hassan, we certainly do that. We certainly do that. And indeed, in the last week, we've also [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=507.04s)]
*  been reporting on how allies of Israel, namely France, Canada and the United Kingdom, have [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=513.2s)]
*  been extremely critical of Israel's renewed military operation in Gaza. But you will understand [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=519.9200000000001s)]
*  why we have to reflect what the IDF says when we go to them for a statement. Just finally and [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=528.32s)]
*  briefly, if you can, I know it's a huge question, but what's the most pressing thing that Gaza needs [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=534.24s)]
*  in medical terms? And then to the bombing. I mean, I know there's a big push to get humanitarian aid [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=540.32s)]
*  in, and I would agree very strongly with that push, but you have an entire population that is [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=548.56s)]
*  experiencing terror on a second-to-second basis while they're concurrently being starved. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=555.04s)]
*  So you need, frankly, an entire peacekeeping force to be on the ground at the moment, ensuring [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=562.8s)]
*  that Palestinians in Gaza are protected and that they're receiving the aid that they need. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=572.4s)]
*  That needs to be the first absolute step. And then all the subsequent steps of rebuilding and, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=578.4s)]
*  of course, accountability for all of these crimes, including the complicity of countries, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=584.48s)]
*  of institutions, of individual politicians who have been allowing this to continue for 19 months. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=590.72s)]
*  When we've experienced genocides of the past and we've avowed as a people to say we're not [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=598.88s)]
*  going to allow these things to happen again, and yet we've allowed them to happen for [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=604.56s)]
*  19 consecutive months now. Well, it's incumbent upon me, of course, to say that the Israeli [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=609.3599999999999s)]
*  government continues to state that genocidal acts are not taking place in Gaza. You don't ask the [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=614.4799999999999s)]
*  perpetrator of genocides. We have to ask the Israeli government for their response [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=624.9599999999999s)]
*  to these things. And as you know, that is the response they give. And that is what we are [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=634.4s)]
*  reflecting. I would appreciate it if you also, in addition to that response, mentioned that [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=644.0799999999999s)]
*  Amnesty International, Doctors Without Borders, Human Rights Watch, the International Court of [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=649.76s)]
*  Justice would all beg to differ. And also we have reported as well, in only March we reported on a [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=655.76s)]
*  number of instances whereby UN officials, including the Special Rapporteur to Gaza, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=662.88s)]
*  have described genocidal acts as taking place. And we have reported that. Tanja Haj Hassan, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=667.92s)]
*  thank you so much for talking to us from Jordan under what are extremely distressing situations [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=674.32s)]
*  for you. Thank you very much. And there's much more on that story, of course, on the BBC News [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=680.0s)]
*  website. Firstly, the composure of Dr. Tanja Haj Hassan there is just astonishing, frankly. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=683.76s)]
*  Discussing unimaginable barbarism which she bore witness to when indeed she did everything [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=689.2s)]
*  she could in impossible circumstances to treat the victims of this genocide. Her testimony, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=693.6800000000001s)]
*  of course, is vitally important. I'm so glad she challenged the BBC on this. What Dr. Taj [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=699.5200000000001s)]
*  Hassan does here is bring to mind that quote about journalism, which you may have heard me say quite [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=705.84s)]
*  a few times now. If someone says it's raining and another person says it's dry, it's not your job [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=710.72s)]
*  to quote them both. Your job is to look out the fucking window and find out which is true. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=715.76s)]
*  Now, the BBC is construing a partiality as just presenting the claims of these radio [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=721.36s)]
*  authorities who were perpetrating the genocide and the overwhelming documented evidence, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=725.28s)]
*  including testimonies from doctors and all the experts and independent organizations and [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=730.4s)]
*  scholars and all the rest, has been two equally valid interpretations of what's actually happening [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=736.72s)]
*  with no attempt to establish what the actual truth is. By the way, if they're going to quote, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=740.8s)]
*  if you're going to quote official Israeli sources, if that's your interpretation, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=744.72s)]
*  why not quote all the genocidal statements by Israeli leaders and officials? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=750.4s)]
*  You see, that's another problem here. That's another problem. What happens and what's happened [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=754.48s)]
*  all the way through this genocide is Israeli leaders and officials just openly speak to the [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=758.88s)]
*  Israeli public in the most genocidal terms in Hebrew. You can translate that. Obviously, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=763.44s)]
*  the BBC has translators at their disposal. You can just hear them saying genocidal things over [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=768.0s)]
*  and over again. Why not quote those? That's the important part. Surely, you're doing the [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=774.0s)]
*  both sides thing there then. You can say, this person claims it's genocide. Meanwhile, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=779.12s)]
*  the Israeli finance minister has said this genocidal thing. I mean, that you're then quoting an [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=785.2s)]
*  official Israeli source. Why can't the BBC do that? What they're doing instead, this is what [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=789.52s)]
*  they're doing. This is what they're doing. This is why it stinks. What they're doing is treating [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=794.48s)]
*  all those Israeli official statements by leaders and officials to the Israeli public as though they [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=798.56s)]
*  just happen in this parallel universe. Instead, what they do is they instead defer to statements [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=804.7199999999999s)]
*  which are tailor-made by the Israeli authorities for Western audiences in English and which are [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=813.1199999999999s)]
*  intentionally issued in order to deceive the Western public. They treat those statements [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=821.8399999999999s)]
*  instead as the official statements that they should be listening to rather than the official [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=828.24s)]
*  statements that are actually being made to the Israeli public. They must be in hysterics about [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=832.24s)]
*  this. They're like, well, we're just jumping up and down in Israel going on about starving the [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=838.64s)]
*  Palestinian people and how we're going to remove them all from Gaza and how there's no uninvolved [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=843.36s)]
*  civilians and how there's no demarcation between the civilians and our military targets. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=848.88s)]
*  And yeah, all we need to do is just type up a little statement going, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=853.6s)]
*  we've never attacked civilians. Us? Israel? Are you joking? We're the most moral army on earth, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=858.96s)]
*  by the way. Whack that in an email to the BBC and then the BBC will just go, oh, just whack that up [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=865.6s)]
*  as the credible statement. It is a sick joke. It's a sick joke. You can quote actually Israeli [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=872.0s)]
*  sources, official sources and statements and therefore say you are quoting all sides, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=879.6s)]
*  but you're only cherry picking the ones which are intentionally given to you for the means of [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=886.4s)]
*  propaganda and deception when there's a whole array of official statements you could be choosing, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=893.2s)]
*  which are choosing not to do. It's all a choice, isn't it? And it is a joke. Not a funny joke, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=897.44s)]
*  a really quite sick joke. Now, as this incredibly courageous doctor makes very clear, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=904.24s)]
*  the Israeli version of events has been taken apart over and over and over and over and over [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=909.12s)]
*  again. Even mainstream news outlets have from time to time deconstructed Israeli lies about [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=912.88s)]
*  their atrocities. The problem is they do it too infrequently. They do it when attention is moved [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=919.04s)]
*  on from the atrocity. They don't give those rebuttals enough prominence and crucially, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=922.64s)]
*  they divorced those rebuttals from their wider reporting, in which they just go back to reporting [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=926.96s)]
*  Israeli claims as though nothing's happened. Now, she also challenges the practice of going [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=930.5600000000001s)]
*  to the perpetrator for rebuttals on its own terms on principle. Now, the BBC and other mainstream [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=936.0s)]
*  media outlets do not do what is happening here with claims from Russian authorities. They treat [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=941.36s)]
*  those rebuttals and claims with obvious contempt and do not both sides the claims being made in [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=948.4s)]
*  the invasion of Ukraine. So why not here? Why not in this case? Did the BBC do this during the [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=952.88s)]
*  Rwanda genocide or during Srebrenica? No, they didn't. And that was not construed as a violation [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=957.36s)]
*  of impartiality. And as Dr. Tanya Haj Hassan also says, if the BBC is really going down this route, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=963.84s)]
*  why don't they include the conclusions of multiple credible organizations like Amnesty International? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=969.12s)]
*  Or do genocide scholars including Israeli scholars like Omar Batov, the professor of genocide and [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=973.44s)]
*  Holocaust studies at Brown University, there's a consensus among genocide scholars about this [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=978.08s)]
*  being genocide. I think that's worth quoting, isn't it? The actual specialists in the field of [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=982.5600000000001s)]
*  genocide, including multiple Israeli scholars, you'd think that might be something worth [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=987.2800000000001s)]
*  just throwing in there if you're going to also just quote tailor-made Israeli statements which [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=993.6s)]
*  you lap up as a media organization and pretend that's impartiality. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=1002.96s)]
*  The truth is that the BBC has played a disgraceful role during this genocide. Right now they are [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=1008.48s)]
*  refusing to broadcast Killzone, a documentary they commissioned which went through every possible [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=1014.3199999999999s)]
*  internal check which is about Israeli attacks on hospitals and healthcare workers. No factual [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=1019.36s)]
*  issues with it, nothing. What's going on there then? We should all subscribe to the YouTube [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=1024.48s)]
*  channel of Basement Films, please look them up and do that now. They produced a film in case they end [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=1028.88s)]
*  up releasing it themselves, in which case we need to make sure as many people as possible watch it. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=1034.64s)]
*  Now in the coming rebuttal, what the mainstream media did and didn't do will be scrutinized. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Mq749FMEc&t=1038.64s)]
