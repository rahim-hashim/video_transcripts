# Israel's Cheerleaders Admit It Has LOST
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2h7naPGMWc)
*  This headline in the Daily Telegraph, a right-wing newspaper in the UK with a staunchly pro-Israeli
*  editorial line, made me furious. It should make you furious as well. The headline is
*  How the Wheels Came Off Israel's Gaza Invasion. The subheading is Hamas is Resurgent in Places
*  the IDF Catched Months Ago. I'll get into this shortly, but just a little summary of where we're
*  at. After over seven and a half months of murderous mayhem, the mass obliteration of most of Gaza,
*  the mass displacement of almost its entire population, the slaughter of tens of thousands
*  of people, many of them children, the maiming of so many, the manufactured famine, well we really
*  could go on. Israel has lost, lost, catastrophically so. It has not achieved any of its war ends after
*  seven and a half months, whether that be securing the release of Israeli hostages by military means.
*  Israel has killed far more of its own hostages than it has rescued by military means. With the
*  vast majority of hostages released, returned to their loved ones because of ceasefire and
*  prisoner exchanges, that is swaps with Palestinians who should be regarded as hostages as well.
*  And crucially, Israel has not defeated Hamas or anything like it. Now,
*  this is why this is important, just big picture stuff first. If you want a summary of what happens
*  with the great western military adventures of the 21st century, it goes a bit like this.
*  1. Politicians and the media loudly line up behind a wall.
*  2. Critics of the war are denounced variously as ignorant, naive, morally outrageous, despicable,
*  stooges of the enemy. 3. Everything that the critics said would happen happens, indeed often
*  even more catastrophically than they predicted in the first place. 4. There is no accountability
*  for the war's cheerleaders, either in politics or the media, while those who are vindicated in the
*  worst possible way, because of all the death, the misery, the destruction, remain treated as
*  fringe extremists. And then of course, the cycle repeats itself again. This is what happened with
*  Afghanistan, this is what happened with Iraq, this is what happened with Libya, and this is
*  what's happening with Gaza. Guys, this has got to stop. It's deranged that we keep having to go
*  through this monstrous murderous cycle. If we don't break this cycle, then let's be blunt,
*  huge numbers of people are going to keep on being slaughtered while violent chaos will be unleashed
*  with consequences that will be felt for many generations. Now, once again, those of us who
*  opposed Israel's onslaught from the very start have to say very loudly, very clearly, and very
*  unapologetically, we were right. Not slightly right, not mostly right, but completely right.
*  Not in the sense of feeling like we won the argument in some public school debating society,
*  because the authority of those we are up against has to be destroyed for good. As things stand,
*  there are no consequences for these people. They walk away whistling, hands in their pockets,
*  from the crime scene, splattered with blood. Then they demand the same again, more blood,
*  with the same outcome. Off they go, whistling, hands in their pockets, from the crime, splattered
*  with blood. They cheerfully carry on with their lives, getting lucrative new jobs, making vast
*  sums of money, treated by mainstream media outlets as moderate and respectable, whether that be
*  politicians or commentators. That has to end. Careers need to be destroyed. People need to go
*  to prison. Not because I'm a fan in general of Castle Solutions, but we live in societies
*  which lock up the impoverished for selling weed, but not for repeatedly helping to destroy entire
*  societies and slaughter countless innocent people. I'm not saying this because of vengeance.
*  It's about justice. It's a recognition that without accountability, these horrors will keep
*  happening again and again and again. Whereas what happens now is it's the people opposed to the
*  crimes who end up with their careers trashed, or indeed, criminalized. I mean, let's just have a
*  listen to this astonishing little contribution from a machine politician, former Secretary of
*  State, who quite notoriously lost to Donald Trump. And of course, I'm talking about Hillary Clinton.
*  I have had many conversations, as you have had, with a lot of young people over the last many
*  months now. And you're right, they don't know very much at all about the history of the Middle East,
*  or frankly about history in many areas of the world, including in our own country.
*  Oh, those silly ignorant young things. What are they like? Don't know what they're talking
*  about, do they? If only they knew a bit of history. Hillary Clinton. Maybe they should listen to your
*  experience in loudly supporting and voting for the Iraq war. How did that go? How did that go,
*  Secretary of State? War in Libya. How did that go? You were a key driver of that. Or indeed,
*  Israel's genocide launched against Gaza. You're a loud cheerleader for that. How's it going?
*  Because looking at the facts here, Hillary Clinton, it seems like those young people
*  who you regard as ill-educated and ill-informed have a much better grip on reality and in thinking
*  through what these horrific wars will mean than you do. Who are you to criticize these protesters?
*  You should be deferring to them. You should be just shutting up and listening to them,
*  along with the likes of Joe Biden and the rest of the political establishment, both Democratic
*  and Republican, who have legitimized and cheered on this monstrosity. Have a bit of respect.
*  Listen to people who know what they're talking about. The protesters, not you. Now, let's just
*  have a look through this Telegraph article, which comes as a complete and utter surprise,
*  which could never have been predicted, except, of course, for those of us who said this would
*  happen from the start. The article notes how the IDF claimed to have completed the dismantling of
*  Hamas' command structure in northern Gaza back at the start of January. That's well over four
*  months ago. As the Telegraph said, when they announced that, the troops had good reason to
*  believe their job was done. By job done, the newspaper notes, the densely populated neighborhood
*  of Jabaliya had been virtually destroyed with entire streets and blocks no longer existing,
*  replaced by deep craters caused by Israeli airstrikes and demolition crews. Then what
*  happened? Oh, Hamas mounted a resurgence, it says, including firing rockets. So once again, the area
*  is, and I quote, swarming with Israeli troops. The Times of Israel actually had this story with
*  the headline, in northern Gaza, troops battle Hamas in some of war's most violent fighting yet.
*  This is where they were supposed to have defeated Hamas months ago. It was supposed to be mission
*  accomplished there four and a half months ago, to be clear. Wait for this paragraph.
*  The Telegraph says it's also symbolic of what Israeli troops says is increasingly becoming a
*  Sisyphean, sorry, Sisyphean task as they retread already scarred ground in northern Gaza, dealing
*  with resurgent Hamas in the same areas they captured months ago. If you want to know what
*  Sisyphean means, it means denoting or relating to a task that can never be completed. According to
*  Israeli media, Herzl Halevi, the IDF chief of staff, last out with Benjamin Netanyahu for
*  refusing a day after strategy for Gaza, adding, we are now operating again in Jabalila. As long
*  as there isn't a diplomatic move to develop a governing body in the strip that isn't Hamas,
*  we'll have to act again and again in other places to dismantle Hamas's infrastructure.
*  It will be a Sisyphean task. There it is again, Sisyphean, never to be completed.
*  Furthermore, the US deputy secretary of state, Kurt Campbell, declared Washington doesn't think
*  that's a sweeping victory as likely a possible. Oh, now you say it, now you say it.
*  I don't know, maybe that would have been useful at the start if you thought it's just some of us,
*  you probably think you're an expert, your US deputy secretary of state, Kurt Campbell,
*  aren't you? Probably thought you were some sort of big guru, knew what's what in foreign policy.
*  Just cheered all on, didn't you? Gave them the arms, let them do what they want.
*  Months later, oh, not going to work, is it? Oh, well, trial and error, we all make mistakes.
*  I mean, in this particular case, that does mean vast numbers of people being brutally slaughtered,
*  huge numbers being maimed, huge numbers traumatised forever. Gaza reduced to rubble,
*  famine, some of the worst atrocities of the 21st century. We live and learn. Oh, well,
*  dust yourself off, Kurt Campbell. On to the next. Israel's defence minister, Yoav Galan,
*  is quoted in this article as publicly saying Netanyahu has to make tough decisions and come
*  up with a strategy to absolve Israel of the task of occupying Gaza. To be clear what's going on
*  here, there's a tension between the likes of Galan, he believes occupying Gaza would be a
*  distraction from, say, consolidating a turn of rule over the West Bank by Israel, which is their
*  real prize, and that Gaza should just be left some sort of mostly destroyed wasteland, permanently
*  besieged with constant Israeli military raids as and when. Whereas the those like Netanyahu and
*  his allies who clearly want Gaza permanently under Israeli occupation, with of course, many members
*  of the Israeli government openly saying that they should resettle Gaza and indeed remove the
*  population of Gaza. Now, under any of these scenarios, life is intolerable for the Palestinian
*  people and what will happen is mass death and survivors forced out of Gaza. The inevitable
*  consequence, genocidal in every possible scenario. Look, what's clear here is Israel cannot win in
*  inverted quotes. It has lost. It is clearly lost. It has failed in its military objectives. It has
*  turned Western public opinion decisively against it. That is the states which arm and support Israel
*  and make its oppression of the Palestinian people possible. It has deepened the already huge anger
*  which exists against it in the Arab world and indeed in the global south, which as a consequence
*  of this horror has flexed its muscles and indeed deepened the obvious decline of the global north.
*  Indeed, new polling in the UK by YouGov finds that 55% of the British public support an arms embargo
*  against Israel with just 13% opposed. While 73% support an immediacy as far with just 8% opposed.
*  Let's be clear, apologies for the Israeli state, our fringe extremists. That's where they're at
*  right now. That's how they should be treated. But tragically, they still have huge power in our
*  political and media circles. Well look, this disgusting farce has to end. This cycle. What
*  legitimacy do these people have? Our media and political elites keep unleashing these hideous
*  murderous wars which end in catastrophe each and every time. Everything they claim in support
*  is discredited. Everything we say is proven right in the worst possible way because what we warn
*  about is mass death, destruction, violent chaos, horror. Which is why I say again,
*  this isn't some sort of, you know, there are debates you have about, I don't know, should we
*  attack the rich more? Should this utility be run by the public or not? We can agree to disagree.
*  This is about mass murder guys. Which is why I say, you know, careers do have to be ended.
*  People have to end up in prison because if there isn't accountability, then huge numbers of people
*  are going to be slaughtered over and over again. This nightmare will go on until we make it stop.
