# Israeli Mourners BOAST About Dead IDF Soldier's War Crimes... At His Funeral
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qm2w5KqAzSE)
*  This really does need to be seen to be believed. Even when Israel's genocide in Gaza leaves you
*  thinking you can no longer be shocked. And it really is important we never stop being shocked.
*  Now from the very beginning, as I've said repeatedly, this has to have been the most
*  confessed crime in history. From top to bottom of Israeli society, from the Israeli political
*  and military leadership to Israeli soldiers, we've had a gruesome combination of genocidal intent
*  and the open admission of war crimes. Israeli soldiers have routinely posted their war crimes
*  online for the whole world to see. No attempts at a cover-up, no hiding, no denial, just loud
*  and proud, boasting, relishing, enjoying, being frankly amused, titillated by what they've done.
*  An Al Jazeera documentary recently explored some of the war crimes posted by IDF soldiers
*  online and we talked about that with the creator of that documentary in a recent video. Now this
*  latest example is deeply disturbing and deeply revealing. This is the funeral of Shival Ben
*  Natan, a 22 year old Israeli settler from the West Bank who we will discuss more of. He was
*  killed during Israel's invasion of Lebanon. Here's a subtitled speech of the eulogy given
*  by his brother. I'll quote it again after I play it. Just have a listen.
*  So he says that, God almighty we want revenge. Revenge, you entered Gaza to take revenge,
*  as many women, children, you can. Everyone you saw, this is what you wanted. And on this day,
*  one year after Simchat Torah, when we thought we were massacre the enemy, massacre everyone,
*  that we will expel them all from this land, we are here at your funeral. This is the eulogy
*  at a funeral. It's striking as you watch this video clip as he's talking about taking revenge
*  on women and children. Those you can see in the clip, presumably his relatives and loved ones,
*  look overwhelmed by grief and are emotionally processing what is being said as though they're
*  deeply moving recollections of a tragically deceased person. You know like at funerals
*  that aren't celebrations of war crimes, the usual type of funeral, relatives would be saying,
*  oh they were such a kind soul, they dedicated so much time to charity, they lived to party or
*  spent time with their children, and the other mourners would yeah be closing their eyes and
*  crying as they processed what they heard. In this example, they're literally listening to how their
*  beloved relatives slaughtered women and children in an orgy of vengeance, getting emotional as they
*  also cry out for more vengeance. I can imagine like a really dark comedy series which pushed the
*  boundaries with scenarios that were just really twisted and unhinged doing a sketch like this,
*  but guess what? It's real. This is actually happening, and it's not only happening,
*  it's happening with the active support and complicity of our governments and most of our media.
*  Now I can read out what was said in the rest of that eulogy. The entire nation, he says,
*  will have the opportunity to avenge your revenge, blood revenge, not the revenge of
*  burning houses, not the revenge of burning streets, not the revenge of burning cars,
*  but the revenge of blood he spilled. Anyway, there were other eulogies at the funeral.
*  Here's another one from a fellow soldier.
*  Let me just quote that one, shall I? He says,
*  you were the happiest and most optimistic and frivolous person in the platoon. We saw it the
*  first time in Gaza when you unauthorizedly burnt a house just to lift the atmosphere.
*  Before I tell you more about who this dead soldier is, which is itself hideously revealing,
*  the fact they're just openly celebrating war crimes, and these are grave war crimes,
*  at a public funeral screams a few things like impunity. You only behave like this
*  if you really honestly think you can get away with anything, as well as genocidal racism and
*  open belief that Palestinians are just fair game to be butchered indiscriminately.
*  Yet another speaker recounted that last October, this now dead settler shot and killed a Palestinian
*  man in the West Bank. He shot 40 year old Bilal Salah when he was harvesting olives and killed
*  him in front of his wife and children. Never facing justice for what he did. The speaker at
*  the funeral said about this, I was so impressed by you and added, you shoot, you talk, you drive
*  them away. I would know that in the West Bank, hundreds of Palestinians, including at least 165
*  children have been killed in the last year, including recently an 11 year old Palestinian
*  boy, Abdullah Jamal Hawash, who was shot in the chest. It's the Israeli forces and settlers
*  responsible for this slaughter, with settlers who murder and maim and intimidate Palestinians
*  protected by the Israeli states. Now, as for the war crimes of this dead soldier, we know that at
*  least 16,000 children have been killed, Palestinian children, by the Israeli state. That itself is a
*  drastic underestimate and that includes not just say airstrikes when the Israeli military selects
*  targets knowing that there were children and babies at home before they blow them up, but
*  includes the deliberate shooting of children in the head and chest by Israeli snipers. Just recently
*  dozens of US based medics who served in Gaza shared their hideous stories of receiving such
*  children who had clearly been intentionally killed. We also know about the systematic burning down
*  of Palestinian homes for no military purpose because IDF soldiers keep posting themselves
*  doing it and celebrating it. They also keep posting themselves blowing up civilian infrastructure
*  such as universities with no military purpose, but because of a deliberate attempt to erase
*  Palestinian society, culture and identity. That itself of course being a key plank of a
*  genocidal onslaught. Now today, South Africa delivered the evidence for their case of genocide
*  against Israel to the International Court of Justice. It is 750 pages that has thousands of
*  appendices and evidence and all the rest of it. It has volumes one and two. It hasn't been publicly
*  released as of yet. What South Africa said is that the evidence for Israel's genocidal intent is
*  undeniable. On top of that, the evidence they say exposes a pattern of mass casualties. The South
*  African ambassadors of the UN in fact said, the problem is that we have too much evidence and
*  they had to take thousands of pages of evidence and condense them into thematic legal arguments,
*  as Al Jazeera have reported. Now they've already reportedly nearly a hundred people working on the
*  case. Unfortunately, the International Court of Justice processes take a very long time.
*  A key point made by South Africa is that Israeli political and military leaders and soldiers,
*  when addressing their domestic audiences, have flaunted shamelessly their genocidal intent while
*  sending English speakers to talk to the Western media to say completely different things, that is
*  lies about respecting international law and so on. Then the Western media in turn has framed their
*  case around those deceitful statements rather than what Israeli leaders and soldiers have been saying
*  to Israelis, often simply just not reporting them, erasing the statements from existence,
*  in doing so erasing genocidal intent. That itself is one of the worst journalistic scandals of our
*  age. There must be accountability. Finally, please support this if you can, I'm off to travel around
*  the United States from Thursday onwards to cover the election. The idea is to ask the questions
*  the corporate media outlets won't, from the role played by complicity and genocide to a catastrophically
*  broken economic model. That means hiring brilliant local videographers and paying them properly.
*  Principles of course only matter if you live by them, so it's going to be hugely expensive to say
*  the least, especially because the plan is to cover what happens after the election with possible
*  turmoil beckoning. If you want to help, please go to patreon.com forward slash omj84. The plan is
*  to expand the operation, do far more of those videos around the world, which of course can only
*  be done as ever with your support, as well as on a new sub stack yet to be launched, investigative
*  journalism, and we have a very big project which will be released. As ever, please like, subscribe,
*  help us take on a media which has helped facilitate genocide at patreon.com forward slash omj84.
*  And yeah, I will soon see you in the United States.
