# This One Example Exposes How Media DECEIVES You On Gaza
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [February 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpEYKwjxRMw)
*  I've been planning on talking about this for a while because it is so egregious
*  and sums up the systemic problem with the western media, how its failure to frame what's actually
*  happening in Gaza, the genocide long slot against Gaza by the Israeli state, its failure to actually
*  frame it according to the actual facts has had catastrophic consequences. Now there are always,
*  and I should say this, courageous exceptions to that but what I'm talking about here is
*  the failure to link together statements of intent, things which Israeli leaders and officials say
*  and linking those to the scandously under-reported multiple atrocities on the ground. I think, well,
*  if this doesn't appall you what I'm going to go through then I don't even know what to say. The
*  war crimes being committed by the Israel defence forces, which most Palestinians refer to as the
*  Israeli occupation forces, are now clearly just too grave and blatant and unapologetic to hide.
*  Well, they have been for quite a long time. IDF soldiers keep posting war crimes gleefully. Why?
*  Because they think they're funny and more importantly they think a large audience at home
*  will find these war crimes amusing and thrilling because both the soldiers and the audiences do
*  not see Palestinians as human beings. But as well as that, after over 36,000 Palestinians have now
*  suffered violent deaths, including over 14,000 children, the evidence of Israeli war crimes is
*  just beyond monumental. So you keep getting a certain type of self-described liberal or
*  centrist commentator, often being genuinely horrified. I'm not belittling their horror when
*  they write what I'm going to go through now. And it goes along these lines. Why is there such a
*  dreadful breakdown in discipline in the Israeli army? Now, I'll give you an example of this.
*  One liberal US commentator in response to some belated but still woefully insufficient CNN
*  coverage of IDF soldiers posting their grotesque behavior tweeted,
*  Insane that this is happening. That any person would be cruel and sadistic enough to post stuff
*  like this and that the IDF doesn't enforce tighter control of its soldiers. This makes the whole
*  institution look so dysfunctional. Okay, this is frustrating to say the least and it shows just how
*  the media has largely completely failed to accurately frame this atrocity according to
*  the stated aims and directions of the Israeli state. What we're seeing isn't a breakdown of
*  discipline or authority in the IDF. It's soldiers behaving exactly as you would expect them to
*  behave based on the pronouncements of their leaders. On the 10th of October, Israeli defense
*  minister Yov Galan told Israeli troops that he had, and let me quote, released all the restraints.
*  On the 12th of October, the Israeli defense minister Yov Galan then publicly announced
*  he'd removed every restriction on Israeli forces. Now, quite apart from the countless
*  pronouncements by Israeli leaders and officials, many of them overtly genocidal in character,
*  which I've covered a great length before, why didn't just these two quotes frame the media's
*  entire understanding of Israel's onslaught against Gaza? I mean, it's a bit of a clue, isn't it? The
*  Israeli defense minister telling Israeli soldiers that he had released all the restraints and
*  removed every restriction on them. I'm level with you. I think that's a bit of a clue.
*  If the Russian defense minister had used that kind of language in the days after the invasion
*  of Ukraine, do you think that would have framed our understanding of Russian soldiers' conduct,
*  not least war crimes? Yes or no, in terms of the license they'd been given to commit atrocities.
*  What is an Israeli soldier supposed to make of being told they have no restraints or restrictions
*  on them, particularly in the atmosphere after the 7th of October, when the likes of the defense
*  minister is calling the population of Gaza human animals? I think they would legitimately understand
*  that as you can do exactly what you want because nobody's going to stop you and you will suffer no
*  consequences. Now, I did a Google search for the whole of October for those quotes. In the Western
*  media, there is barely a mention of either of them. I found a mention in the Times of Israel,
*  a fleeting mention in an opinion column in the New York Times of one of the quotes,
*  not in the news section though, in Fox News, where you can guess the tone of how they reported it,
*  and buried in an ABC news piece. This should have framed the entire coverage of this onslaught
*  and indeed I would note in the ICJ's judgment when they issued provisional measures, they did
*  quote Yoav Galan, all of those particular quotes that I gave to you there, hence underlining its
*  significance. Now, here's a point I'm now going to underline with some horrific recent examples,
*  and what I'm going to say will be deemed outrageous and a disgrace and many other things by
*  apologists for the mass murder of Gaza's population. Now, we've been repeatedly told that Israel's
*  armed forces are the most moral on earth. Now, that's just so ludicrous and ridiculous and stupid,
*  it's not even worth me engaging it, it's just insulting to everyone's intelligence.
*  But also that by definition, they are morally superior to Hamas. Now, I've always been clear
*  that Hamas committed grave war crimes. That includes those killed, those civilians
*  murdered on 7th October and those kidnapped. That's just war crimes, that's a fact.
*  What I would say, clearly, is that the crimes of the IDF are much, much worse. I'm not just talking
*  about the dynamic of occupied and occupier, the claim that the IDF is morally superior to Hamas,
*  again, not to compliment Hamas, given their own war crimes, that claim is insulting nonsense and
*  itself is drenched in anti-Palestinian racism. Because if Hamas are obscene, given the 36 Israeli
*  children who were killed on 7th October, or 3.5% of the total, and every single child they're killed,
*  that is an outrage. Where does that leave the IDF? Given over 14,000 Palestinian children have now
*  suffered violent deaths. And the period between me putting this video out and you watching it,
*  several Palestinian children who are currently alive, breathing, are going to suffer
*  hideous violent deaths. Now the obvious response here is, well, Hamas intend to kill civilians and
*  the IDF don't. That is categorically and offensively untrue. Now I recommend you all Google the
*  Dahir doctrine, D-A-H-I-Y-A. That was what the IDF developed during the 2006 Lebanon War based on
*  inflicting huge damage against civilian infrastructure and populations in order to try and get them to
*  turn on Hezbollah in that case and Hamas in Gaza. That's terrorism, violence against civilians for
*  political end, straightforward terrorism. I'd also recommend reading an article entitled A Mass
*  Assassination Factory, which I've covered extensively in the Israeli Palestinian media outlet
*  Plus 972 magazine based on multiple Israeli intelligence sources in which those sources say
*  that the permitted numbers of civilian deaths per single military target was increased from
*  dozens to hundreds, including the quote, nothing happens by accident. This is a source. When a
*  three-year-old girl is killed in a home in Gaza, it's because someone in the army decided it
*  wasn't a big deal for her to be killed. That was a price worth paying in order to hit another target.
*  Now I'd also know the 70% of Gaza homes severely damaged or destroyed. Farcical to think that level
*  of destruction is a targeted campaign rather than just raining hellfire on the entire Palestinian
*  population. But let's talk about some specific crimes so we can test this Hamas kills civilians
*  deliberately, the IDF does not. Something you should already know is a nonsense, not least
*  if you watch my video about the six-year-old little Palestinian girl Hind Rajab whose entire
*  family was killed by an Israeli tank in their car as they fled for safety, including three of the
*  children. And one of them had 15 year old cousin had rung the Palestine Red Crescent begging for
*  help and then was killed, you could hear her being killed by the Israeli army in that recording.
*  And then this little girl rang the Palestine Red Crescent desperately scared. Before an ambulance
*  was sent to rescue her and then it was blown up by the Israeli army, the paramedics killed
*  before little Hind herself was killed as well. I've covered that at length. Let's quote now from
*  an article in the Los Angeles Times entitled I'm an American doctor who went to Gaza what I saw
*  wasn't war it was annihilation. Now this US doctor Irfan Ghalaria, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon
*  left his home in Virginia for Gaza in late January. Let me quote him, I stopped keeping track
*  of how many new orphans I had operated on after surgery they would be filed to where in hospital.
*  I'm unsure of who will take care of them or how they will survive. On one occasion a handful of
*  children all about ages five to eight were carried to the emergency room by their parents.
*  All had single sniper shots to the head. These families were returning to their homes in Khan
*  Eunis about two and a half miles away from the hospital after Israeli tanks had withdrawn
*  but the snipers apparently stayed behind. None of these children survived.
*  Just process that for a minute children between the ages of five and eight on one occasion all
*  with single sniper shots to the head. So we're not talking about crossfire here a battle in which
*  some portavillians were caught up we're talking about snipers their job is to carefully select
*  targets using their the crosshairs in the barrel of the gun and then shoot them and indeed these
*  kids were not shot in the arms or legs they were all shot each of them in one single occasion in
*  the head. So the IDF snipers clearly selected them seeing who they were selected their heads
*  with the purpose of killing them. Now let's listen to this segment from Sky News.
*  On the second floor there's a five-year-old boy who was hit by a grenade a fragment passed through
*  his eye and lodged in his brain but that's just part of Mumin's story his brother and sister
*  watched it all. It was lunchtime we were sitting down. 11 year old Ahmed Hatab was in the kitchen
*  when Israeli soldiers broke into the family home. They raided our house and they shot our mom and
*  dad then they started shooting at us. His sister Buthaina is nine. We went to another room hiding
*  from the soldiers they started banging on the door and then they blew it up. On December 7th
*  father Mohammed Hatab called his brother a doctor to alert the Red Cross their house had been
*  surrounded by Israeli armor. His brother used WhatsApp he said that the tanks behind the house
*  and excavator destroyed the near house it's very difficult to move without permission.
*  This is Mohammed's brother Omar Hatab a pediatric surgeon at the Gaza European Hospital.
*  My brother called me and he said talk to anybody to deliver us from there because it's very difficult
*  the situation was very difficult and shots around the house so I went to Red Cross and
*  talked with them. I was very very worried. Increasingly alarmed Dr. Omar tried the Red Cross
*  the following day. I called my brother and he said the tanks around the house can't move at all
*  it's complicated. Mohammed's son Mumin has cerebral palsy moving him is difficult and they wanted to
*  notify the Israelis in advance. On WhatsApp the Red Cross was reassuring their representative said
*  we've ensured that the houses would not be bombed or destroyed at night and in the future.
*  Their confidence was badly misplaced. Let's just sum the story up shall we to be clear a five-year-old
*  disabled Palestinian boy with his two surviving young siblings so the IDF stormed their home
*  shot dead their father who was waving a white flag well they've done that repeatedly including
*  Israeli hostages they then threw a grenade into the kitchen injuring the mother and this little
*  five-year-old disabled child. They then killed the mother and then subjected the survivors to
*  humiliating clearly and by definition she did traumatic interrogation before making them leave
*  on foot amidst a war zone. Now I keep saying this I hate having to resort to this what if
*  but there's no option because of the total dehumanization of the Palestinian people but
*  if this was 7th of October and these little Palestinians were kids and their families were
*  Israeli civilians and the IDF soldiers here were Hamas militants that one incident would be very
*  easily described as one of the worst atrocities of that day and it would be used over and over
*  again to justify the onslaught against Gaza and wiping Hamas off the face of the earth.
*  Let's be real that's what would have happened wouldn't it that would actually become maybe one
*  of the iconic atrocities of that day but the rampant racism in all of this means that the 36
*  Israeli children killed on the 7th of October is beyond abominable something I'd agree with I think
*  the killing of any child is abominable to be honest but over 14 000 Palestinian children being
*  violently slaughtered at best leads to a debate about is this proportionate or not
*  what does that say there's no excuses nowhere to hide they said what they were going to do
*  they issued their directions and their orders very publicly they spoke about the Palestinian people
*  in ways which could only be described as genocidal and the failure of the western media to frame
*  Israel's onslaught against Gaza around the very clear and unashamed public pronouncements of its
*  leaders who made no effort to disguise their intent has allowed Israel to get away well for
*  now with one of the great crimes of our age and just again imagine this was a state this was a
*  state hostile to the west and you had Israeli sorry you had the leaders of that state of a
*  hostile state speaking in these ways saying all the restraints have been lifted off their armed
*  forces and these huge atrocities were happening there wouldn't be a debate it wouldn't be a
*  discussion and that alone just sums it up doesn't it and it sums up the catastrophic failure of most
*  western media coverage which is what has granted Israel the impunity to behave as it wishes on the
*  entirely rational grounds that they think they can get away with anything please like and subscribe
