# The US ADMITS Israel Has LOST In Gaza
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U)
*  Israel has lost in Gaza. That is according to the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=0.0s)]
*  who has played a pivotal role in facilitating one of the worst crimes of our age. Now he hasn't said [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  in those words, Israel has lost in Gaza, but what he has said means the same thing. Let's just have a listen shall we? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=10.96s)]
*  Avoid. Indeed, we assess that Hamas has recruited almost as many new militants as it has lost. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  That is a recipe for an enduring insurgency and perpetual war. The longer the war goes on, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=25.84s)]
*  the worse the humanitarian situation gets in Gaza. Okay, let's just take stock. It is, as I speak, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=32.8s)]
*  the 15th of January, 2024. Israel's genocidal onslaught against Gaza began 466 days ago. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=38.08s)]
*  Gaza is a tiny strip of land no bigger than East London. It is 360 square kilometres and about 25 [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=44.72s)]
*  miles long. Israel has one of the most sophisticated militaries on the face of the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=50.88s)]
*  earth. It is armed to the teeth and aided in multiple ways by the United States, the last [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=56.0s)]
*  superpower on earth. It has spent 466 days raising Gaza from the face of the earth, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  exterminating tens of thousands of people, mostly women, children and the elderly, whilst engaging [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=66.48s)]
*  in multiple war crimes such as deliberate starvation, the destruction of the healthcare system, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=71.68s)]
*  mass enforced disappearance, rape, torture, you name it. Israel stated it had two war aims at the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=77.2s)]
*  beginning of this genocidal frenzy. That was to bring home the Israeli hostages captured on the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=84.8s)]
*  7th of October, 2023 by military means. But the absolute overriding key aim that was articulated [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=91.28s)]
*  in public over and over again was to completely eliminate Hamas. On the first count, that's [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=98.08s)]
*  clearly a total failure. The Israeli state has killed far more of its own hostages than it has [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=104.56s)]
*  rescued by military means, with the only mass hostage rescue taking place because of a previous [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=109.76s)]
*  ceasefire and an exchange of detainees. That includes so many Palestinians who are de facto [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=114.8s)]
*  hostages, who were in many cases detained at length without any charge, indeed victims of [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=119.68s)]
*  enforced disappearance, a crime against humanity, subjected to hideous torture and indeed sexual [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=124.56s)]
*  violence. That includes children, as per, for example, the testimonies of Save the Children. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=129.52s)]
*  Now, Antony Blinken has just said that Israel has not only failed to defeat Hamas, but after [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=134.72s)]
*  466 days of utter carnage and death, he has said that Hamas has recruited almost as many new [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=140.72s)]
*  militants as it has lost. So he just casually says that Hamas's arm wing is essentially no smaller [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=146.8s)]
*  than it was when Israel's genocide began. So the key driving rationale to justify so much slaughter, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=152.72s)]
*  so much suffering, so much horror, that key driving rationale is a total failure, according [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=160.16s)]
*  to the government, which more than anyone else facilitated this crime. Well, let's go back to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=164.72s)]
*  what President Joe Biden, Blinken's boss, of course, said in October 2023. Do you believe that [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=171.12s)]
*  Hamas must be eliminated entirely? Yes, I do. Biden was asked, does he think Hamas must be [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  eliminated entirely? And he said, yes, I do. So let's be clear, that was official US policy. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=182.24s)]
*  They facilitated the mass slaughter of Palestinians in Gaza on the grounds Hamas must [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=188.4s)]
*  be eliminated entirely. And now, after giving Israel $22 billion worth of weapons since October [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=192.72s)]
*  2023 alone, which have been used to incinerate, slowly cook and suffocate under rubble thousands [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=198.56s)]
*  of Palestinians, including children, including toddlers, including newborn babies, the US just [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=203.84s)]
*  casually comes out and says the so-called key war aim is a total indisputable failure. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=210.0s)]
*  Who could possibly have predicted this would happen? Oh, hold on a minute. We did. We did. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=216.4s)]
*  We predicted this would happen. We said this would happen over and over and over again. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=221.52s)]
*  Let's just go back to a video that I recorded on the 2nd of November 2023, that is 26 days into [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  this genocidal onslaught and 440 days ago. It was entitled, The Argument Against the Seas Foul Torn [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=230.4s)]
*  Apart. Here's what it said. Now, the idea that you go in and just take out the leadership of Hamas [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=237.04000000000002s)]
*  and that will vanish is lunacy because obviously there is a base for Hamas, which will only expand. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=242.8s)]
*  Now, either Hamas or something more extreme has happened in Iraq. You think all those people on a [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=251.76000000000002s)]
*  daily basis who are now watching their loved ones being murdered, being slaughtered by bombs, picking [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  up the charred limbs of their children are going to go, oh, okay, I accept Israel now. Scores and [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=262.64s)]
*  scores and scores of recruits forever great to extremism are being created every single day. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=267.04s)]
*  So I said the idea that Hamas was going to be defeated militarily was lunacy. I noted how [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=273.6s)]
*  Palestinians on a daily basis watching their loved ones being murdered, picking up the charred limbs [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=278.16s)]
*  of their children would create endless new recruits. Just on the language I used there, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=284.08000000000004s)]
*  I would note that little qualifies more for the term extremism than Israel's genocidal rampage [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=289.20000000000005s)]
*  in Gaza. Now, I'm sorry to say, but I wasn't a genius here. I wasn't a prophet. I wasn't offering [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=294.32s)]
*  some special unique insight. I was stating the obvious, wasn't I? It was the obvious. And many, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=299.68s)]
*  many, many others said the same. We just didn't have any power or influence. How did we know? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=304.64s)]
*  How could we possibly have guessed? We could see the obvious and we didn't have the vast intelligence [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  apparatus of the world's only superpower to keep us up to date. It was obvious and predictable and [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=315.2s)]
*  indeed predicted. You cannot defeat an idea by military means. If you unleash utter depravity [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=320.8s)]
*  against an entire people, you will create an endless pool of recruits determined to fight you [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=325.92s)]
*  to the death. And so it has come to pass. And guess what? The US and its leaders knew what was [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=331.04s)]
*  happening all along. On the 9th of February, 2024, nearly a year ago, the New York Times reported [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=336.88s)]
*  that US intelligence officials told members of Congress that Israel was not even close to [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=342.08000000000004s)]
*  defeating Hamas. The New York Times went on to say, American officials have also raised doubts [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=346.8s)]
*  about whether the destruction or elimination of Hamas is a realistic objective, given it operates [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=351.6s)]
*  like a guerrilla force hidden in a network of tunnels that are difficult to penetrate. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=357.12s)]
*  Weakening the combat strength of the group may be a far more achievable goal, US officials have said. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=361.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, this really is crucial. This really actually goes to the heart of all this, the criminality of [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=368.8s)]
*  all of this. The rationale given by the United States for facilitating this onslaught was, look, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=375.04s)]
*  this suffering and death is all very sad and unfortunate, queues an empty meaningless [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=381.28000000000003s)]
*  hand-wringing about the need to protect civilian life, but it is all for a purpose, to defeat [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=384.88s)]
*  Hamas so there can be quote unquote peace. So the US government was told by its intelligence agency [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=388.72s)]
*  that wasn't going to happen. They instead talked about weakening the combat strength of Hamas as a [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=394.16s)]
*  more realistic goal. Well, that hasn't happened either. There's essentially as many members of [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=398.72s)]
*  Hamas fighting. I mean, look, we go through all this murderous mayhem and then the justification [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=406.32000000000005s)]
*  for the slaughter is just casually tossed aside. So all we are left with is mass murder for its own [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=411.92s)]
*  sake. That's literally what this means, by the way. What other interpretation is there? Yes, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=416.48s)]
*  it's an awful lot of human suffering, but it's necessary to defeat Hamas and then you're just [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=420.56s)]
*  left with, yes, it's an awful lot of human suffering. I mean, that's where we went from, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=427.52s)]
*  wasn't it? Awful lot of human suffering, necessary to defeat Hamas. Now we just go, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=430.96s)]
*  oh yeah, Hamas, yeah, they're not defeated at all, by the way. It's not even happened even close. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=436.32s)]
*  So what are we left with? Human suffering for its own sake. As I've said throughout, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=441.2s)]
*  no crime in history has been so confessed to on so many times, so shamelessly and so unapologetically. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=445.84s)]
*  Both Antony Blinken and Joe Biden belong in jail. They are bloodsame monsters. And indeed, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=453.28s)]
*  at this press conference, there was someone there to remind Blinken of who he really is [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=458.79999999999995s)]
*  and how he will be remembered by history. At the same time, we strengthen America's robust sanctions [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=463.67999999999995s)]
*  regime on Iran and delivered on President Biden's commitment. You will forever be known as bloody [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=470.88s)]
*  Blinken, Secretary of Genocide. You have the blood of hundreds of thousands of innocent people [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=478.16s)]
*  on your hands. We have spent a year defending you, Biden, to appeal to your humanity in front of [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=485.76000000000005s)]
*  your house. We bring you letters. We've held car rallies. The blood of innocent civilians of children [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=494.8s)]
*  is on your hands. We will not forget. We will not forget. We will hold you accountable. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=502.8s)]
*  So do we continue. At the same time, we strengthen America's robust sanctions regime on Iran. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=520.24s)]
*  A genocide committed in plain sight. That is a fact which must never be forgotten. This has not [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=527.2s)]
*  been subtle. It has not been disguised. There is infinitely more evidence than is needed to establish [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=531.6s)]
*  the depth and gravity of this crime. Please like and subscribe. As I've been discussing, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=535.6800000000001s)]
*  we're expanding this operation. I'm hiring a brilliant video and social media professional [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=542.16s)]

*  fascism. TikTok, et cetera, is where it's going to be at. So obviously, I'll keep doing content on [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzzdz5dBJ1U&t=583.6s)]
