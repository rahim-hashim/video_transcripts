# Germany Arrests Jewish Activists, Shuts Down Palestine Congress, Acts Deranged
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1si1pzTszE)
*  This unbelievably disturbing story is so revealing about the age in which we live,
*  in which the world, as it should be, has been turned upside down.
*  Yesterday, the Palestine Congress was due to take place in Berlin, in which a range of figures,
*  Palestinian, Jewish, public intellectuals like Yanis Varoufakis, were due to speak.
*  The Congress was based around exposing the reality of Israeli crimes in Gaza,
*  crimes aided and abetted by Germany, which is Israel's second biggest arms dealer
*  at the United States, to supporting the Palestinian cause and advancing a just and lasting peace,
*  making sure, of course, that Palestinian voices are front and centre.
*  Now, as I asked alongside other progressive figures, such as the Spanish leftist politician
*  Pablo Iglesias to sign a letter in support, important given the climate in Germany, I probably did so.
*  So what happened next? The German police shut it down. And it gets worse than that, as I'll explain.
*  So, only one speaker, Heb Jamal, a Palestinian American journalist, was allowed to speak
*  before the police shut the Congress down after Salman Abu Sitta, a Palestinian researcher in his late 80s,
*  spoke for a minute via video link. Let's watch that moment and the response of attendees.
*  You can see that they then cut off the power.
*  Over 2000 Berlin officers, an army, were involved in blocking access to the building,
*  taking down the live stream and cutting off the power.
*  Now, Jewish activists played a key role in organising this Congress.
*  One of them is Yudi Raz, who was then arrested along with at least two other Jewish activists.
*  Let's see him here being arrested by the Berlin police.
*  Well, indeed, to repeat that, you are taking a Jewish person and then you're talking about anti-Semitism.
*  We will talk about Germany's disproportionate crackdown on Jewish people shortly.
*  Now, another Jewish activist was arrested outside for holding a Jews Against Genocide banner.
*  Absolutely remarkable. According to the journalist James Jackson, the activist said the banner was rolled up
*  and the police targeted me after they saw my Jewish star necklace. We know who the anti-Semites are.
*  Well, I'm just going to be blunt about this. Let's just be very blunt.
*  The sight of German police officers dragging away Jewish citizens because they're speaking out against genocide,
*  well, that gives me the ick, which is an understatement. I'm only saying here what you're thinking.
*  It's a gut response, isn't it? In this case, Jewish activists being demonised as dangerous subversives
*  as they speak out against genocide and the German state comes crashing down on their shoulders.
*  You feel comfortable with that, do you? Really? Is that what washing away Germany's obscene sins looks like?
*  Really? This is also what happened. Ghassan Abu Sitta is a British Palestinian reconstructive surgeon.
*  I was honoured to share a platform with him at a conference organised on Gaza by the charity Warne1 in London at the end of February.
*  Now, he spent the first few weeks of Israel's onslaught in Gaza, treating those maimed and mutilated by the Israeli military
*  and bearing witness to unimaginable horror. And he's offered crucial public evidence about the horror unleashed against the people of Gaza,
*  underlining the huge respect he has rightly accumulated. Glasgow University just elected him as their rector.
*  He won 80% of the vote. He's actually the nephew of Salman Abu Sitta, the speaker I previously mentioned,
*  whose video link speech was shut down by the German police. Now, he was due to speak at the Palestine Congress himself,
*  but he was detained and questioned at Berlin Airport for three hours and then banned from entering the country.
*  He was also told that he was banned from recording any videos or gauging in any political activity in Germany.
*  Indeed, he couldn't even record videos which could be shown at events in Germany. Listen to what I'm saying here.
*  Obscene doesn't really do justice to this, does it?
*  Now, as he rightly wrote, invited to address a conference at Berlin about my work in Gaza hospitals during the present conflict.
*  The German government has forcibly prevented me from entering the country.
*  Silencing a witness to genocide before the International Court of Justice adds to Germany's complicity in the ongoing massacre.
*  Well, indeed, Germany shutting up, silencing witnesses to horrors that Germany is facilitating.
*  Now, Yanis Varoufakis, the former Greek finance minister, politician, writer, someone who's appeared on this channel many times,
*  or on Good Egg, has now also been banned by Germany's interior ministry from carrying out any political activity in Germany,
*  including speaking via Zoom. Let's listen to Yanis Varoufakis.
*  Hello, this is Yanis Varoufakis with a message for my friends in Germany in particular, but not just in Germany.
*  Do you know that the German interior ministry has just issued me with a ban?
*  I've been banned from entering Germany. And indeed, if that were not enough, I've been banned from talking to you via Zoom.
*  What it did through a video message like this, the threat being that if I dare to do it, exactly what I'm doing now,
*  that I will be tried in Germany for breaking German law. Why?
*  Because of a speech that I published yesterday on my blog calling for universal human rights in Israel-Palestine,
*  a speech that we were banned, I was banned from delivering, in the Palestine Congress in Berlin,
*  which the police, in its infinite wisdom, entered the venue and violently disbanded.
*  So my question to my German friends, to Germans in general, whether you agree with me or disagree with me, doesn't matter.
*  Once you have a look at that particular speech, take a moment to read it or to listen to the video on my blog post or on dm25.org.
*  Is this in your name? Is this something that you feel comfortable happening in your democracy?
*  From my perspective, this is essentially the death knell of the prospects, the prospects of democracy in the Federal Republic of Germany.
*  Look at the speech, read it and tell me if I'm wrong. Copy that.
*  Now, bear in mind, by the way, that this is all happening under a nominally sort of centre-left government.
*  It's a government headed by the Social Democrats. Their leader, Olaf Scholz, is the Chancellor of Germany
*  in coalition with the Green Party, although the centre-right free Democrats are also part of this traffic-like coalition.
*  Nancy Faeser is the Federal Minister of the Interior and she has declared,
*  It is good that the Berlin police have announced a tough crackdown on the so-called Palestine Congress in Berlin.
*  So just to interject for a minute, I always find the passive aggressive use of so-called really good music.
*  What does she mean so-called? It is just called the Palestine Congress. Weird.
*  She adds, We are keeping a very close eye on the Islamist scene.
*  What the hell is this person talking about? It's just defamatory nonsense from the German state.
*  This was a congress organised predominantly by leftists with the central involvement of German-Jewish activists, some of whom were arrested.
*  So what is she, Nancy Faeser, not Jewish, saying these kippa-wearing Jewish activists are part of what? The Islamist scene.
*  Is this what she's saying? Well, she is saying that. Sorry, just to be clear, that was rhetorical. That's what she's saying.
*  Now, you see, when authorities start waging war on obvious truth in such a blatant, flagrant and shameless way, their legitimacy is in a lot of trouble.
*  She goes on to say, Anyone who spreads Islamist propaganda and hatred against Jews must know that this will be prosecuted quickly and consistently.
*  We need immediate tough action when such crimes are committed. Crimes.
*  Having a conference to talk about the mass slaughter of civilians, mostly women and children, is a crime.
*  What she's saying is just lies. This is a congress partly organised by Jewish activists taking on a genocidal war backed by Germany and supporting a just peace based on equality for Palestinian and Israeli citizens.
*  That's not Islamist propaganda or hatred against Jews. The German state is lying through its teeth and putting the safety, including of German-Jewish activists, at risk.
*  That's what these hideous defamatory statements obviously do. What she's talking about here is criminalising basic democratic rights, freedom of speech and freedom of assembly being portrayed as criminal.
*  Now, I'm currently working with some Jewish German journalists on what's actually happening there and there'll be a lot more on that to come.
*  But I would again cite the work of researcher Emily Disch-Becker earlier this year, whose research found that almost a third of those cancelled in Germany for supposed anti-Semitism have been
*  Jewish. Now, all of this has also been used to give legitimacy to the racist treatment of those of Muslim heritage.
*  That's the biggest ethnic minority in Germany. I'll just give you one example.
*  An Iranian German citizen got in touch with me. He's a gay man who fled Iran as a refugee.
*  And because he called for a ceasefire, non-Jewish Germans have denounced him as a Nazi, an Islamist supporter, telling him to go back to what they describe as his shithole country.
*  Again, to emphasise the nation he fled as a refugee. He's had Germans demanding he put the Israeli flag, again, not Jewish Germans, non-Jewish Germans, demanding he put the Israeli flag on the door of the shop he works in.
*  He's scared he's going to lose his job. Well, let's be clear.
*  The idea that this is atoning for Germany's genocide of past is deranged. Germany being complicit in genocide.
*  Germany clamping down on Jews, arresting them, persecuting them for opposing genocide, deplatforming them, menacing their jobs successfully in some cases and more on that soon.
*  Germany whipping up a racist firestorm against their biggest ethnic minority.
*  Germany sending police officers to shut down the basic democratic rights of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.
*  Germany banning people from doing any political activity in their country.
*  Does that sound to you like Germany atoning for its past?
*  Let's just be clear here. Germany is using all of this to offer legitimacy to its racism, genocidal complicity and naked authoritarianism.
*  It's a moral and a political disgrace and we all need to speak out.
*  Funny, isn't it, how cancel culture, that whole narrative, died a death when all this began.
*  How often do you hear people talking about cancel culture anymore?
*  Because the people who use cancel culture as a narrative are the very people now pushing to silence and deplatform and fire people.
*  Now, I would know I was involved in a firestorm the other week when I said that the German state was forcing others to pay for its own obscene crimes,
*  which it is, every day since I said that, seemingly, the German state has resolved to prove my point.
*  But finally, something I want to end on.
*  The apologists for Israel's genocidal campaigns are trying to silence those who oppose this historic crime.
*  Smears, lies, distortions, deflections, deplatforming, sacking, arresting, clamping down on basic democratic rights.
*  Well, guess what? It's not working.
*  It's not working. In Germany, which has resorted to the most repressive measures of any of these Western nations,
*  with a media climate which has hidden and justified Israeli crimes,
*  a poll at the end of March found 69% of German citizens thought Israel's military actions in Gaza were unjustified.
*  Such polling is found across the Western world, including a new poll which finds more Americans than not think Israel is committing genocide.
*  Those apologists for this historic crime, they're losing, badly, catastrophically.
*  The gap between the media and the political elites and public opinion is catastrophically big.
*  Something's got to give. That's why they're doubling down more and more on lies, smears and repression.
*  Well, guess what? I don't think it's going to work, guys.
*  The crime is too big, too obscene and too shameless. I don't think they're going to get away with it. Not in the end.
*  Yeah, sure, they can use the machinery of the states and the power of the media to scare people, to intimidate people, to lie, to persecute people.
*  They can do all that. And they'll win short-term successes. But it's going to make it worse in the end for them.
*  Because public opinion is so overwhelmingly on our side.
*  And in the end, given people are already awake to the obscene crime being committed, those who tried to silence the very people who were trying to stop the genocide,
*  the people who tried to silence those people, they're going to get damned.
*  And they're going to suffer terrible consequences, their careers, their reputations and the rest.
*  In some cases, I think they're going to go to prison. I'm still convinced people are going to go to prison over this.
*  I don't think the impunity the Israelis today and their defenders have is going to last.
*  I think it's going to dissolve. I mean, you can see that in terms of how public opinion is shifting.
*  And I think the panics realisation amongst Israel's cheerleaders is beginning to set in.
*  Yes, as things stand, you are silencing people, you're intimidating people, you're persecuting people, but you're going to lose.
*  And that's no comfort to the Palestinian people as they are slaughtered in their tens of thousands, which is why we have to keep speaking up.
