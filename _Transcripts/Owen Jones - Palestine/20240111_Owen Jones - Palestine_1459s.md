Video Description: A witch-hunt against Palestinian solidarity is sweeping the Western world - but nowhere is more severe than Germany. The German state is compelling artists to sign a definition of antisemitism weaponised by the Right to shut down criticisms of the Israeli state's behaviour - that is, if they want to protect their livelihoods. As the German far-right rises, the establishment courages the idea that the real danger to Jews comes from the left and Palestinian solidarity activists - including Jewish activists.

This is the world turned on its head. So I'm delighted to talk to German-Israeli author Tomer Dotan-Dreyfus who speaks with huge moral clarity, and tells the truth about what's really going on.

# German-Israeli Writer Takes Apart Gaza Witch-Hunt - w/ Tomer Dotan-Dreyfus
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU)
*  Hello, there has been a deliberate attempt across the Western world to intimidate those standing with the Palestinian people, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=0.0s)]
*  those opposing obviously the great atrocities currently being committed. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=6.74s)]
*  What's actually very perverse about that is this form of McCarthyism has targeted Jewish people, for example, in the name of [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  protecting Jewish people, the world has been turned completely upside down. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=17.3s)]
*  Now, with that in mind, I'm really delighted to be joined again by Tomer Doton-Dreyfus. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=22.36s)]
*  We talked actually back in October, not long after all this this particular round of [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=27.44s)]
*  intense horror began. He's a brilliant German Israeli writer. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=33.28s)]
*  He's been involved in the peace movement in Germany. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  And what's happening in Germany is, I think a lot of people think it's particularly extreme and it is, but it is symptomatic of [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=40.88s)]
*  what's happening in many different countries. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=47.08s)]
*  So, Tomer, it's great to be joined by you again. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=49.32s)]
*  Hello. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=51.2s)]
*  Hi, hello. Thank you for inviting me again. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=52.0s)]
*  I want to talk to you about a new development, I guess, which I think really is a warning, actually. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=54.68s)]
*  And it centres, for those who don't remember, there was a definition on antisemitism, which was formulated by the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=59.56s)]
*  International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=69.24s)]
*  The actual top definition itself, the actual key definition, I think, is something no one really had an objection to. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=70.84s)]
*  I think various Jewish scholars who didn't think it was particularly, you know, it didn't go into the proper detail of [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=77.11999999999999s)]
*  antisemitism, but it had a series of examples and two of them related to Israel. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=83.16s)]
*  Just do you want to talk about what's happening with that in mind? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=88.56s)]
*  I just wanted to give a preamble about what we're talking about there in terms of what the government and the authorities are [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=92.16s)]
*  planning in Germany. And hello, Eamon. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=99.28s)]
*  So what happens recently is that in the state of Berlin, the cultural ministry has decided to make it mandatory for [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=101.6s)]
*  artists and cultural workers to sign a certain clause agreeing to the guidelines of this definition. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=112.48s)]
*  This definition has been weaponised and instrumentalised many times in the past by right-wing governments, far-right [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  organisations and groups to tackle or to silence pro-Palestinian activists, solidarity with Palestinian movements. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=134.48000000000002s)]
*  And this has come so far that even the person who actually drafted this definition of antisemitism has [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  come forward in The Guardian four years ago and wrote a piece saying, I drafted the definition that the right wing is now [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  instrumentalising for their agendas. And yet there has been almost no debate regarding this definition in the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=167.52s)]
*  Berliner Senat. There was no mention of the other option, the Jerusalem Declaration of Antisemitism, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=177.6s)]
*  that was drafted in 2019 as an opposition to this one, which by the way does not claim that there is no [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=189.04s)]
*  antisemitism in these movements, only that you cannot accuse them inherently of being antisemitic, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=198.32s)]
*  which is something that the fans of Aira Definition are doing. And what it creates is an atmosphere in [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=206.48s)]
*  which, well, in Germany you do rely quite a lot on state funding. So if you don't sign that as an [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=216.88s)]
*  artist and you're not eligible to get state funding, you might lose your livelihood, you might lose your [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=225.44s)]
*  income, you might not be invited to certain institutions to do readings, exhibitions and so on. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=232.16s)]
*  People have already been cancelled based on that, exhibitions and events. But because it's a clause [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=238.8s)]
*  and not a law, it creates a situation where these institutes are policing themselves. So [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=246.56s)]
*  they can always say, we're not really limiting freedom of speech because we didn't make it illegal, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=257.2s)]
*  but they created a situation where you're just not going to be invited anywhere. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=263.52s)]
*  So in a way it's limitation of freedom of speech de facto, but not the euro. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=268.24s)]
*  So what this does basically is, you're an artist, and I should say, by the way, there's loud building [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=272.88s)]
*  work going on, which is why I try to keep my questions relatively pithy to the delight of my [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=280.32s)]
*  audience, because I keep silencing myself, which is relevant to the conversation we're talking about, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=283.84s)]
*  people being silenced. But in terms of this, artists, this is the issue. We know throughout [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=288.96s)]
*  history artists often take a political stand, art and politics are often things which are interchangeable. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=296.96s)]
*  A lot of people's art is actually about expressing their passion about certain issues in society, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=301.76s)]
*  always has been. So what this means in practice, artists do rely on state funding and what they'll [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=307.28s)]
*  do is they'll worry, they'll panic about whether or not their careers, their livelihoods are at risk, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  so they won't speak out. And if they do, they're threatened with their livelihoods being affected. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=320.0s)]
*  Yeah, it creates a huge gray zone in which you just, you don't know if what you're saying is [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=323.76s)]
*  going to cost you your income or not, so you just prefer not to say it. And we've seen this a lot in [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=330.88s)]
*  recent years in Germany, when we look at how language is shifting around this topic, right? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=336.96s)]
*  There was a decision of the German parliament, the Bundestag in 2019, on state funding for [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=343.92s)]
*  people who are in proximity of BDS, and they've decided to take this funding away from people. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=352.56s)]
*  But in this constellation, we have to ask ourselves what is the meaning of the word [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=360.56s)]
*  proximity? What does it mean? The meaning is we don't have to even prove that you are a member [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=365.44s)]
*  of a BDS group. We can just rely on people who claim that you tweeted something. So it creates [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=371.36s)]
*  this whole atmosphere of spying on your neighbors that is not very fruitful for artists and for [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=377.6s)]
*  cultural workers to live in. Or for example, a cultural center in the neighborhood of Neukölln, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=387.92s)]
*  it's a traditionally neighborhood that has a relatively high percentage of Palestinian refugees [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=396.0s)]
*  and other immigrants. And there was a cultural center there that was shut down because of what [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=403.12s)]
*  they referred to as hidden antisemitism. By the way, because they agreed to host an event of the [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=409.92s)]
*  Jewish Voice for Peace. So they were accused by the cultural ministry of Berlin, hidden antisemitism, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=417.76s)]
*  and their funding was taken away and they had to shut down. And the meaning of hidden, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=424.24s)]
*  in hidden antisemitism is exactly that. I don't have to prove any antisemitism because I'm talking [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=429.52s)]
*  about a hidden one. And so language in Germany is shifting around this topic to really worry some [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=434.48s)]
*  degree, I think. Just so people know, BDS, which most people do, is Boycott, Direction and Sanctions, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=444.0s)]
*  which is a movement which models itself on the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=452.08s)]
*  This is also about who gets invited to events, doesn't it? So what happens is organizers maybe [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=457.84s)]
*  a festival or some sort of event, they might invite certain writers and then they get disinvited. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=464.08s)]
*  I know lots of writers this has happened to. So yeah, go for it. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=470.64s)]
*  Sorry. It happened also before this clause was sealed on Monday. It happened to Adania Shibley, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=475.84s)]
*  Palestinian author that wrote a novel and won a prize in the Frankfurt Book Fair recently and [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=483.2s)]
*  was cancelled. I think we might have talked about that. It happened to an anthology of Arabic poems [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=489.76s)]
*  translated to German, an event that was cancelled in Berlin. There is a lot. There is even in the [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=497.68s)]
*  meantime an Instagram account called the Archive of Silence where you can actually go and see all [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=503.36s)]
*  the events in Germany that has been cancelled. Forensic Architecture were disinvited from [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=508.88s)]
*  a university of Aachen. Forensic Architecture is an organization looking into specific [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=515.76s)]
*  events and looking at them from different angles and different perspectives to determine [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=528.2399999999999s)]
*  who done it and how. They researched among other things also the [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=535.52s)]
*  missile on the hospital at the beginning of the war that was unclear if it was Hamas or Israel [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=545.12s)]
*  and so on. They looked into it and proved with their methods that it was an Israeli bombing. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=550.72s)]
*  They got disinvited and so on and so forth. There are many, many examples of that. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=560.24s)]
*  I mentioned at the beginning the question of Jewish people who have been speaking out and [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=565.12s)]
*  throughout the Western world, actually, you can see this particularly in the US, I would say, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=570.08s)]
*  a generation particularly of younger Jews who have very much taken part of the leadership of the [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=574.96s)]
*  Solidarity Movement with the Palestinian people. Obviously there's always been an overrepresentation [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=579.76s)]
*  of Jewish people in movements for liberation and social justice which is something the far right [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=585.04s)]
*  particularly targeted Jews for in the early 20th century onwards. That continues to be the case [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=589.04s)]
*  today in movements in support of Palestinian liberation. Many of those Jewish voices are now [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=595.36s)]
*  being targeted by this very McCarthyism and that is happening in Germany, isn't it? That Jewish [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=599.84s)]
*  people are being targeted in the name of protecting Jewish people. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=605.52s)]
*  Yeah, look, Germany has a very specific image of what Jews are like or what Jews should be like. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=611.84s)]
*  That is supporting Israel maybe with a mild criticism but not too much and looking in a [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=622.0799999999999s)]
*  certain way. Once you doubt or break this image because of, for example, being too critical towards [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=632.24s)]
*  Israel or in any other way that they would imagine you'd be, then you're not even considered really [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=644.08s)]
*  Jewish anymore. Which is really appalling how Germans would explain to me, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=658.48s)]
*  would send me messages and explain to me why the Jewish voice for peace are not really Jewish. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=667.36s)]
*  Which is anti-Semitic. I mean it's completely, wantonly anti-Semitic, isn't it? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=672.88s)]
*  Exactly. I mean, they, of all nations of the world, I think they should be the last ones to [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=676.96s)]
*  determine who's Jewish and who's not and who has the right to speak for Jews and who's not. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=683.36s)]
*  It's in all the state structure there is only one organization in Germany that is allowed [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=691.28s)]
*  to represent Jews. The Central Committee for Jews in Germany, a very conservative organization, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=696.72s)]
*  and others just don't have the same status. So if we'd have many organizations, many Jewish [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=703.76s)]
*  organizations in the UK or in the US, in Germany there's legally only one. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=709.92s)]
*  And it's not democratically elected, like the president and the Grimmium and so on. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=715.4399999999999s)]
*  So yeah, that's where we're at. I mean one particularly famous example [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=725.52s)]
*  centers on Marsha Gessen, who is a Jewish author of Russian Heritage, I think US-Russian now, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=730.24s)]
*  but can you just tell me a little bit about that particular example because it blew up, obviously. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=738.16s)]
*  Yeah, so Marsha Gessen was supposed to get the Hannah Arendt Prize from the city of Bremen and [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=743.12s)]
*  the Heinrich Böll Foundation, a foundation that is close to the Green Party, the party traditionally [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=750.16s)]
*  on the left of the political spectrum, debatable, but okay. And the prize was, they decided to [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=758.32s)]
*  cancel at least first the prize and then they did get the prize but not a ceremony. Because of an [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=770.24s)]
*  article they wrote in the New Yorker where they compared Gaza to Jewish ghettos in the Second World [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=779.92s)]
*  War. And the argument was that this comparison is inappropriate and we can't have that in our [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=787.84s)]
*  public discourse in Germany, to which they replied that without comparing anything to it, without [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=800.0s)]
*  being able to compare anything to the Holocaust, we are actually taking the Holocaust outside of [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=811.76s)]
*  history, outside of time. And if we set our goal to never repeat it, we have to be able to compare [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=818.7199999999999s)]
*  to it in order to realize that it did happen in history, it did happen on this planet. And because [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=828.56s)]
*  it did happen, it can happen again and we have to identify certain processes that might lead there. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=836.72s)]
*  So whether one agrees with the comparison or not, I think their argument as to why it should be [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=843.6s)]
*  okay to compare to begin with is quite convincing. As you said, a quick apology there, because I think [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=851.12s)]
*  as you got their pronouns correct, Marsha Gessen is non-binary and goes by the pronouns they then. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=860.48s)]
*  I'm not sure if I used the correct pronouns, so just making sure I clarify that's obviously very [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=864.72s)]
*  important to get that correct. In terms of just the irresponsibility of what's happening here, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=868.96s)]
*  because antisemitism is real, very real, and it is rising. And antisemitism is so woven into European [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=874.72s)]
*  culture in lots of ways people aren't often even conscious of, it goes back 2,000 years. And we [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=883.0400000000001s)]
*  need to be able to have a term which there was a consensus over what it actually means. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=889.6s)]
*  It's a matter of life and death, it's a very grave and serious issue. So I mean this just strikes me [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=896.24s)]
*  is the height of irresponsibility to have a situation where the term antisemitism becomes [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=902.64s)]
*  redefined and is used to shut down legitimate critiques of Israel and particularly at the [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=909.9200000000001s)]
*  moment the current horror when actually it should have a very precise meaning which [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=916.0s)]
*  we all have to agree on because antisemitism is one of the great evils. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=923.12s)]
*  Yeah, I think antisemitism should be fought against and I think it's counterproductive [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=928.32s)]
*  to focus on the movements in solidarity with Palestinians at the same time as the far-right [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=935.12s)]
*  party in Germany is crossing the 22% in the polls. Just this morning people of this party have been [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=945.36s)]
*  caught meeting with neo-Nazis and others planning a massive deportation of millions of people from [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=955.84s)]
*  Germany once they take power. This is crazy, these are news that seem like they've been taken from [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=965.6800000000001s)]
*  end of the 1920s where they just planned on what's gonna happen when they take power [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=974.4799999999999s)]
*  but when you look at the polls this is not very far-fetched. They are second biggest party in [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=982.0799999999999s)]
*  Germany, 14 points above the SPD, the German Labour and this is a threat. Antisemitism from [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=987.3599999999999s)]
*  the right wing is an actual threat to our livelihoods and to our being in Germany [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=998.64s)]
*  and at this time to put a focus on people mourning their families and friends who are being [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1006.16s)]
*  killed in Gaza is more than irresponsible. The idea that this is protecting Jews, an idea that [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1018.48s)]
*  unfortunately a lot of Jews actually also believe in is bizarre to me I have to say [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1027.36s)]
*  because one day this is going to be over, it's only a question of time but obviously they're [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1034.56s)]
*  going to be eventually a ceasefire and we are going to see all the pictures and all the horrors [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1042.8799999999999s)]
*  and all the videos from Gaza that are not being released now and on this day the world is going [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1048.8799999999999s)]
*  to realise what has happened and we don't want the struggle against antisemitism to be connected [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1056.8s)]
*  with justifying those horrors. I don't think it's going to be good for Jews and this is obviously [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1063.28s)]
*  just a secondary worry because I'm worried about what's happening in Gaza but that's the topic [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1069.9199999999998s)]
*  we're talking about. It's important, I mean obviously it's still very important to talk about. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1075.76s)]
*  I mean just all night as the world turned upside down, well we can see can't we, the regime of [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1081.12s)]
*  Viktor Orban in Hungary which behaves in a gratuitously antisemitic way where he does a [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1086.24s)]
*  blatantly antisemitic campaign about essentially George Soros, the Hungarian born Jewish [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1092.32s)]
*  financier on the basis that he's this kind of sinister Jew pulling the strings of the opposition [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1098.24s)]
*  and at the same time is a close ally of Israel and therefore you know can say well actually [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1103.2s)]
*  we're not, how can we be antisemitic, we're big allies of Israel. And adopted the irodefinition [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1108.88s)]
*  of antisemitism as well as the Trump administration and so on. I mean on that [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1113.44s)]
*  just I think it's such an important point you make about just the world turned upside down and how [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1119.3600000000001s)]
*  dangerous that actually is because the far right is on the rise everywhere. There's every chance [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1124.3200000000002s)]
*  by the way Donald Trump will be back in the White House at the end of this year which will be a huge [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1129.6000000000001s)]
*  boost for far-right forces but across the you know in Austria as well the far right are leading in [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1134.0s)]
*  the polls. In France there's it's not you cannot rule out the idea Marine Le Pen becoming president [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1138.88s)]
*  in the next election, every election she gets closer and closer. We can see in you know all [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1144.3200000000002s)]
*  over Europe various far-right formations so we end up with a situation where the claim is well the [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1150.0800000000002s)]
*  real racist, the real antisemites, the real threats to Jews are those on the left, those who stand in [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1155.2s)]
*  solidarity with Palestine including Jewish people instead of any focus on the far right [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1161.44s)]
*  including in Germany itself which I think maybe we could learn one or two lessons from the [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1168.8s)]
*  experience of the far right. Where the far right probably is on the march everyone should be focusing [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1174.72s)]
*  on that threat and instead we're talking about the left being the dangerous racists. And we've seen [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1180.0s)]
*  that, we've seen that happening, we've seen that happening in this country where the far right was [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1184.8s)]
*  organizing and getting ready to take control in quite practical, was having already practical [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1189.92s)]
*  plans and parliament and politicians were pointing a finger at communists and saying well they are [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1197.76s)]
*  the problem, look at them, look at what they are doing. We've been in this movie before, we've seen [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1203.68s)]
*  it you know and I just wish it doesn't end the same way it ended last time that it happened. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1209.2s)]
*  And just finally on that you know the German state was responsible for the biggest crime committed [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1217.12s)]
*  against the Jewish people ever. I mean obviously it was the culmination of many centuries of [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1225.84s)]
*  horrible antisemitic you know violence pogroms and blood libel and all the rest of it which [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1230.7199999999998s)]
*  Jews suffered for many centuries in many different European countries but it really was obviously [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1236.8799999999999s)]
*  the culmination of all of that. Two-thirds of European Jews exterminated and as well and I'm [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1241.12s)]
*  not saying this because I believe in collective guilt, collective guilt is a very dangerous thing [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1247.04s)]
*  to believe in, you should never believe in it. So I don't mean in terms of acting upon this but it [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1250.4799999999998s)]
*  is a historical fact that most of the German people historically the research suggests knew [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1253.9199999999998s)]
*  about the Holocaust when it was happening. Now as a consequence you know the German state has said [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1260.3999999999999s)]
*  we have a specific historical responsibility because of what happened in World War Two and in [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1265.76s)]
*  in a sense you can't argue with that. I mean you can see that you should act if you're gonna you [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1271.6s)]
*  know you're gonna have if you're gonna be responsible as a state for such an unbelievably [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1275.84s)]
*  horrendous crime then you should draw lessons and act on them. But that what they've done I would [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1281.44s)]
*  argue or lots of people argue is say well we're gonna make other people pay the price for what [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1289.2s)]
*  the German state did. What do you think about that? I think that they are very good in [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1294.96s)]
*  remembering and reparations as long as they don't really have to pay the price for it. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1301.92s)]
*  They are not the ones that have to give up land, they're not the ones who have to even when they [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1307.52s)]
*  gave money you know even in the reparations agreement from the 50s it was money to Israel [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1314.8s)]
*  so that Israel can buy weapons and infrastructure from the German industry was boosting the German [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1321.84s)]
*  industry and in return Israel promised them that the Holocaust survivors in Israel would not be [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1327.4399999999998s)]
*  eligible to sue Germany independently. So it was a very messy, very dirty deal and they are on the [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1332.8s)]
*  one hand presenting themselves as world champions of memory and memory culture and all this kind of [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1346.32s)]
*  stuff on the other hand they have turned memory culture into the the the realm through which they [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1351.6s)]
*  can find their nationalism again. German nationalism today is around supporting Israel, it's around [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1360.24s)]
*  this historical responsibility and their interpretation of it and one could also say that [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1368.3999999999999s)]
*  because it's not very legitimate to manifest German nationalism after the second world war [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1378.24s)]
*  they're doing it through Israel, they're waving the Israeli flags because Israel is the [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1386.32s)]
*  the country of the victims so how can they be wrong? [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1392.88s)]
*  I think it's really powerful stuff and as we discussed I think obviously things are particularly [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1397.76s)]
*  extreme in Germany at the moment and we need to be calling this out. I do think it's a [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1402.88s)]
*  you know the world in which we live the real dangerous hateful extremists are those who oppose [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1410.8s)]
*  a mass slaughter and the people of moderation are the ones who support a mass slaughter which is [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1415.2s)]
*  killed at this point over 10 000 children let alone so many other innocent civilians but it's [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1421.36s)]
*  so important that we talk about this and the voice of people like yourself Tom is so important [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1426.72s)]
*  right now and you speak with such people are going to get sick of me using this term because [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1430.56s)]
*  I keep using it in all the probably every video I do but moral clarity and moral clarity is [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1434.48s)]
*  more clarity so important at a time like this it really is and you've spoken with huge moral [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1439.28s)]
*  clarity and which I hugely appreciate so please for those watching or listening whatever for [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1443.44s)]
*  whatever medium you're watching this or listening on listen please like subscribe share this video [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1450.32s)]
*  but Tom as ever thank you so much for your voice thank you very much for having me [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Hdn4XeAOU&t=1454.8s)]
