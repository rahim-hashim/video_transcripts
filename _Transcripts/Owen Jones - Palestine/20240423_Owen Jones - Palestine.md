# Media Is Demonising Gaza Protesters - To Cover Up This Crime
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeZd23S0KIU)
*  There are two words in the English language which, when used in combination,
*  should signal to you that an obscene crime of historic proportions is taking place.
*  Those two words? Mass graves. Now the soil of Gaza is filled with mass graves,
*  and along with the repeated genocidal statements of Israeli leaders,
*  that should have defined western media coverage of Israel's onslaught. But it hasn't. Instead we have
*  more attention, indeed more anger, about those who were protesting against those who caused
*  these mass graves in the first place. What should be leading the headlines right now are mass graves
*  containing hundreds of bodies at two of Gaza's largest hospitals. Well, they were before Israel
*  launched its attacks on them and essentially destroyed the medical system of Gaza itself,
*  a genocidal act. Now yesterday, the New York Times had four prominently displayed articles
*  about US college protests. Guess how many they had about mass graves in Gaza?
*  Zero. It really sums up the coverage of this crime since the start, doesn't it? Lies by emission,
*  more scrutiny of those who oppose the slaughter than those who are actually executing the slaughter.
*  Let me just stop for a moment. Mass graves at hospitals. Say it out loud maybe, if simply
*  thinking it doesn't allow you to fully absorb the horror. Mass graves at hospitals. Now let's be
*  clear, if a state hostile to the west, not an ally of the west, was responsible for these mass graves,
*  they wouldn't just be the main headlines in newspapers or broadcast media, they would be
*  deafening, overwhelming calls for western military intervention. No question about that. Far less
*  in terms of crime happening in Kosovo, notwithstanding the terrible crimes that did
*  happen there in the late 1990s in the time of Slobodan Milošević's regime in Serbia. They just
*  weren't on this scale, but they were used at the time to justify NATO military intervention.
*  Let's read a report published by the United Nations with a truly horrendous headline.
*  Mass graves in Gaza show victims' hands were tied, says UN rights office. It goes on. Disturbing
*  reports continue to emerge about mass graves in Gaza in which Palestinian victims were reportedly
*  found stripped naked with their hands tied, prompting renewed concerns about possible war
*  crimes amid ongoing Israeli airstrikes, the UN human rights office said on Tuesday. They described
*  hundreds of bodies buried deep in the ground covered with waste. The report says a total of
*  283 bodies were recovered at NASA Hospital in Khan Yunis, which Israeli troops recently withdrew
*  from after virtually wiping the entire city from the face of the earth, with the vast majority of
*  buildings there estimated to have been severely damaged or entirely destroyed. According to
*  Ravini Sander Sarni, the spokesperson for the UN High Commission of Human Rights, among the
*  deceased were allegedly older people, women and wounded, while others were found tied with their
*  hands, tied and stripped of their clothes. They also described more bodies found at Al-Shifa
*  Hospital, previously the biggest hospital in Gaza, but now ruined by Israel's military assault,
*  with UN workers who assessed the site, declaring it was an empty shell with most equipment reduced
*  to ashes. They discussed their 30 bodies buried in two graves in the courtyard of Al-Shifa Hospital,
*  one in front of the emergency building, the other in front of the dialysis building.
*  Sander Sarni added, there are reports that the hands of some of those bodies were also tied,
*  adding that there could be many more victims, despite the claims by Israeli defence forces to
*  have killed 200 Palestinians during the Al-Shifa medical complex operation.
*  As UN Human Rights Chief Volker Turk put it, the intentional killing of civilians,
*  detainees and others who are au de combat is a war crime. Au de combat means a soldier who can't
*  fight because they're sick, wounded, captured, incapacitated, they can't be harmed because they
*  don't pose a threat against international law as a war crime. According to Anastasia Moran,
*  an official at the International Rescue Committee, a total of around 500 bodies are now expected to
*  be recovered from this mass grave at Nasser Hospital in Gaza. 500 bodies. Bear in mind,
*  Gaza's pre-war population is around 2.2 million, so if you think of a country the size of Britain,
*  67 million people there, or the United States, well over 300 million,
*  the impact of 500 bodies being found in a mass grave here would be huge. Gaza's much
*  smaller in terms of population. Now there are two more mass graves at Nasser Hospital they haven't
*  even started on. There were so many missing health workers and patients, that Anastasia says,
*  there were so many missing health workers and patients that are likely in these mass graves.
*  Al Jazeera's correspondent, Hani Mahmood, reports that Gaza's civil defence say the
*  bodies include children, women, medical staff, wounded people and patients. He added that medical
*  staff and evacuees who had managed to leave the hospital before the Israeli army's withdrawal
*  had described scenes of horror, mass killings and arrests to the point the entire hospital
*  turned from a place of healing into a massive graveyard. The civil defence also report signs
*  of field executions, that some of those killed had been shot in the head, handcuffed, wearing
*  detainee uniforms as well as doctors still wearing their scrubs. That's people who clearly were not
*  posing any threat and therefore no justification for their execution. They also report that they
*  don't know if some of the bodies were buried alive or executed prior to their burial.
*  Now I've seen photos of some of the heavily decomposed bodies recovered, obviously horrific
*  to watch. You can see catheters, various hospital tubes coming out of their bodies,
*  patients gowns, that kind of thing. Now it's reported some bodies of family members killed
*  in the grounds of the hospital back in January were buried by relatives as a temporary desperate
*  measure. Then the IDF exhumed bodies supposedly to determine whether any of the Israeli hostages
*  were among the dead, including taking them to Israel, then placed them in a mass grave.
*  Now we don't know how many of the bodies were buried by who, but it's self-evident that wherever
*  the circumstances is Israel's brutal assault, which is obviously the cause of this mass death,
*  and as I say, we're dealing with bodies with hands tied behind their backs.
*  Those people who are in either detainees gowns, for example, or hospital gowns, that kind of thing.
*  Now let's hear from these two mothers who were searching for their missing sons in these graves.
*  I came here for the fifth day looking for the body of my son Jemel. They told us there's a mass grave
*  located here and every day I come here to identify the body, but unfortunately I haven't found my
*  son's remains.
*  I hope that anyone who knows anything about my son will inform me or inform the officials.
*  I can no longer bear it. Every day I come here and search. I come two or three times.
*  I've searched for him in many places.
*  It's just that, you know, the impact is important to talk about because Palestinians have been
*  dehumanized. And that's, I'm afraid, successful to a very large degree that even people who oppose
*  what's going on still find it hard to imagine Palestinians as people with lives of an equal worth
*  to others. It's a huge problem. This is what relies on that dehumanization and our media
*  helps legitimize it. Now local rescue workers report they're looking for the bodies of 400
*  people missing after the Israeli military left. Now let's hear from a journalist in the US asking
*  the State Department spokesperson about all this.
*  Massacres with 180 people including women, men and children that Israel has basically killed
*  those people. That's what they're saying. Are you aware of the report? Do you have any comment on
*  it? I've seen those reports and we are inquiring about it with the government of Israel.
*  Will the US press the Israelis to find out more about this? That's exactly what we're doing.
*  Okay. Yeah, well never any actual answers given here about these atrocities other. What we actually
*  need is an independent investigation into the circumstances of how these mass killings happened,
*  how each was killed. But of course Israel won't allow that. And meanwhile,
*  airstrikes continue to slaughter innocent people. Let's just listen to this report.
*  It has been a horrific 48 hours even by Gaza standards. 17 children and two women all from
*  the same extended family died when another Israeli airstrike flattened this building,
*  say Palestinians. Our team was shown pictures of some of them.
*  At the hospital, relatives mourned the children killed they say as they slept in their beds.
*  Again, just process that. 17 children and two women all from the same extended family killed by
*  Israeli airstrike. Just one atrocity among countless others. Those 17 kids being slaughtered.
*  I mean if 17 kids suffered violent deaths in your country, that would be the biggest news headline
*  for weeks. But in the case of Gaza, including those buried under the rubble,
*  it could be 20,000 kids killed. It's around 14,000 or so that we know about.
*  Now the brutal truth is that if the Western media and politicians saw Palestinians as
*  fellow human beings with lives of any worth at all, this obscenity would have been stopped
*  a very long time ago. And yet a proposed military assault on Ratha, where most of Gaza's surviving
*  population is sheltering, continues to be promised by Israel. Now Melanie Ward, who heads medical aid
*  for Palestinians, both her and that organization do an incredible job in the most impossible
*  circumstances, told an online media briefing there was no way possibly of doing that, that is an
*  onslaught against Gaza that will not be a human slaughter. She says there physically isn't enough
*  space for people in Ratha to head elsewhere. Now she says there's a humanitarian catastrophe on
*  just about every measure, whether you look at food, water or sanitation. Everywhere you go in Gaza,
*  the stench of war sewage follows you, she says. There are literally lakes of untreated human waste.
*  So many crimes committed. So many crimes to come. Some of the worst crimes of this century,
*  all with the complicity of our governments. That's why they're trying to make us angry
*  about protesters. Because those who protested this were right, devastatingly right, right in
*  the worst possible way. Because being right in these circumstances means death on an unimaginable
*  scale. And those who facilitated this obscenity know they are morally disgraced and they fear the
*  consequences for themselves and for the continued Western support for the Israeli state. And so they
*  try to distract us from trivialities like mass graves, to instead focus on those who tried to
*  stop these mass graves from happening in the first place. Don't let them make you forget that.
