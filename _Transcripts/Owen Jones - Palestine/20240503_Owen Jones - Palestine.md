# CNN DISGRACES Itself Over Gaza
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWJfXBP7Eg)
*  It's so easy isn't it to issue fiery denunciations of the likes of say Fox News.
*  That's the bogeyman of bias broadcasters isn't it. Like a pantomime we can all be with it.
*  So obviously propaganda, so obviously spreading falsehood, so vulgar. You want to make common
*  cause with a respectable American liberal and watch their eyes roll to the back of their heads
*  in shame and embarrassment? Just mention Fox News and bingo. CNN on the other hand,
*  that scene is respectable. Not propaganda from them, they're just straight down the line right?
*  Now that should always have been an illusion, but CNN have utterly disgraced themselves over Gaza.
*  Now I'm going to start by playing you an absolutely toxic segment from CNN. It's the sort
*  of propaganda you expect frankly from the news channel of a tin pot dictatorship which turns
*  reality on its head and tells you that up is down and black is white. The presenter behind it,
*  the network's chief political correspondent Dana Bash. Brace yourself,
*  make sure you're not in a too bad mood first. Let's have a listen shall we.
*  Welcome to Inside Politics, I'm Dana Bash. We start with destruction,
*  violence and hate on college campuses across the country.
*  This was the scene just a short while ago at the University of Wisconsin,
*  Madison. Police clashing with protesters, 12 people were arrested.
*  Thank you for asking about it.
*  Hours earlier protests rocked the University of Arizona where campus police used chemical
*  irritant munitions to remove protesters. Around the same time at UCLA, pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian
*  groups were attacking each other, hurling all kinds of objects, a wood pallet, fireworks,
*  parking cones, even a scooter. And before that the NYPD was able to clear Columbia University
*  after protesters barricaded themselves inside a campus building. 300 people were arrested at
*  Columbia and City College of New York. But it is unclear how many were actually students.
*  New York City Mayor Eric Adams warned this morning that professional outside agitators
*  are getting involved. There is a movement to radicalize young people and I'm not going to
*  wait until it's done and all of a sudden acknowledge the existence of it. This is a global
*  problem that young people are being influenced by those who are professionals at radicalizing
*  our children and I'm not going to allow that to happen as the mayor of the city of New York.
*  Many of these protests started peacefully with legitimate questions about the war. But in many
*  cases they lost the plot. They're calling for a ceasefire. Well there was a ceasefire on October
*  6th, the day before Hamas terrorists brutally murdered more than a thousand people inside Israel
*  and took hundreds more as hostages. This hour I'll speak to an American Israeli family whose son
*  is still held captive by Hamas since that horrifying day that brought us to this moment. You
*  don't hear the pro-Palestinian protesters talking about that. We will. Now protesting the way the
*  Israeli government, the Israeli prime minister is prosecuting the retaliatory war against Hamas is
*  one thing. Making Jewish students feel unsafe at their own schools is unacceptable and it is
*  happening way too much right now. I'm a UCLA student. I deserve to go here. We pay tuition.
*  This is our school and they're not letting me walk in. My class is over there. I want to use
*  that entrance. Well I can't take it. Will you let me go in? This could be over in a second. Just let
*  me and my friends go in. Again what you just saw is 2024 in Los Angeles. Harkening back to the 1930s
*  in Europe and I do not say that lightly. The fear among Jews in this country is palpable right now.
*  Ladies and gentlemen welcome to the glorious free press. Seriously if a disintegrating
*  dictatorship was facing mounting anti-government protests and put that kind of propaganda on their
*  state television channel I think they'd be pretty embarrassed. So let's start shall we. Firstly the
*  way this is framed and opened is clearly an attempt to make the point that protests against Israel's
*  genocide of war in Gaza are at the root of now one of his terrible violent disorder. There's no
*  sense of well these are peaceful protests with the right to protest being an essential democratic
*  right against something we can all agree surely involves an abominable level of human suffering
*  including the mass slaughter of children. You can certainly see in the abstracts why people
*  might object to that can't you? Now when it finally gets this segment to the University of
*  California Los Angeles UCLA she describes both Israel pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian groups were
*  attacking each other. Pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian groups were attacking each other. This is just a
*  straightforward deceit that is not what happened at all. What actually happened is that peaceful
*  protest by UCLA students against Israel's murderous onslaught against Gaza was brutally attacked by
*  pro-Israel thugs. That's what happened a pro-Israel mob of thugs. They turned up wearing masks clearly
*  not students certainly in most cases they threw fireworks and they physically assaulted students.
*  The scenes were horrific. In videos you can hear them variously screaming things like
*  second Nakba that is a reference to the mass violent expulsion of three quarters of a million
*  Palestinians mass ethnic cleansing which accompanied the foundation of Israel in 1948
*  along with around 15 000 Palestinians who were killed. Now according to the LA Times they
*  reportedly these pro-Israel thugs yelled racist homophobic and anti-muslim slurs they sprayed
*  beer mace ignited stink bombs and aimed green lasers in the eyes of protesters. Meanwhile the
*  police just stood and watched doing nothing for hours which even the spokesperson for the
*  California governor Gavin Newsom issued a statement saying this was unacceptable. So what on earth is
*  Darnabash doing by saying pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian groups were attacking each other?
*  If say she was walking down the street and got attacked by a MAGA cap wearing Trump supporter
*  would she regard it as acceptable framing if this was reported as a Trump supporter and CNN
*  reporter Darnabash attacking each other or would she regard that quite correctly as hideous gas
*  lighting given the context and the dynamics of what happened? She then goes on to spread more
*  insidious deceit. She says when talking about the arrested Columbia students that it's unclear how
*  many were actually students then refers to the New York City mayor Eric Adams that professional
*  outside agitators are getting involved. Honestly this is cliched stuff this is the sort of thing
*  again you hear from dictatorships. Now Darnabash undoubtedly sees herself as a serious journalist
*  and she should know that you don't simply regurgitate claims made by politicians who
*  are unreliable sources because they are politically hostile to protests they're describing. Where is
*  the evidence? Does she have any? Because journalists on the ground have repeatedly made clear that
*  simply isn't true that inside the protest they are students from all backgrounds including Jewish
*  students who played a pivotal role. Now on the other news channel MSNBC the mayor was asked about
*  these claims. Let's have a listen.
*  Two individuals there he offers up. As journalist Matt Binder points out he refuses to name them but
*  then references a person that the NYPD already confirmed wasn't arrested and wasn't even there.
*  To quote that famous phrase you wouldn't know her she goes to a different school.
*  It gets worse the NYPD then went on to say there was no why for a terrorist at Columbia protests.
*  Absolutely outrageous stuff there. This Matt Binder this reporter then cites New York reporter
*  Ali Bauman who posted that New York City hall sources told CBS New York that the why for the
*  known terrorists is with protesters on Columbia University campus. Oh I bet they briefed that
*  but then she just deleted it without explanation after lots of people called her out. As Matt Binder
*  says if you post obvious propaganda and then delete it after everyone calls you out you owe it to your
*  audience as a supposed journalist to explain exactly what happened here.
*  This part though the next part is just something else she says many of these protests started
*  peacefully with legitimate questions about the war but in many cases they lost the plot.
*  They're calling for a ceasefire where there was a ceasefire on October the 6th the day before
*  Hamas terrorists brutally murdered more than a thousand people inside Israel and took hundreds
*  more as hostages. Wow just wow. Now firstly I've always made it clear that terrible war crimes were
*  committed by Hamas and other armed groups on the 7th of October. Always made that clear. What she
*  is doing here is intentionally and willfully airbrushing all of the suffering of the Palestinian
*  people for generations and starting the clock on the 7th of October as there's no broader context
*  than that. No decades of mass violent ethnic cleansing like the Nakba which the protesters
*  sorry not protesters those thugs who attacked those peaceful protesters certainly knew about
*  because they'd be screaming about it. No decades of mass violent ethnic cleansing. No longest
*  belligerent occupation of modern times. No longest belligerent siege of modern times. No massive land
*  theft and illegal colonisation. No apartheid. No mass arbitrary incarceration of Palestinians including
*  children in military jails often with no charge whatsoever. No violence subjugation. Indeed
*  thousands of Palestinians were killed between 2008 and the 6th of October 2023. In fact of all of
*  those killed in the so-called Israel-Palestine conflict 96% were Palestinian up to the 6th of
*  October. Indeed if we're just talking about 2023 in the West Bank alone before the 7th of October
*  240 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank that year before the 7th of October. 40 of them
*  were children. If they'd been Israelis killed by Palestinian paramilitaries including 40 Israeli
*  children do you think Dana Bash would be calling her talking about a ceasefire? Would she describe
*  that as a ceasefire? No she wouldn't. She would call that a reign of terror against Israelis.
*  That's what she'd be talking about. Indeed if you had even a tenth of that amount of blood spilled
*  where Israelis have been the victims then there would have just been a military assault by the
*  Israeli state. I think we know that don't we? Now those saying there were a ceasefire on 6th of October
*  are just being racist. I'm not using racist lightly here. It's a very obvious thought experiment to
*  prove if that many Israelis had been killed by Palestinians last year before the 7th of October
*  would you call it a ceasefire? No you wouldn't. You only call it a ceasefire in these circumstances
*  because you don't think Palestinian life has equal worth. What other convincing explanation is there?
*  Please tell me I'd love to know because you just wouldn't be calling it a ceasefire in that context.
*  Of course you wouldn't. Bear in mind she's supposed to be an objective broadcast journalist by the way.
*  You probably look at this and think well she's like a polemicist, she's a pundit. No she's not.
*  She's their flagship reporter. She then says now protesting the way the Israeli government,
*  the Israeli prime minister is prosecuting the retaliatory war against Hamas is one thing.
*  Not even pretending is she? Wow. What she's discussing here, this retaliatory war against Hamas,
*  involves the mass slaughter of tens of thousands of Palestinians including those buried under the
*  rubble, at least 40 times more than the number of Israelis killed on the 7th of October.
*  Bear in mind the population of Gaza is over four times smaller. It includes the mass slaughter
*  of children with somewhere between 14,000 and 20,000 kids killed. Bear in mind we would all
*  agree that the 36 Israeli kids killed on the 7th of October was an unacceptable crime. What are
*  that many thousand Palestinian kids factoring in? The mass destruction of most of Gaza's
*  civilian infrastructure so it now looks like a different colour and texture when looked at
*  from space. The destruction of Gaza's entire healthcare system itself imposing a daily death
*  sentence on countless numbers of Palestinians. A manufactured famine involving the swiftest fall
*  of the nutritional status of a population ever recorded caused by a deliberate Israeli siege.
*  She calls this a retaliatory war against Hamas and suggests protests should be about the way
*  it's been prosecuted if they exist at all and the way we'd criticise, I don't know, how our
*  presidents approaching healthcare reform rather than one of the most murderous and destructive
*  military onslaughts of our age. She then says making Jewish students feel unsafe at their own
*  schools is unacceptable and is happening way too much right now. But of course the safety of Jewish
*  students is absolutely paramount. What about the Jewish students who've been centrally involved in
*  these protests? What about the Jewish students who got attacked by pro-Israel protesters? Because
*  they were there in that camp. You can see in fact Jews for Palestinians. You can see a big placard
*  at the encampment being attacked by those protests, by those thugs. And by police,
*  like their fellow students, many of them of course huge numbers have been arrested.
*  These encampments have actually gone to great lengths to be inclusive including holding seders
*  and shabbat. Let's listen to Nara Milonich, a Jewish academic, a professor of history at Columbia
*  who spoke to me last week. When people say that, you know, this is now a hotbed of anti-Semitism
*  and that's what this protest is and encampment is really all about and it's a threat to Jewish
*  safety. Yeah, I wish they would come on campus and see except for that the university has often
*  on been allowing press even on campus. Campus is now sort of closed off so you know only affiliates
*  with IDs can typically swipe in. They've let in press sometimes. Sometimes they don't let it
*  press in and that just sort of foments this narrative. I can say as a Jewish faculty member
*  I'm happy to walk on campus and I do it multiple times a day. I would say also that Jewish students
*  are many of those who are being arrested. I mean some of the student, you know, leaders of this
*  movement are Jewish students. Many of the students in the encampment are Jewish students as you know
*  and again students from a variety of other groups. So this idea is just frankly not true. Now the
*  CNN correspondent then says after a clip of UCLA students arguing with pro-Palestinian protesters
*  again what you just saw is 2024 in Los Angeles harkening back to the 1930s in Europe and I do
*  not say that lightly the fear among Jews in this country is palpable right now. Wow, just wow.
*  Firstly we have no idea about the context here whatsoever because all we can see is some protesters
*  standing there saying nothing while a student yells at them but you can see lots of people
*  walking past him. The claim is being barred from entering campus because he's Jewish. What's the
*  evidence for that given the number of Jewish protesters involved? What's the evidence he's
*  being blocked? Where's the menace of physical violence there? There's absolutely no context
*  whatsoever for what's happening there whatsoever. What she has done there is obscenely below the
*  horror, the horror of 1930s Europe when Jews and other targets of the Nazis and their fascist allies
*  were suffering murderous prosecution and she has the front to say I don't say that lightly.
*  This is a travesty of so-called journalism. It's naked propaganda, no better than Fox News,
*  worse actually because at least Fox News doesn't pretend to be respectable. Now to say she has
*  former is is an understatement to say the least. Listen to how she responded last December when
*  representative Pramila Jayapal put forward statistics about the number of Palestinians,
*  mostly women and children being butchered. 15,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli
*  airstrikes, three quarters of whom are women and children. I don't even know what to say.
*  Wow, just wow. For a start, the United Nations has documented by the way Palestinian women being
*  raped by Israeli soldiers and there is ample evidence of both female and male Palestinian
*  detainees being sexually abused by the IDF and Save the Children report that Palestinian child
*  detainees were sexually abused in the West Bank before 7th October. Yeah, that's right, during
*  the so-called SISFA that Dhanabash likes to refer to. But what kind of answer is that?
*  What kind of answer is that? You listen to someone talking about the mass slaughter of children
*  and you respond by saying, well, you don't see Israeli soldiers raping them. What kind of mind
*  works like that? Now let's just listen to a final segment from CNN from today. 16. Good morning to
*  all of you. Some pretty stunning images coming to us overnight, Evan. We also are just learning at
*  this hour that banners have been hung from the hall. They read Hind's hall and Intifada.
*  Hind is a reference to a woman who was killed in Gaza. Intifada, of course, a reference to uprising
*  violent struggles that Palestinians have had over the years against Israel. As you watch this.
*  Notice what they said there? A woman who was killed. A woman. The woman she's talking about is
*  six-year-old Hind Rajab. A six-year-old. She called a six-year-old murdered girl, a woman.
*  A six-year-old who's slaughtered by the Israeli state, desperately terrified. We know because we
*  could hear her last conversation on the phone to a Palestine Red Crescent respondent where she
*  was surrounded by the slaughtered bodies of her relatives, where she said she was scared of the
*  dark and begged them to get her. Slaughtered along with her family, many of them also children.
*  You heard her 15-year-old cousin butchered whilst also speaking to a responder.
*  And then the two paramedics sent to save her in an ambulance. Slaughtered. The ambulance blown up by
*  the Israeli military and then the Israeli military lied about all of it. How sick is this? How
*  twisted. Do you know what I mean? It's kind of sick, isn't it? It's fucked. Let's just say it.
*  I've often wondered how those who fail to speak out against this, one of the great atrocities of
*  our age, how they manage to live with themselves knowing that so many children have been killed and
*  are being killed every day in the most hideous, violent and terrifying ways imaginable. Buried
*  under rubble, suffocating toddlers. Being cooked, slowly alive by a missile which blows up their
*  home, listening maybe to the screams of their dying parents buried under the same rubble.
*  Imagine the terror of a three-year-old girl in those circumstances. Maybe trapped there for hours
*  in the most excruciating agony before she perishes. How do they live with themselves knowing all that?
*  Well now we know, don't we? They just pretend they're grown-ups. And let's face it, they don't
*  think any of them are human. Not really. Nobody who believes the Palestinians are equal human beings
*  are the same worth as the people they see as like themselves would ever tolerate this atrocity for
*  even a second more. So what's this all about? What's this viral propaganda from CNN and the likes of
*  Darnabosh all about? I'll tell you, these people are morally disgraced. They hitch themselves onto
*  a bandwagon now drenched in so much blood. They've lost public opinion, including in the United States,
*  and they're going to get done by history. And they also face the very real prospect of accountability.
*  That is the role they played in the media in justifying and normalizing what Israel did.
*  And they're too far in now. They know it's too far. There's no going back. I'm not exaggerating
*  when I say these people have played a significant role in the mass slaughter of innocent people,
*  because if the media had called this out for what it was from the start, this would not have been
*  possible. So all they've got now is desperation, knowing deep down the morally disgraced in the
*  eyes of ever-growing numbers of people. What do they do then? They go, look over there, the real
*  extremists, the people who, check notes, oppose genocide and the mass slaughter of innocent children.
*  But that's not going to work. It's not going to work. Maybe once upon a time this might have
*  worked, but this whole disgusting episode, Israel's genocidal slaughter of Gaza, will in my view have
*  disastrous long-term consequences for these mainstream media outlets. The crime is simply
*  too big. It's too blatant. It's too shameless. Too many people have seen things they can't unsee.
*  And because of the internet, we have access to what Israel is really doing, what Israeli leaders
*  are really saying, and what protesters are really about. People can see the truth, no matter how much
*  mainstream media outlets twist and distort and lie about emission and turn the world upside down.
*  They see people who see all this. They see how media outlets lie about it. And note that their
*  audiences are massively tilted towards older Americans. By the way, there are many older
*  Americans who are taking a courageous stand against this, and indeed have taken courageous stands
*  against horrors all their lives. But it is notable that younger Americans are overwhelmingly the most
*  hostile to what's happening. And they're the ones using social media and the internet, where they
*  can see what Israel is doing unfiltered, and then they can see how the media lies about it.
*  So Darnabash and the like can utterly disgrace themselves in public, which they are. But all
*  they're doing is accelerating the downfall of these media outlets. And when that happens,
*  and they'll see it happening, they shouldn't be shocked. They did it to themselves.
