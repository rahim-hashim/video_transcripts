# Israel SHOOTS DEAD US Activist Biden's Hypocrisy Exposed
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [September 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsZtMywFDPk)
*  Let me start by reading this statement from US President Joe Biden from February 7 months ago,
*  when three American soldiers were killed by a drone attack blamed on Iran backed militia groups.
*  He told the world, if you harm an American, we will respond.
*  So how will he respond? After Israeli soldiers shot dead
*  Aser Aigi, a 26 year old US citizen who came to the West Bank as a peaceful human rights activist,
*  joining a campaign to protect Palestinian farmers who are being violently victimized by an illegal
*  Israeli occupation, which is illegally stealing Palestinian land, illegally driving Palestinians
*  from their homes in favor of illegal Israeli settlements. She was shot in the head by Israeli
*  troops, executed or rather murdered in cold blood. Now firstly, let's think of our loved ones,
*  who like countless Palestinian families, are mourning the violent butchery of someone they
*  loved at the hands of the Israeli military. Let's remember that she was clearly someone driven
*  by a sense of humanity, by a sense of taking on injustice and oppression.
*  Let me also say this, because anyone who knows anything about activists who commit to standing
*  in solidarity with Palestinians will know that this is something she will surely have believed.
*  She will of course receive far more attention than many Palestinians, the vast majority,
*  who have been brutally killed. Here I am making a video about her. And I say this not to belittle
*  the horror of what's happened to her, but because this video focuses on exposing a hideous double
*  standard of the US support for Israel's genocide, up to and including standing back while US
*  citizens are murdered by the ally that it arms and supports and facilitates. Now the US State
*  Department spokesperson Matthew Filler, who has spent the last few months filling the airwaves
*  with propaganda on behalf of the Israeli state ever since this all began, he said,
*  are aware of the tragic death of an American citizen, Ainsler Aigee, today in the West Bank.
*  We offer our deepest condolences to her family and loved ones. We are urgently gathering more
*  information about the circumstances of her death and we will have more to say as we learn more.
*  We have no higher priority than the safety and security of American citizens. Well firstly,
*  no mention of Israeli corpability, let alone any denunciation of the Israeli state for murdering
*  one of the US's own citizens. Miller says we have no higher priority than the safety and security
*  of American citizens. Is that so? Let's think back to Rachel Corrie, shall we? She was a 23-year-old
*  activist who was crushed to death by an Israeli bulldozer in the Gaza Strip back in 2003. Now,
*  what did the US administration do for Rachel Corrie and her family? Did the Bush administration
*  pile on to Israel, firstly denouncing its evil, imposing sanctions, taking action? No, it did not.
*  I know that a resolution was introduced in the House of Representatives demanding the US government
*  undertake a full, fair and expeditious investigation into Rachel Corrie's killing, but no action was
*  taken. Now, years later, the US ambassador to Israel said it wasn't a satisfactory Israeli
*  investigation, but that was just empty hand wringing a platitude. Nothing more. No action
*  taken. Let's think back to Shireen Abu-Akli, the Palestinian-American journalist for Al Jazeera who
*  was killed by the Israeli state in May 2023, months before the current horror began. She too
*  was shot in the head by the Israeli army. And do you know what they did? They resorted to their
*  usual playbook. Lie. Deflect. Muddy the water. Wait until everyone's attention moves elsewhere.
*  They claimed initially it was Palestinian militants who did it. Then, months later,
*  when attention was indeed elsewhere, they admitted it was likely them. The Israeli state. All along.
*  Originally, the US government demanded the criminal prosecution of Shireen Abu-Akli's killers,
*  but quickly abandoned that, presumably when it was clear who had killed her. And they claimed that
*  an Israeli review of their military rules of engagement was sufficient accountability. Yes,
*  well, whatever that review of Israeli military rules of engagement was, it has been a tremendous
*  success. I think we can all agree on that. What of the 17-year-old Palestinian-American
*  Taufik Ajak killed by Israeli forces in January? At his funeral, his father asked,
*  how many fathers and mothers have to say goodbye to their children? How many more? Well, the answer
*  to that, I'm afraid, has been thousands upon thousands more since. That is, the parents who
*  survived rather than being killed alongside their children. Now, at the time, his father spoke out
*  about US support for the US military machine, but all the White House could do was say they were
*  seriously concerned. Whoopi doo da. All the US does in these circumstances when Israel murders
*  its own citizens is do some sad face, do some hand-winking, call for an investigation and then
*  just move on. When Hirsch Goldberg-Polin, the Israeli-American hostage, was killed by Hamas
*  militants, Joe Biden declared, make no mistake, Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes. Well,
*  make no mistake, the US will not pronounce to the world that Israeli leaders will pay for these
*  crimes. These American citizens slaughtered in cold blood by the Israeli state. What we see here is
*  the US does not in fact do all it can to stand by its own citizens. If you want a US citizen
*  killed by a key ally engaged in massive war crimes, then the US will seek no meaningful
*  justice, let alone any drastic action. The value of a US life in these contexts is dependent on
*  whether it can be used to justify sabre rattling against official enemies, and Israel knows it can
*  act with impunity. The Israeli soldiers who killed these Americans knew, shortly knew,
*  they could get away with it. They knew they would face no justice, and they were absolutely right.
*  Know by the way some of the news coverage about this latest heinous killing.
*  Listen to this from Sky News. A 26 year old American woman has allegedly been shot dead
*  in the West Bank during pro-Palestinian demonstrations against settlements expansion.
*  What the hell is that? They're not even saying allegedly killed by Israel here, when even the
*  likes of the Jerusalem Post, I would note, have been able to declare as a fact that Israeli troops
*  killed her. Here they're saying that her death is alleged. What are they talking about? Do they
*  honestly think it's a matter of debate, whether this US citizen was shot in the head, and has
*  no signs of life, and is now dead? And what of the BBC? Well they've gone for a classic BBC headline
*  in this horror, attributing no responsibility. American activist shot dead in occupied West Bank.
*  Shot dead by who BBC? Shot dead by who? Here we have it. Another example of the collusion
*  between our politicians and our media outlets in whitewashing the crimes of the Israeli state.
*  Now I want to end by talking about another killing. Another killing reported today of someone else.
*  Barna Baker, a 12 year old Palestinian girl killed during an attack by Israeli settlers
*  on the village of Kyrot in Nablus, the West Bank. Little girl, 12 years old. So many children,
*  so many children killed. I mean in Gaza, thousands, but they've killed since the 7th of October,
*  before 7th of October, hideous numbers of children in the West Bank. Let's remember this little girl.
*  You see, every day, more atrocities, more war crimes, more abominations, armed, facilitated,
*  made possible by the US and its key allies, including Britain, up to and including the US
*  standing by as its own citizens are killed in cold blood by its ally. And that tells you itself
*  all you need to know about this current horror. Please like and subscribe,
