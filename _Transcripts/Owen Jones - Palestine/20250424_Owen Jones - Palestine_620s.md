# "Bomb Gaza's Food", Israeli Leader Demands
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4)
*  How unhinged, how genocide or how depraved can Israel's leaders possibly get? Bad news, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm afraid, because we are very far from hitting the floor. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=5.68s)]
*  Now, here's the latest. Itzmir Ben-Gavir is the Israeli Minister for National Security. He's the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=9.68s)]
*  leader of the Far-Right Otsmer Yehudit party, or Jewish Power, which is a straightforward fascist [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=14.4s)]
*  party. He's visiting the United States, where he went to Donald Trump's Marta Loga estate, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=20.48s)]
*  and whilst there has tweeted the following, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=25.84s)]
*  Just so we're clear here, though I think that was very clear, Israel's Minister of National [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=46.8s)]
*  Security has said he's met with senior Republican officials who have expressed [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=52.64s)]
*  their support for his proposal to bomb aid and food depots in Gaza. Ben-Gavir also addressed [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=57.2s)]
*  journalists whilst in the United States to make clear his support for a policy of deliberate [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=65.44s)]
*  starvation. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=70.48s)]
*  For wider context, Israel has imposed a total blockade on Gaza, which has been in place since [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=82.56s)]
*  the 1st of March. That is 54 days. Nothing is allowed in. Not food, not fuel, not water, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=95.12s)]
*  not medical supplies, nothing. Zero zilch. This is in the context of Israel deliberately destroying [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=100.72s)]
*  Gaza's food production. According to the United Nations, in January, 75% of fields used to grow [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=106.8s)]
*  crops have been damaged or destroyed, and over two thirds of agricultural wells are no longer [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=112.8s)]
*  functional, leaving irrigation crippled. 96% of cattle are dead, milk production has halted, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=117.44s)]
*  99% of poultry have been killed, and the fishing sector has collapsed. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=123.19999999999999s)]
*  Research by Forensic Architecture found last year in addition that 83% of plant life has been [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=128.8s)]
*  destroyed. So we have a total blockade of anything getting in, and Israel's destruction [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=134.8s)]
*  of Gaza's ability to provide food for its population. That has catastrophic consequences, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=138.96s)]
*  of course. The bakeries, of course, closed as you would expect. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=143.52s)]
*  Where is it? How is it possible? According to UNRWA, the United Nations Agency for Palestinian [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=150.8s)]
*  Refugees, humanitarian aid and supplies have not entered the Gaza Strip for over 50 days now. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=156.16000000000003s)]
*  Critical humanitarian supplies are rapidly depleting, UNRWA flower supplies have run out. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=160.64s)]
*  While hunger is spreading and deepening in the Gaza Strip, nearly 3,000 UNRWA trucks of [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=166.32s)]
*  life-saving aid are ready to enter. UNRWA remains one of the largest health actors operating the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=170.72s)]
*  Gaza Strip, however, two thirds of essential medical supplies are projected to run out in [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=175.6s)]
*  under two months, and many already have. This week, Oday Fadi Ahmad, a little boy, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=180.64s)]
*  died of hunger and malnutrition, one of dozens of children who have starved to death. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=187.2s)]
*  And yet just miles away from this apocalyptic starving wasteland, there are sushi bars, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=192.32s)]
*  restaurants serving fine foods. It is one of the most grotesque contrasts in the history of [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=197.6s)]
*  Cuban civilisation. It is in this context that Ben-Gavir is demanding that Israel [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=204.16s)]
*  bombs food and aid depots. This is nothing short of an open, proud, deliberate attempt [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=209.12s)]
*  to starve an entire people. A self-evidently genocidal act that doesn't need any further [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=214.64s)]
*  explanation. Indeed, the Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants against Israeli Prime [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=220.48s)]
*  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defence Minister Yevgalan with charges [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=225.44s)]
*  focused on the question of starvation. In saying universe, protesting against this [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=229.67999999999998s)]
*  genocidal maniac would be considered uncontroversial, even morally necessary. Ben-Gavir attended a [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=234.88s)]
*  lecture near Yale University and Ben-Gavir intentionally tried to goad that crowd of [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=240.96s)]
*  students. And yet after these protests, Yale University stripped Students for Justice in [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=270.96s)]
*  Palestine chapter of its status as an official student group. The protesters, as ever, against [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=280.08s)]
*  hideous war crimes, those under attack. Meanwhile, a journalist at the right-wing Daily Wire posted [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=288.08s)]
*  Jewish students being screamed at for attending a lecture at Yale. Let's have a listen. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=295.44s)]
*  Clearly these students were being booed and met with cries of shame because they were [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=319.91999999999996s)]
*  attending a lecture by a genocidal war criminal who should, in a just and rational world, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=322.64s)]
*  be arrested and incarcerated for war crimes. It's interesting isn't it how the right has spent so [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=326.4s)]
*  long claiming that the left spreads false accusations of racism and yet here is one [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=331.68s)]
*  further example of relentless examples of the right doing exactly that in defence of the Israeli [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=338.0s)]
*  state and its war crimes. Ben-Gavir, it should be noted, has been convicted of incitement to racism [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=343.84s)]
*  in Israel and long before the 7th October he demanded the expulsion of the 20% of Israel's [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=350.24s)]
*  population who are Palestinian. And here's something else related to Ben-Gavir. The day [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=355.68s)]
*  he was demanding Israel bombs food and aid depots and protesters were being disciplined for protesting [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=361.2s)]
*  against him, Israeli media released a photo of Palestinian detainees being hideously abused by [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=366.16s)]
*  their Israeli prison captors and they were there, placed in front of large photographs of Israel's [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=371.2s)]
*  destruction of Gaza in order to mentally torture them. Those prisons, of course, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=376.48s)]
*  are under the command of one Ben-Gavir, the Minister for National Security. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=381.76s)]
*  What is the West actually doing about all of this then? Well, Israeli ministers openly boast about [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=386.72s)]
*  committing war crimes designed to starve Palestinians. An arms embargo? Sanctions? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=390.64000000000004s)]
*  Actual material leverage from Israel's patrons to force it to stop committing heinous atrocities [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=395.76s)]
*  in full view of the world? No, David Lame, the British Foreign Secretary has sent yet another [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=400.72s)]
*  disappointed tweet. He writes, For over 50 days, Israel has fully blocked humanitarian aid to Gaza. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=405.44s)]
*  This is completely unacceptable. Vital supplies are running out and Palestinians risk facing [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=411.84s)]
*  starvation. With France and Germany, we urge Israel to immediately restart the flow of aid. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=416.16s)]
*  Well, that's undoubtedly going to fix it, isn't it? Better shaking in their boots in Tel Aviv. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=421.2s)]
*  You can imagine the scene Netanyahu cackling away at being able to get away with 565 days of [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=425.44s)]
*  genocidal mayhem and him pops one of his aides to say, Prime Minister, the unthinkable has [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=430.88s)]
*  happened. The game's up, I'm afraid. We're not going to be able to survive this one. Netanyahu, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=435.36s)]
*  already beads of sweat forming on his brow, says, what is it? This must be very, very serious. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=439.84s)]
*  His aide finally plucks up the courage to tell his boss, it's David Lame, the British Foreign [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=444.88s)]
*  Secretary. He's posted a tweet saying it's completely unacceptable that we block humanitarian [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=451.6s)]
*  aid. Netanyahu collapses to his knees, thrusts his head back to the heavens and bellows, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=456.96s)]
*  Nooooo! And so ends Israel's siege. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=462.71999999999997s)]
*  Look, let's be honest. This gang of murdering war criminals are laughing at the British government [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=467.52s)]
*  and if they're not, frankly, they should be because they can get away literally with murder. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=472.47999999999996s)]
*  Speaking of murder, I just want to finally end on the case we've been talking about on this channel [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=477.03999999999996s)]
*  over the last few weeks, which is Israel's mass murder of 15 Palestine Red Crescent [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=482.72s)]
*  and Medics and first responders, where the Israeli state lied about it, their story [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=489.20000000000005s)]
*  completely imploding because of video footage, evidence for the mass grave, witness testimony, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=495.36s)]
*  satellite imagery, we could go on. Well, Israeli newspaper Haaretz has yet more details and it is [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=499.28000000000003s)]
*  truly disturbing. They write, the Israeli army unit that killed aid workers and gathers Rafa [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=504.16s)]
*  last month had received a report about increased ambulance traffic on the route [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=509.52s)]
*  shortly before the incident. The soldiers fired at the vehicles continuously for three and a half [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=513.04s)]
*  minutes, even from point blank range, reloading their ammunition multiple times, despite attempts [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=517.04s)]
*  by the aid workers to identify themselves. This is according to Haaretz from materials collected [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=522.8s)]
*  at the incident, some submitted to the IDF Operational Investigative Team and IDF General [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=527.4399999999999s)]
*  Staff Investigative Team. Haaretz notes the lack of credibility in the version of events provided [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=533.04s)]
*  to commanders and investigators. The absurdity of the lies are underlined by Haaretz. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=538.56s)]
*  In this choice paragraph, in his testimony, the deputy battalion commander claimed that once he [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=544.9599999999999s)]
*  believed the people killed in the first vehicle were Hamas operatives, he concluded that the rescue [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=550.0799999999999s)]
*  convoy approaching the scene was actually a group of Hamas operatives who had heard about the incident [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=554.88s)]
*  and arrived to retrieve the bodies of their comrades and attacked the Salyretz-Ghalani unit. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=558.7199999999999s)]
*  A scenario in which Hamas operatives travel in marked rescue vehicles to a location where [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=563.3599999999999s)]
*  they know IDF chiefs are present is one that the army had not encountered during the fighting in [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=568.56s)]
*  Gaza. If that wasn't supposed to be sarcastic. Some of the most hideous war crimes imaginable [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=572.9599999999999s)]
*  committed every single day, all facilitated by western politicians and media outlets. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=580.4799999999999s)]
*  And we must all keep talking about it, because nobody can be allowed to say, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=585.1999999999999s)]
*  I did not know what was really happening. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKx1qNH_zD4&t=589.04s)]
