# One of Israel's Sickest Lies Torn Apart
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01O5zgDhfsk)
*  Here is a succinct summary of the behaviour of the Israeli state as with western backing and
*  active complicity it executes one of the great crimes of our age. Kill, lie, kill, lie, kill,
*  lie, ad infinitum. And what they specifically do after they commit an atrocity is pump the air
*  waves full of deceit, deflection, distortion, their strategy is to muddy the waters, gaslight,
*  tell you not to trust your lying eyes and your lying ears, we could go on. And then they wait
*  for attention to move on and for their atrocity to be forgotten, at best remembered as yet another
*  murky episode which can be poorly understood amidst the fog of war. Well on this channel,
*  we're not going to let the Israeli state get away with that. So let's return to one of the major
*  atrocities, of which there are many, perpetrated by the Israeli state in Gaza, which is the so-called
*  Flower Massacre which we covered at the time. This massacre happened on the 29th of February when at
*  least 118 Palestinians were slaughtered by the Israeli military in Gaza City with 760 injured,
*  some seriously. These were desperately hungry Palestinian civilians waiting for food from
*  A trucks which had been blocked by the Israeli state for a long time from entering northern Gaza
*  as famine befalls it. Now the Israeli state lied through their teeth about this massacre,
*  they claimed they'd fired warning shots in the air to deter a crowd and then they became scared
*  because of a mob of Palestinians moving towards them so they opened fire and that caused a mass
*  panic and a stampede. Let's look for example at the version of events proffered by Elon Levy,
*  shall we? Who was then Israeli government spokesperson but has since been sacked. At the
*  time I tweeted, the Israeli army just massacred over 100 Palestinians as they tried to get flour
*  for their families. Israeli tanks then ran over the dead and injured bodies. The Israeli state is
*  committing these atrocities knowing it can get away with anything. Now Elon Levy then quite
*  tweeted what I said at the time, blood libel he wrote, these poor people were killed when they
*  were crushed in a stampede and in some cases run over by the Ghazan truck drivers as they try to
*  get out but go ahead blame Israel. Now before I just say anything, notice how he tried to point
*  the fingers there at Ghazan truck drivers. It was actually Palestinians who did this.
*  Let's just process here too the disgusting and all too common attempt to invoke blood libel. This
*  is the vile antisemitic conspiracy claim, smear, disgusting antisemitism which has caused
*  throughout history the slaughter and persecution of innocent Jewish people in which Jews are accused
*  of murdering Christians in order to use their blood whilst performing religious rituals. What
*  earth does that have to do with the Israeli state objectively killing huge numbers of people? Blood
*  libel is about something that didn't happen. Jewish people were not going around and are not now going
*  around either killing Christians or indeed anyone else to use their blood in religious rituals.
*  It's not a conspiracy theory to point out that the Israeli state, notes, not the same as the
*  Jewish people, is killing huge numbers of Palestinian civilians. That's a fact and nobody is suggesting
*  that they're being killed to use their blood in religious rituals either. Just listen to this,
*  it's deranged that I even have to engage with this total insanity. That was an official government
*  spokesperson of Israel at the time but it shows how apologists for Israel completely irresponsibly
*  strip antisemitism of its meaning when antisemitism is a grave, grave, grave evil,
*  when it's not only just real but also increasing. Well a detailed new investigation by CNN has
*  revealed that the account offered by the Israeli state including its then spokesperson Elon Levy
*  was false while the account offered by people like myself or indeed the accounts we were supporting
*  were entirely correct. It's striking this comes from CNN because an investigation earlier this year
*  drew from testimonies of CNN journalists who accused their own media organization
*  of journalistic malpractice because of its pro-Israel bias. So it matters when even this
*  media organization is doing a piece of investigative journalism like this. The CNN article is entitled
*  Dying for a Bag of Flour. Videos and eyewitness accounts cast doubt on Israel's timeline of deadly
*  Gaza aid delivery. It refers to the flour massacre as one of the single deadliest mass casualty
*  events that take place in Gaza in the last six months after over a month of Israel blocking aid
*  from arriving into northern Gaza itself I would note which we'll discuss further as part of a
*  genocidal attempt to deliberately starve the people of Gaza. They note that well I would note sorry
*  it's not noted in this article again part of the problem will come on to that Israel's leaders made
*  clear publicly they were going to starve the people of Gaza from the start which should be in every
*  single article every single article when we're talking about the question of food and aid it
*  isn't that is journalistic malpractice there. Now they note CNN that this massacre followed what
*  the United Nations had called a pattern of Israeli attacks on civilians desperately sneaking food
*  amid unprecedented levels of starvation. CNN's investigation was based on testimonies and videos
*  from 22 eyewitnesses. What the survivors of this massacre recalled was Israeli troops
*  firing on crowds as they tried desperately to reach food aid in an indication the sheer level
*  of desperation we're discussing here the CNN article says many said they were undertook by
*  the bullets believing that if they weren't killed attempting to get the flour they would die of
*  hunger instead. They note the contradictory accounts of Israeli spokespeople with the
*  smooth-talking propagandist slash special advisor to Benjamin Netanyahu Mark Regev initially telling
*  CNN that Israeli troops had not even been involved at all while another spokesperson Daniel Higary
*  then said soldiers hadn't fired directly at Palestinians seeking aid but rather fired warning
*  shots in the air. These people keep spreading claims which are false media organizations
*  should make that clear again journalistic malpractice these people were just thrown on air
*  and treated as though they're serious people rather than people with a track record of saying
*  things which are not true about matters of life and death and severe atrocities. Now CNN also notes
*  drone footage released by the Israeli military claiming to show a stampede in which Palestinians
*  were trampled with tanks there to secure the convoy but the quality they know and crucially
*  the editing of their footage made it quote unquote difficult to confirm their claims.
*  The question of editing here really is key they say the crucial moment capturing what calls the
*  crowd to scatter is missing utterly shameless by the Israeli military they released footage which
*  excluded the very key component the reason why the crowd scattered because as we'll see is because
*  they were fired up by Israeli soldiers warrant interception here again by the IDF. Now CNN also
*  say about the footage it shows just how difficult it would have been to fire with any degree of
*  accuracy what the IDF describes as suspects among the tightly packed people surrounding the convoy
*  so the claims that they could in any sense target any so-called suspects here is gibberish.
*  They also said that the CNN say that the IDF has denied their request for the full unedited drone
*  footage from February 29th oh I bet they did I bet they did there was no reason whatsoever for the
*  IDF not to release an edited footage unless they had something to hide you would have to be
*  completely delusional to blame otherwise. Now according to CNN their analysis of dozens of
*  videos and testimonies from eyewitnesses cast doubt on Israel's version of events a euphemism
*  just to be clear for Israel's authorities lying with want and abandon. According to their evidence
*  which was reviewed by forensic and ballistic experts automatic gunfire began before the IDF
*  said the convoy began crossing through the checkpoint and that shots were fired within
*  close range of crowds that gathered for food. Now the eyewitness videos according to CNN drawing
*  on their metadata that is included the time that these videos were actually filmed and they
*  contradict claims according to CNN made by the IDF about when their soldiers began the shooting.
*  The videos began in the hours before the incident so groups of Palestinians sitting around fires
*  walking around the beach a state of calm there as these crowds gathered in anticipation of food
*  arriving desperately hungry people at the time of course because of food aid prevented by CNN
*  but sorry prevented by Israel from entering. Now according to the videos with their metadata
*  gunfire can be heard ringing out and people seen running away urging others to flee warning of a
*  tank seven minutes before the IDF said the convoy had crossed into northern Gaza another video shows
*  gunfire two minutes before the IDF claims for fired warning shots and according to a gunfire
*  acoustics expert his testimony corroborated by another expert the burst indicated heavy automatic
*  gunfire 600 rounds per minute that is not warning shots that is automatic gunfire 600 rounds a
*  minute that's what you're doing if you're massacring people. Now other videos similarly show
*  such gunfire people running suddenly falling being injured as dawn broke videos show dead bodies some
*  with wounds to their head and chest scattered across the coast survivors attending to the dead.
*  Now CNN also interviewed seven survivors they say treated it what was Gaza's largest hospital
*  Shefa which has since been destroyed entirely by the Israeli military and these survivors had been
*  shot including one shot by the IDF as they carried a bag of flour they spoke to a doctor who tried to
*  get food for his family who saw people panicking when the Israeli military began firing he himself
*  was shot in his left leg the piece goes on that the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA the
*  main aid humanitarian agency in Gaza always note that is blocked by Israel from making aid deliveries
*  to northern Gaza adding rather than you familiarly this attack which we could should be calling a
*  massacre always raises serious questions about whether the Israeli military can facilitate the
*  safe distribution of desperately needed assistance you're not kidding are you you're not kidding
*  given their massacring huge numbers of people as they desperately try and get food for no reason
*  as this entire investigation underlines. Now the UN office for the high commission for human rights
*  documented reports for at least 26 attacks on civilians waiting for aid at just two roundabouts
*  in Gaza City now we have to put all of this into context which is as even the British foreign
*  secretary David Cameron detailed in a public letter Israel had prevented aid from getting into
*  Gaza at all by all sorts of ruses insufficient land routes absurd delays caused by multiple
*  and unnecessary screenings arbitrary rejections just stopping aid getting into the Sabbath we
*  could get on we could go on crucially he contradicted claims like you know levy over Israel allowing
*  unlimited aid into Gaza levy was fired subsequently or around that period by the Israeli state clearly
*  well I think it's very clear that was connected but in any case so many reasons to stop aid from
*  getting in now to add to all of that we've had Israeli protesters allowed to block humanitarian
*  aid from getting in quite unlike the brutal treatment of anti-government protesters in Tel Aviv
*  we've had the killing of well over 200 aid workers overwhelmingly Palestinian the biggest
*  killing of aid workers in such a short space of time ever recorded that number also now includes
*  of course the world central kitchen massacre which caused outrage because the victims were
*  westerners but an absurd investigation to what happened there by the Israeli authorities
*  raises far more questions than the answers we've had the mass destruction of roads
*  so very difficult to allow aid to be transported around Gaza given the destruction of infrastructure
*  as well as Israel deliberately targeting police officers whose job is to protect that aid
*  despite even the protests of the Biden administration for that reason we've had
*  the mass destruction of agriculture and food production in Gaza not spoken about enough
*  it's not just about less aid getting in but you need far more aid because you're not Gaza's unable
*  to produce the food it had it was producing before clearly we've had Israel blocking aid from getting
*  into northern Gaza altogether where families underway crucially the attempt to destroy UNRWA
*  that main humanitarian agency in Gaza I keep referring to based on an unsubstantiated smear
*  campaign that's a key plank of the starvation policy as UNRWA's director of planning Sam Rose
*  says today it must be the backbone of any humanitarian response if mass starvation is
*  to be avoided but Israel succeeded in getting multiple donor states to defund it some belatedly
*  restoring access but the US Congress is banning funding of UNRWA until at least March 2025 because
*  of this genocidal smear campaign it is genocidal because you are starving people to death now I
*  would know after the world central kitchen massacre when the US actually used some limited
*  leverage for change over its client state Israel Israel suddenly reopened 20 bakeries the water
*  pipeline in northern Gaza which they've deliberately shut off as we can see and the
*  Erez border crossing into northern Gaza proving conclusively it was blocking aid from getting in
*  they could have done that all before they didn't they chose not to why because let's be clear
*  Israel is deliberately starving the population of Gaza we know this because the evidence is
*  overwhelming blocking aid from getting in blocking aid from being transported within Gaza to people
*  who need it blocking aid from being safely distributed slaughtering aid workers waging
*  war on the main humanitarian agency UNRWA and massacring civilians trying to get food aid
*  we also know this because of the statements of Israeli leaders and officials from the start
*  most notably Yov Galan defense minister one of the three members of the Israeli war cabinet who
*  declared on 9th of October I have ordered a complete siege on the Gaza strip there will be
*  no electricity no food no fuel everything is closed we are fighting human animals and we are acting
*  accordingly we also have the words for example of Giora Ireland an Israeli general former head of
*  Israel's national security council and an advisor's gallon who at the very start supported the siege of
*  Gaza in which declared the entire population will have to leave either temporarily or permanently
*  adding the people should be told they have two choices to stay and starve or to leave he also
*  declared in order to make the siege effective we have to prevent others from giving assistance to
*  Gaza I'd say pretty relevant given the mass slaughter of aid workers as I said repeatedly they
*  said from the start what they were going to do that intent should have defined all media courage of
*  what Israel was doing but it didn't many of these statements were barely even referred to if at all
*  it's as though what Israeli leaders and official promise wasn't real like if something happening in
*  a parallel universe that wasn't relevant and as I keep saying that's the greatest media scandal
*  of our time because Israel made clear exactly what it was going to do from the start they followed it
*  to the letter and western media coverage failed to reflect that ensuring they aided and abetted
*  one of the worst crimes of our age so to conclude the Israeli state kills and lies and kills and
*  lies and kills and lies that should always be our starting point when we hear about these atrocities
*  that's the case with the world central kitchen massacre note how western governments have not
*  demanded the release of all unedited drone footage of that massacre even though western aid workers
*  their own people were massacred note how Israel is refusing to allow foreign journalists into Gaza
*  why because they would see so many atrocities that we're not even aware of and we should also of
*  course bear all this in mind when we're talking about the destruction of our shefa hospital which
*  is the biggest hospital in Gaza where hundreds of bodies are now being uncovered they made all
*  sorts of claims about who they've slaughtered in our shefa hospital well why don't they release
*  the footage of what they did to our shefa hospital because destroying the medical system of Gaza which
*  has now been all but destroyed is itself a genocidal act it imposes a daily death sentence
*  on people who are ill sick injured infirm pregnant newborn babies we could go on so here we will keep
*  analyzing and publicizing Israel's atrocities we won't allow them to just shift the conversation
*  away just pump a load of misinformation and deceits and deflection until everyone gets
*  bored and moves on we're not going to do that it's important we publicize these atrocities and their
*  lies about these atrocities and keep remembering the atrocities they did make sure we get all the
*  evidence out and it should have been clear what the flower massacre was from the start giving
*  palating doctors noted they were treating huge numbers of people with bullet wins that was pretty
*  good evidence because we've got to ensure the truth gets out even if most media outlets let
*  them get away with it we're not going to do that please like please subscribe please share the
