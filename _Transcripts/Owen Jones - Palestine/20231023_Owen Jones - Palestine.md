# Smear Campaign Against Gaza War Opponents EXPOSED
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MsQ4UshFaI)
*  Let's just be clear about what's going on. Sometimes it is necessary to pull back the curtain to
*  reveal what's happening behind the scenes. There is a deliberate and growing attempt to smear
*  and demonise and silence those who oppose the horror being currently inflicted on Gaza by the
*  Israeli state. It is in part a sign of panic because the cheerleaders and apologists of this
*  crime, you see, know that most of the general public do not take well to the atrocities currently
*  unfolding on their screens and they know that the worst is to come. I'm sorry to say that, I don't
*  say that kind of thing lightly but it is the truth. Now I'll show how this is happening and why but
*  first here's how I discussed this earlier on on the Jamie Vine Show. But look I was at that
*  demonstration there was up to 300,000 people it was one of the top 10 biggest demonstrations in
*  the history of this country and I walked and marched alongside Jewish protesters amongst like
*  myself gay protesters. We can see you there in the air. There I am and it was actually it was
*  London at its most diverse and I'll just tell you what's happening here just so everyone is aware.
*  What's happened is most politicians and newspapers in this country have tied themselves to what is a
*  war crime happening in Gaza, a massacre of innocent people where you have thousands of innocent
*  civilians including children being butchered en masse and newspapers and politicians have
*  caught on to the fact that actually most people in this country don't like innocent people being
*  murdered not least with the active support of our government. So with these Israel saying they're
*  going to reduce their leading officials Gaza to a city of tents with Israeli officials saying that
*  they're going to annex parts of Gaza if not all of it with them openly demanding the mass expulsion
*  of the Palestinian people from their homes and saying that not that targeting and avoiding
*  targeting children is secondary to all their other concerns they're being open and honest about
*  their intentions. What these newspapers and politicians are trying to do is turn the tables
*  on the people who oppose the war crimes. They're trying to say the morally indecent people aren't
*  the people cheering on mass murder on an industrial scale. The real morally indecent people are people
*  who oppose slaughter and what they've done is zoned in on a tiny handful of people when there's
*  300 000 people including Jews, Muslims, non-believers, people from all backgrounds
*  and it is cynical and people should see it for what it is. That's what's going on here let's be clear
*  those who support the destruction of Gaza with all the mass resulting deaths know that they do not
*  have a moral high ground. They know that the vast majority who oppose Israel's onslaught were like
*  them disgusted by the atrocities committed by Hamas. The difference is we don't support collective
*  punishment. We don't support the killing of far more Palestinian civilians nor do we seek to erase
*  the decades of occupation, siege, theft of land coupled with colonization in the form of illegal
*  settlements, what's described as apartheid by human rights organizations, the incarceration
*  without charge of Palestinians including children, the killing of Palestinian civilians. Bear in mind
*  before the hideous atrocity committed by Hamas in the last 15 years 96 percent of civilians according
*  to the United Nations were Palestinian, the civilians who were killed that is before October
*  the 7th. Now as well as the fact that human rights organizations document crimes such as
*  forcible transfer and torture. Now after the horror of October the 7th there were many who
*  were understandably rallied by general sentiment of something must be done. We saw that same effect
*  with Iraq, with Afghanistan and with Libya before that sentiment collided brutally with the reality
*  of what something must be done means to the sorts of people who in response to horrors
*  preach only violence. Now that sentiment in this case was always soft partly because the British
*  people have gone on this rodeo several times before. Now for example on the 13th of October of
*  those polled 18 percent said that Israel does try to minimize harm to civilians compared to 44 percent
*  who said it does not try to minimize harm to civilians many others saying don't know. Last Friday
*  a Yugo poll found that 58 percent of Britons think there definitely should be an immediate ceasefire
*  in Israel and Palestine, 18 percent said probably should so the total in support of an immediate
*  ceasefire is about 76 percent three over three quarters of the British population
*  just five percent said they probably should not and three percent said they definitely should not.
*  That three percent is the same figure as those who believe the earth is flat that is not a joke
*  that is a fact but that three percent flat earthed position is the position of the conservatives
*  of the labor leadership who support Israel's onslaught and it is also the position of most
*  newspapers in this country they are completely at odds with public opinion and that's before
*  ground invasion which will inevitably result in the greatest fatalities again I don't say this
*  lightly it's a horrible thing to have to say predicting mass slaughter but this is like
*  watching a horror film where you know what the ending is. Now today the Sun's front page isn't
*  about the mass slaughter of innocent people, collective punishment, the collapsing health
*  service in Gaza, the disappearance of clean water, no it's not about any of these things it's about
*  a tube driver who on Saturday with a tube train full of protesters on their way to a big march
*  against this current onslaught led a chant of free Palestine. Now their front page was headlined
*  unbelievable, furious tube drivers anti-Israel chants over train Tanoi Nigel Farage called for
*  them to be fired sounds a little bit like cancel culture to me a clamp down on free speech now
*  they're trying to spin the idea that supporting a free Palestine is intimidating and even anti-Semitic
*  it is no such thing that is a lie it is an outright lie anti-Semitism is a genuine menace it has meant
*  2 000 years of Jewish people being persecuted as Jews and that culminated within living memory
*  in the Holocaust supporting the right of the Palestinian people to be free of oppression
*  of an illegal occupation let alone the horror being currently inflicted upon them is not
*  anti-Semitism and it distracts attention from genuine anti-Semitism which must be fought to
*  say so. Now similarly the male's headline is Suela's fury at net over jihad chants this is over a tiny
*  group who chanted jihad now as the accent tv presenter Adel Ray put it jihad means struggle
*  a muslim spiritual struggle to avoid sin and be a better human avoid evil to do good therefore
*  tens of thousands were performing jihad in the peaceful protest it can also have a war context
*  let's not focus on one person at a fringe event even the metropolitan police came to that conclusion
*  hence the home secretary's fury now without getting bogged down the semantics here this was
*  a tiny group an absolutely massive protest they are focusing on this tiny group to deflect from
*  the massive diverse protest which included Jewish activists who I marched alongside now there are
*  even growing calls for protests against this horror to be banned as one male on Sunday columnist wrote
*  the rights of protest must be safeguarded but it's clear that over the last two weekends London's
*  Jewish community has felt directly intimidated by the Gaza demonstration that's it now the points
*  been made there should be no further demos allowed for the foreseeable future now as Aaron Keller a
*  Jewish peace activist I know wrote in response I marched yesterday with a Jewish block and I
*  couldn't have felt more welcome I encourage fellow Jews to come and experience it for themselves
*  if nothing else it's an object lesson in how the media weaponizes anti-semitism to fear monger and
*  gaslight now these demands to ban protest would be oh so convenient wouldn't they that as the
*  atrocities grow as the detol mounts those opposing what has been done with the active supports of our
*  government would then be silenced now here's another example the former editor of the Jewish
*  Chronicle wrote I'm feeling pure rage at what's being allowed to happen on the streets of London
*  a hundred thousand people marching because they think Hamas didn't go far enough a hundred
*  thousand people who want rid of me and my fellow Jews and don't give me that bullshit about a
*  peaceful march for Palestine outright outrageous an outrageous despicable lie a truly appalling
*  and disgusting smear notice notes by the way how there was only a tiny handful of arrests compare
*  the number of arrests to the number of people who get arrested at the average football match
*  per person now what's particularly vicious is that that means it's directed in part the Jewish
*  activists who marched there is no evidence that the vast majority of people on that demonstration
*  had any sympathy with Hamas's atrocities I went up and down that protest looking at banner after
*  banner listening to chant after chant and I did not hear anything anything even remotely
*  corresponding to that claim this idea that they wanted to murder Jews we're talking basically
*  about genocidal sentiment and I believe that this rhetoric is dangerous many of those marching
*  are Muslims understandable because they're watching the mass slaughter of fellow Muslims
*  and demonizing so many disproportionately Muslim protesters as from my reading of that tweet makes
*  them have to be violent and genocidal anti-Jewish haters will only whip up further hatred against
*  Muslims and yes there is an increase in anti-Semitism and Islamophobia at times like this
*  and we have to fight it Jewish people must not be held responsible for what is going on now in Gaza
*  equally we have to fight this growing I'm afraid officially sanctioned prejudice
*  against Muslims now indeed the successor of this individual as editor at the Jewish Chronicle Jake
*  Wallace Simmons wrote we need to face reality much of Muslim culture is in the grip of a death call
*  that sacralizes bloodshed not all but many Muslims are brainwashed by it that's a big part of the
*  problem he then deleted it went on tv and lied about what he wrote this I should say despite
*  coming from Jewish Chronicle editors is a view which so many so many British Jews have absolutely
*  no time for whatsoever this bigotry is dangerous it's playing with fire it is transparent again
*  transparent what's going on here cheerleaders for this atrocity know their reputations are being
*  splashed by the rivers of blood which are now flowing in the Gaza Strip they may have heard
*  that the IDF has declared the emphasis is on damage not accuracy that one Israeli official
*  has declared Gaza will eventually turn into a city of tents adding there will be no buildings
*  that hostages and civilian casualties will be secondary to destroying Hamas as the economy
*  minister near Baqirah told ABC News even if it takes a year he said they may be familiar with
*  Israel's former chief military advocate general the country's former attorney general who declared
*  that to destroy Hamas then you have to destroy Gaza because everything in Gaza almost every building
*  there is a stronghold of Hamas that Israel is dropping leaflets on northern Gaza warning
*  civilians who remain there they may be considered a partner in a terrorist organization self-evidently
*  arguing that non-combatants may be considered fair game leaving aside the fact that southern
*  Gaza is itself being bombed contrary to Israeli claims that it's a safe area and that many are
*  unable to flee not least the injured and the infirm that is a public confession of further
*  war crimes to come they must know the apologists for what is happening that Israel is guilty of a
*  collective punishment by depriving innocent people of water food energy and medicine and they must
*  know that there's an indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas going on unless they are completely
*  and utterly delusional also the fact the United Nations has warned of mass ethnic cleansing
*  denounced crimes against humanity and even argued there was a risk of genocide against the
*  Palestinian people as this goes on the more horror will grow and the more people will get angry they
*  will look at an establishment which is complicit in all of these crimes we after all arm Israel
*  and have provided it with diplomatic cover throughout this gruesome episode and they
*  will be increasingly disgusted and appalled so that establishment is just going to try and
*  redirect fire at those who oppose this horror they will try to argue that the real extremists
*  the real moral disgraces aren't the ones who support the collective punishment the mass death
*  the war crimes the human rights abuses that Israel is objectively guilty of but those who oppose these
*  horrors as they become more and more desperate as public backlash becomes ever more intense
*  they will double down on this strategy we must see it for what it is and take it on this is a moment
*  for absolute moral clarity those behind this I firmly believe will be damned by history but
*  we can't simply wait around for history's verdict every day more and more people are going to die
*  they're going to be maimed they're going to be traumatized and they're going to suffer
*  and we must speak out louder with more and more courage more determination never giving an inch
*  not one inch in our opposition to war crimes to the killing of Palestinian and Israeli civilians
*  our opposition to collective punishment to siege to apartheid and in our support unwavering support
*  for a just and lasting settlement that provides peace and security for Arabs and Jews in the
*  Middle East alike free free Palestine please like and subscribe do you keep the show on the road
