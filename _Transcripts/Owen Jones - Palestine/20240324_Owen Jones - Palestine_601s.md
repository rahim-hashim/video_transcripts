# Britain ADMITS Israel Deliberately Starving Gaza
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [March 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KW2xqDO7_g)
*  This should shock you to your very core.
*  The British Foreign Secretary, Lord David Cameron, has sent a letter to Alicia Kern's MP.
*  She's the Conservative Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the House of Commons,
*  who I must admit, just taking a non-partisan perspective here,
*  has done some invaluable work in scrutinising the actions,
*  the murderous actions of the Israeli state and UK complicity
*  in the utter horror being inflicted against the Palestinian people in Gaza.
*  She's done a much, much, much better job
*  than the leader of the opposition, Keir Starmer, or the Labour Front bench.
*  Now, this was in response to a letter from Kern's concerning claims
*  made by the now suspended Israeli official spokesperson,
*  Elon Levy, as famine stalks the people of Gaza.
*  Now, the preeminent expert on famine, Alex Deval, who I've interviewed on this channel,
*  has said this is the most intense famine since World War II,
*  while the charity Medical Aid for Palestinians have said
*  this is the worst decline in the nutritional status of a population
*  ever recorded, ever recorded.
*  Now, Elon Levy had told Alicia Kerns that there are no limits on the entry
*  of food, water, medicine or shelter and equipment
*  allowed by Israel into Gaza,
*  claiming that the crossings into Gaza actually have excess capacity.
*  He says, test us, send another 100 trucks a day to Kerem Shalom
*  and we'll get them in.
*  That's what he said.
*  Now, Alicia Kerns, to her great credit, put these specific, very clear claims
*  from the official spokesperson of the Israeli government
*  to the British Foreign Secretary.
*  She says that the government of Israel is stating there are no issues
*  getting aid into Gaza, adding,
*  This is not the assessment I have reached,
*  nor that of the international aid agencies I have met,
*  nor governments with whom I have spoken.
*  You have been equally clear in your recent statements and media interviews
*  that Israel can increase the aid deliveries if it chooses to do so.
*  She discusses, among other things, how about 20% of munitions are unexploded
*  and that's also blocking a surge in aid,
*  how UK aid-provided water bladders are stuck at the border
*  after Israel has rejected them for entry into Gaza,
*  rejecting specific British aid.
*  Now for Lord Cameron's response to this.
*  And this, I believe, is one of the most important documents
*  in this current catastrophe.
*  He accepts that maritime corridors and air drops cannot substitute delivery
*  through land routes.
*  This is an extremely important point.
*  Air drops only offer a fraction of the aid that is required.
*  They're not properly targeted, they're dangerous,
*  they've already killed Palestinians due to malfunctioning parachutes
*  and indeed risk the lives of Palestinian kids
*  who sometimes swim out to sea when they land there
*  and also they're degrading, utterly humiliating,
*  expecting Palestinians to run like animals, to aid being dropped from the skies.
*  Now Lord Cameron has said,
*  I've been clear that Israel must open more land routes,
*  including for longer and with fewer screening requirements,
*  adding that it will continue to press the full opening of the Ashdod port.
*  That's one of Israel's main three ports, one of its three main ports,
*  and where ships carrying humanitarian aid to Gaza take their cargo.
*  So he's saying here that Israel is voluntarily not opening more land routes,
*  not opening for long enough and imposing too many screening requirements.
*  All of that is leading to a catastrophic lack of aid,
*  not least food, but other aid, entering Gaza.
*  These are all choices made by the Israeli state,
*  which is preventing food and other deliveries essential for people
*  to be able to continue to live from entering,
*  all causing Gaza to collapse into one of the great humanitarian catastrophes of our age.
*  Now specifically Lord Cameron rebuts,
*  Elon Levy, the now suspended Israeli government spokesperson.
*  He says, I can confirm that the United Nations has not requested
*  that the Kerem Shalom crossing is closed on Saturdays.
*  A specific, very clear claim made by Elon Levy, the Israeli government spokesperson,
*  adding, it is our understanding that Israel closes it due to the Sabbath.
*  So this official Israeli spokesperson was publicly making a claim,
*  which was entirely and utterly false.
*  Once again, the long track record of Israel making official public statements,
*  which are false.
*  You cannot believe a single thing Israel's authorities ever say.
*  Now specifically, this really is so important. Just listen to it.
*  He says, similarly, you cite claims that I've also heard elsewhere
*  that international donors should send as much aid as they wish and Israel will facilitate its entry.
*  I wish this were the case.
*  It is of enormous frustration that UK aid for Gaza has been routinely held up,
*  waiting for Israeli permissions.
*  For instance, I'm aware of some UK funded aid being stuck at the border for just under three weeks,
*  waiting for approval.
*  Now listen to this.
*  The main block has remained arbitrary denials by the government of Israel
*  and lengthy clearing processes, including multiple screenings and narrow opening windows in daylight hours.
*  Just absorb all of that.
*  Now firstly, either Elon Levy, official Israeli spokesperson, is completely incompetent at his job
*  and has gone completely wrong what is actually happening on the ground as per what is the most critical aspect
*  of the current situation in Gaza, which is why famine is now spreading at an unprecedented rate,
*  or he is knowingly spreading lies in order to stop people believing that Israel is starving the people of Gaza.
*  Lies he must know that if taken seriously and acted upon will kill huge numbers of innocent people
*  and indeed not just in terms of what Western governments do,
*  but also deceive Western public opinion to stop them putting pressure on their own governments
*  to use their leverage over Israel to stop starving people.
*  Now, as I've said once to him directly on Twitter, and I'll say it again,
*  it is my belief that it might be 10 years or 20 years or 30 years, but that man will end up in jail.
*  The Genocide Convention of 1948 criminalises genocide, obviously,
*  and it also criminalises incitement of genocide and complicity in genocide.
*  And if you are knowingly spreading information which allows a state to starve to death a civilian population,
*  then you are, I believe, self-evidently complicit in genocide.
*  The crucial point here is David Cameron, Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom, one of Israel's key allies,
*  has made it clear publicly that Israel is preventing desperately needed aid to a population
*  which is beginning to starve to death because of arbitrary delays and lengthy clearing procedures,
*  which can take weeks and narrow opening windows in daylight hours.
*  What you can clearly understand from David Cameron's letter is Israel is intentionally putting up
*  as many blocks and delays as possible to prevent aid getting into Gaza
*  with the consequence of people starving to death.
*  Now, David Cameron notes that far fewer trucks entering Gaza than before 7th October,
*  and obviously it's important to say need now is much, much greater,
*  not just in terms of the devastation suffered by civilians, the total destruction of Gaza,
*  but taking into account the decimation of agriculture, so the ability to grow food, for example,
*  and the mass destruction of the sorts of essentials that human life depends on.
*  So David Cameron also notes they're continuing to press Israel to allow in fuel supplies needed for water pumping and desalination
*  and to restore water supplies through pipelines to Gaza,
*  adding pointedly that Israel has the ability to turn the tax back on, they should do so.
*  So what the British government is officially saying is Israel is voluntarily cutting off water to Gaza.
*  Now, don't go applauding the British government for this sort of candid response about what's actually happening.
*  They facilitated this atrocity from the very beginning.
*  They're not using the leverage they have both as an ally of the state responsible for this artificial humanitarian catastrophe
*  and because of the leverage they would have if they broke with the US over this,
*  in terms of bolstering voices in the US demanding the Biden administration uses its overwhelming leverage
*  over its client state of Israel, the US could end this at any moment.
*  If they chose to do so, it would end immediately.
*  This is a confession by the British government of straightforward genocidal intent.
*  The British government has admitted that Israel is deliberately starving the Palestinian people of Gaza.
*  There is no other logical or plausible interpretation of what he said.
*  Notes that the International Court of Justice, the highest court on earth in its provisional orders,
*  ordered Israel to ensure access to humanitarian aid in order to prevent genocide.
*  Clearly that's not happened. The exact opposite has happened.
*  And starving an entire people deliberately is genocidal.
*  And if this was a state which was an ally to the United States, we wouldn't even need to have such an absurd debate.
*  Now, let's just listen briefly to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
*  According to the most respected measure of these things,
*  100% of the population in Gaza is at severe levels of acute food insecurity.
*  That's the first time an entire population has been so classified.
*  We also see, again, according to, in this case, the United Nations,
*  100% the totality of the population is in need of humanitarian assistance.
*  Well, how did that happen, Secretary of State?
*  Because of the crime that the US state has armed and backed from the very beginning.
*  That's how. Those starving kids, those starving Palestinians, all of their deaths are on you.
*  Crocodile tears, indeed. I'll keep saying it because it's true.
*  One of the great crimes of our age.
*  And those responsible must never, never be allowed to get away with this.
