# Politicians PLOT Police State - This Is Not A Drill
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [February 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA)
*  Much of the political and media establishments in this country are shameless. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=0.0s)]
*  They are deeply incestuous. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=5.24s)]
*  They are in large part the same social set. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=7.0s)]
*  There's a revolving door between them. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=9.88s)]
*  People who work in the media often end up working for politicians. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=11.36s)]
*  Those in the political world end up in the other direction, taking up media positions. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=14.6s)]
*  And they have these overlapping prejudices and worldviews when it comes to key issues. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  They frequently treat politics as a soap opera. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=23.68s)]
*  They all see themselves as made characters in it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=26.96s)]
*  They dislike scrutiny. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=29.04s)]
*  They can flay legitimate heated critiques with genuine threats to personal security. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=31.04s)]
*  And they often see mass movements as a dangerous mob. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=35.96s)]
*  Which brings me to why all of a sudden the story is about how we need to restrict [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=39.56s)]
*  protest and protect the political establishment from the mob. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=44.6s)]
*  Now, there's a long tradition of elites using calamities, which they helped create [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  and turning them into opportunities for themselves. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=53.32s)]
*  The financial crash, that's such a major case in point. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=56.2s)]
*  Total catastrophe caused by the private sector, by the greed of the banks, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=59.36s)]
*  letting the market run riot. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=63.6s)]
*  That's what caused it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=65.48s)]
*  But then the Tories came along and rebranded it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=66.72s)]
*  It's a crisis, actually, of the public sector. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=68.8s)]
*  It's overspending by the government that caused the mess. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=71.4s)]
*  And it's all an opportunity to roll back the state, not to sort out market anarchy. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  Extraordinary. Now, this time around, politicians being complicit [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=79.8s)]
*  in Britain's role in directly facilitating Israeli war crimes [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=83.56s)]
*  has become a big old moral panic about protests, the protests against that. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=87.52s)]
*  It's not the politicians with big questions to answer about, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  for example, the mass slaughter of tens of thousands of people. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  It's the people protesting against them. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=99.6s)]
*  Now, this was particularly sparked by labor, according to the party's own sources, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=102.12s)]
*  blackmailing the speaker to overturn parliamentary protocol, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=107.2s)]
*  to trash the SNP's ceasefire motion, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=111.72s)]
*  specifically because it held Israel responsible for collective punishment. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=114.24s)]
*  And then a story was concocted by a range of different [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=118.08s)]
*  politicians, media figures and indeed the speaker who said this was all because [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  he was scared of a terrorist attack in which MPs would be murdered. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=128.04s)]
*  No, it doesn't make any sense. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=133.2s)]
*  This then triggered a renewed moral panic about dangerous extreme protests. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=135.52s)]
*  Now, as I've already covered, this obviously sparked a big wave of Islamophobia [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=139.4s)]
*  because a large contingent of Muslim protesters among those who are [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=144.28s)]
*  taking to the streets against the Oslo Gays Gazette, that became the focus. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=148.92000000000002s)]
*  There's also been used to further demonize and spurn, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=152.6s)]
*  spawn renewed calls for a crackdown on the already [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=156.72s)]
*  absurdly deceived right to protest, a right our ancestors fought for at huge cost [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=160.56s)]
*  and huge sacrifice. Now, don't let the facts get in the way. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=165.88s)]
*  The arrest rate of these protests is extremely low, less than a large football match, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=168.51999999999998s)]
*  despite the punitive anti-protest laws that already exist in this country [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=172.67999999999998s)]
*  and political pressure on the police who are already institutionally hostile [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=176.48s)]
*  to protesters anyway. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  Now, all of this, by the way, is an example of what is called crybullying. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=181.39999999999998s)]
*  The definition of that is a person who engages in intimidation, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=185.67999999999998s)]
*  harassment or other abusive behavior while claiming to be a victim. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=188.35999999999999s)]
*  Our political establishment is now claiming to be the victim. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  I'm not even that's not an exaggeration. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=195.48s)]
*  That's literally what's happened. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=197.28s)]
*  We've gone from not, I don't know, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=198.28s)]
*  14000 children or just two million to two point two million Gazans [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=201.44s)]
*  suffering the most hideous horror with the direct complicity of our political elite. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=205.8s)]
*  They're not the victims. No, our rulers are the victims. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=210.8s)]
*  Now, I should say that isn't to say MP security isn't a genuine concern, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=214.4s)]
*  nor does it need to be protected. Of course it does. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  That's absolutely important in a democracy, too. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=221.52s)]
*  And in the last eight years, within the last eight years, I should say, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=223.84s)]
*  Labour's Joe Cox was horrifically murdered by a far right terrorist [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=226.92s)]
*  and also the conservative David Amis was horrifically murdered by an Islamist [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=231.39999999999998s)]
*  fundamentalist terrorist. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=235.39999999999998s)]
*  But what is clearly and self evidently happening is that legitimate scrutiny [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=236.48s)]
*  and lobbying and organizing to put collective pressure on MPs. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=240.2s)]
*  All key features of a democracy or a healthy functioning democracy [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=244.12s)]
*  are being conflated with terrorism and violence. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=248.16s)]
*  Note, for example, the horrific murder of Joe Cox. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=250.92s)]
*  How often do you hear about her murder being cited in debates about immigration [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=253.84s)]
*  with MPs saying we must change the tone of this because of how extremists [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=259.12s)]
*  can be radicalized, as we saw with the case of the murder of Joe Cox? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=261.96s)]
*  You don't get that her murder is cited in regards to issues [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=265.8s)]
*  that aren't relevant to that, like Gaza. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=269.32s)]
*  Now, the speaker's claim just became accepted as a fact by media outlets [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=272.36s)]
*  and politicians. And so the story was moved from the mass slaughter [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=276.28000000000003s)]
*  of Palestinians to how do we protect our MPs from protests against [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=280.0s)]
*  the mass slaughter of Palestinians? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=284.04s)]
*  Just listen to this from Sky News as an example. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=285.6s)]
*  He clearly felt MP safety was so in question [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=287.44s)]
*  that he felt strong enough to change the procedures of the House. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=291.52s)]
*  Whether that was a mistake for him to be influenced in that way or not. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=296.4s)]
*  As Home Secretary, do you look at that and think we must boost [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=300.52s)]
*  MPs security immediately to stop this even being a discussion point? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=303.88s)]
*  So we we have been very conscious long before the events of this week. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=308.12s)]
*  We've been very conscious that there has been increased pressure [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=313.36s)]
*  on all members of parliament. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=317.0s)]
*  Note here the framing of that presenter just completely accepting as a fact [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=319.08s)]
*  this whole narrative. Now, John Woodcock, a former Labour MP, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=324.24s)]
*  he resigned attacking Jamie Corbyn's leadership, then urged Britain's [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=327.8s)]
*  to vote for Boris Johnson, then got a live peerage from the Tories. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=332.24s)]
*  All right, so isn't it? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=336.59999999999997s)]
*  And then was made, and I quote, by the Conservatives, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=337.71999999999997s)]
*  an independent adviser on political violence and disruption. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=340.08s)]
*  Detached old independent John Woodcock. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=343.23999999999995s)]
*  Now, he's been put in charge of a government commissioned review [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=345.28s)]
*  and to tackling political violence, as it's officially called. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=348.76s)]
*  In response to the mass Gaza protests, he's argued for protest [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=351.79999999999995s)]
*  organizers to have to pay the cost of policing demonstrations. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=354.76s)]
*  A completely absurd attempt to shut down the right to protest, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=358.4s)]
*  which is a basic fundamental right. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=361.28s)]
*  It is a responsibility of a democratic society. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=363.03999999999996s)]
*  To facilitate citizens ability to organize and protest, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=366.28s)]
*  not to make it financially prohibitive. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=369.32s)]
*  I would note, by the way, that one of the political events [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=372.08s)]
*  that drove the rise of the Labour Party was legislation [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=375.64s)]
*  that was introduced at the beginning of the 20th century to make striking [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=379.59999999999997s)]
*  workers financially liable for the costs incurred of them going on strike. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=383.84s)]
*  That was understood as an attempt to shut down the right to strike. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=389.59999999999997s)]
*  And it's the same principle. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=395.56s)]
*  It's an attack on democracy. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=397.96s)]
*  Now, he wants special police orders to be able to shut down public [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=399.72s)]
*  protests around democratic venues, including Parliament, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=403.6s)]
*  council buildings and MPs, offices. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=407.0s)]
*  Well, we can't have MPs here in a protest, can we? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=411.0s)]
*  We've got to make sure protests are as far away from politicians as possible. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=413.6s)]
*  Banning protests outside Parliament. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=417.6s)]
*  You just hear it in another country like. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=420.08s)]
*  A government doing that, you didn't see things. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=424.88s)]
*  Well, that country is right on the way to tyranny. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=426.52s)]
*  I mean, listen to this now as it is, and I'll come on to it. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=429.4s)]
*  The right to protest in Britain has already been trashed. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=432.68s)]
*  It's already been massively curtailed. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=436.04s)]
*  Now, it's very obvious that John Woodcock is deeply hostile [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=438.52s)]
*  to the political message of the protests against Israel's also against Gaza. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=441.44s)]
*  He wouldn't dispute that for a second. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=445.8s)]
*  Now, I would ask him. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=448.8s)]
*  What are you interested in here? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=450.84000000000003s)]
*  Is it actually about what you see as this menace? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=452.4s)]
*  Or do you think it would be kind of nice if these people [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=456.4s)]
*  you really strongly disagree with would just shut up? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=460.52s)]
*  Well, how does that fit in with democracy exactly? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=464.15999999999997s)]
*  Now, next on our list, the Home Affairs Committee, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=468.32s)]
*  led by the Labour MP Diana Johnson, is suggesting protest [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=471.59999999999997s)]
*  must be forced to give more notice. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=475.23999999999995s)]
*  So basically shutting down protests, which respond to sudden events. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=476.96s)]
*  Again, just trying to make process as difficult as possible. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=480.68s)]
*  The claim here, again, is to drain on policing resources. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=483.56s)]
*  Once more, the right to protest in a democracy has to be facilitated [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=486.48s)]
*  by the government. It's not a privilege. It's a right. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=490.28s)]
*  The reason that the costs involved is because so many people want to protest [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=492.88s)]
*  and so many people want to protest because our government is complicit [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=497.24s)]
*  in one of the worst crimes of our time. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=501.28s)]
*  How is history going to look back at this? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=504.24s)]
*  Just take a moment, actually. Just sorry. Just stop. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=505.56s)]
*  Stop for a minute. How is history going to look at this? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=507.88s)]
*  How is history really going to... [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=510.32s)]
*  They're going to see a massive, horrific atrocity being committed. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=512.4s)]
*  They're going to see the government of this country complicit, selling arms, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=517.52s)]
*  diplomatic support. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=520.8s)]
*  We've got a place, obviously, on the Security Council, which is absurd, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=521.76s)]
*  but nonetheless, it is what it is. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=525.08s)]
*  And they're going to go... [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=527.28s)]
*  They're going to look back and go, so what? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=529.24s)]
*  Oh, they tried to shut down protests. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=530.64s)]
*  I mean, come on. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=533.6s)]
*  It's not going to look good, is it? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=535.6s)]
*  It will look very obvious with historical hindsight. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=537.48s)]
*  It should look obvious now, but because of the media we have, it isn't. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=540.6400000000001s)]
*  Now, listen to this. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=544.44s)]
*  The Home Secretary, James Cleverly, has said pro-Palestinian [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=545.8000000000001s)]
*  demonstrators should go home because they've made their point [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=549.2s)]
*  and they're putting a huge pressure on policing [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=551.9200000000001s)]
*  and they're not really saying anything new. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=554.08s)]
*  Firstly, politicians just telling protesters to shut up. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=557.48s)]
*  I mean, again, this is a democracy, but is he taking the piss? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=561.6s)]
*  Maybe the message would change, James Cleverly, by name, not by nature. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=566.2800000000001s)]
*  If... [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=572.12s)]
*  Which is, by the way, the message is stop sorting Palestinians. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=574.4000000000001s)]
*  Maybe that message would change if the reality would change. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=576.8800000000001s)]
*  If the mass sorts of Palestinians would stop, the protest would stop. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=580.0s)]
*  I don't know if you considered that, but if the British government [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=583.36s)]
*  doesn't just arm and support Israel as it committed one of the worst crimes [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=586.6s)]
*  of our age, people would just stop protesting. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=590.9200000000001s)]
*  Now, let's listen to Labour's Harriet Harmon. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=596.0400000000001s)]
*  Because it is inflamed and there's a reality of the threat. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=598.0400000000001s)]
*  But actually, this is about democracy, because democracy depends on MPs [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=602.0s)]
*  voting the way they see fit. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=607.08s)]
*  And that's why the speaker is so exercised about this. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=609.5200000000001s)]
*  It's not just about personal safety. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=612.8000000000001s)]
*  It's also about safeguarding our democracy. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=615.44s)]
*  I want Harriet Harmon mother of... [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=618.32s)]
*  Oh, my good grief. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=619.96s)]
*  Good... [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=622.36s)]
*  What is that? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=623.84s)]
*  Is that... That's how she thinks democracy works. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=625.48s)]
*  She's been in an MP since 1983. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=627.8800000000001s)]
*  Good to know how our politicians see democracy. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=630.0s)]
*  Elected accountable politicians making decisions without anyone [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=633.12s)]
*  out there having anything to do with it, except what every five years [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=637.2s)]
*  when there's an election. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=639.8800000000001s)]
*  Is that what she thinks democracy is? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=641.2s)]
*  That isn't how it works. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=642.6800000000001s)]
*  The right to protest doesn't just exist, by the way, is a... [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=644.0s)]
*  Let's give people the right to vent and get out of the system. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=646.7600000000001s)]
*  It exists on the grounds that democracy includes giving people the right [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=649.36s)]
*  to organise and put pressure on accountable politicians. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=652.68s)]
*  That has proved absolutely pivotal in social progress. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=656.4799999999999s)]
*  Many of the rights and freedoms we have is because people fought for them [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=660.0799999999999s)]
*  and annoyed politicians, annoyed powerful people. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=663.8s)]
*  Social progress involves pissing powerful people off. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=667.4s)]
*  By definition. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=672.0s)]
*  Do you think MPs liked being protested by gay rights activists? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=673.76s)]
*  No, they hated it. They really hated it. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=678.68s)]
*  I mean, they disgusted them for a start. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=681.52s)]
*  Tough. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=683.7199999999999s)]
*  Has she seen the polling, incidentally? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=685.2399999999999s)]
*  The latest YouGov poll has 66% of Britons backing an immediate ceasefire [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=687.88s)]
*  based on Israel ending its military action compared to 13% opposed. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=692.56s)]
*  I'm sorry, is it possible somehow to get public opinion reflected [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=696.16s)]
*  on this issue in parliament? Is that possible without [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=699.52s)]
*  MPs going, no, no, this is violence and aggression? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=703.04s)]
*  Then we have Rishi Sunak yesterday tweeting, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=706.7199999999999s)]
*  I will do whatever it takes to defend our democracy and our values. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=709.04s)]
*  I mean, if the abstract seems fine, what does he mean? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=712.12s)]
*  He quote, treated, we will ensure violence and intimidation has no place [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=714.4s)]
*  in our democratic protest, their process based on a meeting between him [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=717.64s)]
*  and the Home Secretary and police chiefs to discuss how to better protect [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=721.16s)]
*  the people, processes and institutions in our democracy. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=724.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's definitely what you're planning, isn't it? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=730.16s)]
*  Not crack down, a further crackdown on the rights of protest. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=731.68s)]
*  Look, I don't want to get my little tiny valiant out here. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=734.68s)]
*  And I've talked, I mentioned this in the other video, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=737.44s)]
*  but I've been repeatedly silenced in the street by far right extremists. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=739.96s)]
*  I was beaten up by a far right extremist in 2019. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=743.4000000000001s)]
*  He was jailed for two years and nine months [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=745.8000000000001s)]
*  after a judge found him driven by homophobia and hatred of my political views. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=747.72s)]
*  That did not become a big story about political violence at the time. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=752.0s)]
*  I would note, I thought when it actually happened, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=755.2800000000001s)]
*  some people, some journalists complained that I was described as a journalist. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=759.96s)]
*  The coverage. Oh, my word. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=763.44s)]
*  I get bombarded with often extremely graphic and lurid threats, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=766.76s)]
*  survivors and death threats. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=769.84s)]
*  Some of the people who follow me on social media have seen them. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=770.92s)]
*  Not part of the conversation, though, is it? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=773.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't count because I'm left wing. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=774.88s)]
*  I'm a protester and I'm on the side. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=776.2s)]
*  We're not sorting Palestinians. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=777.68s)]
*  But more to the point, you know, in terms of people who are targeted, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=779.12s)]
*  particularly women of color [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=782.92s)]
*  who speak out on, for example, justice for the Palestinians, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=785.4s)]
*  who are constantly subjected to violent threats and rape threats [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=789.08s)]
*  and threats of death threats. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=793.32s)]
*  Not part of the conversation. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=795.84s)]
*  Now, the politics of all of this are not what I would describe as subtle. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=797.24s)]
*  Let's listen to this from the Sky News presenter, Trevor Phillips. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=801.72s)]
*  But the real point is that for the first time since the 17th century, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=805.6800000000001s)]
*  when Charles the first and then later Oliver Cromwell [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=810.2s)]
*  marched into the House of Commons and threatened the MPs at Swordpoint, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=813.44s)]
*  it seems that our elected representatives are acting out of fear [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=817.6800000000001s)]
*  rather than out of conviction. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=822.2800000000001s)]
*  It's easy for those of us whose families are not at risk to be heroic. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=825.28s)]
*  But this is how a democracy dies. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=830.16s)]
*  Most MPs will, I hope, resist the pressure to surrender their independence. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=833.68s)]
*  We'll ask this morning what we need to do to help them protect our democracy. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=838.92s)]
*  I'm going to lose my mind. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=843.64s)]
*  Firstly, you don't even need to read a history book. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=845.6s)]
*  There's lots of occasions when violent threats to MPs have been cited [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=847.72s)]
*  during parliamentary debates on contentious issues in the recent period. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=850.52s)]
*  I did a quick Google. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=854.32s)]
*  One example, pro-hunting MPs had to take extra security measures [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=855.96s)]
*  on the advice of police after apparently being found on an animal rights hit list. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=860.24s)]
*  Why didn't that cause a moral panic about MPs being violently pressured? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=865.32s)]
*  I speak as a passionate opponent of hunting, but were we opponents [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=868.84s)]
*  of hunting or collectively tarred by that? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=872.8s)]
*  No. I mean, the article said the police warning comes amid fears [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=875.4s)]
*  that animal rights activists are employing increasingly violent tactics, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=878.88s)]
*  including nail bombs and attacks on scientists. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=881.88s)]
*  So obviously there were people who were not messing around here. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=883.96s)]
*  But also the arguments cited by Trevor Phillips have always been used [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=887.2800000000001s)]
*  against democracy. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=890.2s)]
*  That is the threat of the mob, of mob rule, intimidating the powerful. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=891.52s)]
*  That's how democracy was always carried out by its opponents. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=895.96s)]
*  I mean, he talks about the 17th century, the last time that happened. What? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=899.1600000000001s)]
*  I mean, these arguments have been used constantly since. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=902.1600000000001s)]
*  In the 19th century, during the great arguments [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=905.32s)]
*  against expanding the franchise, the right to vote, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=908.24s)]
*  there's constant talk about the mortal threat posed by the aggressive [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=910.88s)]
*  and violent mob. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=913.72s)]
*  I mean, they cited the French Revolution, which, as you probably know, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=914.76s)]
*  involved a fair bit of guillotinic. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=917.48s)]
*  The fear the mob has always been used to argue against democracy. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=919.48s)]
*  And indeed, in the current context, you keep hearing politicians [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=923.2s)]
*  and media outlets talking about the mob. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=925.6s)]
*  And they've already had huge clampdowns on the right to protest, as I say, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=927.4s)]
*  that the police can shut down protests if they're deemed to be too noisy, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=931.28s)]
*  too noisy, kind of the point, and give police discretion [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=935.84s)]
*  to stop any protests on totally arbitrary grounds, as well as sweeping grounds [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=938.9200000000001s)]
*  to arrest people and even the suspicion they might engage [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=942.88s)]
*  in some form of nonviolent disruption. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=945.8s)]
*  You can see what's happening here. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=948.2s)]
*  Most of our media and political establishment have been morally disgraced. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=949.88s)]
*  They lined up behind one of the gravest crimes of our age. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=953.16s)]
*  And now they're trying to play a game of deflect, deflect, deflect. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=956.24s)]
*  The real dangerous extremists are those who fought against mass murder. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=959.48s)]
*  And indeed, they're trying to silence the very people [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=963.48s)]
*  who could hold them to account for backing this mass slaughter. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=965.6s)]
*  They know the scale of the crime. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=968.36s)]
*  They know the scale of the crime is only going to be more obvious [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=970.8s)]
*  and they don't want to be held to account. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=973.4s)]
*  So they're going to shut people up. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=975.08s)]
*  And in the process, they are marching us towards a police state. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=976.56s)]
*  Well, we either let them get away with it. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=979.48s)]
*  Or we don't. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0EghA4hjXA&t=983.2s)]
