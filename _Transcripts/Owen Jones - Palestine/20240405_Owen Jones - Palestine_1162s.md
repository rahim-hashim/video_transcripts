# I Challenged Israeli Onslaught Apologist On TV. Then This Happened.
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFqXGkfcyzY)
*  So yesterday I went on Sky News to discuss Israel's onslaught against Gaza. The other
*  panellist was Hen Mazig, an Israeli so-called influencer. Hen Mazig has been an apologist
*  for the onslaught against Gaza which to date of course has killed tens of thousands of people,
*  including of course huge numbers of children. Now this has been a truly fascinating experience
*  because apologists for Israel's mass slaughter of Gaza know they've lost public opinion, know this
*  atrocity is simply too grave and too obvious to defend and they have resorted to deceit, smear,
*  deflection, gaslighting and the attempt to twist words out of their meaning, something we saw them
*  do of course to the brilliant director Jonathan Glazer. That has been my experience here. Now a
*  little note, normally I turn down media requests where the subject is specifically only on Gaza.
*  I try to get Palestinian voices to be heard and platformed instead, have been successful on a
*  number of occasions. When you see me debating this issue on TV it's overwhelmingly been on panel
*  shows where this topic comes up among many others. I'll leave it to you to decide whether doing this
*  was the right call. Now let's just go through some clips from this, let's just call it illuminating
*  conversation and I'll have a little chat about my thoughts about them. To begin with for context,
*  the Sky News correspondent who was on previously had suggested it was politically impossible to
*  suspend arms sales to Israel, in the case of the US that is, and Hen Mazig claimed that a majority
*  or at least 13,000 of those killed in Gaza were so-called Hamas terrorists. I can sense your
*  exasperation when you were looking at Joe, at Mark talking about Joe Biden's comments and there.
*  Well to be clear Israel has said 9,000 so-called terrorists have been killed but as the Israeli
*  newspaper Haaretz pointed out they include those who cross into a kill zone with an invisible line
*  including many civilians and when they cross they are then posthumously termed terrorists with no
*  evidence whatsoever. 40,000 Palestinians are likely to have been killed or more in Gaza because the
*  official statistics exclude those buried under the rubble. Now the point about Joe Biden and
*  his position there, Joe Biden's hot air all the way through has been a defining feature of this
*  conflict, so-called conflict, genocide longslaught against the people of Gaza and he's armed and
*  backed Israel as it has caused so much destruction, the vast majority, sorry a large majority of Gaza's
*  civilian infrastructure is now severely damaged or destroyed so Gaza is now a different color
*  and texture when looked at from space. Where around 13,000 plus children have died violent
*  horrible deaths either with their buildings coming down on top of them or being burned
*  and cooked slowly to death or suffocated or both at the same time and that point which I did think
*  was editorializing on the part of your journalist was that it was beyond any doubt or any reason
*  that you know it was completely unthinkable that the US could pull the plug on arms because that
*  would then pose an existential threat to Israel. That's in Israel's court. Israel has decided to
*  starve the people of Gaza, the fastest drop in the nutritional status of a population in recorded
*  history, the most severe famine since World War II now beckons. You have people in the north at the
*  moment who are starving to death and eating animal feed in order to live. As David Cameron, foreign
*  secretary, not someone I naturally normally quote, detailed in a letter which led, I would
*  note to the sacking of the Israeli spokesperson, Elon Levy, which is probably why you don't have
*  him on your news channel anymore, is because Elon Levy made false statements about aid trucks being
*  allowed in which then David Cameron went through and said that wasn't true. Israel had gone to
*  Great Leads to stop them coming in. The point I'm making is Israel all the way through this has been
*  raising civilian infrastructure to the ground. It has conducted the biggest killing of aid workers
*  in recorded history and the point I would make and this is why I think there's a bit of journalistic
*  malpractice which has defined this conflict. Israeli leaders and officials were very clear from
*  the very beginning about what they were going to do. They didn't hide it. You don't have to go
*  through leaked documents. You just have to listen to, for example, to Yoav Galan, the defence minister
*  who's in the war cabinet of three, who said two days after the atrocities committed by Hamas on
*  the 7th of October, that they were going to cut off food, water and all the essentials of life on
*  the grounds they were fighting human animals and then on the 9th of October he declared he was
*  lifting all the restraints on soldiers and a day later he said he was lifting all restrictions
*  on Israeli soldiers. We've now seen that and the impunity that Israel enjoys from the west
*  has led to aid workers who shared their coordinates on a pre-approved route with massive
*  world central kitchen logos who were chased from car to car with the drone until every single one
*  was dead. And I'll tell you this, if that's true with those aid workers, ordinary Palestinians
*  don't have a chance and Joe Biden has sat through all of this, wringing his hand occasionally.
*  Let me give you a chance. I'm interested in that there's a lot that I'm sure some of the
*  phraseology you won't agree with. I'll say a lot of the facts as well. This is facts isn't it? I
*  mean Gaza is being absolutely... Are there no trucks going into Gaza? Is that what you're saying?
*  There's no trucks with humanitarian aid. You're saying that seven million tons of food today
*  did not enter Gaza? Israel is lying about that? I can answer that question very clearly.
*  Israel has destroyed much of Gaza's domestic food production and agriculture. The amount of food aid,
*  as David Cameron has noted, is much less than before the 7th of October when the need is much
*  greater. And not only that, the roads have been trashed, okay, for a start. Police officers which
*  guard those trucks have been deliberately targeted by Israel with Joe Biden's own administration
*  condemning Benjamin Netanyahu for doing that. Whether it comes to the infrastructure, or for
*  example, the ability to transport the aid around is impossible now. This is why the destruction of
*  agriculture plus the inability to get... You're throwing a lot of head. You know what, I do
*  understand why this conflict raises a lot of emotions. I think we need to focus on reality.
*  And I understand especially when you are Jewish or Palestinian or Arab why you feel so connected
*  to this conflict and really being hurt and upset. I'm upset. My family, my friends, I lost friends
*  on October 7th. I don't understand why you are so angry about that. Because I object to genocide
*  because I'm a human being. Of course it's not a genocide. I'm a human being, that's why. Would
*  you call every war a genocide? No. So why is it genocide? Because you're seeing the deliberate
*  attempt to starve a population to death which Israel's own leaders said at the beginning of
*  their
*  speech. A few things there. It doesn't actually try to rebut many of the key facts that I presented.
*  Now the point about food trucks is, as David Cameron has noted, that the Israeli state has put
*  huge numbers of blocks in place to stop food trucks from getting in. While the destruction of Gaza
*  and its infrastructure, the lack of security, plus the destruction of local food production
*  and agriculture has altogether helped conspire to create famine as a consequence of Israel's actions.
*  Now I'm still astonished that he genuinely asked me, Hen Mazik, why I cared about the people of
*  Gaza even though not Jewish or Palestinian or Arab. I mean what? Sometimes you just hear things,
*  hear questions or things people say and just wonder how someone can end up
*  uttering something like that. The idea that you should only care about the suffering of others
*  is if you share the ethnicity. It's one of the most morally bankrupt things I've ever heard.
*  It's baffling some would just come out and even ask that question. Some of us believe that the
*  lives of human beings have equal worth irrespective of their ethnic group or religion and that you
*  should stand against horror being inflicted against fellow human beings irrespective of their
*  characteristics. As it is, the Palestinian people have suffered generations of injustice,
*  ethnic cleansing, occupation, siege, land theft and illegal colonisation, mass slaughter, even
*  before this, apartheid, all-round brutal treatment by the Israeli army and now a genocidal onslaught,
*  crucially with the direct involvement and complicity of Western governments. That's the key
*  point. Our governments have leverage over Israel and in the case of the US can simply stop all of
*  the slaughter and injustice if they so choose. Now let's hear this particular argument which is
*  offered up, the following argument that is by the presenter because it's an interesting argument
*  which is often thrown around and we'll hear my answer to it. If Hamas were to release the hostages
*  tomorrow, what happens then? Look at the West Bank. Look at the number of people being slaughtered
*  in the West Bank since this began. Last year alone before the 7th of October 240 Palestinian
*  civilians, 40 of them children, were killed in the West Bank and we were told that was a ceasefire.
*  In the West Bank now people are being driven from their homes and they're being slaughtered.
*  The West Bank is not run by Hamas, it's run by Fatah who put down their arms and accepted a
*  peace process. What we're seeing in Gaza already, this idea of releasing the hostages which I want,
*  taking those hostages was a severe war crime, a grave and unacceptable war crime and the only way
*  hostages have been released in any significant number is through ceasefire and prisoner swaps.
*  That includes those prisoners who have been, need to be released and again the information that's
*  come out today of the treatment of these prisoners who are held without charge with their handcuffs
*  so much that they've been amputated as well as the work by Save the Children which has detailed
*  how child detainees are sexually and physically abused. Now it's very important that we talk about
*  this. Well there's a key point here that the hostages have only been released in significant
*  numbers because of a ceasefire and prisoner swap. The abuse of Palestinian prisoners including
*  children who courageous Israeli journalist Gideon Levies describes as Israel's hostages, all of
*  that's been almost entirely erased from the discussion here. Now Hen Mazik also went through
*  crimes committed by Hamas and then suggested that there were people who went on television to defend
*  Hamas gesturing at me as he did so and I responded to that as well as spoke about human shields.
*  Well I'd like to, do I get to answer any of that or? I'd like to move on, which is this Owen? I
*  don't think we could just have misinformation on national television that isn't corrected.
*  What are you saying is misinformation then? Well I mean firstly he accused me of defending Hamas
*  which I have to say those smears might have worked once but it just people watching this
*  thing are desperate. The point about human shields, a brilliant piece of investigative
*  journalism in Plus 972 magazine by the brilliant Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham revealed the use
*  of artificial intelligence, a system called Lavender and what that does is generate a whole
*  load of low-level operatives generated by artificial intelligence with a collateral damage level per
*  person of those targets of up to 20 civilians. The idea, which we have to say the IDF has said
*  that it uses this for information purposes that it has not used. Okay well six separate intelligence
*  sources briefed this brilliant investigative Israeli journalist. Now you can see what's happened
*  there, what they do according to this information is they wait for those operatives to go home
*  when they're in bed with their families there and they blow them up and they blow up their kids
*  and they blow up their families. Can you imagine Hamas was going around blowing up soldiers,
*  Israeli soldiers in their homes with their children. Now this is well and you think that's
*  not acceptable? I do. Israel is doing that as state sanctions. I've said they've committed
*  severe court. Let's have a reasonable. Now let's listen to this question for the presenter then
*  what happens? I mean let's pick up some of the things Hen has been saying which is that look
*  we can talk so much about what Israel is doing in Gaza but ultimately Hamas created this war.
*  I think if you start with the clock on the 7th of October that's absurd obviously in 1948
*  the Palestinian people driven for their homes three-quarter million the vast majority of the
*  people in Gaza are the descendants of those 750,000 people who driven from the homes 15,000 of them
*  slaughtered at the time 1967 yet another act of ethnic cleansing and illegal occupation the longest
*  political occupation. Let's talk about what's happening here. Why ask me the question? Obviously
*  I'm not going to go oh yeah actually this all started on the 7th of October nothing else is
*  relevant. I'm going to talk about the context of Palestinian suffering repeated violent ethnic
*  cleansing the longest belligerent occupation in modern times apartheid as defined by human
*  rights organizations including those in Israel itself siege land theft and illegal colonization
*  as well as mass slaughter the thousands killed between 2008 and the 6th of October
*  2023 96 percent were Palestinians let alone mass incarceration the brutality meted out by the
*  Israeli army on a daily basis we could go on. I mean if there's not enough time to talk about that
*  surely he should have thought that that would be the response anticipated based on the perspective
*  I have. Why ask the question if you don't have time? Baffling and the problem with this is
*  generally the media has stripped historical context even relatively recent historical context from
*  the horrors of the last six months it hasn't often sought to educate people on that context
*  and even when anyone tries to bring it up they've often faced a very dismissive response
*  particularly I would note when it's Palestinians have done this. Right now let's listen to the
*  final part as it all goes south. Oh dear oh dear. In terms of arms Alicia Kearns the conservative
*  MP and chair of the foreign affairs select committee in a leaked recording said that the
*  government had received legal advice that Israel was in defiance of international humanitarian law
*  what that legally necessitates is Britain ending all arms sales but also ending all
*  cooperation and sharing intelligence. Now you're right Britain doesn't supply that many arms but
*  if it ends arms sales that then puts huge pressure on Germany which has decided to make the Palestinian
*  people pay for the grievous crimes it committed by attempting to exterminate the Jewish people.
*  I have some dissent. And the second point. I won't let you the Holocaust will not be used this way
*  how dare you you're not Jewish don't do that. It shouldn't be used. It shouldn't be used.
*  It shouldn't be used to force the Palestinians. Even for you it's a red line. It shouldn't be
*  used to force the Palestinian people to pay for it. Let's be clear what are you saying then?
*  Hen believes that you are that you are disparaging the memory of the Holocaust. Of course I just
*  didn't. No I didn't. You said that Germany is making Palestinians pay for the 16 years
*  that were killed in the Holocaust? Yes I did. This is absolutely discussing I can't believe you're
*  lying. I stand by what I say because it's absolutely true. Are you saying that Germany
*  is supporting Israel because of what happened? Yes it believes it rather than it believes it
*  believes Germany has decided it can make up for its obscene guilt by forcing somebody else to pay
*  for the crimes that Germany committed. It's a very straightforward point so nothing offensive about
*  it. Of course it's offensive. In terms of in terms of in terms of answer I will not take it back.
*  No I don't care about Jews because you know what's interesting I interviewed a German Israeli.
*  I interviewed a German Israeli and people should check that interview the German Israeli.
*  But one person's opinion is not different. They're shutting down Jewish people in Germany who speak
*  about Gaza. The point about arms which we were talking about Israel destroyed the medical system
*  of Gaza by itself as a genocidal act there's no functioning healthcare system they just destroyed
*  our chief of hospital the biggest hospital in Gaza. Now well you think everything's used by
*  Hamas you can point out everything. No no no no no no no we can't make glib questions like that.
*  Okay. Clearly there's Hamas infrastructure across the world. It's disturbing.
*  According to every intelligence organisation in the world. Every single medical facility and hospital
*  in Gaza has been attacked that imposes a daily death sentence on everyone who has cancer,
*  heart problems, people who are pregnant, pregnant women who are having quickly. No no I need to let
*  Hamas have the responsibility. Sorry these who are having their limbs amputated.
*  Well okay let's just have some basic facts here. These are the words I'm not going to quote of the
*  German Chancellor that is the equivalent of the German Prime Minister. Our own history our
*  responsibility deriving from the Holocaust makes our permanent duty to stand up for the
*  existence and security of the state of Israel. This responsibility guides us. The German state
*  has never tried to hide the fact that it is unequivocally stood behind the state of Israel
*  including arming it to the teeth in the current context as Gaza's race to the ground as a form
*  of reparations for the grotesque and unprecedented crime it committed in the Holocaust. The worst
*  crime in human history. The mass extermination by industrialised means of the Jewish people.
*  And it should have made reparations but those reparations are not being paid by Germany here.
*  They're being paid by Palestinians and Germany now justifies Israel's murderous onslaught publicly
*  as well as arming it to the teeth as I say. Now the response to a basic point that Germany is
*  making others pay for the crimes Germany has committed, heinous crimes, has been mayhem on
*  social media from apologists for Israel's onslaught who have in the most shameless and cynical way
*  tried to twist my words so that when I spoke of the obscene guilt of Germany, I obviously mean
*  Germany's extreme guilt, its guilt for an obscenity, the Holocaust, they've tried to
*  suggest that I meant its obscene Germany feels guilt. Makes no sense in that context or even
*  in general. Who would ever say someone has a sense of guilt that's obscene? It doesn't make any sense.
*  Obviously I was talking about the crimes, the heinous crimes committed by the German state
*  in the Holocaust. That's what is meant by their obscene guilt. They rightly have an obscene guilt,
*  that is they are guilty of a crime which is obscene. That's what I was talking about.
*  Just as they tried to do over the Jewish director Jonathan Glaser by twisting his words to mean
*  something completely different and all over social media these apologists for mass murder have
*  suggested an anti-Semitic, a disgrace and should be fired and driven from public life. For what?
*  For saying that the German state has decided, not least as it arms the genocide onslaught,
*  that others must pay for their hideous crimes committed by the German state within living
*  memory. It's simply a fact. It can't be rebutted. I know it can't be rebutted because
*  amidst all the outrage no one sought to offer a counter-argument. There isn't one because it's
*  true as the German state has publicly said itself. Why is this happening? I circle back to the
*  beginning. Everything we said, that is those who oppose this crime of historic proportions,
*  has been vindicated in the worst possible way. Mass killing, famine, unimaginable suffering,
*  some of the worst crimes of the 21st century committed on a daily basis. The apologists for
*  this hideous onslaught, no public opinion has shifted drastically against them. They know they're
*  utterly morally exposed for having legitimised and supported this crime of historic proportions.
*  So all they've got left is twisting words, trying to turn the world upside down to feign
*  moral outrage and portray the opponents of mass murder as the real extremists. Well that strategy
*  my friends has run out of road. This crime is too big, too extreme, too unapologetic. Those responsible
*  for it and those who have cheered it on know they're not getting away with it this time.
*  So all they can do is lash out in the most cynical and twisted way possible. Well the lesson there
*  is we're going to win this. The tragedy is that it's not going to save the lives of so many and
*  we have to keep fighting to end western complicity in this slaughter of Gaza. Please like and subscribe
