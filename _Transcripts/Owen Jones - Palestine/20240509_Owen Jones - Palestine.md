# Endgame For Netanyahu? - Israeli Analyst Ori Goldberg Gives Devastating Assessment
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIJrFuuRspo)
*  Now, since this all began seven months ago, this particular horror, I've done my best to elevate
*  the sorts of voices we need to be hearing and someone who's really struck me in terms of their
*  really incisive, thoughtful contributions. Often when we say thoughtful, we're talking about the
*  current horror, that often means bleak, bleak but honest, which is where we're currently at.
*  And that's Ori Goldberg, who is commentator, analyst, former academic specialist when it comes
*  to the Middle East, has a PhD in Middle East Studies based out in the suburbs of Tel Aviv.
*  Ori, thanks first of all for joining us, really appreciate having your voice.
*  Thank you very much for having me. I've been following your work and listening to conversations
*  you've had here, so it's a privilege to be here. Thank you.
*  Well, I'm sorry you've been subjected to having to listen to my voice, but the focus will be on
*  your voice today, so hopefully that will make up for it. I just want to start actually in terms of
*  just the latest because, you know, seven months in, what essentially has happened is the US has
*  just given a blank check for Israel to behave as it so wishes, with hand-wringing occasionally about
*  what's happened, often leaked to certain media outlets. But, you know, the weapons are carried on,
*  the diplomatic support has continued. There has been a sudden shift, and that is Joe Biden has
*  come out and said that if there is a full-blown offensive, military land offensive against
*  Ra'atha, which is essentially the last part of Gaza which hasn't been ruined, then, you know,
*  there won't be any further weapon shipments. I'm just wondering, what are your thoughts about
*  the significance of that? How significant do you think that is?
*  I think it's very significant for two reasons. One is, as you say, it disrupts the American pattern
*  as it has emerged throughout this seven-month horror. I mean, America is no longer giving Israel
*  carte blanche to do as it will without any regard for consequences. America is making the statement
*  that is based, at least in part, on principle. America is saying, you can't do this with the
*  weapons we sent you. The second reason I think it's important is because I think it will expose
*  sooner rather than later. And I'm here perhaps overly optimistic, but I think this is what's
*  going to happen. I think it will expose how the conceptual, political, military structure
*  that Israel has set up over the past seven months is actually a house of cards.
*  I think that once America has said no, then I think the chinks in the armor are going to
*  start showing. And I think we will very quickly see how empty Israel's posts are and how
*  non-existent its ability is to simply carry on as our prime minister and minister of defense
*  have been saying over the last few days. I don't think that's true. And I think that's going to
*  show quite soon. Now, I'm aware of the fact that there are many people who are saying,
*  this is all a conspiracy. If the United States had wanted to do something, it would have done
*  something long ago. I don't disagree. I think behavior of both sides has been shameful.
*  I think when the West or part of the West, the global North, is directly involved in a conflict,
*  I think no blood is as cheap as Palestinian blood. So I don't think anybody here is commendable or
*  praiseworthy. But I think this is the first time the United States has said no to Israel.
*  And I think the first time you say no to a bully is a moment of seclusion.
*  But it is the dynamics. This is where I'm kind of stuck, working out how this pans out. Because on
*  the one hand, you've got Benjamin Netanyahu, very unpopular before this all began, facing corruption,
*  scandals, and potential imprisonment. It's in his incentive to drag this war out as best he can.
*  He has obviously the most far-right elements of the coalition, the kind of Ben Gevire,
*  Smoczric wing, baying for blood. Ben Gevire today saying Hamas loves Biden. So we really are at the
*  stage where you point at anything and call, in the case of these ministers, just point at anything
*  and anyone and call them Hamas, up to including Joe Biden, who's bankrolled all of this from the
*  start. So you've got that. Then you've also got the US facing domestic huge pressure.
*  The American public has sharply shifted away from Israel's onslaught against Gaza.
*  And Biden faces a presidential election where he has to mobilize his base to come out when a lot of
*  them are actually disgusted and horrified. So I'm a bit stuck because I don't understand what gives
*  there. Because if Netanyahu suddenly accepts the ceasefire, is he forced out of power? And is he
*  trying to prevent that? But equally, if he can't rely on US support, then that will limit Israel's
*  options. So what gives there? Well, I have a multi-part answer.
*  Good. No problem.
*  Here's what I think. And this is my speculative assessment. Netanyahu is very much unpopular and
*  unlike, but he's still prime minister. And an immediate candidate to replace him has, to our
*  great misfortune, not surfaced yet. I think Netanyahu is trying to pull off
*  the equivalent of what the Americans would call a baseball parlance, a triple play.
*  Netanyahu wants to be seen as someone who has fulfilled his promise to the religious right
*  and has operated in Kloffach. He also wants to be the uniter. He wants to be the one who
*  does bring the hostages home. Because then he will seem as though he has made good on his promise to
*  the rest of the Israeli public, despite the dislike, despite the objections. So I can envision a
*  situation where Netanyahu will happily pretend to be doing something meaningful in Kloffach, mostly
*  shedding innocent Palestinian blood. I think it is important to say that so far a
*  major ground operation has not begun in Kloffach, a major Israeli operation. Israel is bombing. And
*  certainly the price in blood is abominable. But I think Netanyahu is still hedging, which is very
*  much a Netanyahu trademark. So I kind of think Netanyahu wants to have his cake and eat it too,
*  which is very much an Israeli pattern of behavior always and certainly during this war. He still
*  believes he can get away with it by doing that, by both operating and demonstrating military
*  prowess and also defiance. And it's also an important point to remember. We don't do what the US
*  tells us. We'll go it alone if we want to. But ultimately, and again, I think sooner rather than
*  later, Netanyahu will, I think he's already realized the price that he's going to pay, which is not just
*  with regard to Israel's isolation and reckoning and proceedings in international courts, but also
*  a personal warrant for his arrest, potentially issued by the International Criminal Court.
*  So I think Netanyahu is very much afraid of that. I also think Netanyahu in his heart of
*  hearts, because at this point, sorry, at this point, he's very capable, but he's also quite mad.
*  I think at this point, he is looking around and he doesn't see anybody who's an immediate
*  option for replacing him. So he is sort of also wondering if an election is held, he might not
*  ultimately pull it off. Now, I wish I could say I think he's absolutely wrong. That's not necessarily
*  true. He has some support. He can still, if he manages to do this, if he manages to be both
*  hard on Hamas, but also the one who does bring home the hostages, reluctantly against his will,
*  but he had to accept it to swallow the bitter pill, drink from the poison chalice, call it what you
*  will. He might be able, at least as far as he's concerned, to pull off the greatest political magic
*  trick the world has ever seen. What gives, that's where I think he's headed right.
*  What I think he's doing, it's the only explanation I can consider plausibly without assuming a vast
*  conspiracy between Israel and the United States meant to ultimately occupy Gaza and kill as many
*  Palestinians as possible. I don't think that's the case, not because of the goodness of Israeli or
*  American hearts, but because this quote unquote war, this horror, as you refer to it, I think
*  accurately, has played out so shoddily, has been managed so poorly, has been so without lack of
*  foresight or any kind of strategic reasoning or wisdom that I doubt this is where the conspiracy
*  comes to fruition. I mean, on that, in terms of just the dynamics within Israeli society, because
*  the polling suggests that more than not, and I talk now about Jewish Israeli citizens just because
*  to always emphasize a fit of the population for those who don't know are Palestinian citizens and
*  the polling is always different there. So if we look at Jewish Israelis, this is significantly
*  more prioritized bringing the hostages back and therefore having a deal to do that over
*  a onslaught against Ra'far. So I'm just wondering where the dynamics in terms of what Netanyahu's,
*  where that kind of comes into play because, I mean, it's quite astonishing when you see actually
*  you get kind of some of the relatives as hostages being manhandled and brutally attacked by the
*  Israeli police. It's quite astonishing. But I mean, I'm just wondering how that plays into it,
*  because obviously what the Israeli state keeps saying is it's non-negotiable, we're going into
*  Ra'far, that's going to happen. And I just don't see how you, again, it's not squaring the,
*  this is going to happen, Ra'far is going to happen with where public opinions are.
*  So where do you think kind of Israeli public opinion is pushing him and what can he get away
*  with? Once again, I'm going to refer to certain parts of your question, maybe give answers that
*  sound different, but they're not, they're part and parcel of the same package. See, here's the thing,
*  Israelis now are thinking about a Ra'far offensive as a Netanyahu gimmick, as something that's been
*  political. But despite the difference in, you know, on the Israeli political spectrum,
*  I think there's still a broad consensus among Jewish Israelis that supports the notion of a war
*  meant to destroy Hamas. So it's like Israelis can now support something and it's complete opposite,
*  because the war to destroy Hamas is still considered by many a national necessity. What are you going
*  to do? How are you going to restore peace with those madmen at the helm? You know, these guys,
*  these are guys sworn to destroying all Jews, to massacring us, you know, these are the new Nazis,
*  it's a new Holocaust, all that. So I think most, the great majority of Israeli Jews
*  kind of agree with that, even if they would offer different reasonings. The people on the religious
*  right would be full of glee about the prospect of killing terrorists, aka all Palestinians.
*  People on the center left would be reluctant. They would perhaps say, you know, we don't like it,
*  that we don't necessarily condone it, but what are you going to do? That was the buzz phrase
*  of this war for at least the first four or five months. What's your suggestion? Okay, that was
*  translated from the Hebrew. You know, I don't like it, but do you have any other plan to suggest?
*  So Israelis don't support Netanyahu, but they support the war. And because they support the war,
*  they can't envision replacing Netanyahu as long as there's a war on. I just saw an interview with
*  the mayor of Kiyachmuna, an Israeli town close to the border with Lebanon that has been evacuated
*  completely of all its residents and is being bombed by Hezbollah rockets. And the guy who
*  was interviewing this mayor said, what grade do you give Netanyahu out of 10? And he said,
*  one or two. He should be replaced immediately after the war. It's as though war is not seen
*  as a political tool for the advancement of the political agenda. War is sacrosanct. If you're
*  fighting a war, it's for the collective. So Israelis can see this rafah offensive for what it is,
*  a ploy meant to appease Netanyahu's base. They understand there's no military achievement there,
*  but they still support the war. But the shift that you're talking about is there. It is beginning
*  to be tangible because over the past two days, you've had both families of hostages for the first
*  time saying, if what it takes to bring our loved ones home, then we need to stop the war. This is
*  something that has not been said by hostage families. They've demonstrated and they've rallied
*  and they've said, bring them all home, but they've never specified how or why. And also you are
*  beginning to hear from former senior Israeli leaders like the IDF chief of staff who has
*  replaced the current one, General Aviv Kochavi, who spoke at a conference in New York. And he
*  also said, if you want to bring the hostages back home, you have to stop the war. Pundits who are
*  also former generals are beginning to say this in a way that's heard. It's still not a popular
*  movement. I doubt it ever will be. But I think if Netanyahu wants to appear as though he's listening
*  to public opinion, as though he's aware of the things that disturb average Israelis,
*  he can now with some legitimacy say, I've been listening and there are people who want to stop
*  the war. I'm taking it seriously. I'm going to try and explore it. And that's also, I'll just say this
*  to end this very lengthy rant. There's also something that you're hearing from
*  people like the IDF spokesman, Admiral Daniel Hagali. He used to say, we're going to explore
*  every option to bring the hostages back home. And he would mean every military option. Now when he
*  says it, he's talking about a deal. So the notion of a deal has snuck into the heart of the Israeli
*  mainstream. The important thing is not to startle the Israeli mainstream. We're like a deer, like a
*  baby deer. We can't say this outright. We can't consciously say we want to stop the war. That's
*  high treason almost. But we're beginning to make the connection that the only way the hostages
*  will return is if Israel consciously chooses to accept a deal. There's a sports challenge here
*  associated with the English football club Millwall. And it goes like this. No one likes us. We don't
*  care. And the reason I put that in the context of Joe Biden now, I mean, look, I mean, given what's
*  happened is seven months allowed all this to continue. But obviously now, as I said, he's
*  under this domestic pressure. What I'm interested in terms of Israeli society, do they look at
*  what Joe Biden now saying, if RAFA happens, we're not giving you these weapons? Is there a sense of
*  that? No one likes us. We don't care. How widespread is that? So it's like, even America's
*  abandon us. And I heard Netanyahu the other day saying the Gentiles, we can't rely on them.
*  And that obviously taps into the collective trauma that the Jewish people quite understandably
*  feel. And it deliberately taps into that, given, you know, is that sense of, you know, look at our
*  past. We can only rely on ourselves. That's what that's trying to tap into. But equally,
*  is there not a sense in Israeli society of, uh-oh, America is our patron, gives us all these weapons,
*  diplomatic support. If they're going off us, we're kind of, we're in trouble. So I'm trying to work
*  out where's the dynamic. No one likes us. We don't care. Uh-oh, this is actually quite serious. And
*  this could be American public opinion is definitely shifting against this in a very
*  dramatic way. Where do you think it falls in Israeli society? Your no wall analogy is very
*  apt considering the style of play favored by no wall players as well. It's not just nobody likes
*  us. We don't care. We're out on the pitch. We're going to kill everybody. But, um, again, I think
*  the best answer I can give you is to say that it's kind of schizophrenic because on the one hand,
*  yes, there's a real awareness of the fact that, uh, it's not just that America is our patron.
*  Look, Israelis really like to feel, uh, as though they belong to the world.
*  Okay. This, this weekend is on Saturday. The Eurovision song contest is going to take place.
*  We take the Eurovision song contest very seriously here. Uh, we're Eurovision powerhouse and, uh,
*  there has been, uh, TV reports about the situation and mother and the protests and,
*  and, you know, we're very sensitive to all that on the one hand, we're very, um, I don't want to say
*  confrontational, but we sort of accept our state. Yes, they don't like us. On the other hand,
*  we really want to be received. We really want to belong. We don't just want to win. We want to be
*  accepted. Uh, part of it has to do with the innate sense of, uh, of, you know, Jewish supremacy and
*  let's even call it racism. We're not really Middle Eastern. Okay. We're not supposed to be friends
*  with these people. We weren't supposed to be here. We're here because, you know, that's, this is our
*  country, but at heart, we're, we are the global North. We're Western, we're European, we're,
*  we're American. So that's on the one hand. On the other hand, um, there is a spirit of,
*  you know, everybody's going to hate us regardless. Everybody hates us. Look at what's happening in
*  the United States. Look at what's happening in Europe. Look at what's happening all over the
*  world. And if, if, if it's so, um, you know, if they really don't like us that much and screw them.
*  But I have to say, if I was to balance the two, I think, uh, fear of, of, uh,
*  windows of opportunity closing all over for Israel, you know, the fear of, of Israel's
*  contraction, because Israel is getting smaller. It's much, much harder than it was to get flights
*  to Israel and from Israel. Um, Israeli institutions are being boycotted in academia,
*  in, in business. Israeli politicians are also being boycotted. This is, this is happening,
*  you know, protest encampments are spreading throughout the world. And so, so, so there's
*  an understanding that this is happening. There's great fear that, um, that this will happen.
*  And also there's this, um, there's also an understanding, and this has to do with
*  Israeli's very intimate, intimate acquaintance with Netanyahu. Remember, he's been prime minister
*  for pretty much the past 15 years, except for like a year there, here and there. Netanyahu ultimately
*  is seen as the wizard of hype. You know, when you look at what he's actually done, most Israelis
*  think that he really knows how to talk to talk, but he's not great at walking the walk.
*  And Israelis are starting to look at all of these effects that are rapidly accumulating. I'm starting
*  to say, what is this? You know, we'll be left with nothing. Now, does that mean that there's a public
*  Israeli protest on the way? No, because Israelis also support the war and Israelis are also very
*  angry. And Israelis also see themselves as justified victims. And what October 7th did was
*  to push our collective sense of victimhood combined with our sense of supremacist entitlement
*  to the forefront of our national consciousness. We are now both, we are perennial victims and
*  perennial overlords. And that's what we want to be. That's very much there. But yes, I think
*  Israelis are gradually starting to fear that there are, and this is a very innovative,
*  revolutionary concept for Israelis, there are consequences to Israel's actions,
*  but there's no such thing as a free lunch. Again, I think a lot of a lot of the questions that you'll
*  ask me throughout our conversation, I'll have a similar answer for you. Israelis are split down
*  the middle, not in collective terms. Each Israeli Jew can and does think opposite things at the same
*  time. But it's almost, it's a schism, is what it is. I said schizophrenia and I meant it. And also,
*  it's not, it isn't tenable. It's not hospitable to life. You either lose it completely,
*  or you stop functioning, which is pretty much where we are.
*  What things I'm interested in is, I suppose what I could call, what you could call kind of
*  genocide mentality, because you've written about this as genocide, which puts you in a very small
*  minority within Israeli society. The reason I'm interested in that is, for example, I mean,
*  Park even, well, the sorts of things that Yov Galant said about cutting off everything because
*  we're dealing with fighting human animals, which people say he meant Hamas, so we're talking about
*  cutting off all the elements of civilian life to a civilian population there. But also, the head
*  of Kogat then came out afterwards and said, he clarified he meant Gaza's population of human animals,
*  because they, that Hamas had become ISIS, but the civilian population had cheered that on.
*  And, you know, always talk about uninvolved. And he said, if you wanted hell, we'll give you hell.
*  That's what he said on the 9th of October. But also, you know, Amalek obviously was a classic,
*  but also, you know, obviously various Israeli ministers. But, you know, you see these clips
*  on Israeli television, which even though I'm aware of where things are at, you watch these clips and
*  you're kind of like, oh my God, you know, where people will be talking just openly about we need
*  to kill children because they'll end up being terrorists. And they just talk about, you know,
*  everyone being collectively responsible, no one involved. The reason I'm interested in that is
*  because that is objectively genocidal. I mean, that's, there's no, you can't really get, whatever
*  people think about the actions of what's actually happening, that's genocidal. It's prohibited under
*  the Genocide Convention of 1948, which Israel translated into law in 1950. In fact, genocide
*  and incitement carry is a capital offence in Israel, which is a little known. But, you know,
*  the ICJ issued provision orders. The reason I'm asking about that is what in terms of genocidal
*  is, I think if you said to these people that's genocidal, they would be outraged. But it is
*  genocidal because by definition, it almost, what I'm trying to work out, is there something in
*  people's heads that go, well, this is different. That's why, because they actually are collectively
*  guilty. But that's always the basis of genocidal mentality. I mean, you know, it's interesting you
*  talk about that kind of fusing of victimhood and supremacy because Serbian nationalism is quite
*  similar to that. It was like we suffered in the Holocaust. We were victims of Nazi genocide.
*  The reason we don't have dominance ethnically in these areas is partly because we were murdered in
*  the Holocaust, in a genocide. And you saw that, you know, again, in Rwanda, the Tutsi rebel forces
*  did commit atrocities. And in 1990, when they raided Rwanda, Hutu extremists said they're going
*  to commit genocide against us. We kill them or they kill us. I mean, it is right. I mean,
*  these are all different, very different contexts, but they are all overlapped. I'm just wondering
*  about that. It's just almost like they can't, I just find it striking that people can say things
*  which are overtly genocidal, but they don't seem to understand that's genocide. I don't know,
*  I mean, what's going on there? Because the number of genocidal statements issued by leaders,
*  military officers, soldiers, journalists, is relentless, but there doesn't seem to be an
*  understanding that is genocidal. What's going on in people's heads?
*  That's a great question. I'll try my best to answer it. By the way, the Serb example is
*  particularly apt. The Serbs are infatuated with Israel because let's add another thing. They're
*  also fighting the Muslims. They see themselves as the vanguard of Christian Europe fighting
*  the demon of the slum that's rising from Albania. This is something I've been thinking about for a
*  while now. As verbose as I am, it's been difficult for me to articulate, but I'll try. I'm trying to
*  try to do this in writing as well. The real horror of the genocidal mentality, as you call it, and I
*  think the explanation for this state of affairs that you're describing is that while there are
*  quite a few Israelis who are not at all averse to killing Palestinians,
*  identifying every Palestinian as a potential terrorist, exterminating them before they come
*  and exterminate us, the real horror is that I think still the majority of Israeli Jews
*  just don't care. They're not actively supporting killing civilians. They don't ask them, and as
*  you say, they'll say, no, of course not. The IDF is one of the most moral military forces in the
*  world. They try everything. They've got legal advisors embedded at the most tactical level,
*  and everything is approved, and everything is in accordance with international law.
*  What are you talking about? There was a survey, a poll that was conducted here a few weeks ago,
*  and it asked Jewish Israelis if they believe that the IDF was acting in extreme fashion in
*  Ghana. Something like 11% or 12% said it's not acting extremely enough. Something like that
*  said, same number said, it is acting in too extreme a fashion, and about 65%
*  of the respondents said, we believe the IDF is the most moral military force in the world.
*  So we're not even answering the question. We don't have opinions, and the reason we don't
*  have opinions is not because we're happy. A lot of Israelis will tell you that they're not happy with
*  what's happening, that they wish fewer innocents would be harmed, but that is, of course,
*  on Hamas who created the situation, and as a result of decades and decades of the dehumanization of
*  Palestinians, the ultimate effect is that come crunch time when Israel is in its eyes, given
*  permission to really go after a Palestinian threat. Most Israelis just don't care. They might
*  see pictures from Gaza and say, and the effect is exactly what you're describing. They can see
*  images of the famine. They can see crushed children's bodies in Raffa or wherever,
*  and they will say that is horrible, and they'll mean it. They'll talk about the suffering of
*  the Palestinians, but it is as though it is completely detached from them, and the reason
*  is we've had it drilled into our heads and consciousness that what happens to the Palestinians,
*  regardless of whether it's our doing, is not our fault. It's not our fault, and we don't want to
*  kill them, but if they die in order to achieve Israeli security, they don't even deserve it,
*  but we don't care. I can't put it any simpler and more horribly than that. Israelis don't care.
*  They don't care, and when you try and explain or get to the bottom of the political predicament
*  here, that's another really, really major variable. One of the reasons Israelis don't feel like they
*  should call for an end to the war is because they don't care. They don't care what the effects of
*  the war are. They know by now, but they toss the information aside. At the beginning of the war,
*  a lot of people on the Israeli left said the problem is the Israeli media. It doesn't show
*  people what's happening. It doesn't show images. That's not the case anymore. Israelis can see as
*  many images as they like, but they will have a whole host of counterarguments from saying
*  Pollywood, and it's all manufactured, to these are numbers brought by Hamas, and to they deserve it.
*  Ultimately, there is a vocal minority that cares and is emotionally and politically invested in
*  the destruction of Gaza. The great majority of Israeli Jews, their politics about it is that
*  they don't care. I think it's such an important point, because obviously in any society, the number
*  of social capacity is 2%. I mean, the vast majority of people, well, dehumanization is so important
*  because it intentionally snuffs out the power we have of empathy, doesn't it? We stop thinking of
*  people as people like us for whom it's intolerable to have any suffering if we ring-fence those of
*  people whose emotions we offer. It strikes me throughout history, atrocities of this sort are
*  always possible partly because of this argument of every terrible thing that happens to them,
*  because our weapons, but it's their fault. I mean, it's always that in these contexts, isn't it?
*  Well, that's often you'll get, I've just debated Israeli apologies, you'll come up with an Israeli
*  war cry and they go, well, Hamas did this. Yeah, so that's always the sense, that's always the kind
*  of thing you get in a context like this, isn't it? Dehumanization is always a double-edged sword,
*  it's just that simple. If you dehumanize a people for such a long time, you lose your humanity,
*  you lose a basic affinity for other humans as humans. You don't judge
*  cause and effect within a human framework, you judge it within an abstract, pure mathematics
*  framework. They did this, so it's their fault. Or let's talk about the justification for
*  Israel's action. Israelis engage in a constant hyping and overhyping of what I've heard referred
*  to as atrocity propaganda. Okay, now the Hamas massacre on October 7th was atrocious. There were
*  vicious crimes committed against humanity. It was a mass slaughter of civilians organized and
*  orchestrated by Hamas. Yes, granted. I'm sure the Israeli military killed some number of Israelis
*  in the mayhem that ensued. I'm sure decisions were made that brought that about. But for Israelis,
*  it's very, very important to constantly stress how atrocious Hamas crimes were because that adds to
*  the fact that Israelis don't care. Israelis don't care about Palestinians long before October 7th,
*  but now we can say that Palestinians are beyond the pale. These people are not human. If they can
*  do this, and Israelis will tell you stories that have been debunked about beheaded babies, about
*  whatever. It's all there. This has been documented. It's clear what's happened and what hasn't happened.
*  So many bad things have happened, but Israelis want the point to be drilled into the global
*  consciousness. This is Hamas's fault, and they don't deserve our awareness. They are animals.
*  I would make the point that all of this is happening not because of the raw
*  horror of the actions that did take place on October 7th. It's happening because this is the
*  basic mechanism. Because Israelis have lost the ability to look at the other side and see them
*  as humans. That's what dehumanization does. You take away somebody else's humanity for long enough,
*  you lose your own. That's where we are. It's a really important point, I think,
*  you made there, which I think the Al Jazeera documentary, very thorough on
*  7th of October and the war crimes that committed made was, there was, it says very clearly Hamas
*  committed serious war crimes on 7th of October, but there ended up being more focus on crimes that
*  weren't committed rather than the ones that were. So for example, I would say,
*  the young revelers from a festival cowering in a shelter and throwing a grenade in,
*  how many people know even about that crime? Very little. And yet people know far more about the
*  claim that babies were beheaded, which didn't happen. Because beheading a baby is the most
*  disturbed unhinged thing probably you can think of. Whereas killing, although that was abominable,
*  but there's not enough of a distinction between what Israel is doing in Gaza. Because the argument
*  was, we're going to kill, because they knew the Israeli state, we're going to kill more people.
*  So you have to have their form of violence, the way they kill people is so much more disturbed
*  than us. I think that's why you... It's not even more disturbed. It's really beyond the pale.
*  These are people with whom you can have no parley whatsoever, no communication. They deserve to be
*  destroyed because people who can do that, they can do anything. You don't want them to run free.
*  The final point there, just in terms of... These conversations are...
*  Because what's so brilliant about what you're talking about, you're candid, you're honest,
*  it's you're unflinching in your analysis. When we talk about what a lasting piece is where
*  Jewish and Palestinian citizens share the land together on the basis of equality and justice,
*  and every possible scenario in which that could happen looks impossible,
*  which is what is so bleak always about these conversations. So I'm just wondering,
*  what I would say is, in terms of the dynamics of what we've been discussing in Israeli society,
*  does not seem sustainable to me. I don't see how that's possibly sustainable. It's like a hot house.
*  It's partly not sustainable because there is a divorce going on, I would say, between
*  Western public opinion and the Israeli state. The way too many people, particularly younger
*  generations, and particularly you look at younger Jewish Americans who have been very
*  increasingly mobilized in protest, there's too much of a divorce going on in terms of how
*  people look at the world, how they look at what Israel is. And this has brought that to the fall
*  in a way that I don't think is actually... There's no going back. So I just wonder,
*  where is that how this changes? Because I think at the moment, I don't see how within the context
*  of Israeli society, this, given how isolated people like you are, but I mean, what gives?
*  What gives? What possible end game is there where we're not talking about this,
*  essentially, dystopian present and future? I think you're very accurate in your description
*  of reality and prospects for the future. I'll try and give you an answer that has
*  traces of optimism. And the traces of optimism are not rooted in the goodness of Israeli hearts
*  or in the charitable nature of Israelis or Palestinians, but actually in the same sort
*  of lack of humanity and the same transformation of Israeli society into
*  a two dimensional existence. And that is that Israelis are very, very tired.
*  Okay. I don't think most Israelis, as I said, are interested in a wholesale massacre of Palestinians.
*  I think they're very tired. I think they'd like peace, as you said. And I think, but I think a
*  lot of Israelis are incapable of even imagining change, let alone articulating it. So I perhaps,
*  again, overly in overly optimistic fashion, I think that if the right amount of external
*  pressure is applied, including the South Africa style boycott and an isolation, if reality is
*  made clear to Israelis, and if the potential of an alternative is also presented to them, I am,
*  I need to emphasize this. I'm not suggesting Israelis now have the collective strength
*  to generate such an alternative from within. But if alongside the pressure, an alternative
*  is presented to Israelis, I think that there are quite a few Israelis who would respond positively.
*  Again, not because they care, but because they don't care. They don't care and they want to live.
*  Israelis do want to live. They may have lost sight of how that's possible, but I think Israeli
*  society is quite vibrant and enjoys its liveliness and does not want to relinquish that quite so
*  quickly. I don't know that Israel has within it the strength or the foresight to bring that about
*  independently. I am hopeful against hope because I don't trust the international community,
*  you know, any farther than I can throw it is the American say. But I think as you say, the gap is
*  so wide and there is real anger now directed at Israel, which is a first and a welcome first as
*  far as I'm concerned. Only if we really bear the brunt of this reaction will we perhaps come to our
*  senses. Do I know that that's going to happen? I don't. But on a personal note, I'm Israeli.
*  I'm not going to leave. This is my country. Not my country in a strictly possessive sense,
*  because it's the only place I have. And I'll try and fight for it by speaking, by, I don't know,
*  doing anything I can. And the only way I can justify that is by thinking that
*  out of the greatest wickedness of the Israeli collective character as it now is, which is this
*  double dehumanization, out of that might come the ability to embrace change.
*  Well, if this was, if I was convinced that Israel was all about murdering Palestinians,
*  I would be less optimistic. What I think this is, is a case of radical, horrible criminal indifference.
*  But I think if this indifference is made to react to a negative reality, if it's made to see what
*  the consequences are, if it's made, that's probably the most accurate thing to say, if it's made to
*  acknowledge the fact that its actions have consequences, if that can happen,
*  then slow incremental change might take place.
*  Amen. Well, you give me hope. And I think personally, you are going to win because you have to.
*  It's true. I mean, it sounds absurd when you say it, but it is true. I mean, you know, there is no
*  other way out other than the land being shared by all that land being shared by the people who live
*  there. No one's going anywhere. That has to be the basis. And eventually there has to be a just,
*  lasting settlement, which accepts that, where, and based on the principles of equality and justice,
*  there's literally no getting around it. Oria has been such an honor. And I think, you know,
*  you're, as I said, not just incisive, but also really full of humanity. And I think gives us a
*  lot of raw insight into exactly the dynamics at play and what that means for Israel and beyond.
*  So do share this video, make sure everyone hears what Ari Goldberg has got to say. I think I've
*  been absolutely fascinated. I've learned a huge amount and I'm sure everyone listening to you
*  has as well. Press like, subscribe, leave your comments, love to hear what you think.
*  Ari, honestly, what an honor. Thank you so much.
*  Thank you so much for having me and for giving me this opportunity to speak.
*  Oh, and it means the world to me. Thank you.
*  Oh, bless you. Thank you so much.
