# Why Israel DIDN'T WIN Iran War - w/. Sina Toossi
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug)
*  Was this the humiliation for Iran that it was widely presented as in the western media by Israel and so on? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=0.0s)]
*  Of course, we're talking about the Israeli unprovoked and completely illegal attack on Iran, just a fact, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=7.44s)]
*  followed of course by the also illegal US assault which followed. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  The original narrative looks a little bit shaky now after leaked Pentagon [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=22.48s)]
*  assessment suggesting that actually it may only have set back Iran's nuclear [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=28.0s)]
*  whatever program by a few months which is not actually significant at all. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  And Israel, as Donald Trump pointed out, got a bit of a kicking actually if we're going to just be honest [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  and then not saying it in a flippant way because I'm not a fan of missiles just generally be [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=47.28s)]
*  blowing people up which is why Israel shouldn't have attacked Iran. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=52.08s)]
*  Does no better person speak to you than someone I've been following about Iran, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=55.12s)]
*  particularly Iran related issues not exclusively which is Sina Suzy, her senior fellow at Center of [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=60.72s)]
*  International Policy, a think tank based in DC who writes very extensively on Iran and knows about [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=66.0s)]
*  Iran and like a lot of people pontificating about Iran. That's helpful, I don't know, it kind of [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=71.44s)]
*  helps people sort of know what they're talking about. It's great to see you. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=76.4s)]
*  Thank you for having me, really happy to be on. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=80.64s)]
*  I just want to ask firstly this quite extraordinary, I mean I say quite extraordinary, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=83.52000000000001s)]
*  Trump having his latest thing, I mean we shouldn't, I mean you know we're kind of used to a bit of [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=88.08000000000001s)]
*  theater there aren't we really, but this was earlier where he was very frustrated that the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=93.28s)]
*  basically leaked Pentagon assessment of the attack basically into the Iran strike [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  on Iranian nuclear facilities basically. And his defense secretary Hegzef, Pete Hegzef also [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  jumping up and down saying this you know, but actually even there sounds a bit of doubt, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  moderate to severe and we believe far more likely severe and obliterated. Well there's a [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  little, moderate and obliterated, it's quite a big gap between the two. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=131.12s)]
*  And he says they're further or much further away from nuclear weapons today then well [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=138.8s)]
*  it depends on how we define that. What do you think about that? I mean because they don't [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=142.32s)]
*  sound that confident actually, they sound a bit shaky given they are defined by bluster and how [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=145.28s)]
*  they present themselves. What do you think about this, the strike? Yeah I think when it comes to [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  assessing this war and which side made strategic gains or not, first I think it's useful to look at [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=154.4s)]
*  what Netanyahu said at the outset of this war and during the duration of this war as to his objective. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=162.0s)]
*  So his, he said you know like a direct quote like we will not stop until we've destroyed Iran's [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=167.44s)]
*  nuclear and missile programs. And that was echoed throughout the conflict by various Israeli [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=173.20000000000002s)]
*  officials. We also saw that this kind of morphed pretty quickly into a pretty explicit aim to kind [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=180.8s)]
*  of trigger regime change or massive unrest and chaos in Iran. Netanyahu desperately talked to the, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  you know he went on this Iranian Farsi news channel, Iran International, which is most likely funded by [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=195.36s)]
*  Israel itself and you know he tried to speak to the Iranian people and you know all these efforts [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=202.96s)]
*  to kind of stoke unrest. So now we see you know with this conflict reaching a ceasefire in this fashion, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=209.12s)]
*  Iran's ballistic missile capability was not destroyed, far from it Iran was continuously [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=216.88s)]
*  firing missiles at Israel every day. I've seen compelling analysis from you know arms experts [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=221.76s)]
*  and missile experts and people who track that stuff very closely that Iran actually got situated [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  in a pretty ideal situation with its missile strikes. That it was it initially fired heavy [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=234.48s)]
*  barrages and you know to really diminish and the quantity of Israeli interceptors and their [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  multi-layered air defense system. You know it's not the Iron Dome, it's the David Sling, it's the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=247.28s)]
*  various aero interceptor missiles for a high altitude and they're the most important ones [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=252.23999999999998s)]
*  when it comes to these sophisticated you know hypersonic claimed Iranian missiles which they [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=256.24s)]
*  are going very fast, they have multiple warheads and so we saw that actually interestingly despite [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=262.96s)]
*  the number of missile firings going down, the number of hits went up and you know there's a [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=269.59999999999997s)]
*  lot of footage of Iranian missiles hitting various facilities in Israel and targets. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=275.84s)]
*  Iran with that said it seemed like they followed a pretty calibrated tit for tat response where [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=281.35999999999996s)]
*  Israel for example hit you know an Iranian refinery with a drone attack early on in the war. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=287.59999999999997s)]
*  Iran followed the next day and hit a refinery in Haifa which resulted in that [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=294.4s)]
*  refinery going out of commission, power outages in Israel, I believe it's still out of commission [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=298.79999999999995s)]
*  as well. We saw that they attacked research centers and science centers in Iran, assassinated a lot of [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=304.0s)]
*  nuclear scientists. Iran bombed the Weizmann Institute in Tel Aviv which is a top Israeli [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=310.96s)]
*  military research and scientific center and then when it comes to the U.S. role, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=316.16s)]
*  obviously America supported Israel you know behind the scenes, military supply and all that, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=323.20000000000005s)]
*  but they directly intervened on Saturday and bombed the Iranian nuclear facilities [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=329.44000000000005s)]
*  and so this was also interesting because what it seems to me is that America bombed facilities [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  that were largely evacuated of the key nuclear material like centrifuges and enriched uranium [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=343.2s)]
*  and then Iran retaliated by attacking a U.S. base in Qatar that was largely evacuated. Again, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=349.44s)]
*  calibrated tit for tat. So now when it comes to assessing the damage done to the Iranian nuclear [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=356.48s)]
*  program, so the most, the biggest proliferation risk of Iran's nuclear program was that it [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=361.03999999999996s)]
*  amassed a large stockpile of enriched uranium, enough for I believe 10 to 15 nuclear bombs. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=367.52s)]
*  Uranium enriched to like 60% which is very close to the weapons grade, 90% needed to weaponize [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=374.24s)]
*  and Iran had gained, you know, built these advanced centrifuges, what's needed to produce [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=380.32s)]
*  this enriched uranium and centrifuges that could very rapidly produce high quantities of high [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=386.32s)]
*  enriched uranium. So according to this U.S. intelligence estimate that came out, according [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=391.76s)]
*  to the New York Times' coverage of this yesterday, there was a direct quote that said [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=397.2s)]
*  nearly all of this material and equipment is untouched, has been moved and so I think, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=401.76s)]
*  you know, and that the Fordow, this deeply buried site that was targeted that is the main facility [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=409.92s)]
*  in Iran, it seems like the Iranians themselves had said that only the entrances were hit, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=415.76s)]
*  no damage was done and even before the entrances were hit, there was satellite imagery of tons of [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=420.88000000000005s)]
*  trucks at the site in the preceding days that moved the equipment out and the Iranians themselves [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=427.68s)]
*  sealed it up with soil. Now this New York Times report and this U.S. intelligence community report [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=432.48s)]
*  seems to corroborate that Iranian narrative that only the entrances were hit, that the underground [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=437.44000000000005s)]
*  halls that are, I think, you know, hundreds of meters underground were not affected and so this [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=442.64000000000004s)]
*  is a very damning indictment of this whole war and, you know, this idea that Israel is coming out [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=448.88s)]
*  of this having met any of its strategic objectives is objectively false, that Iran's missile program [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=454.8s)]
*  is not destroyed, its nuclear program is not destroyed. To the contrary, Israel actually [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=460.96s)]
*  suffered immensely from attrition warfare, you know, most of its citizens were in shelters for [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=466.71999999999997s)]
*  this 10-day period, its economy was shut down, key sites were hit. You know, I heard from a Wall [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=471.92s)]
*  Street Journal reporter that, you know, contrary to what the Israelis publicly acknowledged, key [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=477.92s)]
*  military and intelligence sites in Israel were also hit and the Israelis were reeling and basically [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=483.52000000000004s)]
*  wanting more U.S. help and so this was also costly war. I mean, for all sides, certainly Iran took [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=489.36s)]
*  heavy blows, its top military leadership was assassinated, many nuclear scientists were [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=495.92s)]
*  assassinated, many various targets in the country were hit, its air superiority, its kind of control [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=500.88s)]
*  over its own skyways was, skies was challenged, although I would say that this idea that Israel [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=507.52s)]
*  had total air supremacy is not supported by all the facts. Iran, for example, shot down many Hermes [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=512.4s)]
*  drones. We'll see if they shot down any jets and they have any proof of that, particularly the F-35, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=519.36s)]
*  if they did that would be a strategic game changer. But yeah, so we're seeing that I don't think that [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=525.68s)]
*  the U.S. and Israel would have accepted a ceasefire or agreed to one if their narrative was true. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=530.72s)]
*  They haven't achieved any of their goals. So I think the mere fact that this ceasefire has [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=538.64s)]
*  happened after 12 days after a surprise Israeli attack is testament to the war being costly for [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=542.32s)]
*  them and I think that Iranian strike on al-Udayt in Qatar, yes, it was symbolic, the base was attacked, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=548.0s)]
*  maybe no damage was done, but what it signaled is that Iran is willing to enter that theater of [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=554.24s)]
*  destabilizing the Persian Gulf states, these close allies of the U.S., this vital artery of global [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=560.72s)]
*  energy resources, the Strait of Hormuz. And when it comes to economies like the UAE, Qatar, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=567.04s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, much like Israel, which is another reason this war was costly for Israel, is that [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=575.36s)]
*  they're heavily dependent on foreign investments and foreign capital and they heavily stand to [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=580.88s)]
*  lose from capital flights. This is the reason the Houthis emerged from the brutal Saudi war against [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=587.04s)]
*  them for many years because they had managed to shut down large parts of Saudi Arabia for a while [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=593.68s)]
*  and the Saudis just couldn't develop, they couldn't deal with that. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=600.16s)]
*  So, you know, Trump was just in these states inking these billion, trillion dollar supposed [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=605.1999999999999s)]
*  memorandums of understanding. He has a lot of personal investments and personal wealth in these [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=611.8399999999999s)]
*  countries as well, as does Jared Kushner, for example. So I think there's all these factors [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=617.1199999999999s)]
*  that contributed to the ceasefire. We'll see if it lasts, but for now, I think this conflict has [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=621.52s)]
*  been costly for all sides, but certainly the U.S. and Israel can't, I don't think it could be credibly [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=626.8s)]
*  claimed that they came out of this meeting their strategic objectives. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=632.16s)]
*  I mean, what do you think of what Donald Trump said? There was a few aspects to it. In terms of [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=636.88s)]
*  publicly reprimanding Israel saying it must not bomb Iran and demanding it didn't drop the bombs [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=645.4399999999999s)]
*  on them and doing that publicly, we know there have been tensions between the U.S. and Israel [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=653.8399999999999s)]
*  before, actually more tensions, for example, in Reagan, notoriously during the 1982 invasion of [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=658.0s)]
*  Lebanon when he rang the then Prime Minister, Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to denounce [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=662.88s)]
*  the assault on Lebanon as a Holocaust. But he did that privately, he didn't say anything publicly. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=669.68s)]
*  But I mean, you know, there's that. I thought one of the most notable things was he was talking [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=676.72s)]
*  about, because from the position of Israel, Iran is this great evil, it's the unique evil. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=682.08s)]
*  And Donald Trump put them on the same level. He's talking about these two countries and put them on [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=687.44s)]
*  the same level playing field. But Israel is supposed to be essentially the closest U.S. ally, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=691.0400000000001s)]
*  pretty much. And Israel is supposed to be, Iran is like the great evil for the U.S. right and the [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=696.1600000000001s)]
*  U.S. as well. So he's telling about, you know, these two countries, they've been fighting so long, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=702.96s)]
*  they don't know why they're still fighting, you know, as though they're both naughty school [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=706.8000000000001s)]
*  children on the same naughty step. Which from the point of view of Israel is a great, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=710.64s)]
*  I mean, that's a huge improvement from where they are. For Israel, that takes them down [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=716.96s)]
*  astronomically, surely. And then, you know, and then he keeps talking about how actually Iran [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=722.08s)]
*  did actually do quite a lot of damage to Israel. It's not helpful from Israel's point of view [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=728.24s)]
*  at all. I mean, Israel, you know, tried to suppress reporting of what was happening in terms of bomb [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=732.88s)]
*  attacks, the missile attack. What do you make of that? Is it just theater or does it mean [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=738.0s)]
*  something? Because it's definitely odd, it's eccentric, not least actually given, you know, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=742.48s)]
*  I know people go, well, Trump's a maverick and all the rest of it. And actually you can't, you know, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=748.0s)]
*  he's a bit, he's unpredictable. But I mean, he did appoint a bunch of pro-Israel maniacs to key [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=750.96s)]
*  positions. So how does it all work? Yeah, I think it's potentially extremely significant. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=756.16s)]
*  Right. You know, we see that, I mean, I think it helps to take a step back and see what are [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=762.72s)]
*  the strategic aims of Israel in the region and what are the strategic aims of Iran, for example, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=768.48s)]
*  in the region. Israel has basically positioned themselves as a key strategic ally for America, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=772.88s)]
*  a valuable ally, you know, during the Cold War against the Soviets and in the war on terror [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=780.24s)]
*  against Islamistism. And, you know, despite the fact that they've been a strategic liability, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=785.76s)]
*  I've argued for America, they've been pushing to make themselves to continue to be on the receiving [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=792.24s)]
*  end of unconditional US support. And now with the global geopolitical landscape changing even more [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=798.08s)]
*  rapidly towards multipolarity, towards America not being overextended, America needing to prioritize [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=805.84s)]
*  certain regions over the other, that I think in this big strategic picture, Israel's priority has [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=812.24s)]
*  been to keep America in the region, keep it to back itself, back Israel unconditionally, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=818.4s)]
*  support, you know, give cover for Israel's expansionist aims over the West Bank, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=825.4399999999999s)]
*  over Gaza, over other neighbors to consolidate this apartheid order. You know, I think that's a [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=830.3199999999999s)]
*  fair and objective assessment of Israel's strategic aims. And I think, you know, their [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=836.9599999999999s)]
*  opposition to, for example, the Obama era nuclear deal was not because of its non-proliferation [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=842.24s)]
*  merits, which were very strong. It sealed off Iran's pathways to a deal. It was that they were [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=846.8s)]
*  afraid that America and Iran would eventually come to some kind of strategic settlements, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=852.16s)]
*  that this big bogeyman of Iran that they built, that America would come to some level of terms with [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=857.8399999999999s)]
*  it, reduce its presence in the region, move on to, you know, focusing on China, Russia, other parts [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=862.8s)]
*  of the world domestically, and that Israel was strategically becoming a more weaker position. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=869.92s)]
*  So we see that Trump, like Obama, you know, they've had this professed aim to, you know, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=876.0s)]
*  pivot to Asia, pivot to China. China is America's real peer competitor. You know, and I think there's [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=882.8000000000001s)]
*  a lot of alarmism there. I'm against this new Cold War against China myself, but this is the view in [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=888.08s)]
*  Washington that China is where America should focus, Russia. So you can, you know, in the [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=893.0400000000001s)]
*  Washington foreign policy establishment mindset, you know, this is great power competition. China [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=898.5600000000001s)]
*  and Russia are America's great power rivals. Those should be the priority. Israel has been [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=903.68s)]
*  trying to portray Iran as some kind of big bogeyman, great power kind of country, which it [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=908.9599999999999s)]
*  absolutely is not. The Iranian economy is not anything significant or meaningfully challenging [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=913.3599999999999s)]
*  at a global level to the U.S. Its military power is purely defensive, as we've seen in this war. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=920.3199999999999s)]
*  Even there's been Pentagon assessments, you know, publicly released Pentagon assessments that Iran's [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=926.16s)]
*  military doctrine is defensive. It's based on asymmetric warfare. It does not have any offensive [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=930.88s)]
*  capability. It could basically, you know, it's heavy investment in missiles, drones, certain other, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=935.84s)]
*  you know, these groups in the region that could raise the cost of conflict against it, but do not [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=941.2s)]
*  position it as an offensive power. So in America, for America, it does make sense to come to some [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=946.16s)]
*  kind of strategic settlement to Iran, a detente, if you will, not like rapprochement. I don't think [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=951.92s)]
*  that's been on the table for either side. A detente that allows it to diminish its presence [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=956.08s)]
*  in the Middle East and focus more on Asia and, you know, Russia, elsewhere at home. So this war, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=961.6s)]
*  you know, in terms of meeting those strategic objectives, you know, in terms of Israel wanting [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=970.8000000000001s)]
*  to get America into a war with Iran, you know, Trump had just finished five rounds of negotiations [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=975.9200000000001s)]
*  with Iran right just before Israel attacked. He had written a letter to the Iranian Supreme Leader, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=980.56s)]
*  Ali Khamenei, in March, starting these negotiating process, which is apparently a very respectful [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=987.28s)]
*  letter. It seems like Steve Witkoff was on the cusp of an initial framework nuclear deal that was [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=993.04s)]
*  potentially going to be reached in the talks that were scheduled for last Sunday before Israel [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1001.3599999999999s)]
*  struck the war. So, you know, in Washington, there's basically two schools of thought. One [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1005.52s)]
*  is that, you know, Trump basically deceived the Iranians. This whole thing was a strategic ruse. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1010.48s)]
*  He was playing kind of 4D chess, meanwhile preparing to support this Israeli attack. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1016.56s)]
*  The other school of thought is that, no, you know, that Nathan Yahu is desperate to scuttle [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1022.88s)]
*  this process. He basically came to Trump, you know, he's been pushing hard for attacking Iran [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1028.6399999999999s)]
*  for many months now. We know that all these reports preceding this that Trump was pushing back, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1033.04s)]
*  you know, he even apparently fired Mike Waltz, his national security advisor, because Waltz was [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1037.92s)]
*  gung-ho on attacking Iran with Nathan Yahu. But then it seems like there was this artificial 60-day [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1041.92s)]
*  deadline that Trump had apparently put on negotiations with Iran. It's not even clear [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1049.28s)]
*  when they started, when it would end. And it seemed like Nathan Yahu came to Trump the week [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1054.3999999999999s)]
*  this war started and was basically like, you know, we have this plan, we're going to execute, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1061.04s)]
*  we're going to take out their leadership, we're going to take out their missile, you know. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1066.48s)]
*  And then Trump, and then they sold Trump on this idea that this would make it easier for you to [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1071.44s)]
*  get a deal. And it would put Iran in a weaker position and give you leverage. And then Trump [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1076.96s)]
*  seems to have given like a green light, if not a yellow light. And then that first morning when [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1082.3999999999999s)]
*  the Israelis were remarkably successful, you know, I think Israel's comparative advantage and [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1088.56s)]
*  really warfare is these abilities and capabilities and intelligence, covert warfare, assassinations. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1093.2s)]
*  This is an air power. This is what they've honed in on. They're not a ground power. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1099.9199999999998s)]
*  They can't sustain conventional warfare for long periods of time. But their intelligence and covert [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1104.1599999999999s)]
*  means they're very sophisticated, obviously with US and European support as well. So then that first [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1110.3999999999999s)]
*  morning, Israel came, took out Iran's senior military leadership, took out a bunch of nuclear [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1116.0s)]
*  scientists. And it seemed like they had kind of paralyzed Iran's air defenses and military [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1120.72s)]
*  command and control structure for several hours, because that's how long that lasted. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1125.44s)]
*  And Trump that morning, it seemed like he was probably like, wow, this is actually my work. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1130.08s)]
*  And he had, you know, he tweeted, he gave statements like, this is excellent, I support this. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1134.56s)]
*  And then he kind of once that first Iranian missile strike came that later that day, he [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1138.64s)]
*  went silent, interestingly, for two days. And then after that was this push for this kind of incoherent [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1142.88s)]
*  push that eventually resulted, you know, for escalation and de-escalation that eventually [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1149.44s)]
*  came to the ceasefire. So I think ultimately, it's very interesting this what you mentioned about [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1153.6000000000001s)]
*  this even handed way that Trump addressed Iran and Israel when announcing the ceasefire. It wasn't [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1159.68s)]
*  like our great ally, Israel, this evil country, Iran, was very even handed when he was announcing [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1165.1200000000001s)]
*  the ceasefire. And that is, I think, the Israelis worst nightmare is that if America adopts a more [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1170.72s)]
*  balanced role in the Middle East, similar to China and Russia, like China and Russia come deal with [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1178.0800000000002s)]
*  the Iranians deal with the Saudis deal with the Israelis, they don't give any of them [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1182.4s)]
*  unconditional support, they don't underwrite any side against the other and they kind of gain [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1186.88s)]
*  leverage over all the countries, you know, they encourage, you know, they, they boost their [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1190.72s)]
*  leverage by having competitive foreign relations. So the Saudis have to compete with the Qataris over [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1195.04s)]
*  getting China's favor or getting Russia's favor, or the Turks have to compete with [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1199.52s)]
*  them to get, you know, Russian favor. So if America were to have such a policy, well, rather than [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1204.24s)]
*  unconditionally backing any side in the Middle East, having a more balanced policy, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1211.52s)]
*  where it would encourage regional countries not to act with impunity that would entangle [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1216.4s)]
*  America into conflicts that it cannot afford, nor does it want like a big war with Iran. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1221.44s)]
*  And it can gain leverage over all countries. And ultimately, I would argue would benefit [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1227.1200000000001s)]
*  America's strategic interests more and American security and prosperity to have better relations [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1231.0400000000002s)]
*  with Iran. And this would be the worst case scenario for Israel. So I think that's what we [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1235.44s)]
*  should keep it. We should watch out for going forward. If America continues to seek some kind [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1240.24s)]
*  of deal with Iran, we'll see what is even possible at this stage, especially given, obviously, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1249.52s)]
*  the Iranians have every reason to be distrustful. Interestingly, Trump, when he announced the cease [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1253.6s)]
*  fire, he also said China can buy Iranian oil. It was unclear what he meant because there's sanctions [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1258.6399999999999s)]
*  and China's not technically, according to US sanctions, not allowed to buy Iranian oil. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1262.9599999999998s)]
*  Today at the NATO summit, Trump said that he'd link the Gaza ending the Gaza war, which he said [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1267.84s)]
*  there's been great progress made something that happened very soon, which we've heard before, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1273.6799999999998s)]
*  we'll see. Nevertheless, he said that at the NATO summit and he explicitly linked it to the [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1277.52s)]
*  Iran-Israel ceasefire, which that raises questions. What were the conditions of the [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1281.76s)]
*  ceasefire with Iran? Did Iran ask for it also to result in a Gaza ceasefire? I think there's [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1286.24s)]
*  several things. The strategic landscape can change. Obviously, in Israel, it would want it to change [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1294.16s)]
*  to enable its uncompromising dominance in the region, to keep America there, to contain and [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1300.8s)]
*  isolate or collapse Iran. But we're seeing almost two years after October 7th and now after this [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1307.04s)]
*  Israel-Iran war that Iran is still there, its military capabilities are still there, its nuclear [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1314.56s)]
*  infrastructure is still there. Then Hezbollah is still there. Hamas is still there. Meanwhile, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1321.04s)]
*  Israel is unprecedentedly isolated. I would argue they're in a strategic deadlock with what they've [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1327.52s)]
*  gotten themselves into with the occupation, with the West Bank. The Arab states aren't engaging them [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1334.0s)]
*  anymore or have an interest in deepening ties like they used to. America continues to want to [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1340.48s)]
*  leave the region. I think they're in dire strategic straits. We'll see how it plays out. But [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1345.44s)]
*  the public narrative is not reflective of this because I think that's reflective of the lopsided [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1351.76s)]
*  information war capabilities, that the US and the national security state in the US [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1358.64s)]
*  and Israel just have a lot more sophistication and power in the media space. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1365.5200000000002s)]
*  Alternative media such as yourselves and non-legacy media are changing that. But [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1371.6000000000001s)]
*  in general, in the information war and what they can present, a strategic failure as a victory much [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1378.16s)]
*  more than any other kind of power really can. Just finally, then, that's interesting. Do you think, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1385.36s)]
*  because we have heard this about Gaza several times now, and that being, well, they've broken [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1395.28s)]
*  a ceasefire, which then Israel violated repeatedly and then just destroyed in what has been awful, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1400.3999999999999s)]
*  genocide. I mean, it's all genocide of the privacy, but everyday massacring, starving [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1410.56s)]
*  Palestinians at eight points. So I'm just wondering what you think there in terms of what [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1414.88s)]
*  possible progress could be made given the US has officially endorsed the policy of removing [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1419.6000000000001s)]
*  every Palestinian from Gaza and the prospects of what making Gaza a habitable place, how would that [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1425.2s)]
*  even happen in the current context? Because that would need colossal willpower with no restrictions. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1431.5200000000002s)]
*  So you just think, what does it look like Gaza? I mean, it would be like the mother, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1440.48s)]
*  it would just be, you know, as Donald Trump said, a civilization has been wiped out. I mean, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1444.56s)]
*  what do you think? I just don't know what it looks like because I just think, you know, we did the [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1451.6s)]
*  ceasefire thing with Israel just killing lots of people and then ending it when they wanted to. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1455.52s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it'll have to be, you know, Nate and Yahoo would have to go basically. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1461.9199999999998s)]
*  Um, you know, he has, I think, undisputably, even within Israeli politics, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1467.76s)]
*  that prolonged this war to ensure his own political survivability, to avoid [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1475.12s)]
*  all the ramifications that would come if he loses power, including on corruption charges, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1481.4399999999998s)]
*  including potentially having to go to jail. His words, I mean, he might call a snap election [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1485.36s)]
*  and he might win. Yeah, yeah. So that's why I think, you know, he's trying to manipulate [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1489.6799999999998s)]
*  all these narratives to portray himself as ascendant. So even, for example, you had the [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1495.76s)]
*  U.S. intelligence reports yesterday saying this strike on the nuclear facilities was basically [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1500.32s)]
*  a failure. Then you had this Israeli institution that I just read from this tweet from a former [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1504.8s)]
*  Israeli national security official who said that this Israeli institution has been heavily [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1510.8799999999999s)]
*  politicized and controlled by Nate and Yahoo and his acolytes. So I think even within Israel, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1515.36s)]
*  he's trying to push this narrative that, you know, this war against Iran was a remarkable [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1520.96s)]
*  success against Hamas. We've reached, we're going to destroy them, uproot them, they're over. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1524.4s)]
*  But I think, yeah, it just basically has to do with U.S. pressure at the end of the day. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1530.8000000000002s)]
*  If Trump, you know, he's been all over the place. He has on important significant issues [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1534.8000000000002s)]
*  differed with Israel in recent months. For example, saying he's going to lift the sanctions on Syria, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1543.44s)]
*  deepening ties with Saudi Arabia, detach from Saudi Arabia, getting an Abraham Accord with [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1549.3600000000001s)]
*  Israel, directly negotiating with Hamas to get an American Israeli hostage released over Israel's [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1555.04s)]
*  preferences, ending this war with the Houthis against Israel's preferences. So Trump has, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1561.6s)]
*  you know, already on these big issues showed that he's willing to, you know, differ with Israel. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1568.56s)]
*  So we'll have to see that, because I think America's strategic interests demand an end to [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1576.56s)]
*  this war. And we can see that the cost of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict has been [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1582.1599999999999s)]
*  at the root of a lot of the instability in the region, has been something that has entangled [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1588.24s)]
*  America in this region. And as the world global order shifts to more multipolarity, as America, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1593.04s)]
*  you know, has commitments in other regions that it is struggling to maintain, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1601.36s)]
*  it can't afford to continue backing Israel like this. So if I think if Trump, just like Trump, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1606.56s)]
*  you know, yelled at Netanyahu and basically cussed him out yesterday, that that ended the war with [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1611.52s)]
*  Iran, he could he also has that power to end that war in Gaza. And I think so if it ends, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1617.04s)]
*  and if it ends in a way that can actually bring relief to the Palestinian people there, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1624.8799999999999s)]
*  it would have to be because America put the pressure that it was always able to put. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1629.84s)]
*  And, you know, that war has reached a dead end strategically. Just another quick point that I [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1633.4399999999998s)]
*  just remembered in regards to the calculations of the US is these interceptor missiles. So the [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1638.1599999999999s)]
*  aerial interceptor missiles are very expensive. America produces them. America only reportedly [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1643.6s)]
*  produces about 100 a year. Those have already been depleted. Israel had like a, I think between [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1649.36s)]
*  100 and 200 that have been largely depleted. And so this is a big advantage to China. And China has [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1654.56s)]
*  a lot of the rare earth materials as well to produce these very sophisticated interceptors. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1661.1200000000001s)]
*  So in terms of the balance of power in Asia, the balance of power in Russia and Eastern Europe and [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1664.88s)]
*  the Baltic area and Ukraine, you know, these kind of armaments are key. And so America doesn't want [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1670.4s)]
*  to expend them in a useless, pointless war against Iran that is not in its interest at all. So I [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1676.16s)]
*  think, yeah, the strategic picture is not in favor of Israel. But with that said, I would not [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1682.5600000000002s)]
*  underestimate Netanyahu's madness. I mean, I used to think it was a mad man. I don't know, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1689.12s)]
*  he is very desperate. It's not just the show. Like he might just, I think if he launched this war to [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1698.08s)]
*  derail US-Iran negotiations and get America in a big war, he might do something like that. Again, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1704.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, he's very desperate. So if to the extent that Trump understands this is unclear, a lot [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1709.92s)]
*  of the right wing in America increasingly understands this, including Steve Bannon, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1715.36s)]
*  Tucker Carlson. So that narrative is changing. So I think, yeah, all these developments are not good [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1719.28s)]
*  for Israel. Really, really fascinating stuff. And I think as the hate that expression just to sell, [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1725.04s)]
*  but I can't get another one off the top of my head. And the narrative has shifted a little, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1731.6s)]
*  quite significantly, actually, even in the last 24 to 48 hours, in particular, I would say. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1736.1599999999999s)]
*  And because during the onslaught itself, the, it was just basically Iran is getting a kick in [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1742.96s)]
*  humiliation, Israel, you know, triumphant. But things have shifted and actually it's not looking [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1748.48s)]
*  at all that straightforward. And actually, I think it raises very, very interesting question marks, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1756.3200000000002s)]
*  which you have emphasized. So it was really, really fascinating for everyone watching. Do like, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1761.76s)]
*  press like, subscribe, leave comments, leave your thoughts, share the video. Obviously, we're gonna [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1765.92s)]
*  get the discussion out. But it was important people hear what Sina has to say. I learned a [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1770.6399999999999s)]
*  huge amount there. And I'm sure everyone else did as well. So thank you so much, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1776.56s)]
*  Sina. I really, really, really appreciate it. Thanks so much. Thanks for having me. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TbD6ISHgug&t=1779.6s)]
