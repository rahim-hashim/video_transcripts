# Ministerâ€™s Israel Hypocrisy Will SICKEN You
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4)
*  This is absolutely repulsive. This really is something else. And it really just summarises [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=0.0s)]
*  how the whole world has been turned on its head by those who are the architects of the genocide of [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=6.0s)]
*  the Palestinian people. Now Zibi Hotevelli is the Israeli ambassador to the UK, a fanatical defend, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=12.16s)]
*  of course, of Israel's genocidal onslaught and also general subjugation of the Palestinian people. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=17.28s)]
*  Yesterday she posted a tweet in which she stood alongside Lisa Nandi, the Secretary of State for [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=23.2s)]
*  Culture, Media and Sport. Let me just read it out. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=27.84s)]
*  Thank you Secretary of State Lisa Nandi for a constructive and thoughtful meeting at DCMS, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  I appreciate your recognition and understanding of our serious concerns about the failings of [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=38.0s)]
*  the BBC and Glastonbury in staging and broadcasting blatant anti-Jewish hatred. A clear line was [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=43.04s)]
*  crossed from free speech into the incitement of hatred, violence and murder, and grateful that we [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  stand united against all forms of anti-Semitism including when it's amplified on public platforms. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=53.68s)]
*  This regards a Chanuk-Glastonbury music festival, specifically Death to the IDF, by a punk band. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=59.28s)]
*  The IDF is a genocidal killing machine whose atrocities have led the International Criminal [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=65.36s)]
*  Court to issue arrest warrants against Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence minister for war [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=69.6s)]
*  crimes and crimes against humanity, and indeed has led a consensus of genocide scholars, including [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  those in Israel itself, to conclude that Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=80.32s)]
*  people. There is a profound irony of course, which is Zibi Hoteveli supports sending IDF soldiers to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=86.0s)]
*  their deaths given she supports a genocidal onslaught which has principally exterminated [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=90.96s)]
*  Palestinian civilians but also killed hundreds of IDF soldiers. She claims that this is anti-Semitism [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=95.91999999999999s)]
*  and whipping up this storm against Jewish people. This is a deranged lie, it's simply false. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=103.76s)]
*  The IDF, a genocidal killing machine, and Jewish people as a whole are not the same thing, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=114.08000000000001s)]
*  and it's actually anti-Semitic to conflate the two. This is absolutely something else, but honestly [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  this isn't what I'm actually talking about. You'd expect Zibi Hoteveli to behave like this. That's [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=129.84s)]
*  not the point here. Let's just go into the world on its head. Lisa Nandi has whipped up, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=133.28s)]
*  or helped, so it wasn't just her to be fair, was it? She has fuelled a furore over the death [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=140.24s)]
*  of the IDF chant labelling it anti-Semitism, a grotesque abuse of the meaning of anti-Semitism. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=145.12s)]
*  Anger at a genocidal foreign army is driven by its genocidal behaviour, which includes [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=149.76s)]
*  deliberately massacring unarmed, starved Palestinian civilians as IDF soldiers and officers [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=154.32s)]
*  have confessed they have been ordered to do. It is not driven by hatred of Jewish people. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=161.36s)]
*  I'll talk more about Lisa Nandi's behaviour here, history is going to be so damning Lisa, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=166.0s)]
*  but let's just zone in on what the Israeli ambassador wrote. Discussing Lisa Nandi, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=170.16000000000003s)]
*  she posed for a picture, which she said a clear line was crossed from free speech into the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=174.16000000000003s)]
*  incitement of hatred, violence and murder. I am grateful that we stand united against all [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  forms of anti-Semitism, including when it's amplified on public platforms. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=181.44000000000003s)]
*  So Lisa Nandi here, standing united with the Israeli ambassador to confront what is wrongly [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=186.24s)]
*  described as racism and what she, the ambassador, labels incitement of hatred, violence and murder [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=190.48s)]
*  on a public platform. Let's listen to Zippy Hotevelli on a public platform on LBC, January 2024. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=195.84s)]
*  Those areas must be destroyed. And one of the things we expose to the world after getting into [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=202.0s)]
*  the areas in Gaza that we try to find all those tunnels and underground metro city that Hamas has [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=209.76s)]
*  built, thanks to this great support of Iran, Qatar, the international community, generosity, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=216.48s)]
*  everything turned to be this horrible terror city. One of the things we realised, every school, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=222.39999999999998s)]
*  every mosque, every second house has an access to tunnel. So this is, and of course, ammunition. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=227.67999999999998s)]
*  But that's an argument for destroying the whole of Gaza, every single building in it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  So do you have another solution how to destroy the underground tunnel city, that this is the place [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=238.56s)]
*  where the terrorists hide, where they have all their ammunition and this is the rockets that [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=243.36s)]
*  are still fired on Israeli cities? So there is the Israeli ambassador publicly calling for the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=247.36s)]
*  destruction of every building in Gaza. And bear in mind that an Israeli official declared on the 12th [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=250.96s)]
*  of October 2023 that Gaza will be reduced to a city of tents with no buildings left standing, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=255.68s)]
*  which is exactly what Israel went and did to Gaza. Almost all homes in Gaza are destroyed or damaged. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=260.16s)]
*  Israel has systematically attacked and destroyed hospitals, schools, mosques, churches, libraries, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=265.44s)]
*  universities, cafes, any and all pillars of a functioning society. Now, what this Israeli [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=270.24s)]
*  senior diplomat was doing was not an abstraction, because no one thinks a punk band at the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=278.16s)]
*  Klasenberg music festival is actually going to achieve death to the IDF. She's part of Israel's [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=282.40000000000003s)]
*  actually existing genocidal machine. She used her position to justify the mass indiscriminate [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=286.96000000000004s)]
*  destruction of civilian infrastructure, which can only lead to mass civilian death, because if you're [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  destroying all the buildings in Gaza, then you're going to kill, as Israel has, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=296.48s)]
*  vast numbers of civilians. A key definition of genocide as per the Genocide Convention is [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=300.64000000000004s)]
*  deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  destruction in whole or in part. Obviously, if you systematically destroy all civilian infrastructure [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=309.84000000000003s)]
*  in the territory, then you are deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=314.40000000000003s)]
*  calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part. No people can survive if you [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=318.24s)]
*  destroy all of the infrastructure that makes civilisation possible. Equally, the Genocide [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=323.04s)]
*  Convention criminalises the direct and public incitement to commit genocide. Calling for the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=327.20000000000005s)]
*  total destruction of an entire territory, which is what Hotevelli did, is the direct and public [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=331.84000000000003s)]
*  incitement to commit genocide. In a rational world, Hotevelli, given she has diplomatic protection [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=336.72s)]
*  from legal prosecution in the UK, would have been expelled from our country for what she said. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=341.52000000000004s)]
*  Did that happen? No, that did not happen. Quite the opposite. Instead, she's treated by the British [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=347.36s)]
*  government as someone with moral authority on the subject of inciting hatred and violence. Indeed, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=352.56s)]
*  more than that, some of these demands should be acted on in terms of imposing punishments on the [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=357.84s)]
*  public broadcaster, or what is, as I think we can all see, a state broadcaster, because the punk band [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=362.08s)]
*  initiated this chant when the Glastonbury Music Festival happened to be broadcast by the BBC. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=367.44s)]
*  This is insane. It's utterly insane. You'd be forgiven for concluding these people are trying [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=372.24s)]
*  to make you all go insane by turning the world on its head so wantonly and brazenly. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=378.0s)]
*  Now before Glastonbury, Lisa Nandy said, it's not my place to tell the BBC what they can or can't [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=383.28s)]
*  broadcast. That would take us to a very dark place. Seems as though we are in that very dark place. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=386.88s)]
*  She did an emergency statement to the House of Commons about the chant. So we had an emergency [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=391.36s)]
*  ministerial statement, not about, for example, again, the IDF deliberately massacring hundreds [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=395.6s)]
*  of deliberately starved, unarmed Palestinian civilians at aid points, but about a chant [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=400.08s)]
*  expressing people's anger and disgust with that IDF. She starts this non-stop [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=404.56s)]
*  furore over the chant being broadcast, indeed expands the furore to include the cancellation [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=408.88s)]
*  of the documentary about the plight of Palestinian children who have been killed in tens of thousands [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=413.52s)]
*  of numbers in Gaza because the child narrator had turned out to be the son of a junior technocratic [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=417.92s)]
*  minister in the Hamas administration, which was irrelevant because the child narrator didn't write [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=423.44s)]
*  any of his words that were written for him by the documentary because he was the narrator. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=427.36s)]
*  She said, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=431.12s)]
*  Interesting what she talks about there, isn't it? What Lisa Nandy says about [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=454.8s)]
*  accountability for the decisions that were taken. I agree with Lisa that people should be held [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=459.84s)]
*  accountable for the decisions that were taken. Decisions, for example, like arming a genocide, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=465.2s)]
*  arming the genocide extermination of a people, which I think is rather more important than a [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=470.15999999999997s)]
*  documentary, which was a rare example of the BBC showing the plight of murdered children being [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=475.68s)]
*  systematically murdered by our weapons, having a furore about it because of the child narrator. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=481.35999999999996s)]
*  You are so morally bankrupt. How do you live with yourself? Do you have a conscience? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=491.44s)]
*  Do you have any more code? I'm interested, actually, what goes on in these people's heads? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=499.52s)]
*  How do they justify their actions themselves? Bear in mind, too, that if the documentary [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=503.91999999999996s)]
*  commissioned by the BBC into the systematic destruction of Gaza's healthcare system was [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=507.76s)]
*  also cancelled despite having no problems with it whatsoever, but the government's beef is, of course, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=517.6s)]
*  not with that, not with the failure to properly cover the depravity being unleashed by the AF, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=522.4s)]
*  quite the opposite, which is hardly surprising because this implicates the British government, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=526.24s)]
*  which is arming and facilitating this crime of historic proportions. In terms of genocide or [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=529.68s)]
*  rhetoric more broadly, the genocide rhetoric of Israeli ministers and officials literally fills [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=534.64s)]
*  hundreds of pages, from the very beginning to more recently, for example, the Israeli [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=538.88s)]
*  Minister Bezelos Smotrich declaring that Gaza will be entirely destroyed, or indeed Israel [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=542.4s)]
*  officially declaring it will drive Gaza's population to a concentration camp and deport them. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=546.72s)]
*  With Netanyahu's dating, we are demolishing more and more of their homes. They have nowhere to [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=550.88s)]
*  return to. The only obvious result will be the desire of the Gazans to emigrate outside the strip. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=554.96s)]
*  The genocide rhetoric is underpinned with firepower and consequences, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=560.88s)]
*  firepower partly delivered by His Majesty's government. Insane. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=580.64s)]
*  Intensibly Sinadi in her role more broadly, in opposition, she was the shadow international [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=596.88s)]
*  development secretary. In January 2024, the same month that Zippy Hotevelli legitimised [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=600.56s)]
*  wiping Gaza from the face of the earth, the Israeli state initiated a smear campaign against [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=605.36s)]
*  UNRWA, which is Gaza's main humanitarian agency, the Palestinian refugee agency, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=611.84s)]
*  with baseless claims of terrorism. This happened to coincide with South Africa's genocide case [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=617.28s)]
*  against Israel at the International Court of Justice with a damning ruling and provisional [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=622.08s)]
*  orders issued against Israel. This led to multiple countries suspending funding for UNRWA when Gaza [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=627.44s)]
*  was in a catastrophic humanitarian situation. Clearly this had dire consequences, undoubtedly [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=632.48s)]
*  condemning many Palestinians to death. One of the countries that suspended aid was Britain. This was [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=637.28s)]
*  the moment for Labour to condemn this genocidal move with the power Labour had at the time, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=642.08s)]
*  when it was massively ahead in the polls, which was about crippling the main humanitarian agency [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=646.48s)]
*  in Gaza during a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, which was entirely human made. But Labour didn't [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=653.36s)]
*  do that. Exactly the opposite. Lisa Nandy instead declared allegations this series demanded serious [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=658.48s)]
*  response, as the UK rightly ensures that aid is never used to support terrorism, we are seeking [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=663.44s)]
*  urgent discussions with ministers to ensure ordinary Gazans can access aid. So what Lisa [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTHCQuvklP4&t=668.32s)]
