# Israel AT WAR With Syria - Where Is The Outrage?
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c)
*  Israel just went to war against Syria. Now you might very reasonably be asking why you don't [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=0.0s)]
*  know about this, because there is almost no prominent coverage about it in the Western media. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=4.8s)]
*  What the hell is that about? Syria hasn't attacked Israel. There were no threats from [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=10.16s)]
*  the Syrian government. In fact, there was not even the flimsiest pretext for what is a straightforward [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=14.64s)]
*  war of aggression. Overnight, the Israeli army went and bombed multiple targets around the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=20.48s)]
*  capital, Damascus, as well as in the south of the country, whilst Israel has already invaded an [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=25.28s)]
*  occupied part of the country. Israel has also made it clear that Syria can't have sovereignty. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=31.36s)]
*  It's very clear that promoting the Balkanisation, breaking the country up, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=36.88s)]
*  is in the minds of the Israeli state. Now, a bit of context. Israel has occupied the Golden Heights, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=42.24s)]
*  which is Syrian territory since 1967. It illegally annexed it in 9A1, which the world overall refuses [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=48.08s)]
*  to accept, except, notably, for the United States, when Trump unilaterally recognised [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=54.96s)]
*  it as Israeli territory in 2019. After the Assad regime fell in December 2024, Israel invaded a [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=60.32s)]
*  demilitarised buffer zone in the final third of the Golden Heights. As justification, Israel claimed [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=68.0s)]
*  that the 1974 Disengagement Agreement signed with Syria had collapsed. There's no legal basis for [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=73.92s)]
*  that. There might be a change in government, sure, but the Syrian state remained. Such agreements [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=80.32s)]
*  are supposed to survive changes in government. Indeed, the new transitional president, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=85.27999999999999s)]
*  Ahmed al-Sharah, declared his government would accept that agreement. The United Nations too [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=90.0s)]
*  denounced Israel's occupation as a violation of the 1974 Accords. But at the same time, Benjamin [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=95.6s)]
*  Netanyahu declared, we will not allow any hostile force to establish itself on our border. Now, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=102.16s)]
*  originally, the Israeli state claimed this was a temporary measure, but earlier this month, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=108.0s)]
*  it was revealed that Israel had already built six military sites in the buffer zone and had also [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=112.4s)]
*  been building roads as well. As Al Jazeera report, Syrian citizens in and near the demilitarised zone [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=117.84s)]
*  have complained of Israeli encroachment on their land, as well as checkpoints, unauthorised arrests, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=124.32s)]
*  housing raids, and road closures. All the hallmarks, of course, of an occupation. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=130.24s)]
*  Furthermore, Israel has reportedly been offering Syrians in Israeli occupied territory [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=137.12s)]
*  opportunities to work in Israel itself, supplying cheap labour for the occupiers. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=142.24s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu now says troops will be there for an unlimited period of time, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  while the defence minister, Israel Katz, has declared troops will remain there indefinitely. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=151.84s)]
*  As well as invading Syria in December, Israel repeatedly bombed Syria back that month as well, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=157.2s)]
*  with more than 100 raids all over the country, claiming it was to stop weapons falling into the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=163.92s)]
*  hands of extremists. Also, Israel warned the new government they faced being targeted if Israel [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=169.04s)]
*  deemed them a threat. Now, yesterday, following a national dialogue summit, so-called, the Syrian [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=175.11999999999998s)]
*  government condemned Israel's invasion of its land and asked for them to withdraw. How did Israel [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=180.95999999999998s)]
*  respond? By launching a military onslaught against Syria, what other countries would regard as a [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=186.64s)]
*  war of aggression. Israeli planes launched attacks near the capital, as well as in the south. At [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=194.48s)]
*  least two Syrian soldiers were reportedly killed, and Israel Katz, the defence minister, openly spoke [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=201.44s)]
*  with hostility, declaring, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=207.92s)]
*  Israel is demanding that the Syrian government can't move its own forces into the south of its own [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=216.64s)]
*  country, which is a brazen assault on the sovereignty of another nation. Indeed, for those who believe [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=225.44s)]
*  that the new Syrian government are somehow puppets of the Israeli state, that's not to say you [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=231.51999999999998s)]
*  shouldn't criticise the nature of the new Syrian regime, but for those who say that, the Israeli [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=235.83999999999997s)]
*  foreign minister yesterday declared that it was a bunch of Islamic terrorists from Idlib [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=241.84s)]
*  that conquered Damascus with force. Here's what Al Jazeera's Hamda Salout had to say about the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=246.88s)]
*  situation. The officials have been reiterating what they've been saying since they first started [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=253.52s)]
*  their expansion of its occupation of the Golan Heights in the north. They say that they're not [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=258.0s)]
*  going to allow the Israeli, the rather the Syrian army to regroup itself south of Damascus, that they [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=263.2s)]
*  want southern Syria to be totally demilitarised, and they're not going to allow any sort of presence [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=269.68s)]
*  of the military or any weapons there, saying that it's a threat to Israel and the safety of [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=274.56s)]
*  its citizens. The defence minister said, quote, that Israel will not allow Syria to turn into [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  another Lebanon, saying that they don't want any sort of weapons or threats on their borders. But [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=285.44s)]
*  this has been a situation that's been going on not just for months, but for years, Israel striking [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=290.24s)]
*  places across Syrian territory. But this time they're saying that they don't want any sort of [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=295.92s)]
*  Syrian military presence. And remember, this is a new administration in Syria. This is a country [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=301.76s)]
*  that has freed itself from its previous regime. And Israel is infringing on its sovereignty, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=307.2s)]
*  saying that they don't want any sort of military activity there. So the army is saying that they're [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=313.28000000000003s)]
*  going to continue to strike weapons depots, any sort of military assets and command centres. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=317.6s)]
*  While Syrian officials say that Israel is infringing on its sovereignty, calling on them [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=322.88s)]
*  to leave the places that it has set up. But Benjamin Netanyahu, along with his defence minister, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=327.36s)]
*  Israel Katz, say that the presence of Israeli forces in those buffer zones is going to remain [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=332.71999999999997s)]
*  until further notice. As the former Portuguese minister Bruno Maceiz puts it, Israel heavily [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=338.15999999999997s)]
*  bombing Syria tonight, the reason preventing the country from getting back on its feet. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=344.48s)]
*  While Syrian journalist Mazen Hassoun writes, Israel is bombing Damascus right now without [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=348.96s)]
*  any provocation. Israel wants a war to destabilise Syria and prevent the democratic transition. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=354.47999999999996s)]
*  Israel is an enemy to the Free Syria. And Israeli analyst Myrev Zonshine says, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=359.68s)]
*  with ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon and all our war on Palestinians in the West Bank, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=365.28s)]
*  Israel has opened another front with extensive bombing in Syria, completely unprovoked. Hard [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=369.35999999999996s)]
*  not to see it as an effort to sow chaos and provoke a response. Israel's attacks on Syria [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=375.36s)]
*  have led to protests breaking out with the country there, with citizens demanding that Syria respond [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=381.68s)]
*  with an attack on Tel Aviv. Other placards include slogans such as, Israel is our eternal enemy, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=386.16s)]
*  and Netanyahu is a terrorist. As DropSite News' brilliant journalist Mataza Hussein explains, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=392.72s)]
*  Syria is at a level of development right now that is inferior to any third world country that I have [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  been to. There is almost no electricity in the country, little food or water, people are [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=404.64s)]
*  displaced or living in ruins and tents, and the government itself barely exists as a practical [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=409.03999999999996s)]
*  reality. Every state needs to defend its sovereignty, but the idea that Syria today [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=413.91999999999996s)]
*  has the capacity to engage in direct conflict with a nuclear armed state backed by the world's [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=418.56s)]
*  only superpower is risable. He adds that he believes that Syria is likely to seek security [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=423.44s)]
*  guarantees from Turkey, whose regime is closest to the new Syrian administration, but adds, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=428.88s)]
*  I would not be surprised if Syria rebuilds relations with other former enemies in the [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=434.96s)]
*  long term, including eventually Iran. The current attacks are calling into question [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=439.28s)]
*  its survival in its current form, and every step necessary will likely be considered. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=443.44s)]
*  Well, that really would be a striking example of Israeli hubris, that after the Assad dictatorship [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=448.71999999999997s)]
*  fell, Israel is doing all it can to drive the new government into a position of hostility, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=454.96s)]
*  but look at the hypocrisy here. Russia's aggression in Ukraine is condemned, but Syria can invade and [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=459.76s)]
*  bomb its neighbours at will, and not only is there no condemnation of these wantonly illegal [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=464.79999999999995s)]
*  assaults on the sovereignty of other nations, there is very little prominent media coverage. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=470.08s)]
*  Indeed, this weekend, Israel's official Twitter account posted a picture of its planes, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=475.12s)]
*  its warplanes, flying over Beirut with a caption, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=480.24s)]
*  Israeli Air Force jets over Beirut during Hassan Nasrallah's funeral. Now, furthermore, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=484.24s)]
*  the US has allowed Israel to maintain its occupation of southern Lebanon, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=489.68s)]
*  contrary to commitments to withdraw. This normalisation of Israel's violation [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=493.68s)]
*  of the sovereignty of multiple nations is absolutely absurd. The only reason Israel [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=499.04s)]
*  can do this, of course, is because it's armed to the teeth and backed by the world's only superpower, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=504.16s)]
*  the US, albeit a hegemon in decline. That our media outlets and politicians are not screaming [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=508.8s)]
*  about Israeli aggression against sovereign nations says all you need to know. Well, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=513.92s)]
*  right now Israel is awash with hubris. In Palestine, of course, it's committed some of the worst crimes [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=518.8s)]
*  of our age, and that's without discussing the hideous atrocities committed in Lebanon. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=524.24s)]
*  Its leaders are clearly intent on carving out a greater Israel, which means endless remorseful [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=528.8s)]
*  war. But anyone who is familiar with Greek tragedies knows that hubris all too often [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzQ4rv416c&t=533.44s)]
