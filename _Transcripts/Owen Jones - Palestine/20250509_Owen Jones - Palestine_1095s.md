# Kick Israel Out Of Eurovision - w/. Samir Eskanda
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g)
*  Eurovision, for a lot of people, it's kind of a bit of camp fun, I guess. And some would go, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=0.0s)]
*  oh no, keep the politics out of it. Well, we're going to explain why you can't do that and why [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=4.24s)]
*  Israel's participation in this contest, while it is committing genocide, let alone, of course, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=9.52s)]
*  the crime of apartheid, which it has been committing for generations now, means that Israel's [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=14.48s)]
*  participation has to end. There's a campaign which is gathering speed this year. This is so important. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=20.64s)]
*  It's about Israel's impunity and it's about how we take concrete action to end that impunity [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=27.68s)]
*  during one of the great crimes of our age. With that in mind, I'm really delighted to be joined [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=33.68s)]
*  by the brilliant Samir Eskander, who is a Palestinian artist, organiser, human rights activist, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=37.04s)]
*  who's based over in the UK. He's had such a long history of activism and campaigning in this area. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  He's been covered by multiple media outlets all over the world and played a key role in the sorts [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=49.2s)]
*  of campaigns which are necessary if this horror is going to end. Samir, it's great to speak to you. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=55.76s)]
*  How are you doing? I'm okay. Thank you for inviting me on. First thing, so when people go, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=62.0s)]
*  oh, Eurovision is just about music, politics, keep it out. I mean, that's the default. That's what [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=68.0s)]
*  people come out with. What's the answer to that when we're talking about a state committing genocide? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=72.4s)]
*  Well, I think that the Eurovision organises the European Broadcasting Union, or the EBU for short. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=79.6s)]
*  I think they've presided now over some of the worst, most controversial editions of the song [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=85.52s)]
*  contest. Since Israel hosted Eurovision in 2019, the EBU, the Eurovision organises have been [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=92.32s)]
*  consistently defending, protecting, shielding apartheid Israel, even now as it commits genocide [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=101.44s)]
*  against 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza. If they don't want a political song contest, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  don't defend the participation of a genocidal state that is currently at the International [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=115.52s)]
*  Court of Justice. As many people know already, the International Court of Justice, the world's [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=120.56s)]
*  highest court, has already ruled that Israel is plausibly committing genocide. So if you don't [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=125.76s)]
*  want a politicised contest, my advice to the EBU is don't invite genocidal states. I mean, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=130.96s)]
*  the Israeli broadcaster, CAN, it's called, is itself deeply, deeply complicit in this genocide [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=137.04s)]
*  in Gaza. I don't know if everybody knows, but the way it works is that national broadcasters [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=145.12s)]
*  obviously participate in Eurovision. They're the participants. So from Israel's side, it's CAN. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=149.84s)]
*  I mean, CAN news hosts, news anchors are on air, calling and citing for genocide [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=156.79999999999998s)]
*  against Palestinians in Gaza. They're signing bombs and missiles and dedicating them to the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=164.56s)]
*  people of Gaza. I mean, last year, CAN, Eurovision hosts were making really incredibly, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=168.64s)]
*  you know, they were inciting really against other international contestants who were [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=179.6s)]
*  calling for Israel to be excluded as, you know, thousands and thousands of artists and [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=184.23999999999998s)]
*  queer and trans organisations, many European politicians. Very recently we had, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=189.60000000000002s)]
*  we saw the Icelandic foreign minister calling for Israel to be excluded too. So the level of [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=194.88000000000002s)]
*  opposition to Israel's participation in this contest is so huge. At this point, by digging [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=201.84s)]
*  their heels in and insisting on Israel's participation, the Eurovision organisers [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=209.60000000000002s)]
*  are absolutely playing a role in enabling this genocide in Gaza. And that's why Palestinians, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=215.84s)]
*  including the Palestinian journalist syndicate, are calling for Israel to be excluded. And, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=223.44s)]
*  you know, you may, your viewers may know already, I know Owen, you've been covering this, more than [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=229.2s)]
*  200 Palestinian journalists have been systematically targeted and murdered in Gaza. Their families [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  have also been targeted. This is what many people are calling a journo side within the genocide. So [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=240.4s)]
*  at what point do the Eurovision organisers do the bare minimum of excluding this genocidal state and [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=247.28s)]
*  this genocidal broadcaster from this contest? And, because you mentioned the ICJ, we also, of course, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=256.88s)]
*  have the International Criminal Court, which is issued arrest warrants against Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=262.64s)]
*  his former defence minister, for war crimes, for crimes against humanity. For those who don't know, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=265.92s)]
*  I mean genocide, the public incitement of genocide is itself a crime. It was criminalised by the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=270.24s)]
*  Genocide Convention of 1948, one of five crimes. Israel was ordered by the International Court of [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=275.44s)]
*  Justice to stop the incitement of genocide and CARM has shared the public broadcast of their shared [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  videos, for example, of Israeli children singing, We Will Annihilate Everyone in Gaza. I covered that [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=288.48s)]
*  song on this channel at the time. It's a truly disturbing song. So that broadcast is complicit in [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=293.04s)]
*  a crime. There's no question about that. It's an objective crime. No lawyer would tell you otherwise [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=298.72s)]
*  unless they're lying to you. So, I mean, in terms of, you know, Russia has been banned. So, I mean, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=304.32s)]
*  that kind of just answers that one. So, I mean, Russia can't participate because it has invaded [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=310.08000000000004s)]
*  Ukraine and committed war crimes. Israel is using this as a PR stunt. I mean, explain, how important [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=315.04s)]
*  do you think Israel sees this? Because it isn't just campfoth, is it? It's something which is [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=321.68s)]
*  watched by millions of people. Why is this important for Israel in terms of how it normalises itself [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=325.44s)]
*  and how it kind of wins cultural buy-in from people? Well, I think the Israeli president, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=331.84000000000003s)]
*  who's also the head of state, Isaac Herzog, made that very clear last year when he said, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=337.44s)]
*  quote, it's important for Israel to appear in Eurovision. So, I think he's speaking there to, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=343.44s)]
*  as you say, the contest's propaganda value for Israel, particularly in the time of genocide. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=348.32s)]
*  And at the International Court of Justice, South Africa actually cited [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=353.36s)]
*  the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog's assertion that Palestinians are, quote, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=357.84s)]
*  an entire nation out there that is responsible. And they cited that as evidence [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=361.52s)]
*  of Israel's genocidal intent. So, there's a very irrefutable link here between how Israel sees [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=365.92s)]
*  its participation in the Eurovision Song Contest and the genocide that it's perpetrating in Gaza [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=374.4s)]
*  as we speak. I mean, as you said, in 2022, Eurovision organises the EBU banned Russia [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=380.47999999999996s)]
*  following its illegal invasion of Ukraine. And what they said at that time was, I've got the quote [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=387.91999999999996s)]
*  here, the inclusion of a Russian entry in this year's contest would bring the competition into [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=391.68s)]
*  disrepute. But clearly, insisting on Israel's participation has brought the competition into [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=396.71999999999997s)]
*  disrepute. And this is what so many fans are saying. I mean, last year's edition, you only had [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=402.4s)]
*  to scan through some of the top tweets from the millions and millions of tweets that are generated [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=408.0s)]
*  when Eurovision, the night that it takes place, to see just how distraught Eurovision superfans are. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=413.44s)]
*  And for a lot of people, Eurovision is something that doesn't just happen once a year. It's [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=420.32s)]
*  something that they follow closely and participate all year round. And now we're seeing, again, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=425.76s)]
*  lots of Eurovision fan sites are refusing to either cover Israel's participation, or in at [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=431.12s)]
*  least one case that I've seen this year, they're refusing to cover the contest whatsoever. And so [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=438.56s)]
*  these are real superfans who kind of live and breathe Eurovision. And so for them to make [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=444.08s)]
*  that decision to not cover it whatsoever this year, I think also speaks to just the depth of [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=450.47999999999996s)]
*  feeling there is for excluding Israel. I mean, just again, evidence. One journalist at Cannes [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=454.64s)]
*  says, the Eurovision Song Contest has long been more than just a musical event. It is a critical [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=463.03999999999996s)]
*  arena for Israeli advocacy. YouTube channel created by the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=466.8s)]
*  dedicated to paying ads for the Televo advertising campaign. They see this clearly as very important [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=473.28s)]
*  for them, because it's a way of, I guess, trying to capture hearts and minds, you know, making it, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=478.15999999999997s)]
*  making Israel look cool and sexy whilst it's murdering innocent people by in vast numbers. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=484.47999999999996s)]
*  I mean, this act itself, I mean, this is about art. It's about, we call it art washing, don't we? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=492.79999999999995s)]
*  I mean, can you tell just, you know, because there's pink washing as well, the way Israel has, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=499.84s)]
*  and that kind of taps into it. Because Eurovision, let's be honest, you've got a [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=504.32s)]
*  disproportionately queer audience, I would say. But I mean, they're trying to, I mean, what is art [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=507.76s)]
*  washing? Because this kind of explains why the cultural boycott is so important. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=512.08s)]
*  So when we talk about art washing, what we mean is that it's a form of white washing. So [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=518.4000000000001s)]
*  Israel and, you know, some corporations and some other states can try to cover up their different [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=525.2s)]
*  forms of human rights violations and complicity by employing certain tactics. In the case of [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=536.24s)]
*  Israel, this is very overt and specific. So since 2005, Israel has launched what it calls the brand [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=543.36s)]
*  Israel campaign, where you have ranking foreign ministry officials saying, we will show you [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=549.2s)]
*  Israel's prettier face. So you don't just think of Israel in the context of war. And that what they [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=555.04s)]
*  call hasbara, which means propaganda, is the same as culture, another foreign ministry official has [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=560.88s)]
*  said. So this is what we mean when we talk about art washing. We also mean, for example, when an [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=566.4s)]
*  artist goes to play in apartheid Tel Aviv, which some are continuing to do, even in the context [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=572.48s)]
*  of this genocide, they're playing in Tel Aviv, some DJs, some other artists, just a short drive [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=577.76s)]
*  away from where more than at least 62,000 Palestinians have been [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=583.36s)]
*  annihilated. And Gaza has been levelled to a very large extent, you know, hundreds of thousands of [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=591.44s)]
*  children are on the verge of starvation. Almost everybody is sick in Gaza, according to some [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=598.32s)]
*  some metrics. So to go to an apartheid city, just a short drive away, and to perform there, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=606.4s)]
*  while all of this is taking place, this is what we mean by art washing. You are, when you [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=614.0s)]
*  participate in this, you are absolutely, consciously and irrefutably distracting, covering up [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=619.76s)]
*  white washing or art washing this genocide. You mentioned pink washing too, you know, so far this [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=627.44s)]
*  year we have already dozens of queer and trans organisations calling for the boycott of Eurovision [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=634.48s)]
*  between 2018 and now we've seen, I think, hundreds of queer and trans organisations make the same [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=641.84s)]
*  call. So many individuals, pride marches, Eurovision screening parties and queer venues [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=649.12s)]
*  have also said the same thing. So at this point, the opposition to Israel's pink washing, to its [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=657.36s)]
*  art washing, to its exploitation of Eurovision as a means to really cover up its genocide is huge. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=666.64s)]
*  And just yesterday, more than 70 former participants in Eurovision, including the 2017 [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=675.28s)]
*  winner for Portugal, Salvador Sobral, Britain's 2023 entrant May Muller and so many others, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=681.36s)]
*  also called for Israel to be excluded on the same basis that Israel is white washing its genocide. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=688.88s)]
*  Last year, the contest took place in Malmo and more than 30 artists, venues and organisations [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=694.48s)]
*  withdrew from what's called Eurovision Week, which is the contest's official pre-parties, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=701.92s)]
*  including Malmo Pride, also withdrew. So much, in fact, was withdrawn from Eurovision Week that [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=707.92s)]
*  they actually took down what they were calling Eurovision Street. And also last year, climate [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=714.88s)]
*  justice activist Greta Thunberg, she joined tens of thousands of people on the streets of Malmo [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=720.64s)]
*  condemning Israel's genocide. Can you just explain finally BDS, boycott divestment sanctions, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=725.36s)]
*  tell me just what that is and so is the principles underpinning it and why it's so crucial in ending [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=733.12s)]
*  what is Israeli impunity, which is the ability of Israel to get away with literally anything, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=738.88s)]
*  with no accountability or justice, which is why it can quite literally live stream a genocide. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=744.24s)]
*  It's just as you said it. So it's Israel's impunity that allows it to continue this perhaps most [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=751.36s)]
*  well-documented live streams genocide in history and in particular, it's Western complicity [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=758.56s)]
*  that allows it to do so. So it's the complicity of Western states, corporations and institutions, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=766.4s)]
*  including cultural institutions. So since 2004, the Palestinian campaign for the academic and [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=772.2399999999999s)]
*  cultural boycott of Israel or PAKT has been calling for the boycott of Israel's complicit [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=778.2399999999999s)]
*  cultural institutions. So BDS, including the cultural boycott of Israel, specifically targets [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=783.68s)]
*  institutions rather than individuals and it targets complicity rather than identity. So what [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=790.3199999999999s)]
*  that means in practice is Israeli arts organizations, cultural institutions, venues, music festivals, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=795.28s)]
*  orchestras, etc. are absolutely implicated in this genocide in Gaza and the underlying regime of [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=801.12s)]
*  settler colonial apartheid. So for example, there's a club in apartheid Tel Aviv called Barbie and in [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=808.48s)]
*  this club in 2014, when Israel was again massacring Palestinians in Gaza, killing more than [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=815.84s)]
*  2,200, including 500 children in that summer of 2014, this club Barbie, they made special t-shirts [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=822.08s)]
*  that said, fuck you, we're from Israel. And they printed them up and they drove down to near Gaza [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=827.76s)]
*  and they found uniformed armed soldiers. They handed out these t-shirts and they posted the [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=834.24s)]
*  pictures proudly on their Facebook page. They're still up today saying we wanted to pamper our [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=839.76s)]
*  boys. So and this Barbie club, we've even seen some international artists go to play there even [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=845.76s)]
*  during the genocide. So that's just one small example among many. One other example I can give [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=851.6s)]
*  you is that a few months ago, more than 7,000 authors, including leading names, book workers [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=857.92s)]
*  and other writers, pledged to boycott complicit Israeli publishers. Now the coalition working on [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=866.4799999999999s)]
*  that actually carefully researched every Israeli publisher to see if any had met the conditions [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=872.4799999999999s)]
*  in BDS guidelines, which would make them exempt from the boycott. None did. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=880.3199999999999s)]
*  So there may be one that may have met the conditions and people have been looking into [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=888.16s)]
*  that more recently. But as of a few months ago, every single major Israeli publisher was [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=895.4399999999999s)]
*  absolutely boycottable on the basis of BDS guidelines. They had failed to end diverse forms [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=901.68s)]
*  of complicity and they'd failed to endorse the comprehensive Palestinian rights under international [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=906.56s)]
*  law, including the right of return. And if any Israeli cultural institution meets those two [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=913.04s)]
*  conditions, which are themselves partly modelled on the boycott movement against apartheid in South [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=918.8s)]
*  Africa, then they would be exempted from the boycott. But as of today, almost none has, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=925.28s)]
*  with some possible minor exceptions. So we've also seen so many other cases though beyond [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=930.16s)]
*  the complicity of Israeli cultural institutions, which absolutely should be boycotted by all [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=938.8s)]
*  artists, all cultural workers and indeed tens of thousands have publicly pledged to do so. And many, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=944.56s)]
*  many more would be engaged in a silent boycott, which we as Palestinians involved in the cultural [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=949.68s)]
*  boycott would also welcome, although we hope that more will go public. But beyond this too, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=954.8s)]
*  we've seen enormous boycotts of, for example, South by Southwest, the Music Industry Showcase [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=960.48s)]
*  Festival in Texas, which was partnered with the US military and US weapons manufacturers. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=965.76s)]
*  And because of this link to Israel's genocide in Gaza, more than 120 artists boycotted South [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=972.64s)]
*  by Southwest. In Britain, the Great Escape was boycotted by more than 160 banks, because it was [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=977.92s)]
*  partnered with Barclays Bank, which invests in eight or nine Israeli weapons manufacturers and [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=984.72s)]
*  other manufacturers arming Israel's genocide. So even without the link to Israeli, complicit Israeli [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=991.6s)]
*  cultural organizations, we are seeing lots of very strategic and targeted campaigns that are [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=998.5600000000001s)]
*  working to end the complicity of international arts events and organizations. Brilliant stuff. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=1007.6s)]
*  And, you know, just finally, you sometimes get this bad faith attack. I remember this last year, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=1014.24s)]
*  going, oh, well, that's going to solve everything, isn't it? Your revision being boycotted. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=1018.24s)]
*  The point is, this is a multi-pronged campaign. No individual thing in isolation, of course, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=1021.36s)]
*  will end apartheid and genocide being committed against the Palestinian people, just as it wasn't [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=1026.96s)]
*  true with apartheid in South Africa. It's about using every possible lever, any possible leverage [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=1032.24s)]
*  that is there in order to pile pressure on Israel, to isolate it, to turn it into an actual genuine [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=1038.64s)]
*  pariah state, in order to make it untenable to carry on committing these grievous crimes against [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=1045.28s)]
*  the Palestinian people. This is one particular assault. It's also consciousness raising. It's [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=1052.24s)]
*  about reaching people, because a lot of normies engage in your revision. This reaches them. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=1056.16s)]
*  That's why this is just so, so important. So please listen to what's being said there. Spread [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=1060.56s)]
*  the message. Spread this video. Make sure everyone hears Samir's brilliant voices ever. Press like, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=1066.24s)]
*  subscribe, and leave comments, because again, that means more people engage, more people then [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=1072.0s)]
*  hear what we're talking about. That's the whole point. Samir, as ever, thanks for your incredible [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=1076.08s)]
*  work, honestly. It's always an honor to talk to you. Thank you, Owen. Take care. You too. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRWoWZ1cG4g&t=1080.0s)]
