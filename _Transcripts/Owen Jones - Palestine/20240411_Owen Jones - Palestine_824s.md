# Israel Plots WAR With Iran - w. Trita Parsi
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WETnBxQD5gI)
*  This week, the prospect of some form of armed confrontation between Israel and Iran, and
*  possibly the US therefore, and Iran, well, that seems to have become a lot more likely. We've
*  of course seen Iran, the bombing, sorry, of Iran's embassy in Damascus by Israel. What does it all
*  mean? Is a global, a regional conflagration more likely? Well, we've got no better person to speak
*  to you frankly than the brilliant Tritiparsi, who is an American-Iranian commentator, the co-founder
*  and executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, and an author of three
*  books, I believe, on the question of Iran and the US and general relations. Tritip, it's a great
*  pleasure to see you. How are you doing? Pleasure's all mine. Thank you so much for having me.
*  So let's just get straight into it. Is a confrontation, an armed confrontation with Iran
*  inevitable given, as we saw, for example, the strike on the embassy in Damascus by Israel?
*  It is certainly not inevitable, but it is unfortunately increasingly likely. There
*  definitely are ways to prevent a further escalation, and many of those cards are in the hands of
*  Biden, but we have seen that Biden has not been prioritizing de-escalation for the last six months,
*  and the last signals coming out of the White House suggest that he's not looking, or is actually not
*  serious about de-escalation this time around either. But inevitability, I would absolutely
*  not say. Just take a look at what's been going on for the last few years. The Israelis have hit
*  Iran numerous times, and the Iranians have actually not responded, partly because they're
*  playing a long game. They know that they're in a weaker position right now, and they are in a
*  confrontation with Israel, but it is not in their interest to actually have a confrontation right
*  now. It is in their interest, at least as Netanyahu defines itself, for Israel to have it, for Israel
*  to expand the war, to prolong the war. And this is a key problem in Biden's approach. He has linked
*  his policy, as if he hitched himself to what Netanyahu does. But Netanyahu is not looking
*  to end this conflict. He's not looking even to get the hostages released. Just see what he did
*  yesterday with the assassination of the children and grandchildren of one of the Hamas officials.
*  That's not something you do when you actually want to advance a deal that gets the hostages released.
*  Yet Biden has hitched his policy to Netanyahu, even though they have very different interests.
*  I mean, so that look of it and thing, this is kind of wacky behavior by the Israeli state in that
*  there's been six months now of this murderous onslaught against Gaza. But I mean, that's been
*  a strategic defeat for Israel in lots of ways. Public opinion is drastically shifting against
*  them in the states that they need support from, armed support, diplomatic and political support
*  from. And they haven't actually defeated Hamas, which after six months of dropping the equivalent
*  of several nuclear bombs on an area the size of East London. So a lot of people go, well,
*  why would they want to expand that into a regional war? Or is it because of the strategic defeat that
*  they seem to be suffering? I think you put your finger right at the end. It's the danger of them
*  losing in Gaza that increases the likelihood of them trying to expand the war in order to be
*  able to get some sort of a turn of events that can turn this into a strategic win. But you also
*  have to remember two other factors. Netanyahu in particular, but also other Israeli leaders,
*  have been looking for a fight with Iran for the last 20 plus years, and they've been pushing
*  American presidents to go to war with Iran. And all of them, even the most hawkish ones,
*  have pushed back. But now with Biden's deference, unprecedented deference to Netanyahu,
*  Netanyahu may find himself having the best opportunity yet to be able to go forward with
*  his longstanding objective and maybe taking that opportunity as a result. Secondly, we also again
*  have to remember Netanyahu knows very well the minute this war ends, his political career ends
*  as well, and most likely his prison sentence begins. So he does not have an interest in ending
*  the war, getting the hostages released. And don't take it from me, take it from the Israelis inside
*  of Israel that are on TV every day making this point. The families of the hostages who at this
*  point have been completely fed up for the last two months, they've been very clear in their commentary
*  that the current government of Israel is by no means, by no strategic imagination, prioritizing
*  the release of the hostages. Yet Biden is following Netanyahu's lead on this as if Netanyahu's objective
*  is to get the hostages released, as if Netanyahu's objective is to end the war, not prolong it,
*  not enlarge it. It's a calculation that we've seen obviously six months of often hot air from Joe
*  Biden, hand-wringing whilst continuing to arm Israel, provide diplomatic support for Israel.
*  But I mean, that's flagging compared to where it was. Obviously, the US is still facilitating
*  this absolute horror show, but public opinion has drastically shifted. I mean, a new Yugo poll
*  suggests that more Americans than not think genocide is taking place in Gaza. And that's
*  a huge majority amongst Biden's own voters. So now Biden is going to presidential election with
*  a large majority of his own voters thinking he's facilitating a genocide, which is not good.
*  So I mean, he's started to use very tiny bits of leverage, that's clear. Is this way, if you start
*  a war with Iran, is that a way of just getting the US back in line, then the US all of a sudden
*  just swings back in support and drops any reluctance? I think we may already have seen
*  at least the foreshadowing of that, because Biden came out yesterday and said that the United States
*  will support Israel completely, ironclad support if there's a confrontation with Iran. Now that
*  is the traditional American position, but here's a very important thing that has changed that Biden
*  doesn't seem to take into account. Biden managed to get an uneasy truce with Iran and Iranian
*  supported militias in Iraq and Syria, in which the Iranians put pressure on these militias not to
*  attack American bases and troops any further. And for about seven weeks now, we've had no such attacks.
*  So this happened, of course, after they killed three American soldiers and Biden took military
*  action against them. So it was an uneasy truce. It would never have lasted for a very long time.
*  At some point it would start again because these militias wanted to go after American troops and
*  the Iranians held them back. And then Israel goes and violates international law, the Vienna
*  Convention, and bombs the Iranian consulate in Syria, expecting what to happen. Obviously,
*  it would be an escalation. Obviously, one of the most likely things that would happen is that the
*  truce that kept American troops in the region safe would end. And this is now happening. Biden
*  knows this, but instead of putting some pressure on Israel for having put American troops at risk,
*  he goes back and says, ironclad support. We're seeing a repeat of that bear hug from October 8th.
*  The bear hug that in my view was the original sin that led us to a situation in which rather than
*  thinking that he actually builds leverage with Israel, it actually ensured that the Israelis
*  concluded the United States and Biden do not have the courage to use any leverage with Israel. And
*  as a result, they've gone ahead and done exactly what they wanted. And to be frank, they've gotten
*  away with it. Biden has so far never put real material support. There's some rhetorical shifts
*  taking place right now. Those are important as potential precursors of what would happen
*  with a real pressure, but we have yet to see that real pressure.
*  Will Barron What does Hezbollah fit into all of this in terms of what would happen if a
*  non-confrontation began with Iran? Because obviously Hezbollah has a very large presence
*  as an armed force in south Lebanon or the border with Israel. There's a kind of low level conflict
*  going on at the moment. Hezbollah, of course, for those I'm sure people know, aligned with Iran.
*  What do you think would happen there? And how significant a force are they?
*  And what would there be a conflagration there in terms of not just Gaza, but then south Lebanon?
*  Dr. Ali If there is a confrontation between Israel and Iran, that's where I think it would be almost
*  inevitable to also see Hezbollah get dragged into it. If there was a confrontation between
*  Israel and Hezbollah, then it's not as certain as to whether Iran would get dragged into it.
*  But if Iran is already in, I think it's really unlikely that Hezbollah will not get dragged in
*  as well. And what's really, again, important to recognize here, neither Hezbollah nor Iran are
*  looking for this fight for many different reasons, including the fact that Lebanon is an economic
*  mess. Hezbollah has managed to reestablish itself as a Lebanese organization and not just an Iranian
*  proxy. This would shatter that to a large extent. The Lebanese public absolutely do not want this.
*  What the Iranian public doesn't want this for at all. This regime is extremely unpopular inside
*  of Iran. Their economic situation isn't shattered. They're not looking for this fight. I'm not saying
*  that they're not in conflict with Israel. I'm not saying that they are not looking for the
*  confrontation down the future in which they're in a stronger position, but they're not looking for
*  it at this very point. The Israelis are, and again, we talked about the logic of all of this,
*  but Hezbollah is a very formidable force. The Israelis lost the war against them in 2006,
*  after 34 days. Since then, Hezbollah has grown much stronger. Technology has even the playing field.
*  There were no drones used in a large extent in the war in 2006. Drones will be a very critical
*  component of the next war between Israel and Lebanon. Even if Israel had the end of the day
*  were to win it militarily, and one could definitely make the argument that it has
*  scored major victories against Hamas militarily, is Israel better off? You just mentioned the
*  statistics about a plurality of Americans now believing that Israel is committing genocide,
*  which then means that the word genocide is no longer taboo in this conversation. It also means
*  that we've moved way beyond apartheid being a taboo in the Israeli American conversation about
*  Israel. Five years ago or four years ago, that was still extremely controversial. So if you just take
*  a look at it over the course of 10, 15 years, it is impossible to come to the conclusion that
*  Israel is better off or that the trajectory that Israel is on will make it better.
*  Will Barron Just final question. First, I'm interested about Iraq because one of the unintended
*  consequences of American hubris was after the invasion of Iraq. Iraq moved more into the orbit
*  of Iran. I know US strikes in Iraq led to the protests of the Iraqi military and actually they
*  demanded that the US military leave Iraq altogether. So I'm wondering what's going on in terms of Iraq.
*  But finally, what do you think? How big? What would actually be, it's not inevitable, but how
*  do you see and how big a regional conflagration would actually be if this happens?
*  Omer Shai So we talk about Iraq first, the Iraqis
*  understandably having gone through so much devastation in the last 20 years following
*  the US invasion, but also preceding that the UN sanctions and Saddam's dictatorial rule, etc.
*  do not by any stretch of the imagination want to be the arena for an Israeli Iranian fight or for
*  an American Iran. And that is unfortunately, the outcome for a lot of the weaker states in the
*  region, they end up becoming the territory in which the stronger states are fighting their
*  fights in order to avoid having to fight it on their own terms. So it's not surprising at all
*  that the Iraqis are upset both with Iranians and with the Americans at this point, the Iranians
*  have been fighting missiles into northern Iraq, accusing it of hosting or to being, you know,
*  Mossad cells, etc. And of course, the US has been doing the same. And there in the middle is Iraq
*  trying to be a sovereign state in all of this. In regards to a regional congregation, I still think
*  that there may be pathways in which there could be an exchange of fire. I'm not advocating for it,
*  but there could be an exchange of fire that does not lead to major confrontation. The Israeli
*  foreign minister said something quite fascinating yesterday on Twitter in Hebrew and in Persian.
*  He said that if Iran strikes Israel from Iranian territory, then Israel will strike back at Iranian
*  territory. Well, the only way Iran could strike Israel from Iranian territory is if it uses
*  ballistic missiles. Is he putting forward a red line saying if Iran retaliates with ballistic missiles,
*  Israel will escalate further. But if it doesn't strike a ballistic missile, meaning that it would
*  use drones and other things from Syria, then Israel may take that hit, but it will perhaps
*  strike back, but not in an escalatory way. And as a result, both of them will smack each other,
*  but then go back instead of having an all out fight. It could be that that is the message that
*  is being sent. But then hearing what is coming from the administration, Iran clad support, no
*  call for restraint, etc. It does make me worry that even if there are some elements in the Israeli
*  government that doesn't want to go in an all out war, this kind of Iran clad support rhetoric
*  does not do anything to induce restraint on these rates. Fascinating stuff, Trita. And I'll be
*  certainly following your commentary in the coming days and weeks. And I really thoroughly recommend
*  everyone follows, obviously on social media. And because as you can see, we've got someone with a
*  unique vantage point and insight on what's currently unfolding, as well as the horror,
*  obviously, in Gaza. So do share this video, press like and subscribe, leave your comments.
*  But Trita, it's been a big honour. Thanks so much. Thank you so much for having me.
