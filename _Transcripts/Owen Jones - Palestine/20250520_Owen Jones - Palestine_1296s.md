# Gary Lineker DRIVEN OUT By BBC... For Opposing Israel's GENOCIDE
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU)
*  Barry Lineker being forced out of the BBC is a reminder of an iron rule which has prevailed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=0.0s)]
*  ever since Israel began its genocide against the Palestinian people. That the world must be turned [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=5.68s)]
*  on its head. That it's those who oppose one of the most heinous crimes of our age who must be [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=10.96s)]
*  threatened, deplatformed, sacked, silenced, expelled, arrested and even deported while those who support [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  these despicable horrors are treated as respectable newspaper columnists, TV pundits, celebrities, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=21.92s)]
*  politicians and indeed national leaders. If you publicly oppose genocide then you are placing your [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=27.52s)]
*  reputation, your livelihood, your career and even your freedom at risk. You are treated as an [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=33.84s)]
*  extremist. If you support this genocide you are treated as respectable, as moderate and as [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=40.0s)]
*  mainstream. Well history will look back at this perversion of reality with disgust and rightly so [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=45.92s)]
*  and history will also record that the BBC is complicit in genocide. I'd go further than that. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=52.56s)]
*  If the western media have done its job then Israel's genocide would never have been possible. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  If they had just told the truth from the very start and treated that hideous truth with the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=62.96s)]
*  gravity it deserves then western governments would never have been able to get away with arming Israel [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=68.56s)]
*  with offering crucial diplomatic and political support and aid which made this genocide possible. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=73.92s)]
*  The BBC is one of the most important media institutions on earth and it has grotesquely [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=79.28s)]
*  failed in its reporting on Israel's genocide and as such the BBC has helped facilitate genocide. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=84.72s)]
*  That's what it's done. Nobody for even one second believes Gary Lineker has even a particle [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=91.92s)]
*  of antisemitism in him or indeed any other form of hatred. His position on Israel and Palestine [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=96.32s)]
*  hasn't been driven by any form of political radicalism but just a very basic sense of humanity [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=101.2s)]
*  that you should not slaughter, name, bomb, traumatise, impoverish, starve, torture, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=107.52s)]
*  innocent people, mostly women, children and elderly people. It is as straightforward as that. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=111.6s)]
*  Now we're going to past manufactured theories about Gary Lineker and Palestine and those who [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=116.88s)]
*  support Israel's genocidal onslaught have been gunning for one of the BBC's most popular stars [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  ever since he spoke out. Let's discuss the current saga. He's been the match of the day host for over [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=128.24s)]
*  quarter of a century and was due to present next season's FA Cup and the 2026 World Cup. He's now [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=132.96s)]
*  announced he's standing down after a coordinated campaign against him. He hasn't said that but [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  that's what happened. He shared a post as a story on Instagram which featured the brilliant Palestinian [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=142.96s)]
*  Canadian lawyer, Diana Butu, discussing the nature of Zionism, who I have interviewed on this channel. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  The BBC itself should have given a proper platform for Palestinians to discuss an ideology [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=154.16000000000003s)]
*  whose consequences has in practice led them to be repeatedly driven from their land, subjected to [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=159.04s)]
*  mass murder, torture, incarceration, poverty, apartheid, colonisation and now genocide. It has [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=164.64s)]
*  failed to do so. By sharing Butu's words, Gary Lineker was doing a job the BBC should have done. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=170.23999999999998s)]
*  However, the video included an emoji of a rat. There's no question this has anti-Semitic [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  connotations when applied to Jewish people with the Nazis referring to Jews as vermin. It had [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=180.95999999999998s)]
*  nothing to do of course with Diana Butu who again has no form of anti-Semitism attached to [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=186.72s)]
*  her whatsoever. Lineker has already apologised for not noticing this emoji and making clear he'd [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=191.84s)]
*  never have shared it if he had and that he deleted it immediately when it was brought [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=196.96s)]
*  to his attention. Furthermore, let's listen to the video statement that Lineker has published [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=201.04s)]
*  today on Instagram. Hi everyone, some personal news. Last week I shared a post here on Instagram [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=205.92s)]
*  that contained an emoji that has awful connotations. Unfortunately, I did not see the emoji. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=211.68s)]
*  If I had, I would never ever have shared it. The minute I was made aware, I quickly deleted the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=219.36s)]
*  post and went on to make an apology. I would like once again to say I'm sorry unreservedly for the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=225.6s)]
*  hurt and upset caused. It was a genuine mistake and oversight, but I should have been more diligent. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=232.32s)]
*  I know that. I've stood up for minorities and humanitarian issues and against all forms of [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=238.79999999999998s)]
*  racism all of my life, including of course anti-Semitism, which I absolutely abhor. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  There's no place for it and never should be. So I think it's best for all concern that I step [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=251.12s)]
*  down from BBC presenting duties altogether and not do next season's FA Cup or World Cup. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=256.88s)]
*  The final day of the Premier League season on Sunday will be my last show. It's been a pleasure [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=263.36s)]
*  and a huge privilege working with the BBC for 30 years, especially hosting Match of the Day, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=270.16s)]
*  a programme that is so close to my heart and an integral part of my life. I'd like to thank all [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  of the quite brilliant, talented and lovely people both in front and behind the camera that I've [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=281.76s)]
*  worked alongside for three decades. You're an absolute best. The relationship with the BBC [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=287.04s)]
*  has been long and wonderful, but it's the right time for the organisation and myself to go our [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=292.8s)]
*  separate ways. Thank you also to all of you for your incredible support and love over so many years. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=298.88s)]
*  It means the world to me. I'll see you all on Sunday. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=306.24s)]
*  Again, nobody reasonable, nobody reasonable thinks Linneke is anti-Semitic. All that he [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=310.32000000000005s)]
*  would knowingly have shared any post which could imply that Jewish people are vermin is a nonsense. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=316.48s)]
*  It's a lie and it's an excuse to get rid of him. Today, a militantly pro-Israel organisation, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=321.36s)]
*  calling itself the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism, which I'd note has relentlessly targeted [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=326.88s)]
*  opponents of Israel's genocide, has issued a statement taking credit for Linneke being driven [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=331.6s)]
*  out of the BBC. Their press release is headlined, Gary Linneke Quits BBC Following CAA Action, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=336.56s)]
*  stating Gary Linneke is reportedly departing to the BBC following complaints to the broadcaster [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=342.56s)]
*  from Campaign Against Anti-Semitism. Just who are these doughty campaigners against racism? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=348.56s)]
*  Last January, they published a tweet which read, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=353.52s)]
*  Thinking of visiting Sadiq Khan's London, this is what you can expect to see. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=355.92s)]
*  The first frame of the attached video is an Islamist flag. This wasn't so much of a dog [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=359.68s)]
*  whistle as a foghorn. Here is an example of the world being turned on its head. These are the [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=364.0s)]
*  sorts of people who are treated as somehow being authorities on racism, targeting the likes of [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=374.24s)]
*  Linneke as being the ones who are really guilty of racism. In their clearly delighted statement, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=380.72s)]
*  they state, Gary Linneke could have been the deslinum of our generation. Instead, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=386.32s)]
*  he transformed in front of the nation's eyes into Mr. Not-So-Nice Guy, an egotist who mistook [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=390.64s)]
*  celebrity for moral authority, a divisive figure who used his fame to inflame. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=396.64s)]
*  The absolute cheek of these moral disgraces. Gary Linneke is apparently Mr. Not-So-Nice Guy [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=402.64s)]
*  because he opposes the mass slaughter of little children. He used his fame to inflame because he [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=407.03999999999996s)]
*  called for mass butchery to end. Mass butchery which has led the International Criminal Court, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=412.0s)]
*  to which this country is a signatory member, to issue arrest warrants for war crimes and crimes [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=416.15999999999997s)]
*  against humanity against Israeli leadership. And a consensus amongst genocide scholars that Israel [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=420.48s)]
*  is committing genocide, including two, sorry not two, multiple Israeli scholars of genocide. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=426.0s)]
*  Like Raz Segal, Omar Batov. As I say, the world turned on its head. Their suggestion that Linneke [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=436.96000000000004s)]
*  has been transformed in front of the nation's eyes is based on nonsense. The polling shows [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=443.92s)]
*  that the British public decisively opposed Israel's onslaught from the very beginning, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=448.0s)]
*  that a huge majority support an arms embargo on Israel, that they believe Israel has committed [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=452.16s)]
*  war crimes and that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should be arrested for war crimes [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=457.12s)]
*  and crimes against humanity. Linneke's views are the mainstream views of the British public, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=461.28s)]
*  while the views on Israel and Palestine of the so-called campaign against anti-Semitism [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=466.16s)]
*  leading figures are fringe opinions. Now let's consider past so-called controversies [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=470.8s)]
*  involving Gary Linneke and Palestine. In November 2023, he shared a clip of my interview with [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=474.64s)]
*  Raz Segal, a brilliant Israeli-American associate professor of genocide and Holocaust studies. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=479.84s)]
*  In that clip, Segal explained based on his expertise, based on his scholarly research [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=485.36s)]
*  and understanding why Israel's onslaught was, in his view, a textbook genocide. Linneke [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=490.15999999999997s)]
*  quote tweeted that clip, adding simply, worth 13 minutes of anyone's time. That didn't cause a [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=495.52s)]
*  furore in the British media. One example was an article in the Times newspaper, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=500.24s)]
*  headlined BBC staff's anger after Gary Linneke shares Israel-Gaza genocide video. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=504.0s)]
*  The article included the following, the post caused dismay among BBC staff. One raised concerns that [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=508.72s)]
*  it would be bloody awful for any Jewish colleagues that have to work with Linneke. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=514.0s)]
*  It's pretty shit for any Jew having to work with quite a few folk here. Right now, they added. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=517.76s)]
*  This was frankly insane. Why should Gary Linneke sharing the thoughts of a Jewish-Israeli-American [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=522.16s)]
*  academic specialist in genocide and Holocaust studies represent some sort of attack or threat [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=527.68s)]
*  to Jewish people? This entire narrative is based on the shameless, overt conflation of Jewish people [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=532.64s)]
*  and the state of Israel. Ever since the genocide began, pro-Israel cheerleaders have not even tried [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=538.4799999999999s)]
*  to pretend they believe in a demarcation between Israel, the state, and Jewish people as a whole. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=543.76s)]
*  This is dangerous. It is irresponsible. And what's more, it's transparently anti-Semitic. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=550.3199999999999s)]
*  After this, Linneke said in an interview with Zetio, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=556.4s)]
*  It's the worst thing I've seen in my lifetime. Constant images day in, day out of children losing [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=559.12s)]
*  their lives, but the minute you raise your voice against it, you get accused of being a supporter [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=563.04s)]
*  of Hamas. Indeed, anyone and everyone who speaks out about Palestine faces being smeared as a bare [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=567.04s)]
*  minimum. He also said in that interview that there's a lot of heavy lobbying on people to be quiet. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=571.92s)]
*  That's the truth. Anyone and everyone who speaks out about Palestine faces being smeared as a bare [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=576.16s)]
*  minimum again and pressured to go silent. Since then, Dario Linneke has taught the BBC a basic [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=581.04s)]
*  lesson in journalism. Listen to this from an interview with Amal Rajan, who is one of the [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=586.56s)]
*  presenters on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. You could be partial. I know where I stand on this. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=590.8s)]
*  I'm sorry, it's more important than what the BBC, what's going on there is, you know, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=596.8s)]
*  the mass murder of thousands of children is probably something that we should have a little [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=603.1999999999999s)]
*  opinion on. The BBC as a whole needs to be impartial about it. Why? It needs to be factual. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=607.76s)]
*  It needs to be impartial about conflict, doesn't it? And it's hard. It wasn't impartial about [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=614.8s)]
*  Ukraine and Russia. And you might say that the- Why does it have to be impartial about? I understand [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=620.8s)]

*  something that's going on that far away, why does it- Because the Israeli position is that [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=632.1600000000001s)]
*  what is happening in Gaza, and by the way, I'm not here as an advocate of the Israeli government, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=637.7600000000001s)]
*  but the Israeli position is that what is happening in Gaza is a response to the slaughter [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=641.9200000000001s)]
*  and capture of innocent Israelis on October the 7th. Which was awful, which was truly awful. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=646.4000000000001s)]
*  And that full context needs to be there when discussing what's going on in Palestine. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=652.4000000000001s)]
*  But that's not the full context, is it? Because the full context starts way before October the 7th, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=655.2800000000001s)]
*  doesn't it? It sounds like you think the BBC isn't a complete mess on impartiality. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=660.32s)]
*  No, I don't think the BBC is a mess. I think the BBC has- It's very difficult. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=664.0s)]
*  I think the BBC generally does a really good job of it, but it's not always easy. I think [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=669.0400000000001s)]
*  facts are the most important thing that they- It's like that old thing, isn't it? If it's [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=676.88s)]
*  raining outside, you don't need someone's opinion to say it's not raining. What you want to see [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=681.5200000000001s)]
*  is actually what is the weather outside. So I understand why it's so difficult for the BBC, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=686.72s)]
*  and it really is. And I feel for the people at the top because the amount of lobbying that will be [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=693.12s)]
*  going on and from people with, that aren't very impartial, must be immense. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=698.8000000000001s)]
*  What he does here is reject the idea that impartiality means being neutral about the [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=706.24s)]
*  mass murder of thousands of children, arguing this is probably something that we should have [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=709.9200000000001s)]
*  a little opinion on. When Rajan said that the BBC needed to be impartial, Linnecke rightly [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=714.08s)]
*  responded it needed to be factual and referred to a famous quote about journalism which says, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=718.4000000000001s)]
*  if someone says it's raining and another person says it's dry, it's not your job to quote them [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=722.64s)]
*  both. Your job is to look out the fucking window and find out which is true. He further noted the [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=726.88s)]
*  BBC wasn't impartial about Russia and Ukraine, and here's a crucial point. There are those who say, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=731.6s)]
*  well actually Linnecke as a BBC employee should be neutral or someone who works for the BBC. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=735.9200000000001s)]
*  Firstly, he's a sports presenter, not a politics journalist, and the BBC's guidelines were changed [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=741.6s)]
*  in 2023 to allow for personal views to be expressed that aren't party political. Secondly, would a [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=745.84s)]
*  sports presenter sharing content opposing Russia's invasion of Ukraine suffer this sort of outrage and [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=751.12s)]
*  these sorts of consequences, or condemning Russia's behaviour? Would they? You know they wouldn't. Well, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=756.0s)]
*  you all know they wouldn't. What about taking a position on the climate emergency? The point there [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=760.8s)]
*  is that there is a consensus amongst climate scientists, just as there is a consensus amongst [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=765.1999999999999s)]
*  genocide scholars about Israel's genocide. As for the BBC's coverage, what it has done from the [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=770.08s)]
*  beginning is take the fact that Hamas committed atrocities on the 7th of October as a fact, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=774.8000000000001s)]
*  but never once treated Israel's atrocities as such. It has continually treated official [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=780.5600000000001s)]
*  Israeli claims as credible in a way it would never dream of doing with official Russian claims, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=785.6800000000001s)]
*  despite overwhelming evidence of Israel lying over and over and over again. And indeed, it is [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=789.9200000000001s)]
*  often framed entire stories around Israeli claims. It has whitewashed crimes and ignored crimes [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=795.6s)]
*  altogether. It not only failed to frame its coverage around the incessant statements of [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=800.4s)]
*  genocidal and criminal intent made by Israeli leaders and officials from the beginning, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=805.44s)]
*  it often didn't cover those statements at all. It hasn't even tried to pretend that it treats [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=809.44s)]
*  Palestinian life as having even a fraction of the worth of Israeli life. It has failed to join the [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=814.64s)]
*  dots in terms of what Israel is objectively doing, such as deliberate starvation. It has failed to [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=820.24s)]
*  give proper space to Palestinian voices. When it does, it continually puts them in the dock, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=824.88s)]
*  as though they are guilty of crimes, often treating Palestinian civilian voices as though [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=829.4399999999999s)]
*  they are to be prosecuted more aggressively than official Israeli leaders and so on. It has failed [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=834.4s)]
*  to put the facts about international law at the forefront of its coverage. We could go on. But [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=840.24s)]
*  when the BBC actually broadcast a documentary about the truth about the crimes committed by Israel [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=844.0s)]
*  and Gaza, it was removed because the child narrator turned out to be the son of a Hamas [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=848.64s)]
*  deputy agricultural minister. A technocratic position, but in any case irrelevant because [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=852.64s)]
*  this was the narrator, the words weren't written by the child in question. They've now refused to [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=857.36s)]
*  broadcast a subsequent film about Israel's systematic destruction of Gaza's healthcare system. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=861.76s)]
*  Basement Films, which produces it, issued a statement saying, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=867.12s)]
*  We are doubtful that our film Investigating Attacks on Hospitals and Medics in Gaza, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=871.04s)]

*  one of their most beloved stars because he opposed Israel's genocidal onslaught and some of the most [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=904.24s)]
*  grievous atrocities humans can possibly commit. At the same time, they refused to give actual space [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=908.96s)]

*  is deemed to be unacceptable because of his views, consider this individual. Some of you may be aware [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=919.52s)]
*  that I wrote a detailed investigative report focusing on BBC Online's courage of Israel's genocide [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=924.0s)]
*  published by the brilliant Dropsite News in December 2024. I discussed a meeting by BBC [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=929.84s)]
*  staff in which they raised concerns directly to Tim Davey, Director General of the BBC. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=934.48s)]
*  Let me read directly from that piece, in which they discussed the role of a powerful individual [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=938.96s)]
*  named Robbie Gibb, one of five people who serve on the BBC's editorial guidelines and standards [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=943.2s)]
*  committee, along with Director General Tim Davey, BBC News CEO Deborah Turness, the Chairman of the [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=948.08s)]
*  Arts Council Nicola Sirota and BBC Chair Samir Shah. Gibb is charged with helping to define the BBC's [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=953.6800000000001s)]
*  commitment to impartiality and to respond to complaints about the BBC's coverage on Israel [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=959.6800000000001s)]
*  and Palestine, but its ultra partisan record speaks for itself. The brother of a former [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=963.68s)]
*  Conservative minister, he is a veteran of the revolving door between Britain's worlds of media [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=968.0s)]
*  and politics. In his 30s, Gibb was the Chief of Staff for Conservative MP Francis Maude, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=973.04s)]
*  before becoming Deputy Political Editor of Newsnight, the BBC's flagship current affairs show [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=978.4s)]
*  and later editor of BBC politics programmes. Between 2017 and 2019, he served as Director [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=983.8399999999999s)]
*  of the Conservative Party for the Conservative Party, and was knighted by her upon her resignation. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=989.12s)]
*  In 2020, Gibb also led a consortium to rescue the Jewish Chronicle from bankruptcy. In 2021, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=994.32s)]
*  Gibb returned to the BBC, joining its board as a non-executive director. In 2022, former senior [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=999.44s)]
*  BBC journalist Emily Maitlis described Gibb as an active agent of the Conservative Party, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1005.52s)]
*  who shaped the broadcaster's coverage by acting as the arbiter of BBC impartiality. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1010.08s)]
*  Similarly, Lewis Goodall, her colleague, said editors told him to be careful, Robby is watching [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1014.48s)]
*  you. Gibb's deep involvement in the Jewish Chronicle continued after he took up his BBC role. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1019.04s)]
*  In the November 2023 BBC Declaration of Personal Interest, he declared he was the 100% owner of the [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1024.24s)]
*  newspaper before being replaced by a venture capitalist in August 2024. One former Jewish [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1029.76s)]
*  Chronicle journalist declared that since the change in ownership, the paper has read more like a [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1034.88s)]
*  propaganda sheet for Benjamin Netanyahu, and that Gibb regularly appeared in the office to check up [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1038.96s)]
*  on what stories were topping the news list and offering a view. Since the acquisition, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1043.52s)]

*  October 2023. In one example, he tweeted a video of a £2,000 bomb exploding in Gaza City with a [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1056.0s)]
*  caption, Onwards to Victory, before deleting with no apology. In September 2024, four Jewish Chronicle [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1062.32s)]
*  columnists resigned in protest after the paper published a story that included fabricated quotes [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1067.84s)]
*  from Israeli officials with one declaring that too often the J.C. reads like a partisan, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1072.64s)]
*  ideological instrument, its judgement is political rather than journalistic. Four Israelis, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1077.1200000000001s)]
*  including an aide to Netanyahu, were subsequently arrested on charges of falsifying and distributing [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1081.5200000000002s)]
*  fabricated documents of the Jewish Chronicle and Germany's largest newspaper build. In September, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1086.48s)]
*  the Muslim Council of Britain wrote a letter expressing concern with Gibb's position on the [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1091.5200000000002s)]

*  Standards Organisation. At that May meeting, BBC journalists had emphasised that Gibb's agenda [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1104.0s)]
*  was widely understood in British media circles, referring to his links to the Jewish Chronicle [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1109.04s)]
*  and noting its right-wing partisan orientation and slavish pro-Israel stance. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1113.52s)]
*  As I keep saying, the world has turned on its head. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1119.28s)]
*  Guy Lineker is considered to be unacceptable as a sports presenter, but Robbie Gibb is considered [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1122.72s)]
*  as acceptable as an actually deeply influential figure in BBC coverage. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1127.6s)]
*  Here's a final message to those who have hounded Gary Lineker out of his job, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1133.04s)]
*  who are no doubt celebrating. You have lost. You have lost the battle for public opinion in the [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1136.48s)]
*  West, which long ago was defined by revulsion at Israel's murderous actions. You know that even [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1141.76s)]
*  former cheerleaders of Israel are publicly turning against it as they realise the scale of the crime [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1147.28s)]
*  is impossible to defend. You know that in time, both the media and government will be forced [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1152.08s)]
*  to reflect the actual monstrous truth and to act on it. And you also know deep down that this crime [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1157.12s)]
*  is too depraved, too extreme, too deranged, too shameless, too unapologetic and too documented to [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1162.8799999999999s)]
*  get away with. You know that there will be a reckoning that those who supported this [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1168.32s)]
*  abomination will, within their lifetimes, face the consequences of their actions. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1172.32s)]
*  And you know that the judgement of history will be devastating. All you have for comfort in the [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1176.56s)]
*  here and now is the sculpts of the people you've deprived of careers, reputations and freedom, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1180.4799999999998s)]
*  and the mass slaughter of Palestinians who don't even pretend to consider to be human beings. You [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1186.24s)]
*  are monsters. And in time, that will be the consensus, politically and indeed legally. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1190.88s)]
*  That's what matters here, the crime being committed. Apologies for Israel's genocide think by [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1196.24s)]
*  making examples, they confide in everybody into being silent. And there's no question that many [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1200.32s)]
