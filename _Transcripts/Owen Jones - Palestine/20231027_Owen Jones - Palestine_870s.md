# Keir Starmer IN CRISIS Over Gaza
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DkKWzcUhng)
*  Firstly, a well done to you for those who have marched against Israel's onslaught against Gaza,
*  for those who've written to their MPs, for those who've posted about what's going on,
*  using whatever platform, however big or small you have, sharing videos, articles,
*  not least platforming voices from Gaza itself, whatever you've done, no matter how big nor small,
*  the pressure is paying off. Now, our government arms and supports Israel,
*  that's why we are directly complicit in what's currently unfolding in Gaza, the horror,
*  and that's without even talking about the historic role of British colonialism in the least in all of this.
*  Now, we want to force the government's position to change away from the unquestioning support of Israel,
*  that's the very least that we're fighting for in the current calamity.
*  And the first step to doing that is to force the Labour opposition to abandon its support for a military onslaught
*  which has killed over 7,000 people, including over 2,700 kids, with many others trapped under the rubble.
*  Now, communications have been blocked in Gaza, the fear has to be now that the worst is to come.
*  Now, at the moment, the Conservatives know they have carte blanche to let basically Israel do whatever it wants,
*  because the opposition isn't putting it under any pressure.
*  Now, if the opposition did take a stand, it would galvanise public opinion,
*  because the polling shows overwhelming support for a ceasefire, just needs leadership to give it, to put pressure on the government.
*  And so, Labour changing its stance, some people go, well, it's the opposition, why does it matter?
*  Because it will put massive pressure on the government, given where public opinion is currently at.
*  Now, because of people like those watching or listening to this, Keir Starmer is now under huge pressure with a big revolt in the Labour Party.
*  Before I talk through that revolt, here I was on Storm Huntley's show on Channel 5,
*  discussing Starmer's support for war crimes and deceit over it, which is what triggered this revolt in the first place.
*  Well, it's important to say he lied there, by the way.
*  I know we're saying he clarified his comments, but what he said, and we can hear with our own ears,
*  is he said Israel has the right to cut off water and electricity.
*  He then went on to talk about international law, but he either, as a human rights liar, slightly unfortunate,
*  either his lack of understanding of international law, which prohibits collective punishment,
*  that's Article 3 of the Geneva Convention, or he was being dishonest.
*  And so, when he then later said, he never said that Israel had the right to cut off water and electricity,
*  it is important as journalists that we don't allow politicians to gaslight people and pretend they didn't say things that they did.
*  He did say that.
*  In terms of his position now, look, what we're seeing is a grave war crime, and we're seeing collective punishment,
*  thousands of people dead, many of them children, under rubble.
*  There's a thousand people that are, I believe, trapped under rubble.
*  We don't know if they're alive or dead.
*  The mass destruction of the health system there, which is imploding,
*  there's people drinking from ivy drips because they don't have any clean water anymore.
*  The fact that the Labour Party is unable to call for a ceasefire, to call for the violence to end,
*  is, in my view, a moral catastrophe.
*  And if you look at the polling, only 3% of people in this country oppose an immediate ceasefire,
*  which is the same number, by the way, who think the earth is flat.
*  But that is the position of the Labour Party and the Conservatives.
*  Now, more than 20 Labour councillors have resigned in protest,
*  the party's lost control of Oxford City Council as a consequence, in fact.
*  Nearly a quarter of Labour MPs have called for a ceasefire, including two front benches,
*  which they're not actually supposed to be allowed to do, but neither have been fired,
*  striking that they're both Muslim, Labour front benches.
*  I think the Labour leadership realises how much fury there is in the Muslim community,
*  obviously way beyond the Muslim community.
*  Many non-Muslims, myself included, who are furious about what's currently happening,
*  that it would be seen as a massive, massive F-U in a very febrile circumstance.
*  I mean, we had Kyrsten Amr visiting an Islamic centre in the most manipulative way possible,
*  leading to that centre issuing a statement condemning him and expressing their dismay
*  for how that visit was manipulated.
*  But the leadership keeps refusing to support a ceasefire.
*  They keep calling for things like more humanitarian aid, which is just PR for them,
*  it's just reputational damage limitation. It's a nonsense.
*  The cause of humanitarian catastrophe is the violence.
*  And the idea that you can effectively distribute aid when such a tiny strip of land
*  is being pummeled by a military superpower is completely and utterly deranged.
*  So what they did is wait for the US and the Conservatives to shift to call for a humanitarian pause,
*  or humanitarian pauses to allow an aid.
*  This is also a nonsense because what that means is pause the bombing, get the aid in,
*  then what, bomb the aid, and bomb the people using the aid, killing them all over again.
*  Now, in any case, what's happening, because of the pressure built up by people like yourselves,
*  the dam is bursting.
*  Sadiq Khan, the Labour Mayor of London, has come out to call for a ceasefire.
*  And that has been followed by Anna Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader as well.
*  Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, as well as other local mayors in Manchester as well.
*  There have been talk of resignations on the Labour front bench about Khan.
*  Well, a few journalists have actually been covering this story with, I would say, integrity.
*  Spoke of resignations, potential resignations.
*  Overnight, at least two shadow ministers were considering resigning to Dale this weekend over Kirsten Island,
*  not calling for a ceasefire.
*  A source close to the situation told me that as soon as one sat down, more would immediately follow.
*  But that now has been postponed, apparently, because of the likes of Sadiq Khan and others coming out in favour of a ceasefire.
*  So they think they're winning.
*  I think that's cowardice.
*  Obviously, if they resigned, that would make it much more likely to put more pressure on the Labour leadership.
*  But I think maybe time to find a backbone and maybe prioritise saving innocent people from a catastrophe
*  rather than your own ministerial careers.
*  In any case, you can't dismiss the left.
*  The Labour leadership is completely out of sync with the vast majority of Labour voters and members.
*  Now, this whole crisis is a case study and just how deceitful and duplicitous Kirsten is actually is.
*  Back as the New Statesman notes, in 2015, when he selected his Labour candidate for his seat,
*  he spoke on a panel of the Kandan-Palestinian Solidarity Campaign.
*  I mean, the idea he didn't go near that now is absurd.
*  In front of a slogan, kick Israeli racism out of FIFA.
*  In the 2020 campaign video, he had to convince members to vote for a difficult leader.
*  It featured protesters waving Palestinian flags.
*  Now, pledge for his leadership campaign, put human rights at the heart of foreign policy.
*  Where do you even begin?
*  Now, given the level of deceit underpinning his entire leadership campaign,
*  the abandonment of all his key promises, he is, though, certain to become prime minister.
*  The concerted have destroyed themselves.
*  But I just believe that the sheer level of dishonesty and duplicity will at some point have to collide with political reality.
*  Now, pressure has to be placed on Labour, not simply to back a ceasefire,
*  but to address the underlying causes of this entire horror.
*  Now, I spoke about that earlier on Channel 5.
*  Leadership from Labour.
*  That's what Labour needs to be offering right now, leadership.
*  And that means not pretending that the horrors that we're witnessing began on 7th October.
*  That means dealing with the underlying problem, which is what's happened to the Palestinian people, which is...
*  Which is what the UN tried to say and has been criticised quite heavily for that.
*  Well, that just shows how extreme the Israeli government is, and they are extremely...
*  I mean, they've got overtly far-right ministers in that government, including Benjamin Netanyahu.
*  The United Nations Secretary General made it clear that you cannot address this without dealing with the occupation,
*  illegally, of Palestinian land, the siege of Gaza that's been going on, obviously, for so long,
*  the apartheid, which has been defined by human rights organisations,
*  the deprivation of the right of Palestinians to basic rights at the hands of an illegal Israeli occupation.
*  What was that? A ceasefire? Then what? So I spoke about that as well.
*  The cause of the humanitarian disaster is a military superpower pummeling a densely concentrated area
*  the size of East London with thousands and thousands of bombs.
*  Could we just get back to...
*  Until there's a ceasefire...
*  Owen, could we just get back to my point?
*  Then we won't end the humanitarian disaster.
*  Okay, let's say they give them a ceasefire. Then what?
*  None of you are saying what happens when there is a ceasefire.
*  What do you want to happen at that point? You think Hamas is just going to come out waving a white flag?
*  What do you want to happen?
*  We want to end the underlying basis of why we're in this mess in the first place,
*  which is the decades-old oppression of the Palestinian people.
*  The fact that they've been occupied and besieged...
*  Let's get close because we've got back into the conflict...
*  Now, don't just listen to me. Listen to that well-known left-leaning subversive, John Sowers,
*  the former MI5 head, who says that Israel must know that destroying Hamas is beyond its reach.
*  Lots I don't agree with in the Financial Times article he's written,
*  but it makes the point that military solution to Hamas is not going to happen.
*  Look, I mean, just look at any precedent.
*  I mean, Iraq was a striking example where it was claimed that Saddam Hussein was in cahoots with al-Qaeda,
*  which was a nonsense. It took the invasion of Iraq to turn Iraq into a playground for al-Qaeda,
*  and then you've got the rise of al-Qaeda and then a massive counterinsurgency campaign against them in the 2000s.
*  And, you know, they were defeated, supposedly, but there's a lack of imagination there
*  because they were replaced by something which was even more extreme, ISIS.
*  Which then conquered large swathes of Syria and Iraq, and again, you had a massive counterinsurgency in Mosul,
*  which devastated Mosul, had thousands of deaths.
*  And the clear difference there is, you know, Mosul was occupied.
*  I mean, the level of public acquiescence in Mosul for ISIS was much lower because we're talking here
*  in the case of decades of occupation and a much, you know, more entrenched context in that sense.
*  Now, people keep talking about the hostages, about the need to rescue the hostages.
*  That's why there can't be a ceasefire. I mean, I just don't even know how to engage with that.
*  But do people really, really think that hostages are going to be rescued if Gaza is flattened?
*  If people want to call support this military onslaught, then find some other rationales,
*  which at least make some sort of logical sense.
*  You don't really think the hostages are going to be saved, do you, if Gaza is invaded and flattened?
*  You know, obviously, we don't know for sure, because it's Hamas,
*  but Hamas have claimed that several of those hostages have already been killed.
*  You know, it is credible, given the thousands of bombs which have been dropped on a tiny strip of land.
*  But in any case, a prisoner exchange has to be a basis for saving those hostages.
*  There are many Palestinians who are incarcerated without trial, including children.
*  We have to talk about that. It's not going to be popular, but we have to talk about that.
*  As well as, frankly, you know, the mass in terms of ground invasion,
*  I know people aren't thinking in terms of the establishment about the worth of Palestinian human life,
*  but they do matter to some of us.
*  And already nearly six times as many Palestinians have died in the last few weeks as Israelis who were killed by Hamas,
*  which is the beginning of all of this particular episode.
*  And that will only multiply, obviously, with more devastating airstrikes and ground invasion,
*  without even talking about possible regional conflicts or the mass death and misery.
*  There has to be a political solution.
*  Now, the massacre that is going on was defended on the basis of self-defense,
*  but no one would ever say, well, the mass slaughter of Palestinians over the years.
*  In fact, 96% of Palestinians in the last 15 years before this October were Palestinians.
*  People wouldn't say, well, they have to do something. They have to do something, don't they?
*  And so, you know, the facts, you can't even make that argument.
*  You know, so, you know, why?
*  The argument is always the occupier must have the right to self-defense,
*  but the occupied can never have the right to that self-defense.
*  If they're attacked and they try and respond, people go, no, that's not the way.
*  This is violence. You can't possibly do that.
*  But if Israel launches a military assault, wiping out huge numbers of people,
*  then that's seen as justified and self-defense.
*  Now, it was put to me that Hamas want to wipe Israel off the map,
*  and that's why there can be no lasting peace. Here's how I answered that.
*  They got nothing in exchange for it.
*  And the desperation of so many in Gaza drove people into the hands of Hamas.
*  And actually a lot of evidence suggests Benjamin Netanyahu promoted Hamas,
*  and then Haaretz, an Israeli newspaper, has a lot of evidence to suggest that,
*  to divide the national movement. That's what's important.
*  I'm going to go back.
*  I mean, that is the point, really, that I think is the nub of the issue,
*  which is that it's Israel at the moment which has occupied and oppressed the Palestinian people for decades.
*  That is at the root of this catastrophe.
*  Now, the final point I would want to make is we've been here before.
*  Actually, lots of people out there remember Iraq, and it was New Labour who brought us into Iraq.
*  They browbeat us at the time, if you oppose the Iraq War, you're basically a stooge of Saddam Hussein.
*  And it was a catastrophe. And Afghanistan was a catastrophe. And Libya was a catastrophe.
*  And people who opposed those disastrous interventions were all vilified at the time.
*  And we got nothing out of the vindication because of the horror that ensued.
*  But this is the same thing all over again. I think this will be the undoing of Keir Starmer in the end.
*  Not now. He'll become prime minister. But he promised in his leadership election to put human rights at the centre of all.
*  That's interesting.
*  There's no pleasure in vindication. All we have to show for that vindication is blood, blood and more blood.
*  We know this is a catastrophe. I think many of us deep down in our bones know that a military onslaught continuing
*  will only unleash more human misery and disaster. Pressure is paying off. We've got to keep building it.
*  And this is a matter of life and death. Labour already buckling.
*  I think we can build pressure to make them buckle and then we can work on making the government buckle.
*  But it means we've got to keep marching. We've got to keep protesting.
*  We've got to keep using our voices, social media, elsewhere, talking to people around us, because otherwise the consequences.
*  Well, we'll be paying for them for many generations to come.
