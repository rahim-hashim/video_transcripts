# BANNING Of Palestine Action In UK Should TERRIFY You
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8)
*  The British government's decision to ban Palestine action and anti-terror legislation, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=0.0s)]
*  putting a non-violent protest movement in the same legal bracket literally as ISIS should [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=4.96s)]
*  absolutely terrify you. It represents a crucial landmark in Britain's descent into naked [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=11.6s)]
*  authoritarianism in and of itself, in combination with other deeply disturbing developments, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=16.96s)]
*  I'll discuss those. It shows exactly what the direction of travel is in this country, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=21.36s)]
*  which is the criminalisation of resistance to the involvement of Britain in genocide and more [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=25.92s)]
*  broadly the crushing of our hard-won democratic freedoms. Let's be clear here, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=29.68s)]
*  Palestine Action are a direct action movement. They stand in the very long proud tradition [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=36.4s)]
*  in this country of direct action and civil disobedience which help secure many of the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=41.6s)]
*  rights and freedoms we take for granted today. That's not a history we talk about to celebrate [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  as much as we should or anywhere near it because our rulers try to stop us doing that because they [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=51.28s)]
*  fear we might want to emulate our ancestors' behaviour. Palestine Action are not terrorists, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=56.48s)]
*  prescribing them as a terrorist organisation as though they are ISIS is completely deranged [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=64.08s)]
*  behaviour. ISIS kill people, they actually behead people and amongst other atrocities, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=70.64s)]
*  we all know about those. Palestine Action do things like smash up machinery and arms [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=77.67999999999999s)]
*  factories in opposition to British direct involvement in genocidal extermination, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=81.84s)]
*  as well as spraying Gaza is not for sale and Donald Trump's golf course, more lately breaking [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=86.0s)]
*  into RAF Price Norton to spray paint two planes. That's what has prompted the prescription which [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=90.56s)]
*  the government is rushing through. These are activists who, unlike the terrorists rightly [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=98.88s)]
*  conjured up in your heads, are opposed to killing people. They're trying to stop people being killed. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  It's the exact opposite of what terrorists are understood to do. Indeed it's the Israeli state [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=108.4s)]
*  perpetrating terrorism on a mass scale, state terrorism against the Palestinian people, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=113.67999999999999s)]
*  but of course terrorism has long been redefined to exclude the mass violence perpetrated by the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  West and its allies. Vette Cooper, our Home Secretary, who is a soulless political robot, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=122.88s)]
*  said in her statement, the disgraceful attack on Price Norton in the early hours of the morning [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=128.0s)]
*  on Friday 20th June is the latest in a long history of unacceptable criminal action [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  committed by Palestine Action. The UK's defence enterprise is vital to the nation's national [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=136.24s)]
*  security and this government will not tolerate those that put that security at risk. I say [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=142.56s)]
*  Vette Cooper, she didn't write that. One of her aides wrote that. Now we should note of course [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=146.96s)]
*  the likes of the suffragettes were demonised and they actually were far far more militant [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=155.12s)]
*  than Palestine Action because they killed people, they blew things up, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  they smashed up art galleries, but they actually bombed things. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=168.24s)]
*  Vette Cooper has stood up in parliament dressed in the clothing of the suffragettes. She has [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=172.56s)]
*  literally worn the garbs of a far more extreme in terms of tactics, a movement far more extreme [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=181.28s)]
*  than Palestine Action. Those people were demonised and hated at the time, they were portrayed as [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=191.76s)]
*  terrorists. But how did history judge the suffragettes and how does history judge those [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=197.44s)]
*  who persecuted them? Well Vette, maybe look up some history before you wear the garbs of people [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=204.88s)]
*  who actually fought against injustice at the time when it was hard rather than when history took a [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=213.2s)]
*  different view. Let's just hear some of this guff, excellently torn apart by Zoe Gardner who [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=220.0s)]
*  does particularly excellent work on the rights of migrants and refugees. She was on LBC alongside [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=224.96s)]
*  the former Labour MP Luciana Berger. And Palestine Action have been involved in a sustained aggressive [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=229.36s)]
*  broad campaign that undermines the rule of British law and undermines Britain's national security. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=234.88s)]
*  They've engaged in 356 direct attacks to the tune of Â£55 million worth of damage and underneath [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=239.60000000000002s)]
*  our terrorism act they've met all the conditions which are very tightly laid out which means that [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=246.16s)]
*  they are now and have been as we've heard from the Home Secretary earlier today prescribed. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=251.44s)]
*  Zoe Gardner. I mean absolutely terrifying to hear that. I think we really need to take a step back [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=254.56s)]
*  from the concept of whether we agree or not with their aims and ask ourselves is this terrorism, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=259.84s)]
*  is the intention of this to sow terror? Absolutely not. Absolutely not. And this is not even the thin [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=265.52s)]
*  end anymore of that wedge. I think this is a serious threat to our civil liberties. I think [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=272.16s)]
*  it is quite clear and if you would just indulge me for a second I did make a very short list of a [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=278.8s)]
*  couple of other instances where this same type of action of attempting to disarm RAF jets has been [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=282.8s)]
*  taken in the past in 1996. Four women vandalised an RAF jet preventing its travel to Indonesia [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=288.56s)]
*  for complicity in the East Timor genocide. They were found not guilty. In 2003 activists sabotaged [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=294.8s)]
*  fuel tankers to disrupt US warplanes reaching Iraq. It was Keir Starmer who was the lawyer who [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=300.24s)]
*  defended them on the basis that they were acting for the greater good to prevent war crimes from [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=304.96000000000004s)]
*  taking place. And in 2017 two activists attempted to disarm Typhoon jets to prevent them reaching [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=309.12s)]
*  Saudi Arabia and to take part in war crimes in Yemen and they were again found not guilty on the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=314.0s)]
*  basis that they were attempting to prevent war crimes which is the true intention actually of [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=318.8s)]
*  this group. It is not their intention to intimidate or to damage national security. It is their [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=322.16s)]
*  intention to prevent war crimes from taking place which are taking place. And while we can agree that [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=325.76s)]
*  they took the matters into their own hands, they knew they were committing criminal damage, they [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=329.84000000000003s)]
*  knew they were committing vandalism and they should be charged under those times. The idea that they [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=333.84000000000003s)]
*  are terrorists and that I now for expressing my support for them could face serious terrorist [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=337.92s)]
*  charges up to 14 years in jail is a terrifying escalation and abuse of state power and we should [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=343.28000000000003s)]
*  not stand for it for a second. Well indeed, some crucial points made there by Zerri Gardner. Firstly [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=348.8s)]
*  this abuse of the so-called you know the term terrorism. In another life I worked in the office [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=354.08000000000004s)]
*  of the veteran left-wing Labour MP John McDonnell. The first week I started work in his office was [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=359.84000000000003s)]
*  November 2005 when Tony Blair was trying to introduce 90 days detention. And in fact I [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=364.8s)]
*  started on quite the week because that turned out to be the first parliamentary defeat suffered by [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=370.40000000000003s)]
*  New Labour since it came to power in 1997. Not because I turned up as much as I'd like to suggest [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=373.84000000000003s)]
*  there's a correlation there. The point made consistently in that period during New Labour's [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=379.52000000000004s)]
*  anti-terror legislation is that it would be used and abused to crack down on civil liberties when [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=383.92s)]
*  the threat of terrorism wasn't even relevant. Nobody actually thinks Palestine Act is a terrorist [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=388.88s)]
*  organisation. I mean it's just a lie. Nobody actually thinks they're terrorists. Anti-terrorism [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=393.44s)]
*  legislation has been used against them opportunistically but no one actually thinks they're terrorists. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=400.32s)]
*  They might say they think it, they're lying through their fucking arses, I'm sorry to swear. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=404.88s)]
*  It's absolutely true that Palestine Act breaks the law. You might completely reasonly interject [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=408.88s)]
*  here and say what you're saying Palestine Act shouldn't be prosecuted for breaking the law. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=413.2s)]
*  While it's true that if I was serving in a jury personally I would support acquitting them on the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=418.96000000000004s)]
*  grounds they are trying to stop a much bigger crime than say throwing some paint at a plane, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=423.92s)]
*  when activists take direct action they do expect the Lord to come after them. That's a sacrifice [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=429.6s)]
*  they are prepared to take. It comes with a package. The argument here isn't actually [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=435.68s)]
*  that the state shouldn't prosecute people who take direct action given that does come with a [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=440.96000000000004s)]
*  territory. Look if I was to wave my magic wand obviously I would just get rid of the reasons for [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=445.12s)]
*  why people are taking direct action which is that Israel is committing genocide with the direct help [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=449.52s)]
*  of the British government. As I said I would also acquit these people. That's not the point here. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=453.76s)]
*  The question here is, is Palestine Action a terrorist organisation which should be treated [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=458.0s)]
*  as a terrorist organisation? With legislation that means if I express my support for the courageous [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=463.44s)]
*  principled dedicated fighters for justice who are and always will be Palestine Action activists, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=468.08s)]
*  I could end up being sent to prison for up to 14 years. This video I am making in a week's time, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=473.84s)]
*  if I made this video, I could be sent to prison for up to 14 years. Does that sound like a democracy [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=481.28s)]
*  to you? What I'm saying here, do you think it is a proportionate response that a sentence of up to [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=487.2s)]
*  14 years should hang over my head like a sword of Damocles? Do you think that's proportionate? Do [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=495.44s)]
*  you think that's how democracies behave? That's what this prescription means. It means even [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=502.96s)]
*  expressing what is construed as support for the prescribed organisations who in the eyes of the [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=508.0s)]
*  state will become officially a terrorist organisation, you can be sent to prison for nearly a decade and [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=512.16s)]
*  a half. This very video. As Zoe Gardner points out, this action which is portrayed as an outrage [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=518.64s)]
*  isn't new. In 2003, five peace protesters, the Fairford Five, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=529.76s)]
*  broke into RAF Fairford and disabled military equipment with the aim of disrupting military [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=534.32s)]
*  operations in the Iraq war. Who defended these protesters? What was the lawyer's name? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=538.48s)]
*  Keir Starmer. One of them ended up with a conditional discharge and a Â£250 fine for [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=543.04s)]
*  cost. Another had a curfew order for five months. Really mild slaps on the wrist there. Two of them [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=548.08s)]
*  were acquitted on the grounds. The jury accepted their actions were reasonable because they were [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=553.76s)]
*  trying to prevent war crimes. That was a more radical attack as it happens. They disabled [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=558.32s)]
*  military equipment. It wasn't just red paint. Even that deeply authoritarian Labour government [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=563.84s)]
*  did not pull out the terrorism card, even though it was at the very height of the so-called war and [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=568.0s)]
*  terror where British streets were actually directly be mobilised. And indeed it was just a year and [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=572.32s)]
*  a half after 9-11 itself. Indeed, in the case of the Iraq war, what criminality actually matters? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=576.6400000000001s)]
*  Disabling military equipment or war which as the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan at the time, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=583.36s)]
*  declared was illegal. Who was the actual threat to British service personnel? The people trying [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=587.84s)]
*  to stop British service personnel being sent to be maimed or to their deaths? 179 British service [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=592.72s)]
*  personnel were killed in Iraq. Completely unnecessarily. Who was the actual threat [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=598.32s)]
*  to military equipment if we're going to sanctify property over lives, given how much of it was [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=604.88s)]
*  destroyed as a consequence of the British government's catastrophic decision to ally itself [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=611.6s)]
*  with George W Bush's presidency in that fateful war? The Iraq war was a grave crime. The genocide [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=615.84s)]
*  in Gaza facilitated by our government is an even bigger crime and what we are talking about here [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=623.76s)]
*  is spray paint. Meanwhile, the British government for example is supplying crucial components for [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=627.6800000000001s)]
*  F-35 jets which are raining death and destruction on the people of Gaza and ripping open the skulls [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=633.52s)]
*  of newborn babies. No non-violent movement has ever been prescribed as a terrorist organisation before. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=639.36s)]
*  I'll put that in this wider terrifying context but as the Palestine Action lawyers say, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=645.9200000000001s)]
*  while some actions of those associated with Palestine Action have involved damage to property, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=650.0s)]
*  activists do not advocate or intend unlawful violence against the person. A significant [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=654.24s)]
*  number of actions associated with Palestine Action have used entirely conventional campaigning [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=658.8000000000001s)]
*  methods such as marches, rallies and demos. It is an authoritarian turn and abuse of language to [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=662.96s)]
*  label the terrorist organisation. Amen. Those are very disturbing twists. As the Guardian report, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=667.9200000000001s)]
*  home office officials have briefed the idea that Palestine Action could be funded by Iran. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=673.44s)]
*  There was absolutely no evidence for this smear whatsoever, conveniently conjured up when Iran's [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=679.2800000000001s)]
*  been brought into the picture by Israel's illegal and unprovoked war there. But the Guardian [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=683.12s)]
*  notes this comes two days after a pro-Israel lobby group called We Believe in Israel tweeted [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=689.2800000000001s)]
*  Behind Palestine Action's theatre resistance stands a darker puppeteer, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=694.96s)]
*  the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Palestine Action is the mask, the IRGC is the face. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=699.76s)]
*  Apologies there for the voice, I just thought it was appropriate given the ludicrous linguistic [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=709.84s)]
*  style deployed by these lunatics. The Guardian note, the only evidence it provided was saying [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=716.8000000000001s)]
*  that the IRGC's vocabulary echoes in Palestine Action's slogans. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=724.4s)]
*  It's probably stuff like, don't do genocide. It's just deranged. We Believe in Israel launched [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=730.48s)]
*  this campaign to ban Palestine Action and the Guardian also report, language from a report [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=736.0s)]
*  it published was similar to that used by Cooper in her statement. Hmm, wonder what's gone on there. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=742.0799999999999s)]
*  Don't know why I'm doing that accent either. The former director of We Believe in Israel is [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=748.4s)]
*  Luke Ackhurst, a fractional fighter who played a pivotal role in Stammer's crushing of the left [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=751.36s)]
*  before being parachuted into a seat in Durham which he had no connection to whatsoever. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=755.28s)]
*  We Believe in Israel was founded by BiCom, the main pro-Israel lobbying organisation in Britain [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=759.2s)]
*  who published a journal called Fathom. This journal amongst other things published a piece [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=763.92s)]
*  by Giora Island, a former Israeli general who floated in Fathom in a piece published by that [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=768.16s)]
*  journal, the permanent expulsion of Gaza's entire population and amongst other things he wrote in [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=776.4s)]
*  that article, the people should be told they have two choices, to stay and to starve or to leave. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=781.68s)]
*  He also proposed amongst other things destroying the water facilities in Gaza. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=788.24s)]
*  Giora Island was an advisor to Yoav Galant, the former Israeli defence minister who was indicted [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=792.64s)]
*  by the International Criminal Court alongside the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for war crimes [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=798.0799999999999s)]
*  and crimes against humanity. This piece was cited in South Africa's case of genocide against Israel. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=802.08s)]
*  Who are the real extremists here? It is those who have been apologists for the worst possible crimes [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=809.44s)]
*  that can be committed against human beings. Every day at the moment the Israeli army, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=814.5600000000001s)]
*  which Britain is allied to, is mowing down starving Palestinians who are desperately trying [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=818.72s)]
*  to get food and the British state is designating those trying to stop these crimes as terrorists [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=822.8000000000001s)]
*  who face up to 14 years in prison. We should note that earlier in this year the police arrested [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=828.4s)]
*  dozens of entirely peaceful non-property damaging as well, because let's not betray property damages [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=834.0s)]
*  or violence, violence is committed against humans, but they were just conventional walking down the [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=842.48s)]
*  street pro-Palestinian protesters. After the police tried banning the protests on completely [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=848.64s)]
*  spurious grounds, the director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, Benjamin Al and the chief [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=852.88s)]
*  steward of the march, Chris Nineham, who was violently arrested at the protest, are now being [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=857.12s)]
*  put on trial. Meanwhile, the British government won't even commit to honouring the arrest warrant [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=862.4s)]
*  against Benjamin Netanyahu, issued by an International Criminal Court which it's a founding member of [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=868.16s)]
*  and they still treat his state as an ally who they are arming. The world has turned on its head, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=872.8s)]
*  and all of this must be seen in the context of a clampdown on the right to protest. Back in May [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=878.88s)]
*  2023, before Israel's genocide, I wrote a column headlined, Consider the Coronation Arrests and [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=883.04s)]
*  Witness Britain's Slide Towards Authoritarianism. I noted the pleasing act introduced by the Tories [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=887.92s)]
*  allows for protests to be suppressed if they are deemed too noisy. Protests are almost by definition [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=892.24s)]
*  noisy. This reasoning seems beyond dispute. Nigel Farage loudly demanded the prescription of the [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=897.28s)]
*  courageous anti-genocide fighters to Palestine action, in the hours before the Stalin government [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=903.12s)]
*  made its announcement. Where do you think this is heading guys? In the US, the foundation for [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=907.04s)]
*  today's authoritarian dissent were laid by so-called democrats and centrists who demonised pro-Palestinian [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=911.2s)]
*  activism. In this country, there's already a raft of authoritarian anti-protest laws and just [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=917.12s)]
*  general authoritarian laws, and if Nigel Farage ends up becoming Prime Minister, which is entirely [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=923.44s)]
*  plausible, he knows this authoritarianism has been legitimised by his predecessors, he just needs to [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=927.9200000000001s)]
*  build on it. This is a very dangerous moment, it's becoming increasingly clear to me that they're [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=933.36s)]
*  going to send some of us to jail. That's where this is heading. People who peacefully oppose [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=937.36s)]
*  one of the worst crimes of our age, some of us are going to go to prison. They'll try and make [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=942.0s)]
*  examples to scare everyone else into silence. Well, here's the thing, if you ask those who [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=946.08s)]
*  support prescribing Palestine action, do you agree that if your country is helping to facilitate [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=952.08s)]
*  genocide, then you have as a citizen a responsibility to do anything in your power to stop that [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=956.4s)]
*  genocide from happening, what would they say? Well, they would probably say, Israel isn't committing [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=961.9200000000001s)]
*  genocide, thus we reject the premise of the question. Alas, as you've probably noticed, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=965.84s)]
*  I'm largely blacklisted these days by the British media, so I don't get to ask these questions [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=969.6800000000001s)]
*  of these people very often anymore, but they then need to be pinned down. Just answer the question, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=974.8000000000001s)]
*  as a principle, do you think that if you are the citizen of a country facilitating genocide, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=979.36s)]
*  that you should do anything you can to stop that crime, that particularly abominable crime? Yes or [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=983.9200000000001s)]
*  no? The only morally decent answer to that question, of course, is yes. And then they [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=990.72s)]
*  have to contend with the fact that it is the consensus of genocide scholars that Israel is [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=996.4s)]
*  committing genocide, including Israeli genocide scholars, like the Israeli American Professor [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=1000.48s)]
*  of Genocide and Holocaust Studies, Omar Bartov, like Israeli American Associate Professor of [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=1005.12s)]
*  Genocide and Holocaust Studies, Raz Segal, like Israeli Professor of Holocaust History, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=1009.76s)]
*  Amos Goldberg, like Israeli Head of the Institute for Contemporary Jewry at the Hebrew University [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=1014.24s)]
*  of Jerusalem, for example, Daniel Blattman, who specialises in the history of the Holocaust, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=1018.64s)]
*  like the Israeli Historian Dr. Shmuel Lederman, who also specialises in genocide studies. We could [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=1023.1999999999999s)]
*  go on. What are the defenders of prescription arguing? That these genocide experts and scholars [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=1029.6s)]
*  are all delusional, stupid, dishonest? That they're all inviting a massive backlash on a false [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=1034.72s)]
*  whim, particularly Israeli scholars discussing their own country in that climate under a far-right [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=1041.52s)]
*  government? Surely they'd have to accept that if there is a consensus of genocide scholars who [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=1047.76s)]
*  believe genocide is taking place, then the view at the very least that Israel is committing genocide [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=1053.84s)]
*  is a credible and plausible conclusion. And at the very least, there must be a hell of a lot of [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=1058.96s)]
*  evidence that an absolutely heinous crime is taking place. But that offers a clue about how all this [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=1064.96s)]
*  ends. Anyone who goes to prison for opposing genocide will know that they're being persecuted [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=1074.0s)]
*  for opposing the most abominable possible crime, the genocide of a people. And they will know [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=1080.72s)]
*  however long they're incarcerated what history will have to say about that. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=1089.76s)]
*  But the truth is, those who run this country are behaving like this because they're scared. They [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=1094.72s)]
*  know a reckoning will one day come and it's going to sweep them away like a hurricane. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=1100.4s)]
*  Their reputations are going to be destroyed and they're going to lose their freedom. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=1106.4s)]
*  They're going to go to prison. And they're going to go to prison because this crime is [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=1111.6000000000001s)]
*  simply too extreme, too documented, too confessed to and already too opposed for them to get away [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=1115.6000000000001s)]
*  with. Right now, those people are in charge and they can repress and silence their opponents. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=1121.6000000000001s)]
*  But the clock is ticking. You are the damned, the doomed. Those who at the very least [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=1127.44s)]
*  will only be remembered by history as monsters and who face the judgement not just of the history [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=1134.0s)]
*  books but one day of the courts. And you will not have the comfort of being locked up and feeling [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=1139.6s)]
*  righteous. Instead, you will be tortured in that prison cell by the horrors you inflicted, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgPy2QRS7r8&t=1147.9199999999998s)]
