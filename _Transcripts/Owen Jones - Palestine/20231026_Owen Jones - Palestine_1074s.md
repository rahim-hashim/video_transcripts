# Israeli Academic SANCTIONED For Palestine Solidarity
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4)
*  We've had 19 days of horror now and thousands of people have been killed, a brutal Israeli onslaught with Western support causing total devastation in Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=0.0s)]
*  Now, I'm really proud to be speaking to Yuri Heresh today, who is a social linguistic Israeli academic and someone they've been, they've put their, I suppose, career on the line to stand up for what they believe in. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=10.56s)]
*  And I think this is a really striking case study of exactly what is happening in Israel. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=25.76s)]
*  Now, Yuri, thank you for joining us, by the way. Lovely to see you. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=32.24s)]
*  Thank you for having me, Owen. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=34.56s)]
*  Just quickly, just to explain, you know, to an audience, where are you from, what's your academic kind of background, that kind of thing. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=35.96s)]
*  OK, so I was born in Jaffa. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=42.6s)]
*  For British audiences, that's where you get the name for your Jaffa cakes. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=46.96s)]
*  And because Jaffa is known for its orange groves, I did grow up between Israel, between suburbs of Tel Aviv and a few years in New York when my dad was studying at Columbia University. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=50.6s)]
*  I lived in Israel. I studied there until I was 30. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=66.88s)]
*  I then moved to the United States for a few years. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=70.12s)]
*  I studied there and eventually I did my PhD in sociolinguistics at the University of Essex. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=72.16s)]
*  My academic expertise is on language variation and change, particularly insofar as Arabic dialects are concerned and the interaction between Arabic and Hebrew in Palestine. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=79.16s)]
*  So just tell me a bit about your own, I suppose, political positioning and where you stand on the question of the rights of the Palestinian people, for example. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=91.96s)]
*  OK, I mean, in a way, you could say that I've evolved somewhat. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=99.8s)]
*  I mean, I can remember my first political demonstration, which was at the age of seven or eight, sitting on my dad's shoulders, protesting the construction of one of the first, I guess, Israeli settlements in the West Bank, part of a Peace Now protest. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=102.68s)]
*  So my childhood was really shaped a lot around political activism, not in the very, how would I put it, not very radical, at least in my mind, and not in any kind of way that I would never ran for office or anything of that nature. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=125.08s)]
*  But I was always out on the streets when needed. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=145.68s)]
*  And I think it was when I spent a few years in the US among a very international kind of audience, including Palestinians, including Arabs from other countries, Americans, Europeans, what have you, that I realized that what I've been thinking all these years has really been I think I had been not stifling myself, but somewhat limiting what I allowed myself to say. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=150.36s)]
*  And in fact, I was in favor of all these things that I may have sometimes thought were radical, like the right of return of Palestinians to Palestine. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=178.32s)]
*  Right. That's something that's today. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=187.84s)]
*  Even today is pretty much taboo in Israel. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=189.6s)]
*  Right. Because people say, well, if they return, there'll be a majority. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=192.68s)]
*  Right. Yes. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=197.04s)]
*  But that's the way things are supposed to be. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=198.76s)]
*  And so that's where I'm standing now. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=203.28s)]
*  I mean, I am I don't like to say pro-Palestinian because it's as if I single out Palestine. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=205.92s)]
*  You know, I am a humanist. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=215.68s)]
*  I'd like to say that. But I also don't want to water it down. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=217.48s)]
*  I don't want to, you know, yes, this is what's on my mind because I feel that as an Israeli citizen, I bear some of the responsibility, especially as an intellectual, as an academic, as someone who's [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=219.96s)]
*  been out there and vocal, I feel like, you know, I can't just say, OK, this is Netanyahu. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=233.2s)]
*  This is the right wing. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=240.11999999999998s)]
*  The Israeli people as as a collective have have a lot to answer to with regard to the plight of the Palestinian people. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=242.72s)]
*  And that's where I'm standing right now. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=255.28s)]
*  So I, you know, and if that means going out into the street, be it in Tel Aviv or in Philadelphia or Washington, D.C. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=256.92s)]
*  or London, for that matter, as I did last Sunday with Palestinian flags and signs calling for for the right of return and for ending the siege on Gaza and ending the war on Gaza, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=265.32s)]
*  then that's where I am. And I have nothing to be ashamed of. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=277.32s)]
*  So what happened to you? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=283.08000000000004s)]
*  So I was actually in New York for about a week attending a social linguistics conference representing my college, ironically. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=285.48s)]
*  And on the morning of the last day, it was Sunday, I received an email signed by the president and vice president of academic affairs of my college. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=296.52000000000004s)]
*  It's a college called Akhva Academic College in central Israel, informing me that I have been suspended pending a disciplinary hearing, which will be scheduled in the next few days. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=308.2s)]
*  I'm saying now in parentheses, it has never been scheduled. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=320.88s)]
*  It's been 10, 10, 11 days now. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=323.8s)]
*  And the content of the email was even more alarming than than the than the bottom line, because it indicated that I had posted a sign on social media calling for freeing the ghetto of Gaza. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=329.0s)]
*  In fact, in English, it just says Free Gaza in Hebrew, it said free the Gaza ghetto, a sign that was from a from a demonstration in Tel Aviv months ago. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=353.0s)]
*  Right. But I put it online again, given the the the events. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=364.08s)]
*  And it also said that it has come to our attention that you have claimed that Israel is committing genocide. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=371.15999999999997s)]
*  And it said that I have I have tarnished the name of the college, that I have my my actions and my views can only be interpreted with with with full certainty as support for the terrorist acts perpetrated perpetrated by Hamas. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=379.52000000000004s)]
*  And that and that's pretty much it. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=401.44s)]
*  So, you know, in a way, even without having this disciplinary hearing, I was already tried and executed in that very brief email. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=404.76s)]
*  An interesting development still on that same day as I immediately informed my head of department, as well as the chairperson of our local senior faculty union, the union chair immediately wrote back saying that she would not intervene in my case because she, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=416.8s)]
*  who would, in court, supports the administration's critique of my actions. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=437.56s)]
*  And I would have I would have I would have been able to live with that in a way, even though I think she betrayed her her her job. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=442.91999999999996s)]
*  But but about an hour or two later, she sent an email to the entire to 40 or 50 of my colleagues, including myself. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=456.36s)]
*  I mean, I was because I'm on that email list of of colleagues who are members of the union. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=465.12s)]
*  And she informed my colleagues that I had posted my support for Hamas, not that my my views might be interpreted at no. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=472.36s)]
*  That Uri Horish supports Hamas in those precise words and that she feels as if the union is not under any obligation to support me and so on and so forth. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=486.48s)]
*  And then then started a barrage of responses, which I was also, again, an addressee to because people just replied all. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=499.96s)]
*  And I started I literally started shaking. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=507.79999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I literally started thinking these people are are after me and I'm not one to be paranoid and not one to really think, you know. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=510.08s)]
*  I'm not one to catastrophize everything. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=520.0s)]
*  But this was the first time, I think, in my long activist or quasi activist career that I felt that I was in danger. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=522.84s)]
*  I'll say also that I was supposed to come back to Tel Aviv that day and I felt lucky. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=533.4000000000001s)]
*  In fact, I felt fortunate that United Airlines and Lufthansa and all the foreign airlines had canceled their flights to Tel Aviv because I was forced to stay out of the country. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=538.8000000000001s)]
*  I, in fact, rerouted myself to come to London. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=547.64s)]
*  I'm currently staying with friends in Essex, friends of mine from the university. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=551.4s)]
*  And I was glad that I wasn't able to go back because I didn't want to be around these people. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=557.0s)]
*  And it's clear you've been essentially fired because, for example, your professional page is gone, your email is gone. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=561.8s)]
*  So, I mean, they wouldn't even be able to email you that's the result of what they decide. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=569.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, it's not just the result. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=574.0s)]
*  If I have a hearing, I'm entitled to be there. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=576.44s)]
*  I'm entitled to have either union or legal representation. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=579.52s)]
*  I had, in fact, contacted a lawyer in Israel, a labor lawyer, a lawyer who specializes in labor disputes, was also an ally politically, sending her all of my correspondences and so forth. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=584.64s)]
*  But yes, it was, I believe, three days ago that I realized that I was locked out of my professional email. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=602.52s)]
*  So even if they wanted to contact me, they wouldn't be able. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=610.16s)]
*  I did email my immediate supervisor, my head of department, saying, look, I cannot access my email. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=612.72s)]
*  So here's an alternative email in case the college still wants to contact me and my phone number. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=619.32s)]
*  But yes, you're right. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=627.28s)]
*  I mean, my impression was that or my interpretation is that that's it. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=628.44s)]
*  I mean, they really have decided without consulting me, without hearing my side of the story to summarily dismiss me from from my job. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=632.24s)]
*  Any record of my contributions to the college are gone. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=641.6400000000001s)]
*  That's almost true. I mean, there are some, for instance, there are some YouTube videos of me giving lectures and so forth that aren't on the college server. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=646.0s)]
*  So, you know, there is actually it's kind of. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=654.8800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but they've basically washed their hands off of me. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=657.6s)]
*  I mean, it's like the Stalinist airbrushed someone out the photo kind of thing. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=661.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=664.96s)]
*  Just just finally, I mean, to put this in the context of what's actually happening in Israel in terms of the the atmosphere, I suppose, in terms of, I guess, there's a juxtaposition, which is you are hearing language, which is being condemned by scholars who specialize in the study of genocide is genocidal rhetoric. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=667.24s)]
*  So I don't think I'm being hyperbolic. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=683.36s)]
*  The United Nations itself has issued a statement and calling for the protection of Palestinians from genocide. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=684.5600000000001s)]
*  So, again, we're not being hyperbolic here. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=690.48s)]
*  Secretary General has has has voiced his view that that that the Hamas attacks attacks did not occur in a vacuum. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=692.0s)]
*  Right. He didn't justify them, of course, but he said, look, these people have been under siege for what, 17 years and under vicious occupation. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=700.9200000000001s)]
*  I think he said since 1967, if you think of it, you can go back to 1948 and perhaps even earlier. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=710.32s)]
*  Yeah. So the context is clear. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=716.48s)]
*  And the context is something that I think mainstream Israeli, the mainstream Israeli public. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=719.2s)]
*  And when I say mainstream, I think I mean over 90 percent of the piece of Jewish Israelis are just unwilling to think about. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=726.08s)]
*  Right. The context is something that is all for them always revolves around our experience, the experience of Jewish Israelis, of the Jewish people at large, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=734.44s)]
*  including those who aren't Israelis, excluding those Israelis who happen to be Palestinians. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=749.64s)]
*  So all of this broader context, which is the real context that you mentioned, Owen, is oftentimes completely ignored by the Israeli public. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=754.96s)]
*  So, I mean, in terms of what's happening in freedom of expression, because I know, for example, Israel Frey, who's an ultra orthodox leftist journalist who did the Kaddish, the Jewish prayer, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=764.92s)]
*  and for those who die, for those who don't know, but for both those who died in Hamas's attack, but also those dying in Gaza. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=776.96s)]
*  And he a far right mob came to his house and sort of throwing windows. He has a fleece and hiding at the moment. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=784.52s)]
*  Yeah, actually, he actually he took himself. I mean, he lives in Tel Aviv. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=789.76s)]
*  I understand he he immediately went to the closest hospital. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=793.36s)]
*  Yeah, the main hospital in Tel Aviv, the Ichelov hospital, and tried to I mean, he said, if I can be safe anywhere, it'll be a hospital where people are supposed to protect me. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=796.6800000000001s)]
*  And the mob even even arrived there. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=805.76s)]
*  And last I saw a video of him saying that he's he's in hiding in an undisclosed location and fearful of his life. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=808.12s)]
*  He's not the only one. Oh, and actually, it is very important for me to say two things. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=817.0s)]
*  My case, alarming as it may be, enraging as it may be, is not the be all and end all of the situation. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=823.48s)]
*  Right. First of all, I mean, my heart and my and my my thoughts are, first of all, with the the the over two million Palestinians living in Gaza and those who are no longer living and those who are losing their lives and their homes. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=834.48s)]
*  I mean, what I've got, what I've gone through is not even not even a drop in a bucket. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=850.48s)]
*  It's really nothing compared to what they're going through. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=860.4s)]
*  But even if you compare what I'm going through to my my comrades, my colleagues, students, Palestinian students, and I see Palestinian students, I mean, Israeli citizens who are Palestinians who study at Israeli universities and colleges, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=863.64s)]
*  who nurses and doctors who save lives in Israeli hospitals and clinics and serve all the entire Israeli population. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=880.8s)]
*  They have been not some of them have been suspended from their jobs, from their studies. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=890.6s)]
*  Some of them have been outright sacked or expelled from from their schools. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=895.48s)]
*  Some of them have been arrested for things that I would even say are far more benign than the stuff that I've been posting online and saying publicly. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=901.4s)]
*  Things like I mean, there's a she's a neuroscientist and a pop singer named Dalal Abu Amne from Nazareth, who was about a week ago arrested by police. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=912.16s)]
*  She actually went to a police station to complain about people harassing her online and so forth. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=925.52s)]
*  And while she was at the police station, police officers from a different station came to arrest her because she posted on Facebook a very common and I would say benign Muslim saying in Arabic, it's la ghaliba illallah. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=932.64s)]
*  It translates as there is no victor but God. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=948.16s)]
*  And she was accused that because of the juxtaposition between the events of the previous days and her praise of God, God being Allah, but Allah, I must say to everyone, Allah is the Arabic word for God. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=951.8s)]
*  Jews use it who speak Arabic. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=967.4399999999999s)]
*  Muslims use it, of course, and Christians use it. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=969.8s)]
*  It's just the word for God. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=972.92s)]
*  So when she says there is no victor but God, this is something that billions of people are saying around the world. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=973.92s)]
*  And she was she was arrested for that here and her I don't know if she's still in detention, but I know that she was brought before a judge who extended her arrest for several more days. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=979.68s)]
*  So really, what I'm going through is symptomatic and indicative of a much larger phenomenon and a much more, I would say, alarming, chilling phenomenon of unwillingness to accept any kind of. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=991.4s)]
*  Expression of opinions of youth that don't tow the party line and not talking about a specific party, towing the collective party line of Zionist Israeli. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=1009.04s)]
*  Thought and ideology. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=1024.6s)]
*  Yeah, I really appreciate you talking to us all about this. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=1027.48s)]
*  And I think what you went through is an injustice, but also reveals, as you say, something much, much broader about what's happening in Israeli society and what happens to those who speak out in support of the Palestinian people in this truly dreadful moment. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=1030.6799999999998s)]
*  But honestly, I really, really appreciate it. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=1046.6399999999999s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=1048.24s)]

*  That's what I'm here for. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=1053.28s)]
*  I know that. And that's why I agreed to speak with you and not some of your other colleagues who who I don't trust as much. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=1055.76s)]
*  Well, I couldn't possibly comment about that. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=1063.76s)]
*  But to those watching or listening, do like and subscribe and also do spread this video around so we can get the word out. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_t7Rmnw6i4&t=1065.88s)]
