# There Was NO CEASEFIRE on 6th October Israel's Lie Taken Apart
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [June 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzIIrXFz4gQ)
*  You'll have heard this narrative many times, expressed by apologists for Israel's genocide
*  of rampage. Every time you call for a ceasefire, there was a ceasefire on the 6th of October,
*  and the next day, Hamas broke it. Now, this narrative basically goes like this. Israel,
*  a democratic oasis, was just casually minding its own business and living peacefully, doing nothing
*  to inflict violence on anyone else. When, out of a clear blue sky, lightning struck,
*  the tranquillity Israel had so carefully respected being blown apart by war regression,
*  which came from nowhere. This narrative is a lie, a total raging lie, and it is dripping with racism,
*  as I'll explain. None of this, by the way, is to defend war crimes committed on the 7th of October.
*  As I've said from the beginning, no cause on earth justifies violence against civilians,
*  whether that be maiming, killing or kidnapping. That doesn't mean Israel's claims of a broken
*  ceasefire are true. They're not. At all. Now, that goes without even including the very basic
*  historical context of what the Palestinian people have been subjected to for many generations.
*  This itself is intolerable. You can easily establish it was intolerable by flipping it. Would
*  the people of Israel, or indeed any people on earth, tolerate what the Palestinians have endured?
*  When the Balfour Declaration, named after the then British Foreign Secretary,
*  Arthur Balfour, himself profoundly anti-Semitic, promised to establish a Jewish homeland in
*  Palestine in 1917, the Jewish population of Palestine was only 10%, with the Arab population
*  being 90%. Yet within 30 years, the UN General Assembly proposed to partition Palestine into a
*  Jewish state and a Palestinian state. Even though the Jewish state was allocated 55% when the
*  Jewish population of Palestine at the time constituted a third. That's an important detail
*  because the pro-Israel narrative is often presented as, here was a reasonable proposal which the
*  Palestinians and their Arab allies rejected, causing a terrible war, but again, which people
*  on earth would have accepted this outcome under those circumstances? Indeed, we can test this
*  hypothesis very easily because Zionist paramilitaries did wage a terrorist campaign of their own before
*  the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948, including such terrorist atrocities as the King
*  David Hotel bombing of 1947 in which 91 people were slaughtered. There was of course the Nakba,
*  in which three quarters of a million Palestinians were violently expelled or fled for fear of their
*  lives, with 15,000 suffering violent deaths, and indeed a large majority of Gaza's population
*  are the families of those expelled. Palestinians then faced further mass expulsion in 1967. They
*  suffered the longest belligerent occupation of modern times and in Gaza the longest belligerent
*  siege of modern times. Now, Palestinians have long been subjected to what human rights
*  organisations internationally and in Israel define as apartheid, the monstrous violations
*  of human rights. Well, we'll come on to all of that of course, but above all else, Palestinians have
*  been subjected to a violent deprivation of the right to national self-determination, which has
*  lasted for generations and which no people on earth would tolerate. Look at the fatalities alone as an
*  indicator. According to the United Nations, between 2008 and 6 October 2023, 96% of all
*  fatalities were Palestinians compared to 4% Israeli fatalities. In absolute numbers, that means
*  over 6,400 Palestinians were killed, over 83% of those in Gaza compared to 329 Israeli fatalities,
*  of which 125 were killed in the officially recognised borders of Israel, rather than the
*  majority who were in the occupied territories. There were over 158,000 Palestinians injured,
*  including compared to less than 6,500 Israelis injured. So again, 96% of injuries were
*  Palestinians. You can't look at that astonishing level of violence and claim there was some form
*  of ceasefire in place. Clearly there wasn't. Now let's look at the West Bank alone. Now some will
*  go, well, that's not Gaza, is it? No, but Palestinians don't regard Gaza and the West Bank as separate
*  national entities, but as one indivisible Palestinian nation. And crucially, Hamas
*  don't rule the West Bank, so it can't be used as an excuse for Israeli violence.
*  As the Israeli human rights organisation, Betsalen, pointed out, the Israeli state killed
*  more Palestinians in the West Bank in 2022 than in any year since 2004. That included 34 children,
*  the youngest being 12, while the oldest Palestinian killed was 78 years old. I think those statistics
*  speak for themselves. Now in 2023 to 7th October, 240 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank,
*  dozens of them children. As Save the Children pointed out in a press release on the 18th of
*  September 2023, that is 19 days before the 7th of October, 2023 was then the deadliest year for
*  Palestinian kids in the occupied West Bank, with 38 children killed by that point. Now if 240
*  Israelis had been killed, including dozens of Israeli children at that point, nobody would have
*  called that a ceasefire. And here's my point about racism, that so many Palestinians can be
*  violently killed by the Israeli state and that still be described as a ceasefire underlines how
*  Palestinian life is just stripped of any meaning. You can't possibly believe Palestinian life has
*  equal value, anything like that, and call such astonishing bloodshed a ceasefire. Then there's
*  mass incarceration. Before the 7th of October, since the occupation began in 1967, so between
*  October 2023, the United Nations says Israel had detained approximately one million Palestinians,
*  including tens of thousands of kids. There are around 5200 Palestinians languishing in Israeli
*  prisons on the 6th of October, and crucially those imprisoned after being charged were so without
*  even the basic fundamentals of a fair trial. They were held in military courts, not civil courts,
*  including no access to a lawyer while interrogations took place and confessions were obtained,
*  with confessions often obtained in Hebrew, which is not the language they speak. Indeed, those
*  accused often met the lawyer for the first time when they entered a military courtroom,
*  bail, denied in most cases, so the quickest way out is to plead guilty whether or not that offence
*  is committed. Hence, understandably, the conviction rate in these military courts is over 99%,
*  the conditions have deteriorated and they're much worse now. It gets worse. We've discovered,
*  we've discussed these ludicrously unfair trials, but there were specifically 1200 detainees being
*  held under administrative detention orders that is without any charge or trial whatsoever,
*  almost all of them Palestinians. And these detentions, I repeat, without charge, range
*  from months to years. On the 10th of July 2023, that is two months before the 7th of October,
*  the UN issued a press release entitled Special Rapporteur Says Israel's Unlawful Castle
*  Practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory are tantamount to international crimes and have
*  turned it into an open air prison. Now let's just focus on children. That's right, the detention
*  and imprisonment of kids. As Save the Children note, Israel is the only nation on earth which
*  automatically and systematically prosecutes children in military courts. And when I read
*  the following Greece in detail, guess what the most common charge for children is? Stone throwing.
*  It was estimated that before 7th October, Israel detained and prosecuted between 500 and 700
*  Palestinian kids a year in military courts. According to Amnesty International, the child's
*  request for a lawyer is often delayed until the interrogation has taken place and often a confession
*  is obtained. It is a punitive system that is not aimed at rehabilitating children. It always keeps
*  kids in prison until they are tried and sentenced. Children are often pressured into accepting plea
*  bargains in exchange for a commuted sentence. Children held under administrative detention
*  orders are never presented with charges. With detentions based on secret evidence that isn't
*  disclosed to the detainee or their lawyer, they have no legal means to either challenge the detention
*  or the alleged basis for it. Consider this. According to the Save the Children report,
*  at least months before 7th October, 42% of children detained were injured during their arrest,
*  including gunshot wounds and broken bones. While two thirds of these kids were arrested at night,
*  half of those arrests were at their homes. 86% of these children were beaten, 60% were hit with
*  sticks or guns. Children reported violence and abuse of a sexual nature. 60% of kids experienced
*  solitary confinement for up to 48 days. 70% said they suffered hunger. 68% said they didn't receive
*  healthcare. 58% were denied visits or communication with family while they were detained.
*  Now, consider the horrors these kids go through. Remember the most common charge,
*  the most common accusation of stone throwing, where it should be said it's not even clear
*  in those situations who's been throwing stones. The maximum sentence for throwing stones is either
*  10 or 20 years depending on the circumstances. Why shouldn't we consider huge numbers of these cases?
*  Not as prisoners, but as hostages. Not least these children. Not just these children, but
*  children taken from their families subjected to hideous physical violence and yes, sexual violence,
*  deprived of the most rudimentary basics of a fair trial, often subjected to solitary confinement,
*  detained in cases with no charge of trial at all. If Israelis were being subjected to that routinely
*  before 7th October, would they consider that to be a ceasefire? Would you consider that to be a
*  ceasefire if your people were being subjected to that? Let's just be real here. Indeed, that's
*  without discussing another pillar of the occupation, which is illegal settlements.
*  There are an estimated 700,000 Israeli settlers living in illegal settlements in the West Bank.
*  That is stealing the land of the Palestinian people, making an independent, viable Palestinian
*  state completely and utterly impossible. Palestinians living there are subjected to
*  violence by these settlers who are protected by Israeli security forces, while Palestinians own
*  structures, homes, shops, etc., face demolitional seizure, while Palestinians are forcibly displaced
*  from where they live. There are segregated roads, you can see why this is called apartheid,
*  while Palestinians are subjected to checkpoints which can be arbitrarily closed where they can
*  be stuck waiting for hours and subjected to humiliations by Israeli soldiers. Again,
*  does a brutal military occupation like this, with Palestinian land being colonised, sound like a
*  ceasefire to you? Would Israelis consider such treatment a ceasefire if the boot was on the
*  other foot? Let's get serious here. But what of Gaza? Barthank the fact that Palestinians rightly
*  see Gaza and the West Bank as indivisible parts of the same nation which they are, as we would see
*  northern and southern England as part of the same nation, the Israeli state will say, well,
*  we withdrew our treats and settlements from Gaza in 2005 and look how we were repaid.
*  Let's be clear first of all why this so-called disengagement happened. It was on the basis that
*  the real prize was the West Bank, and that abandoning Gaza could mean doubling down on the West Bank
*  instead and thus making Palestinian statehood completely and utterly impossible. Gaza was
*  then subjected to the most prolonged siege in modern history. Exit and entry into Gaza by sea
*  or air was prohibited. Israel had bombed Yasser Arafat International Airport's radar station and
*  control tower in 2001, then bulldozed the runway. As Dov Weiglas, the then-advisor to the Israeli
*  Prime Minister, put it in 2006, we have to make them much thinner, but not enough to die.
*  According to the United Nations, in the first five months of 2022, there were 8,000 truckloads per
*  month entering Gaza, which is 30% below the monthly average for the first half of 2007 before the
*  blockade was imposed, but bear in mind the population had grown by more than 50% in that
*  time. Severe restrictions were imposed on fishing. 62% of the population required food assistance to
*  survive. Nearly 80% of its piped water was unfit for human consumption. Israel banned the entry of
*  food necessary for Gaza's power plant to function, while there were numerous claims that Israel
*  deliberately targeted that power plant in Israel's repeated military attacks. As the Israeli human
*  rights organisation, Betsalem, said six months before 7 October, the blockade Israel has been
*  imposing on the Gaza Strip for more than 15 years has crushed Gaza's healthcare system, and there
*  were constant shortages of medicines and medical equipment. In 2022 alone, more than 20,000 requests
*  by patients and persons escorting them to access vital medical care outside of Gaza were rejected,
*  sometimes with no answer received by the time of a scheduled appointment. Israel still controlled
*  the telecommunications sector and even Gaza's population registry. All of that meant Gaza was
*  rightly judged, legally speaking, to be under Israeli occupation. Now that period of siege and
*  indeed occupation, Gaza was subjected to repeated violent onslaughts at the hands of Israel. Guess
*  when the last such onslaught was before 7 October? It was under five months, between 9th and 13th of
*  May 2023. I doubt most even know or remember this. Now according to Amnesty International at the time,
*  in its early May offensive on the occupied Gaza Strip, Israel unlawfully destroyed Palestinian homes,
*  often without military necessity, in what amounts to a form of collective punishment
*  against the civilian population. Israel also conducted apparently disproportionate air strikes,
*  which killed and injured Palestinian civilians, including children. The Israeli attack damaged
*  nearly 3,000 homes, including 103 homes which were entirely destroyed. 11 civilians were killed,
*  including 4 kids. 190 Palestinians were injured, including 64 kids. But there were far more deadly
*  attacks than that. In the 2008-09 Gaza war, so called, named Operation Cast Iron Lead, over
*  1,400 Palestinian civilians were killed, including 300 kids and at least 115 women.
*  Around 3,500 homes were entirely destroyed, nearly 3,000 more suffered major damage.
*  217 schools and 60 nurses were either damaged or destroyed, 40 primary healthcare clinics and 12
*  hospitals attacked. Injured civilians died needlessly as Israeli soldiers repeatedly denied
*  access to ambulances. And human rights organisations like Amnesty International noted that Israeli
*  forces repeatedly used Palestinians as human shields. As that quote goes, every accusation
*  is a confession. Another onslaught took place in 2012 in which over 100 civilians were killed.
*  Just to emphasise how much continuity with Israeli crimes there are, during that particular horror,
*  here's what I said in BBC Question Time. Now it's often said, and Barack Obama made this point,
*  he said what country on earth would tolerate rockets being fired at them? I ask you this,
*  what people on earth would tolerate a siege which stops basic supplies getting in,
*  an occupation, a 45-year-old occupation, a brutal occupation at that, illegal settlements
*  all over the West Bank which are in total violation of international law and what we've seen in the
*  course of this onslaught are the deaths of 158 Palestinians, at least 30 Hema children. Now we
*  all want a secure and lasting peace. When we have Israeli ministers like the interior minister
*  calling for Gaza to be sent back to the Middle Ages, when in the last offensive we had another
*  minister calling for a Holocaust to be inflicted on Gaza, when we have the son of Ariel Sharon
*  who wrote in the Jerusalem Post talking about how Nagasaki and Hiroshima were solutions,
*  possible solutions to be inflicted, when we have those people we won't get a secure peace but the
*  way we will get it for Arabs and Jews alike to end the occupation, end the siege of Gaza and
*  dismantle the illegal settlements and finally have a just settlement for the Palestinian people
*  ensuring peaceful Arabs and Jews and the region as a whole. Israel has merely taken those horrors to
*  a much greater extreme. Then there was the 2014 so-called Gaza War named Operation Protective
*  Edge in which the United Nations found that nearly 1500 Palestinian civilians were killed,
*  a third of them children. That particular offensive began with two horrific incidents.
*  In the first nine Palestinian kids and four young adults were killed while they were watching the
*  World Cup on television and in the second four little kids were killed by Israeli boats firing
*  on them while they played hide and seek on a beach. That incident happened while foreign
*  journalists were watching from a hotel. The journalists made clear they could see from a
*  distance that the targets were children. The youngest was seven years old. Amnesty found during
*  this onslaught that Israel failed to take necessary precautions to avoid excessive harm to civilians.
*  That is against international law. They found Israel deliberately targeted civilians and
*  Lamot buildings. Around 30% of Gaza's population were internally displaced in this onslaught.
*  None of this is to absolve Hamas or other groups, Palestinian armed groups, in this crisis. The
*  likes of Amnesty also accuse them of war crimes which is never any defence. The point is there
*  is the dynamic of Occupy and Occupied and in this case he occupies a military superpower
*  armed to the teeth and backed by Western states who facilitate these war crimes and who commit
*  far graver and far deadlier war crimes in the process. There was yet another offensive in
*  2021 in which an estimated 128 Palestinian civilians were killed. That's without even
*  mentioning the so-called Great March of Return in 2018. These were weekly demonstrations by
*  Palestinians at Gaza's perimeter fence. Thousands of Palestinians joined these protests, demanding
*  an end to the illegal siege of Gaza and the right of refugees to return to homes they were driven
*  from during the 1948 Nakba. Yet Israeli forces massacred these protesters using live ammunition,
*  rubber coated steel bullets and tear gas. 214 Palestinians including 47 kids and over 36,000
*  people including approaching 9,000 children were injured. Of those injured, 1 in 5, that is 8,000
*  were hit by live ammunition. Does that sound like a ceasefire to you? What we're discussing here is
*  violence on a mass scale, enforced by a colonial state depriving the Palestinian people of their
*  basic fundamental rights and national self-determination, having driven so many from their homes and continuing
*  to do so, stealing their land and colonising it, besieging them, kidnapping them. Let's be clear
*  about what Israel's mass incarceration programme means in practice. None of this is a ceasefire
*  in any meaningful sense. It is a hideous never-ending war on the Palestinians and no people on Earth,
*  none, would tolerate it. That doesn't mean you justify the war crimes committed on the 7th of
*  October. Nothing ever justifies maiming and killing and kidnapping civilians. But it's simply a lie,
*  a straightforward lie to say there was a ceasefire in place on the 6th of October. It's also a racist
*  lie, a judiciously racist lie. It is based on the narrative that Palestinian lives got no meaning at
*  all. If Israelis were subjected to what I've detailed, they would rightly consider it intolerable
*  beyond words. Indeed, many of the atrocities committed against Israeli civilians, atrocities
*  for which there's no defence, were entirely comparable to atrocities long committed against
*  the Palestinian people, as we can see from the mass slaughter of Palestinians, including children
*  before the 7th of October alone. There was not a ceasefire, no ceasefire on the 6th of October. It
*  is a racist lie to claim there was. It is part and parcel of the dehumanisation of the Palestinian
*  people and we are duty-bound to tell the truth. Please like and subscribe. Do leave your comments.
