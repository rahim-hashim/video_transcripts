Video Description: Lord Walney - or John Woodcock to you and me - is the unelected Lord who was appointed by the Tories as a life peer after he endorsed Boris Johnson, and then an 'independent advisor' on political violence.

He's now trying to ban Palestine Action, and wants clampdowns on the right to protest, from the Palestinian movement to climate justice. But who is he? His links have been exposed - and it raises damning questions about our democracy.

# The Lord Trying To Ban Palestine Protests Linked To Arms Lobby - w/. Palestine Action's Huda Ammori
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag)
*  Now, since Israel's genocidal campaign against Gaza began many months ago, there has been an [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=0.0s)]
*  attempt to turn, I suppose, scrutiny onto those who oppose the genocide, rather than those who [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=5.04s)]
*  support and cheerlead this genocidal onslaught, the real dangerous, hateful extremists, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=11.28s)]
*  other people who oppose mass murder. That's essentially what the British establishment [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=16.32s)]
*  has tried to do. And there's no better example than what we're going to talk about today, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=21.52s)]
*  which is a proposal by, we'll talk about it, from on high, I would say, to ban Palestine Action. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  Palestine Action is a brilliant group who have done direct action in this great tradition of [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  peaceful civil disobedience, which won many of the rights and freedoms people take for granted [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=43.28s)]
*  and exposing, for example, firms linked to Israel's, not just current, genocidal onslaught, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  but the ongoing oppression of the Palestinian people and the deprivation of the right to national [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=55.84s)]
*  self-determination, apartheid, colonisation, we could go on. So firstly, it's great to speak to you, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=62.0s)]
*  Huda Amori from Palestine Action. Lovely to see you. How are you doing? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=67.76s)]
*  Good. All right. Glad to be here. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=70.16s)]
*  It's a big honour. Right. I'm just going to do a little preamble now, get everyone up today [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=73.6s)]
*  on what's going on, because then we can talk about this properly with you. So basically, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=77.28s)]
*  what we're talking about is there's a guy, a bloke called John Woodcock, who is now called Lord [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=81.44s)]
*  Wolman. Now, he is the government's so-called independent advisor on political violence, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=86.47999999999999s)]
*  and he has a report coming out next week. And that report is pushing for far-reaching attacks [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  on basic democratic freedoms and rights, including suggesting banning Palestine Action. Now, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=99.36s)]
*  just who is this guy? Let's just be clear who he is. So he used to be a Labour MP, and he was on [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=105.2s)]
*  the very right of the Labour Party. He was chair of Labour Friends of Israel. He resigned from the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=110.24s)]
*  Labour Party in 2018 after an investigation into claims he'd sent inappropriate text messages to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=116.32s)]
*  a female aide, which to be clear, he denies. The next year, he called on voters to back Boris [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=121.44s)]
*  Johnson's Conservative Party. Johnson was clearly delighted and then appointed him the next year as [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=126.96s)]
*  a life peer in the House of Lords, hence Lord Walney. He was then made the government's so-called [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=132.95999999999998s)]
*  independent advisor on political violence and disruption. As he's been on the receiving end of [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=139.84s)]
*  far-right violence, including being beaten up by a neo-Nazi. Interesting. What's he focusing on? Oh, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=145.92s)]
*  let's have a look, shall we? Although he's supposedly looking at activity in what was described [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=150.64s)]
*  as the far-right, far-left. Interesting how he uses that term and what that actually means. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=154.16s)]
*  And other political groups, he told the Right Wing Telegraph newspaper he was focusing on so-called [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=161.6s)]
*  progressive extremism, including activities related to the climate emergency and racial injustice. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=165.92s)]
*  Now, in recent months, he's been trailing several recommendations of his big detailed report, which [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=172.24s)]
*  will be released on what he thinks the government should be doing. And that includes a form of [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=178.32s)]
*  prescription on groups that regularly break the law in the, by the way, very long, it's not just [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  British specific, but it is a British tradition as well as a tradition elsewhere of civil disobedience, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  which would, you know, obviously was used to demonise and attack the likes of the suffragettes, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=194.16s)]
*  trade unionists, you could go on. Now, among 30 recommendations, it proposes banning at least [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=199.2s)]
*  two protest groups, Just Stop Oil and Palestine Action, which acts against arms companies which [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=205.2s)]
*  supply Israel's military. But it's just emerged that he had lobbying links to companies that would [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=210.64s)]
*  benefit from these attacks and protesting. And there's a Guardian article by my colleague, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=215.28s)]
*  which goes into this, Damien Gayle, and it points out he has entries in his Lord's Register of [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=221.51999999999998s)]
*  Interest. So when you are a MP or a Lord, you have a Register of Interest which details your business [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=226.88s)]
*  interests. And that's important because then voters are able to scrutinise the decisions made [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=233.36s)]
*  by MPs and cross-check them against the business interests that they're involved in and see if [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=238.72000000000003s)]
*  there's a conflict of interest as voters and citizens would see it. So that includes, acting [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  as Chair, the Purpose Business Coalition, an organisation run by the PR and lobbying firm [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=249.60000000000002s)]
*  Crown Associates, which counts the oil company BP and arms company Leonardo among its clients. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=254.32000000000002s)]
*  Reading from the Guardian here, the Register also shows he's a paid advisor to Rydd-Pederson [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=259.52000000000004s)]
*  Public Affairs, another lobbying firm which acts for Glencore, a Swiss mine company with interest [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=263.12s)]
*  in coal, and Emwell Energy, which describes itself as highly focused on oil and gas business. These [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=267.12s)]
*  are relevant obviously in terms of looking as well at the proposed bans, including Just Stop Oil. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=272.08000000000004s)]
*  Now Leonardo in particular has been subject to a persistent campaign of protest by Palestine Action, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=279.6s)]
*  the Guardian notes, including occupations of its factories during which equipment was smashed and [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=284.48s)]
*  graffitiing of the entrance to its London HQ. Now before I speak to you, I'm just going to have a [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=287.92s)]
*  little clip here from the podcast The Newsagents where Lord Wolney was actually interrogated about [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=293.92s)]
*  this. It's quite interesting, it's quite rare to see something like this happen on any mainstream [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=300.24s)]
*  outlet, so let's just have a quick look. John, can I just ask you whether you're the right person [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=303.68s)]
*  to be advancing these arguments, given that you're a former Chair of Labour Friends of Israel, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=307.92s)]
*  and Palestine Action, and I'm just going to quote them here and I would like to get you here your [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=316.0s)]
*  response, they say you're part of the current Chair of the Defence Purpose Coalition and you're [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=319.6s)]
*  getting funding from the Israel lobby. Yeah, I think when any organisation starts talking about [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=324.96000000000004s)]
*  an Israel lobby, they need to look at their own slide into anti-Semitism. That is a textbook [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=332.56s)]
*  example of the kind of anti-Semitism that mainstream organisations have tried to [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=341.12s)]
*  move away from in recent years. John, I mean you are the former Chair of Labour Friends of Israel, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=351.12s)]
*  do you not see that, how this is going to come across to supporters of Palestinian liberation? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=361.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, I mean I don't think I would go into this thinking I was going to make friends with [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=368.24s)]
*  people who were part of that extreme end of the pro-Palestine movement anyway, but I think the [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=375.76s)]
*  public and lawmakers are going to have to look at this report in the round. It's a big report, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=386.96000000000004s)]
*  it's a hundred thousand words, it's got a lot of... Talk us through this, what is the Defence Purpose [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=394.88s)]
*  Coalition? We've been honestly scratching our heads and calling around trying to work out what [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=401.12s)]
*  the Defence Purpose Coalition is or does, you're the current Chair of that as well. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=405.52000000000004s)]
*  The Purpose Coalition is an organisation of purpose-led groups including, it has been some [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=410.88s)]
*  defence-related companies who value the contribution that they make to the UK economy [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=418.48s)]
*  and we should all do that. But the point you make about that, look, you are an impartial voice on [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=423.76s)]
*  this, I just think that the perception would be that people would beg to differ given you kind of [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=429.92s)]
*  have a role with the defence industry, you have been a part of Labour Friends of Israel. I also [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=435.6s)]
*  just want to show a little clip of Palestine Action doing their thing, let's have a little look. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=440.40000000000003s)]
*  Alright, you've had to listen to me speak on for quite a long time. Let's just start then, so [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=448.48s)]
*  you've got this, let's just talk about the fact with, shall we, with say Labour Friends of Israel, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=462.08000000000004s)]
*  so Lord Walney's gone to Israel on trips paid by Labour Friends of Israel, so in 2011, he also in [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=468.72s)]
*  2011 attended the 10th anniversary of the British-Israel Communications Research Centre, BICOM, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=476.0s)]
*  which is the main pro-Israel lobbying group in Britain. 2011-2013, he was Chair of Labour [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=481.28s)]
*  Friends of Israel. 2018, he went to Israel paid for the Australia-Israel Cultural Exchange Limited. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=486.24s)]
*  2024, again, went to Israel paid by the European Leadership Network, which was created in 2007 to [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=492.4s)]
*  counter the widespread criticism of Israel in Europe. Shall we just start with this? What do we [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=499.76s)]
*  think that that tells us? Well, I think the first thing it tells us is that he's not very [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=505.28s)]
*  independent. We're being told that this guy is supposed to be an independent government advisor [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=510.79999999999995s)]
*  who's trying to claim to be impartial and to have applied the response he gave to the Guardian [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=517.68s)]
*  article was that he was applying an objective standard to his fact-finding mission for the past [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=523.6s)]
*  three years or so he says, but clearly he has got huge leanings towards Israel, massively influenced [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=530.08s)]
*  by it. So this is not an impartial report and this is a report that's designed in order to try and [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=537.36s)]
*  recommend things that will be made into British law. So you have to look at the origins and the [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=542.48s)]
*  motivations behind why he would want to write something like this. And if he's getting paid, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=547.2s)]
*  he's going on trips funded by the Israel lobby just a few months ago in January during the middle [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=553.44s)]
*  of a genocide in what he called a solidarity mission, a solidarity mission with a genocidal [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=559.12s)]
*  entity whilst people in Gaza are being massacred and still are to this day. He's getting paid by [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=565.28s)]
*  arms companies through these firms, Leonardo, who supply arms to Israel and we're supposed to [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=570.72s)]
*  believe that that's not going to impact his thinking or his motivations. And when we can see [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=578.24s)]
*  what's coming out in this report and what he's recommending that we should be banned and we're [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=582.96s)]
*  seven months into the Gaza genocide, it shows where is the priority of this government or [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=587.76s)]
*  you know this supposed independent government advisor. People have been calling for an arms [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=594.0s)]
*  embargo. The British people have shown through polls that they want an arms embargo on Israel, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=598.16s)]
*  but rather than entertain that they're talking about banning us, Palestine Action, who've been [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=604.4s)]
*  taking direct action to actually impose somewhat of a people-powered arms embargo where we shut [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=609.04s)]
*  down the weapons companies arming Israel when our government fails to do so because we're not going [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=614.64s)]
*  to sit by and allow a genocide to happen. I mean this man has no integrity and anyone who takes this [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=619.1999999999999s)]
*  seriously I just think is a sham. It's a sham on democracy. It's a sham to the British public [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=624.72s)]
*  that people should have to buy this stuff up, have to read it, have to entertain a report in parliament, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=630.64s)]
*  take it seriously when the motivations are so clearly warped towards the direction, towards [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=636.3199999999999s)]
*  a genocidal entity. And I also say like the way that he's gone about this right so in October, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=642.4s)]
*  and he's constantly been tweeting Palestine Action like constantly and you know you just think he's [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=649.36s)]
*  another Zionist bot by the way that he just keeps tweeting us on Palestine Action and in October he [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=653.92s)]
*  tweeted us saying he tweeted an article in from the Sun about us and said that called his Hamas's [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=660.0799999999999s)]
*  little helpers. This is a senior independent government advisor who's writing a report who's [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=666.72s)]
*  supposedly applying an objective standard and this is what six, seven, you know eight months ago he's [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=672.64s)]
*  calling us Hamas's little helpers. He already knows what he wants out of the report and what where he's [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=678.32s)]
*  leading towards so you know I just think it's a bit of a joke but the problem is it's a joke but [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=682.72s)]
*  it's actually being taken seriously by the establishment at this day. Well yes I think I mean [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=687.36s)]
*  I'm sure Lord Rolland would go well my business interests have nothing to do with what I'm doing [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=692.5600000000001s)]
*  but if this was something he opposed and someone was linked to businesses in a similar way what [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=696.24s)]
*  would he say? I mean you know it's just you know I would love to hear his defense there but I think [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=703.04s)]
*  that other part just is interesting he's tried to jump on Israel lobby and so to conflate that with [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=708.64s)]
*  anti-Semitism. We've seen obviously repeated attempts to conflate critiques of the Israeli [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=713.12s)]
*  state and its cheerleaders with the evil of anti-Semitism. I mean I did an article a few [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=718.88s)]
*  years ago about the role of the Saudi lobby. The fact is there is everyone knows Israel as a state [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=726.72s)]
*  in countries such as Britain there are organized campaigns to promote the interests of Israel and [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=734.16s)]
*  to defend it in the midst not least of a genocide which public opinion is actually really [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=742.08s)]
*  overwhelmingly opposed to according to the polls and new polls just come out showing [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=749.6800000000001s)]
*  the large majority of the public agree with you they want an arms embargo on Israel. So do you know [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=754.24s)]
*  that it's just disingenuous isn't it to say that to say what you're saying here in terms of links [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=758.88s)]
*  to the Israel lobby what does he think labor friends of Israel how do we describe labor friends [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=763.36s)]
*  of Israel that's not the Israel lobby what does he even what does that mean? Well I think it's [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=766.0s)]
*  just when you can't you don't want to face the facts so you just come out with this it's like [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=770.08s)]
*  a knee jerk I'm just going to call them anti-Semitic because I can't answer this and you know we can [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=773.6800000000001s)]
*  like we can we can read we can use Google we can see on the internet that you're being paid by [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=779.6800000000001s)]
*  pro-Israel groups Israel lobby groups to go fly over to Israel. They pay for the tricks to be [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=783.9200000000001s)]
*  clear which is payment in kind yeah yeah yeah and yeah and that is linked to all of these pro-Israel [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=788.8000000000001s)]
*  groups and also you mentioned the Saudi lobby he's gone to Saudi Arabia visited the Saudi Aramco oil [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=794.56s)]
*  site so you know it's got his so he's compromised in that side as well but we would talk about [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=800.8s)]
*  you know the the media even the establishment to a certain degree will admit or talk about the fact [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=808.0799999999999s)]
*  there's an oil lobby or there's an arms lobby right but like but obviously a country's lobby on [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=814.0s)]
*  behalf of their own interests right and we know Israel has been doing this and we know that they've [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=820.88s)]
*  been doing this in the UK and I think this is just exposing the kind of the the impact it has on [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=824.88s)]
*  groups within our within Britain who are opposing these things and when these things are allowed to [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=832.0s)]
*  happen and are ignored and so I am glad that the you know the Guardian picked it up and [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=837.12s)]
*  and is reporting on these things and that we're having this conversation now because [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=842.0s)]
*  we have to see what's behind the motivations to to put out these policies and to call for groups [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=846.56s)]
*  like Palestine Action to be to be banned and also just to say that you know we found out [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=854.7199999999999s)]
*  about this on Saturday at 8 p.m they sent an email to Palestine Action saying can you give [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=861.76s)]
*  us a response in the next couple of hours you know late on a Saturday night and this is the [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=869.04s)]
*  the BBC because this thing's going to come out right we haven't and as far as I know neither [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=874.0s)]
*  of other groups we never saw the report the press have been sent extracts from the reports [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=879.36s)]
*  we haven't seen any of that just the points that the press send us in order to comment and reply [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=885.92s)]
*  to so suddenly so this man is going off to the press rather than actually telling the groups who [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=890.16s)]
*  he's writing about any of the things that he's going to write about and giving them a right to [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=896.64s)]
*  reply or comment on on his supposed fact-finding mission and when we did ask for the you know we've [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=901.36s)]
*  asked since for the report and we've just been told you know you're not going to get it it's [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=909.36s)]
*  going to be published next week and that's that so it's like there's no there's not one bit of this [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=913.2s)]
*  is in any way they can't even pretend it's professional but he will he will defend it [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=918.16s)]
*  by saying well I've written 100 000 words so you have to take me seriously. I mean it's really [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=924.88s)]
*  interesting talking about well kind of something I've often spoken about is how they're trying to [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=930.48s)]
*  turn the world on his head, cheerleaders of of Israel, in that the facts he's called an [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=935.52s)]
*  independent advisor when he's clearly someone who has passionate pro-Israel views he was chair of [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=943.6800000000001s)]
*  Labour Friends of Israel he's repeatedly gone on paid trips to Israel by groups which make it clear [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=952.16s)]
*  they exist to promote Israel in western nations and at the moment I mean if you look at what [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=957.36s)]
*  where British public opinion is at quite correctly 67% of Britons according to a poll two months ago [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=967.84s)]
*  think it's likely Israel has committed war crimes with 10% saying unlikely, a large majority [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=974.96s)]
*  demand an immediate ceasefire and you know a larger you know actually more there's a big [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=982.32s)]
*  lead for Britons who believe that Israel should enter peace negotiations with Hamas a view which [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=989.28s)]
*  if most if any MP spoke could probably end their career but it's just interesting public opinion [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=994.96s)]
*  is you know and you know in America more Americans not think genocide is taking place we haven't had [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=999.52s)]
*  a poll on that in Britain I don't quite understand why I've been asking pollsters for clarity in that [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1004.08s)]
*  one be interesting to see the results but the point is we have a situation where there was a [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1008.4s)]
*  state committing obviously gross gross crimes some of the worst atrocities of the 21st century [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1013.6s)]
*  that on trial in the International Court for Justice for genocide it's extremely likely the [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1020.24s)]
*  International Criminal Court will issue arrest warrants to Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1024.24s)]
*  leaders and you have here a so-called independent advisor appointed by the government after he [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1029.44s)]
*  called for people to vote for them linked to the pro the provisional lobby trying to demand the [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1034.72s)]
*  government then introduce legislation to ban groups taking on this genocide it's insane [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1040.0s)]
*  100% it is it is and that's that's the thing isn't it his interests lie with protecting [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1047.1200000000001s)]
*  the military interests of a genocidal state whilst it's committing a genocide and not with the will [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1053.52s)]
*  of the British people who as you said support an arms embargo on Israel and when you have a [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1059.52s)]
*  government who fails to implement one and continues to arm Israel and not only are they you know arming [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1064.8799999999999s)]
*  Israel one of our main targets as well as Leonardo is Albert Systems which is Israel's biggest [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1071.52s)]
*  weapons manufacturer they have several sites in this country and they they use Gaza as a laboratory [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1077.6s)]
*  for their weaponry so even right now during this current genocide they're testing out new weaponry [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1083.6s)]
*  on the Palestinian people which they'll then put on to the international market you know share the [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1089.36s)]
*  internet intellectual property across the world of its Albert sites and make it killing out of [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1094.4799999999998s)]
*  what they're doing and these these factories are sending weapons right now to Israel so when we [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1099.04s)]
*  are the ones putting ourselves putting our liberty on the line in order to stop these factories from [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1104.6399999999999s)]
*  operating and whilst we accept that we understand that we're going to be criminalized we do not for [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1109.52s)]
*  one second believe that we are doing anything that is either immoral or lawful if anything the [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1115.2s)]
*  opposite even if the state treats us differently but you know but but Lord Wellne or whatever [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1121.04s)]
*  you want to call him I don't like calling him Lord or whatever his name is today is yeah he's just [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1128.72s)]
*  working to protect a genocide basically and put and and make it harder for groups like us to do [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1135.3600000000001s)]
*  what we're doing but that's not going to happen because we're not going to stop and and I think [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1141.52s)]
*  that's that's one of the other things that keeps coming out you know he says there's not enough [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1145.36s)]
*  deterrent for groups like Palestine Action or it's just well and that's just that's just not true [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1149.84s)]
*  right like we have someone who's in prison right now for taking direct action we have people facing [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1154.6399999999999s)]
*  trial like there are consequences for this it's just that people are willing to face those [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1159.36s)]
*  consequences when they're seeing the consequences that these weapons have on the Palestinian people [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1164.4s)]
*  you know yeah it is it is in terms of legally in this country it's already you know quite [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1170.24s)]
*  quite bad but still we're going to take direct action you know they've made a lot of effort to [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1177.92s)]
*  remove defenses and trials so this is just like an extra thing on top of that but I think that [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1182.08s)]
*  just shows that they realize that other things have failed and for us that's also encouraging [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1187.84s)]
*  because they are going to try you know people like John Woodcock and his friends are going to [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1193.6s)]
*  try and do everything in their power to stop you but when you keep going you get closer to victory [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1200.1599999999999s)]
*  and for us that's the key thing to remember and not let them distract us but at the same time we [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1205.1999999999998s)]
*  have to fight back against this because it's just absolute crap yeah and on that I mean I'm sure John [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1209.76s)]
*  Woodcock would not like to be accused of defending a genocide but he defends objectively a military [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1214.1599999999999s)]
*  onslaught which we believe is genocide in which millions of people all over the world well more [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1218.08s)]
*  than that believe to be genocide and history I believe will very clearly adjudicate to be [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1223.2s)]
*  a genocide I mean again you know it's quite interesting how protesters are demonized at the [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1228.32s)]
*  because when people look back at protests in the past though they always side with them so if you [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1234.16s)]
*  look back to the suffragettes people like to think oh I'd be on their side at the time the suffragettes [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1238.64s)]
*  were really hated demonized betrayed as terrorists anarchists you read the parliamentary debates [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1242.88s)]
*  where they're laughing about you know like torturing them and deporting them and killing them [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1247.1200000000001s)]
*  and then you you know you get by the way the suffragettes did far more extreme stuff than [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1251.76s)]
*  protesters today I mean they actually kill people and bomb things for a start but you know it's the [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1255.44s)]
*  same you know LGBTQ activists you know throughout history what I think is quite interesting if you [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1261.2s)]
*  say to the British public because it's so easy to the media and the establishment to demonize [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1266.6399999999999s)]
*  protests like yourself is do you think Israel's committing war crimes yes do you think war crimes [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1270.96s)]
*  should be stopped yes do you think if people have something within their power if it's within their [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1275.12s)]
*  power to do something to stop war crimes they should stop them yes well then you have to [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1278.96s)]
*  support Palestine action there's no other yeah it's not possible to not support Palestine action [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1283.04s)]
*  if you believe that yeah yeah and I think that they've you know we have um I think they failed [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1288.72s)]
*  to also I think he's failed to demonize us in a lot of ways the interview that he did was really [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1294.8s)]
*  bad I mean I think his attempts to demonize Palestine action and also it came across he [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1299.2s)]
*  did seem very insistent and he just kept referring back to Palestine action and [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1304.48s)]
*  that you know the fact that we as he said smash up stuff etc and that he's watching his tweet and all [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1308.8s)]
*  of this it does seem a bit obsessive um and but the the fact is that when these people are confronted [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1314.88s)]
*  with these vested interests that they have they they're stuttering they don't know what to say [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1320.64s)]
*  you know they're stumbled because they they're not expecting to actually be confronted on these [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1326.4s)]
*  things which I think is quite interesting that I think he was shocked that he was even asked about [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1330.8s)]
*  that and I think when the story came out it wasn't mentioned and now it is being you know brought [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1335.04s)]
*  into the conversation which I think is is crucial because we need transparency and what what the [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1340.88s)]
*  real motivations are behind these things and also like what's happening to democracy this is an [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1345.04s)]
*  unelected politician who's received this funding from the arms industry traveled to Israel a few [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1350.08s)]
*  months ago you know and now he's coming out with this like how can this even be allowed and he [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1356.4s)]
*  gets the claim to be independent I mean it is really sinister actually the more you look at [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1361.6000000000001s)]
*  it I mean he's previously called for things like uh you know new police boss to ban protests near [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1365.76s)]
*  parliament and MP's office you can no longer protest against your elected representatives [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1371.44s)]
*  you know it's this attempt to conflate protests with with violence um you know scrutiny basically [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1375.8400000000001s)]
*  any scrutiny it just becomes violent and protests exclusion zones around arms factory and fossil [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1382.96s)]
*  fuel infrastructure also you know for example I mean basically arbitrary attempts for example [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1388.64s)]
*  forced protests to pay for their own uh protest which is it's similar to what was done to trade [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1394.16s)]
*  unions at the beginning of the 20th century where trade unions were made financially liable for [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1399.44s)]
*  them going on strike and attempt to make it impossible to go on strike because it would [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1405.28s)]
*  just financially cripple them and that is you know it's things like it's just an attempt to just [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1408.48s)]
*  abolish the right to protest but I think again people have to look you know kind of I mean he's [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1412.08s)]
*  he's angry about people about things being smashed up yeah has he seen what happened has he seen [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1418.3999999999999s)]
*  what's happened to Gaza has he seen what's happened 70 plus of civilian infrastructure is really [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1422.8s)]
*  damaged destroyed it now looks a different color in text we looked at from space and he's worried [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1426.96s)]
*  about some some property being smashed up uh companies facilitating one of the great crimes [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1430.6399999999999s)]
*  of our age I mean it really is how does he how does he think history is going to look at people [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1435.6799999999998s)]
*  like him I don't think he cares no probably not probably not um but just finally on this [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1439.84s)]
*  look what what do you say because you know labor being run by a bunch of authoritarian weirdos if [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1447.1999999999998s)]
*  I'm honest um you know they previously criticized the government for not clamping down enough on [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1453.6s)]
*  climate protesters so you can see where they're coming from they've said they're not going to [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1458.72s)]
*  repeal various authoritarian bits of legislation already used to throttle protests in this country [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1463.4399999999998s)]
*  what's the strategy now in terms of because what what will happen if he if if the government go [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1469.3600000000001s)]
*  yeah we're criminalizing Palestine action and just apply on all the rest as though your terrorist [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1473.76s)]
*  organizations I mean that's basically you know this is the sort of thing you look at and people [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1477.8400000000001s)]
*  if you see it if people see this happening in other country they saw this happening in pieces [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1482.16s)]
*  Russia they didn't understand what this was um what do you say what's going to happen I mean if [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1485.5200000000002s)]
*  you get if you get banned what what what's the strategy well one of the first things I think is [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1491.3600000000001s)]
*  that actually off the back of this we'll probably get a lot more support and we'll probably get a [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1497.44s)]
*  lot more people joining us and this is what tends to happen when you've singled us out during the [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1501.3600000000001s)]
*  genocide especially to say let's ban this group people look at what Palestine action is doing and [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1505.68s)]
*  go why they want to expand this group especially when it's coming from this guy so I think actually [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1510.96s)]
*  we're going to get a lot more support a lot more people joining us and ultimately we'll find a way [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1515.8400000000001s)]
*  to continue either way and we will continue to shut down these weapons factories I don't know [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1520.24s)]
*  how that's going to look right now and obviously it's very early days we don't know [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1525.8400000000001s)]
*  if the law is going to be introduced what it will look like etc but what I do know is that [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1529.6000000000001s)]
*  you know in Palestine action and and also some other groups as well we have faced raids arrests [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1534.0s)]
*  we've been stopped by counterterrorism police we've had people in prison you know we've had [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1541.1200000000001s)]
*  very lengthy trials defenses taken away from us so we have faced a lot of consequences and we [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1545.92s)]
*  understand that every that we need to overcome every obstacle that is thrown at us in order to [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1551.92s)]
*  be able to get closer to our victory which is shutting it down and stopping these arms companies [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1557.76s)]
*  from supplying Israel and that every time we overcome and we keep going and they fail to stop [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1563.1200000000001s)]
*  us we're closer to winning so ultimately we will continue no matter no no matter what and and I [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1569.52s)]
*  have to say this guy's given his validation he one of his first articles last week he said [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1576.8000000000002s)]
*  Palestine action is causing enormous damage to the arms industry and we'll you know we will [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1581.6s)]

*  in years to come no question when Israel was committing genocide against the Palestinian people [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1602.6399999999999s)]
*  what did you do did you do something or did you not and what you've done is step up more than [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1608.16s)]
*  step up and history will record that and and already you know I've said before about protesters [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLI9qrBZnag&t=1614.3200000000002s)]
