Video Description: Avi Shlaim is one of the great living historians: Professor of International Relations at Oxford University, he's a proud self-described Arab Jew, born in Baghdad in 1945. That heritage has deeply influenced him, and we talk about Zionism, the real history of Israel that is often erased, defying the attempt to start the clock on 7th October, the question of state terrorism, how there could have been a different approach to Hamas, genocide - and why a one state giving equal rights to all is the solution.

His new book, appropriately enough, is 'Three Worlds: Memoirs of an Arab-Jew'.

# "We Need A One State Solution" - Prof. Avi Shlaim Destroys Israel's Myths
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I)
*  Hello, I'm very honoured today to be joined by a very distinguished guest, Professor Avi Slame. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=0.0s)]
*  I know very many of you have been very excited. I gave people a heads up that I'm talking to you [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=4.8s)]
*  today, Avi, so thank you so much for joining me. For those who don't know, very distinguished [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  historian, specialist, of course, in the Middle East, Israel, Zionism. And in the current horror, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  one of the best pieces of work that I've certainly read was by you in Prospect Magazine, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=23.52s)]
*  and that went viral. Avi, firstly, it's a huge honour to be joined by you, so thank you so much [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=28.8s)]
*  for joining us. I just want to start by talking about yourself, if that's okay, because you've [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=34.88s)]
*  got a very fascinating and relevant backstory, and I think we'll end up going full circle with [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=41.2s)]
*  this, actually, by the end. You're Jewish, and you were born in Iraq, so just wondering if you [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  want to tell us just a bit about that history, because it's obviously extremely relevant. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=52.08s)]
*  I was born in Baghdad in 1945 to a Jewish family, and when I was five years old, my family moved to [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=55.68s)]
*  Israel, so I went to school in Israel, and I recently wrote an autobiography, which is called [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=67.36s)]
*  Three Worlds, Memoirs of an Arab Jew. So today, I describe myself as an Arab Jew, and this is a very [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=78.4s)]
*  controversial term in Israel. Israelis say that it's a contradiction in terms. It's an ontological [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=91.6s)]
*  impossibility. If you are a Jew, you cannot be an Arab, and if you're an Arab, you cannot be a Jew. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=100.56s)]
*  Well, I beg to differ, and I can think of no better way of describing my initial identity [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  as that of an Arab Jew. We were Arab Jews in Baghdad. We spoke Arabic at home. We spoke only [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=116.88s)]
*  Arabic at home. Culture was Arab culture. Customs were Arab customs. My parents' music was a nice [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=128.48s)]
*  blend of Jewish and Arabic music, and in Iraq, there was a Jewish community in every Arab state [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=140.72s)]
*  throughout the Arab world, and the Jewish community in Iraq was the most prosperous, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=153.27999999999997s)]
*  the most successful, the most well-integrated community, and it contributed to nation-building [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=162.0s)]
*  at every level, so the Jews were a very positive element in Arab society in the 1930s and 40s. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  This all changed with the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 and the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=183.6s)]
*  defeat of the Arab armies in Palestine. There was a backlash against the Jews, and it was [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=190.48s)]
*  this backlash that uprooted my family and myself, but I still like to describe myself as an Arab [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=199.76s)]
*  Jew, controversial as it is, because I'm proud of being Jewish, and I'm equally proud of being an [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=210.16s)]
*  Arab. I'm proud of my Arab heritage, and I don't see any contradiction between the two, and my [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=220.72s)]
*  memoirs have aroused a lot of interest in the Arab world because anyone who was born after 1948 [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=230.24s)]
*  has no idea that once upon a time there was a very extensive Jewish community that lived in the Arab [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=240.79999999999998s)]
*  world and for the most part lived in harmony with coexistence, and for my family and myself, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=250.56s)]
*  Muslim-Jewish coexistence was not an ideal, was not an abstract idea, it was everyday reality, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=260.8s)]
*  and it is this world that has been, this old world, very happy world, was swept away in the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=269.04s)]
*  20th century by the cold winds of nationalism, and it's that world that I wanted to recreate, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=278.0s)]
*  reanimate in my memoirs, and as you suggested, hopefully we'll end up [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  in a full circle and come back to this idea of Jewish-Muslim coexistence, possibly in one [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=299.84000000000003s)]
*  democratic state in Israel-Palestine. I think that is how we will go full circle. I should also [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=308.8s)]
*  explain by the way, I spoke before I'm in Paris, there's building work currently going on, so I'm [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=315.84s)]
*  signing to myself, which will be to the delight of much of my audience, but we will go full circle [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=320.79999999999995s)]
*  with what you just said by the end. Now I'm just interested in your thoughts about the evolution [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=325.2s)]
*  of Zionism, and I'm interested in this because the left, and this is perhaps something that the left [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=329.2s)]
*  could be self-critical about, but it's a history people don't realise, the lefties have quite a [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=334.32s)]
*  different relationship with Zionism, and indeed when Israel was founded, much of the left [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=338.32s)]
*  supported that. I mean I'm not sure if we can flake the Soviet Union with the left, but the [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=343.6s)]
*  Soviet Union at the time was the first state to draw back the foundation of Israel. People might [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=348.48s)]
*  remember 1985, Neil Kinnick's famous speech where he attacked militant, and Eric Heffer walked off [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=354.08000000000004s)]
*  the stage, very much a left-wing stalwart, also a Zionist. Tony Benn used to denounce the PLO. It's [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=359.68s)]
*  quite interesting that history is often not discussed, and I'm just wondering what you thought [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=366.0s)]
*  about that, how Zionism was originally seen, but whether what we see now is actually the logical [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=370.16s)]
*  end point and evolution of Zionism. It used to have these socialist pretenses, but it was always [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=376.72s)]
*  based on that mass displacement of the Palestinians, the Nakba, which at the time much of the left [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=382.8s)]
*  didn't even talk about. So I'm just wondering what your thoughts about how Zionism was originally [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=387.68s)]
*  seen, and whether its reality was airbrushed, and whether you see it's developed now as its inevitable [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=391.84000000000003s)]
*  end point. Zionism was a liberal ideology, and based on universal values like freedom, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=397.68s)]
*  independence, justice, and equality. And in the 1950s, Israel was indeed a socialist icon, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=412.0s)]
*  and because it was democratic, because it was socialist, because it was progressive, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=424.15999999999997s)]
*  it received a huge amount of international sympathy and support. But Israel has evolved [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=431.12s)]
*  a long way from that early period, and we'll probably come back to that later. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=439.2s)]
*  What happened in reality is that Israel mistreated the Palestinians. Israel embarked on the [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=453.68s)]
*  systematic takeover of Palestine, and a huge gap developed between the Zionist rhetoric, the Zionist [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=462.47999999999996s)]
*  ideal, and the reality of Israel's treatment of the Palestinians on the ground. And the Zionist [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=471.84s)]
*  founding fathers filled this gap with humbug and hypocrisy. Now, Noam Chomsky once said that [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=481.2s)]
*  settler Zionism is the most extreme and vicious form of imperialism. The Palestinians have had [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=498.71999999999997s)]
*  the unique misfortune of being at the receiving end of both Zionist settler colonialism [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=509.76s)]
*  on the one hand, and Western imperialism on the other hand. First, during the British Mandate, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=518.0s)]
*  when it was Britain, and since 1948, it's been American imperialism that has supported the [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=525.84s)]
*  Zionist project. So Zionism was increasing, or rather the state of Israel was increasingly seen [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=533.84s)]
*  as an imperialist power, allied to America. And there is no better demonstration of that [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=543.84s)]
*  perception, critical perception of Israel, than the tragedy that happened in the Middle East. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=553.36s)]
*  And that is unfolding in the Gaza Strip today, not just with American complicity, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=564.08s)]
*  but with American active support for the Israeli massacres. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=570.64s)]
*  I was very struck by something which the brilliant Canadian writer Noamie Klein, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=580.64s)]
*  who's had a big impact on myself and a whole, I'd say, generation of progressive writers and thinkers, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=587.0400000000001s)]
*  she's of course Jewish herself, and she wrote about how the West founded Israel as a form of [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=592.24s)]
*  reparations for the crimes committed against the Jewish people, and obviously within living [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=598.48s)]
*  memory the Holocaust, the attempt to exterminate the entire Jewish population, two-thirds of whom [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=604.24s)]
*  were killed in Europe in a very short space of time. But she said that involved granting a form [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=608.48s)]
*  of exceptionalism, whereby, for example, the forms of colonialism that the West was at that time [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=612.8000000000001s)]
*  increasingly being forced to abandon because of the struggle of the peoples who'd been colonised, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=620.08s)]
*  but Israel almost was given an opt-out out of that, and a form of exceptionalism. There's something [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=626.48s)]
*  actually, Razi Gal, the Israeli-American scholar of genocide and Holocaust I've interviewed, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=631.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean he talks about this, how there's a form of exceptionalism granted in international law [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=638.96s)]
*  to Israel as a consequence. And I was just wondering what you thought about that kind of [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=644.0s)]
*  analysis, I suppose. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=648.08s)]
*  The Holocaust was a uniquely evil and catastrophic event, and it had consequences. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=653.28s)]
*  One of the consequences was to make an unassailable case for an independent Jewish state, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=663.44s)]
*  and in the aftermath of the Second World War there was a Western feeling of guilt towards [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=674.48s)]
*  the Jewish people, and a feeling that [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=687.28s)]
*  they had to be compensated for the Holocaust. Something really major, something titanic, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=693.28s)]
*  had to be done for the Jews in the aftermath of this catastrophe, and that thing was an [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=707.1999999999999s)]
*  independent Jewish state. This explains why the UN voted for the partition of Palestine in 1947, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=714.1600000000001s)]
*  the partition of mandatory Palestine into two states, one Arab, one Jewish. This was very unfair [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=724.5600000000001s)]
*  to the Arabs because the Jews were a minority and they were allocated 55% of mandatory [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=733.76s)]
*  Palestine, so the Arabs rejected partition and went to war. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=741.52s)]
*  And then in the course of the war Israel expanded its borders to 78% of mandatory Palestine. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=750.88s)]
*  So the Holocaust explains a great deal about why Israel came into existence in the first place, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=760.4000000000001s)]
*  and the rather permissive attitude towards Israel and its use of force after it was established. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=770.72s)]
*  But I cannot agree that Israel was granted an exceptional status under international law, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=781.6800000000001s)]
*  because international law is universal. The same rules apply to everybody and they apply to Israel [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=795.2800000000001s)]
*  as well. And it's because of Israel's behavior, because of its use of military force, because of [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=803.68s)]
*  its violations of international law, because of the occupation that it alienated world opinion. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=811.76s)]
*  And today I think that more and more people no longer give Israel this immunity, this exceptional [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=822.0s)]
*  status, because the Holocaust, the Jews were the victims of the Holocaust. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=832.08s)]
*  Whereas today in Gaza it's Israel which is the perpetrator of a genocide of Palestinians. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=840.4000000000001s)]
*  So things have changed very radically and now Israel receives much less immunity [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=851.9200000000001s)]
*  in public opinion because of the Holocaust. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=859.6s)]
*  I'm just interested in, as a historian obviously of this, of Israel, of Zionism, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=865.76s)]
*  the Middle East, the attempt to start the clock on the 7th of October, and obviously 7th of October [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=872.8s)]
*  was a huge trauma, it was a huge trauma for people obviously in Israel and beyond, and it included [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=880.08s)]
*  war crimes, severe war crimes which were committed against innocent Israeli civilians, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=887.3599999999999s)]
*  which no one should be any doubt about. What there's been is obviously often this, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=891.52s)]
*  all the way through, an attempt to say this is when this all began essentially, and everything else, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=898.56s)]
*  apartheid, occupation, mass displacement of the Palestinians from 1948 onwards before arguably. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=903.68s)]
*  I'm just wondering what your thoughts about that and why it's important to have a historical [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=912.4799999999999s)]
*  context both for 7th of October but also to explain everything that happened since. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=916.32s)]
*  It's impossible to make any sense of what is happening today without understanding the [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=926.48s)]
*  historical context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Hamas attack on Israel on the 7th [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=932.88s)]
*  of October was utterly horrific and cannot be justified because it involved the killing of [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=941.92s)]
*  1200 Israelis, mostly civilians, and atrocities were committed. So it was a horrific event which [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=953.12s)]
*  has been denounced and must be denounced. But as the Secretary General of the United Nations [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=964.64s)]
*  said at the time, this attack didn't happen in a vacuum. It happened in the context of [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=974.88s)]
*  56 years of suffocating Israeli occupation. And he went on to say that the context doesn't justify [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=983.76s)]
*  the attack, but it helps to explain it. And the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=998.16s)]
*  Mr. Erdan, immediately launched a vicious personal attack on the Secretary General of [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1005.36s)]
*  the United Nations. He accused him falsely of anti-Semitism. He said nothing that was anti-Semitic. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1011.92s)]
*  He called for his resignation. He appealed to members of the United Nations to stop funding [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1021.04s)]
*  the organization. And he even said that the Secretary General of the UN is a threat to world [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1031.44s)]
*  peace. Now there is nothing new about Israeli hostility towards the UN, but the contrast between [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1040.4s)]
*  the civility, the decency, the humanity of the Secretary General, and the crudeness and the [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1051.68s)]
*  crassness of the Israeli representative is very striking. So I would follow, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1058.0s)]
*  and I have followed in my writing, the example of the Secretary General of the UN [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1071.12s)]
*  in trying to put the war in Gaza in a historical context. And the brief historical context [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1078.8s)]
*  the long historical context will take us back to the Balfour Declaration of 1917. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1088.48s)]
*  But I would like to start with the Israeli occupation of Gaza in 1967. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1095.68s)]
*  And the fact that the Palestinians for 56 years have been living under occupation, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1105.44s)]
*  the most prolonged and brutal military occupation of modern times. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1116.32s)]
*  So this is the everyday reality for Palestinians on the West Bank and Gaza, a brutal military [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1123.84s)]
*  occupation, arbitrary occupation that denies them independence, denies them human rights, denies them [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1131.4399999999998s)]
*  all the basic rights that every people is entitled to. And [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1139.12s)]
*  what Israel experienced on the 7th of October is a very, very extreme and dramatic and painful [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1149.84s)]
*  attack. But it has to be seen against the background of long-standing Palestinian suffering. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1159.2s)]
*  And there is one other point about the context for the Hamas attack. Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1170.4s)]
*  Netanyahu's line to the Israeli public is that he is the guarantor of Israeli security. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1177.2s)]
*  And that the Palestinians are finished, the Palestinians are defeated. Israel has a free hand [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1186.72s)]
*  to do whatever it likes on the West Bank. And as for Gaza, it's contained within the prison of Gaza. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1195.2s)]
*  Gaza is the largest open air prison in the world. And part of his policy was to allow [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1206.96s)]
*  Hamas to govern Gaza. But Gaza was contained, there was an Israeli blockade of Gaza, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1216.24s)]
*  which has been in force for 16 years. And a blockade is a form of collective punishment, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1224.0s)]
*  which is prescribed by international law. After the Hamas attack on Israel, Israel [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1234.3999999999999s)]
*  extended the blockade that had inflicted so much suffering on the Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1242.6399999999999s)]
*  And now they cut off water, food, medical supplies, and fuel. So they use starvation as a weapon [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1250.8s)]
*  of war. This is a new level of brutality, of cruelty, even of sadism. So [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1260.96s)]
*  that is the background to the Hamas attack, because the message that they sent was, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1276.16s)]
*  we are not defeated, we are not finished. And Hamas, it's true that the Palestinian authority [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1283.5200000000002s)]
*  doesn't represent any resistance. Indeed, the Palestinian authority in Ramallah has become [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1292.64s)]
*  a subcontractor for Israeli security. That's why it doesn't enjoy legitimacy. And Hamas said, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1302.0800000000002s)]
*  we are still here. We cannot be ignored. And we continue to lead the national struggle against [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1309.92s)]
*  the occupation. And there was one other reason for the timing of the Hamas attack. And that is [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1320.0800000000002s)]
*  that America persuaded a number of Arab countries, four Arab countries, to sign [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1327.6000000000001s)]
*  the Abraham Accord with the accords with Israel. And America put very strong pressure on Saudi [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1338.3999999999999s)]
*  Arabia to join the circle of the Abraham Accords. And there was a deal that was on the table. It [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1347.12s)]
*  would have taken a few more weeks and Saudi Arabia would have joined the circle of Arab states who [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1354.8s)]
*  are at peace with Israel. And Hamas wanted to prevent that. And indeed, at the very least, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1362.96s)]
*  Saudi Arabia has suspended the attempt to sign a peace agreement with Israel. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1373.44s)]
*  The Abraham Accords represent a stab in the back to the Palestinians, because they give Netanyahu [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1381.68s)]
*  what he wants. Netanyahu's line is that Israel can make peace with the Arab states without making [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1388.72s)]
*  any concessions to the Palestinians. And he seemed to be vindicated. But now, as a result of the [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1398.88s)]
*  Hamas attack, it is clear that the Arab world cannot continue to ignore the Palestinians, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1407.44s)]
*  and that the Palestinians are going to continue to put up resistance to the occupation. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1415.2s)]
*  I'm interested in how you termed Israel's onslaught against Gaza State terrorism. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1422.72s)]
*  Terrorism has been used by Western states basically to claim their violence is legitimate, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1428.4s)]
*  moral, and in contrast to their opponents. It's a very politicized term, terrorism. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1432.64s)]
*  It is interesting actually in the context of the so-called Dajah doctrine developed in the 2006 [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1437.68s)]
*  Lebanon war, in which essentially Israeli strategy is to inflict terrible damage on civilian [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1443.44s)]
*  populations with terrible civilian fatalities in order in the context of Lebanon to get them to [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1452.0800000000002s)]
*  put pressure on Hezbollah and in Gaza to put pressure on Hamas. And a very brilliant Israeli [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1458.88s)]
*  Palestinian publication called 972 magazine actually used [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1466.3200000000002s)]
*  they spoke to sources of military intelligence to kind of confirm this was actually happening. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1474.0800000000002s)]
*  But I'm just interested in that. Your view on state terrorism, Israel, given obviously the [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1477.6000000000001s)]
*  official claim of Israel is that this is self-defense, that they're waging self-defense [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1483.3600000000001s)]
*  to shut down terrorism. So just what's your thoughts on how terrorism is used and why we [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1487.3600000000001s)]
*  should talk about state terrorism? Terrorism is the use of military force against civilians [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1492.32s)]
*  for a political purpose. And a Hamas attack on Israeli civilians is a form of terrorism. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1502.8s)]
*  And an Israeli attack on Palestinian civilians in Gaza for political purposes is a form, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1514.88s)]
*  in my book, is a form of state terrorism. Now Israel claims that it has the right to self-defense [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1525.04s)]
*  and all its Western allies like Biden, like Rishi Sunak, like [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1535.36s)]
*  Sir Keir Starmer repeat parrot fashion that Israel has the right to defend itself. But it doesn't [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1546.6399999999999s)]
*  under international law because although Israel withdrew unilaterally from the Israeli government [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1556.32s)]
*  withdrew unilaterally from Gaza in 2005, it is still the occupying power because it controls [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1563.76s)]
*  access by land, sea and air to Gaza. So Israel is the occupying power and you have the right [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1571.92s)]
*  to self-defense if the attack comes from another state or if the attack comes, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1578.72s)]
*  but you don't have the right to self-defense if the attack comes from an area under occupation. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1586.72s)]
*  To put it more simply, Israel doesn't have the right to self-defense against the people [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1596.72s)]
*  that it occupies. And therefore I call the Israeli attacks on Gaza, this is by my count, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1604.1599999999999s)]
*  this is the sixth Israeli military offensive in Gaza and all of them are acts of state terrorism [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1613.6s)]
*  in as much as they are directed not against Hamas but against the people of Gaza as a whole. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1622.8s)]
*  And if I may, I'd like to refer to the first Israeli attack on Gaza, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1630.6399999999999s)]
*  Operation Cast Lead in late December 2008 and early January 2009. That was Operation Cast Lead. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1638.88s)]
*  There is the Goldstone Report about that operation and it's a very impressive report, very detailed [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1652.0s)]
*  account of 33 Israeli episodes and many Israeli war crimes and the conclusion is that the Israeli [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1660.32s)]
*  attack on Gaza was in a broader sense an attack on the people of Gaza and its aim was to punish, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1670.0s)]
*  punish, humiliate and terrorize the people of Gaza. And this current offensive in Gaza [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1680.72s)]
*  is also intended to terrorize, to punish and to terrorize the people of Gaza. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1691.84s)]
*  And the strongest argument is the one that you mentioned, the Dahir Doctrine. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1701.52s)]
*  This is a doctrine that was developed by the IDF during the second war in Lebanon and what it says [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1709.52s)]
*  is that Israel is entitled to inflict very, very severe damage and suffering on civilians [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1719.28s)]
*  for the purpose of denying the resources, denying their support to [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1727.6s)]
*  in that, in Lebanon it was Hezbollah, in Gaza it's Hamas. So under the Dahir Doctrine Israel is [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1735.6s)]
*  entitled to cause massive carnage and damage to civilian infrastructure and buildings [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1752.48s)]
*  in order to turn the population against Hamas. But this war has been counterproductive and [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1766.56s)]
*  self-defeating because the Israeli atrocities and inhuman behavior towards the civilians in Gaza [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1777.6s)]
*  has turned the people of Gaza not against Hamas but against Israel. And public opinion shows [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1791.28s)]
*  that if there was a Palestinian election today, Fatah will receive 16% and Hamas would receive [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1800.3999999999999s)]
*  60%. So Israel has failed in its aim of using military force against civilians in order to turn [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1810.72s)]
*  them against Hamas. In terms of Hamas, and I think some people find this challenging, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1819.12s)]
*  they would have found it challenging before the 7th of October attacks and they certainly would [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1828.7199999999998s)]
*  find it more challenging now, controversial to discuss this, but it's about the relationship [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1832.4799999999998s)]
*  between or the approach towards Hamas I suppose. When Hamas won the elections in 2006, which they [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1837.28s)]
*  won partly because, well in large part because of huge disillusionment with Fatah, which had [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1844.88s)]
*  previously dominated, who were widely perceived as corrupt and essentially had become appendages of [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1849.3600000000001s)]
*  the Israeli occupation. That's how many Palestinians in the West Bank came to see Fatah. So Hamas kind [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1855.68s)]
*  of came to power partly because people were fed up with Fatah basically. But that caused then a [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1861.3600000000001s)]
*  siege of Gaza, which is the longest such siege in modern times. But actually your view is actually [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1868.24s)]
*  there could have been a different approach. And the reason, you know, people go back to the charter [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1876.64s)]
*  of Hamas and say, well look, Hamas just want to wipe out Israel and so on. But actually they're [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1880.0800000000002s)]
*  more complicated and fluid than that, aren't they? In the way that they've been portrayed. And actually, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1886.0800000000002s)]
*  you know, we're going to build a coalition here. Tony Blair of all people, not someone I normally [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1891.44s)]
*  quote, on the Middle East certainly. But he actually, back in 2017, he said it was wrong [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1895.76s)]
*  for the West to have boycotted Hamas in the aftermath of their win. And there should have [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1904.24s)]
*  been a different approach. It was actually, you know, if even Tony Blair can say it, then why [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1909.84s)]
*  can't we? But I'm just wondering, what are your thoughts on that? Because I think people will [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1914.24s)]
*  find this challenging. I think it's a very interesting thing to talk about. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1917.6s)]
*  Oh, and I'm so glad that you brought up the Palestinian elections of January 2006, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1920.64s)]
*  because most people have never heard of it. And it's never mentioned in the current discourse [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1930.24s)]
*  about Gaza. So the simple fact is that in January 2006, there was an all-Palestine elections, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1941.6s)]
*  and Hamas won an absolute majority, not just in Gaza, but in the West Bank as well. An absolute [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1954.24s)]
*  majority in what was generally recognized as a fair and free election. And Hamas went on to form [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1964.0s)]
*  a government, and it was a moderate government, despite the charter. Once Hamas was in power, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1975.44s)]
*  it had adopted the parliamentary role to power, and it won power, legitimately. Once it was in [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1982.56s)]
*  power, it moderated its program, and it called for negotiations with Israel on a long-term [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=1991.12s)]
*  truth. Could be 20 years, 30 years, 40 years, and Israel refused to negotiate. And the United States [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2002.0s)]
*  and European Union and Britain and Prime Minister Tony Blair, to their eternal shame, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2013.1200000000001s)]
*  backed Israel in refusing to recognize the democratically elected government, and they [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2023.1200000000001s)]
*  resorted to economic warfare to undermine the Hamas government. And worse was to come [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2030.48s)]
*  is the Palestine papers, a cache of 1,600 documents that were leaked to Al Jazeera, [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2042.48s)]
*  revealed there was a plot against Hamas, and a secret committee was set up. It was called the [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2050.96s)]
*  Gaza Committee, and on it were represented Fatah, Israel, Britain, America, and Egyptian [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2057.7599999999998s)]
*  intelligence. And the aim was to isolate, weaken Hamas, and Israel and America armed Fatah and [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2066.72s)]
*  encourage Fatah to launch, to mount a coup d'etat in order to capture power and drive Hamas out of [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2081.76s)]
*  power. And Hamas preempted the coup against it by seizing power in Gaza. Now, the attitude of the [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2092.5600000000004s)]
*  Western powers is very revealing during this critical period. They say that they support [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2105.44s)]
*  democracy and they promote democracy. Here was an example of Arab democracy, a shining example [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2113.44s)]
*  of Arab democracy, for the incredible achievement for the Palestinians to have democracy under the [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2122.4s)]
*  conditions of military occupation. But the Western powers in Israel said the people had spoken, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2128.64s)]
*  but the people had voted for the wrong bunch of politicians, and therefore they didn't recognize [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2141.6s)]
*  them. This reminds me of something that Bertroth Brecht said after the workers' uprising in East [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2147.44s)]
*  Germany in 1953. If the government doesn't like the people, the government should dissolve the [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2156.32s)]
*  people and elect another. That's one of my favorite quotes which I often refer to. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2165.92s)]
*  Now, I mean, in terms of, I mean, it's interesting, I've been talking a lot at the moment about South [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2178.0800000000004s)]
*  Africa's case against Israel, accusing Israel of genocide, taking Israel to the International Court [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2182.32s)]
*  of Justice. It's one of the most chilling documents I've ever read in my entire life, a very thorough, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2189.52s)]
*  loyally piece. One of the things, it looks at acts, conduct, and it also looks at language. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2197.92s)]
*  And it is striking. I mean, again, I keep mentioning Ra'si Gal, the Israeli-American [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2204.88s)]
*  associate professor of Holocaust and genocide studies, but he said it's very rare for genocidal [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2210.4s)]
*  intent, regardless of what people think about conduct, for genocidal intent to be so explicitly [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2214.6400000000003s)]
*  spoken on so many multiple occasions. And since that document came out, there have been so many [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2220.6400000000003s)]
*  other examples of genocidal incitement, which is illegal under the 1948 Genocide Convention. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2226.2400000000002s)]
*  A state is duty-bound to prosecute those who use public platforms to incite genocide. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2232.08s)]
*  But I'm just interested what you think about that. Is that kind of, does this just basically, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2237.3599999999997s)]
*  kind of, this is the inevitable consequence of any form of settler colonialism? You get a colonizer, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2242.24s)]
*  it takes the land of the people who don't want their land taken off them, you get forms of [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2247.8399999999997s)]
*  violence, which then are met with terrible repression, which then feeds more violence [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2252.08s)]
*  in a asymmetric way. And you get this cycle where eventually the occupying settler state essentially [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2257.68s)]
*  just adopts an increasingly genocidal posture. I don't know, what are your thoughts about that? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2265.12s)]
*  Has this emerged innately from Zionism or is this, could a different outcome have been achieved? [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2269.92s)]
*  Settler colonialism has its own dynamic. It's not like any other form of colonialism [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2280.24s)]
*  where there is a metropole, people from that country go and occupy and live in another country [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2291.68s)]
*  and they have a home to go back to. Settler colonialism is different and Zionism was a [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2300.2400000000002s)]
*  settler colonial movement from the beginning. And the logic of settler colonialism, since there is [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2309.28s)]
*  another people on the land, is to eliminate that people. The rhetoric was very different. The rhetoric [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2319.6s)]
*  was developing Palestine for the benefit of both peoples, but the reality was that it was a Jewish [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2327.8399999999997s)]
*  exclusive settler colonial movement which after 1917 embarked on the systematic takeover of [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2335.36s)]
*  Palestine. So you either carry out the ethnic cleansing of Palestine, [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2346.0s)]
*  and this is what Israel has been doing systematically. In 1948 there was the first [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2357.68s)]
*  Nakba. Three quarters of a million Palestinians became refugees. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2368.0s)]
*  Now we are on the verge of a second Nakba. What is utterly [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2376.8s)]
*  horrific is the genocidal rhetoric that we hear in Israel. It's increasing all the time. It's not one [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2387.84s)]
*  or two people and it's not marginal people. It's from the president down. The president of Israel [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2397.28s)]
*  said there are no innocent people in Gaza. Well Israel has just massacred over 22,000 people. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2404.88s)]
*  Two-thirds of them are women and children. And [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2414.8s)]
*  there have been so many other explicit genocidal statements. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2422.08s)]
*  One rabbi talked about dropping an atomic bomb on Gaza as an option. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2428.56s)]
*  And there is a majority in Israeli public opinion for an expulsion of all the people [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2436.24s)]
*  in Gaza. All 2.3 million people. And this is not just loose talk. There is a plan [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2443.44s)]
*  that was of the Israeli Ministry of Intelligence dated 13th of October which favors the expulsion [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2457.44s)]
*  of the population of Gaza to northern Sinai against Egyptian opposition. Egypt is opposed [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2468.16s)]
*  to ethnic cleansing. Jordan is opposed to ethnic cleansing. But the direction of Israeli policy [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2477.92s)]
*  seems to be pointing towards ethnic cleansing because the civilians in Gaza were pushed from [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2484.64s)]
*  the north to the south and now they are concentrated in an ever narrower area near the border with [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2494.24s)]
*  Gaza. And the Minister of Finance, Zbitt Shail Smotrich, has said that openly that the [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2502.7999999999997s)]
*  Palestinian population of Gaza should be reduced from 2.3 million to maybe 100 or 200,000. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2513.7599999999998s)]
*  So I don't think ever in history there's been so much evidence of rhetorical support [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2523.28s)]
*  for genocide which shows a definite intention to commit genocide. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2534.32s)]
*  And what is very worrying in all this is the demonizing of the Palestinian people. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2545.12s)]
*  Increasingly, and the distinction is not made between Hamas and the Palestinian people in general. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2553.7599999999998s)]
*  More and more Israeli ministers are referring to the Palestinians as Nazis. And this is what [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2564.7999999999997s)]
*  happened in Nazi Germany. First came the demonization of the Jews and then came the [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2573.84s)]
*  Holocaust. And I'm extremely worried that this dehumanization of the Palestinian people [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2582.08s)]
*  as a whole is paving the way to ethnic cleansing and in more extreme terms to [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2589.76s)]
*  genocide. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2597.84s)]
*  Just before we go full circle, let me go, we talk about what happens next and prospects for [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2605.6800000000003s)]
*  well, something which emerges from this horror which can provide the only solution which is [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2612.2400000000002s)]
*  a lasting peace which offers security and happiness to Jews, Palestinians on the basis of a shared [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2619.1200000000003s)]
*  land. But before I just ask you, we talk about that. One of the bleakest things, I look at the [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2627.12s)]
*  polling in Israel of the Israeli Jewish population where most think not enough fire power has been [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2631.8399999999997s)]
*  used. A large majority support the ethnic cleansing of Gaza. One of the reasons I find that so bleak, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2640.0s)]
*  it is very important to say millions of Jewish people don't live in Israel. I mean, if we look [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2646.4s)]
*  in the US, the Jewish population is more progressive than the average American and a whole generation [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2650.24s)]
*  of younger Jews are at the forefront of the solidarity in Palestine at the moment. I think [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2655.6s)]
*  that's something which would worry and disturb Israel very much. Younger Jews turning away from [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2661.36s)]
*  Israel in the United States and the US is so instrumental to allowing Israel to continue [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2666.64s)]
*  to behave as it does. The reason I find it so bleak looking at that is the left as we understand [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2671.52s)]
*  it would not exist without Jewish people. And that's one of the reasons actually particularly [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2676.3199999999997s)]
*  in the 20th century, early 20th century, anti-Semites partly used the fact that Jews were [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2681.6s)]
*  always overrepresented in the left and in movements for emancipation, liberation, social justice, [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2687.44s)]
*  to hate Jewish people even more. I mean, the Nazis obviously spoke about an international Bolshevik [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2693.04s)]
*  conspiracy. The German left, obviously again, Jews were overrepresented. And I'm just thinking just [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2697.92s)]
*  in terms of that form of humanism, Jewish humanism and the left are so intertwined. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2703.2s)]
*  And in a way Israel's had to wage war against it, hasn't it? And one of the reasons people like [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2709.84s)]
*  yourself often get the wrath of apologists for Israel as a Jewish person who speaks out against [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2715.44s)]
*  what Israel is doing is you're a reminder of that tradition which in a sense Israel has sought [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2722.4s)]
*  to marginalise. I'm just wondering what your thoughts about that are. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2728.88s)]
*  I'm not a practicing Jew, but as I said earlier, I'm proud of being Jewish. And as I understand it, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2732.8799999999997s)]
*  the three principle pillars of Judaism are truth, justice and peace. And I look at [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2742.3999999999996s)]
*  the present government in Israel, at Netanyahu himself, and he doesn't represent any of these [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2753.7599999999998s)]
*  values. He's a corrupt and mendacious politician who stands trial on serious charges of corruption. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2765.2799999999997s)]
*  And one of the reasons that he's fighting this war and a long war, as he says, in the way that he [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2778.0s)]
*  does is because once the fighting stops, the countdown will start for the end of his premiership [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2786.24s)]
*  and if he's indicted, he's likely to end up in prison. So this is the kind of person [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2796.0s)]
*  who leads Israel today and he personifies the ugliest, the most brutal, the most [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2803.7599999999998s)]
*  racist, the most xenophobic aspect of the worst kind of Zionism. But he's one person, then [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2813.92s)]
*  his coalition partners, one coalition partner is [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2826.72s)]
*  Itamar Ben-Gvir, who is the Minister of Internal Security, and he is the leader of [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2833.7599999999998s)]
*  a party called Jewish Power. The name itself is a fascist and he himself is an outright [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2845.92s)]
*  outright fascist, whose hero was Rabbi Kahane, [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2855.2000000000003s)]
*  whose party had been outlawed. And another hero of Ben-Gvir was Baruch Goldstein, who had committed a [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2865.6800000000003s)]
*  massacre of 28 Palestinian worshippers in the mosque in Hebron. And there is Betzalel Smotrich, [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2875.12s)]
*  who is a declared [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2892.88s)]
*  homophobe and an extreme Jewish supremacist. And those two are calling for the ethnic cleansing [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2898.8s)]
*  of Palestine, not just from Gaza, but from the West Bank as well. So you have an Israeli government, [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2910.8s)]
*  which is the most right-wing and racist government in Israel's history, the most [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2918.16s)]
*  pro-settler and also the most Jewish supremacist government. So Zionism has evolved over the years [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2926.16s)]
*  and it had a liberal phase, it had the socialist phase in the 1950s that I mentioned earlier. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2940.0s)]
*  But today it has moved to the extreme right and it's a really reactionary, discriminatory, [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2946.88s)]
*  racist, expansionist form of Zionism. This is what Israel is today and that is why [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2954.4s)]
*  more and more young people in particular have turned against Israel. And as you said, [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2968.96s)]
*  in America it's not just younger Jews, but the whole community has shifted its attitude towards [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2976.24s)]
*  Israel. And so what we have is a disconnect in the West between the governments, the European [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2986.56s)]
*  governments, British government, American government, the governments that remain almost [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=2996.3999999999996s)]
*  blindly and uncritically pro-Israeli, and the public which is increasingly pro-Palestinians and [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3002.72s)]
*  increasingly critical of Israel. So we have this disconnect and one reason that I have for optimism, [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3012.16s)]
*  a very limited reason, is that public opinion has shifted very dramatically in the last three months [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3025.84s)]
*  because of the Israeli actions in Gaza and in the long term [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3034.7200000000003s)]
*  Western foreign policy is bound to catch up with public opinion. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3042.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean that I certainly think is something which is hopeful and something which Israel should be [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3049.44s)]
*  very worried about because I mean I think a whole generation, huge numbers of people, [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3053.44s)]
*  not just young people, you're quite right, I think they're politicised by what they're seeing [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3058.88s)]
*  and I think the dam will eventually break there. But in terms of the future prospects, because as [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3064.0s)]
*  I've said there's only one lasting piece here and that's where this land is shared by Jews, by [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3069.68s)]
*  Palestinians, of Muslim predominantly but also Christian and other religions and those of [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3076.88s)]
*  no religion. But I mean it seems so utopian this idea of a single democratic state which I'm [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3082.08s)]
*  fascinated at, I mean it automatically that's what appeals to people like myself, a single democratic [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3087.6800000000003s)]
*  state where all have equal rights because we see you know Gaza may be left inhospitable, its population [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3091.92s)]
*  driven out, what survives of it. In the West Bank we're seeing this huge level of just state [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3099.28s)]
*  terror again against the Palestinian population, the illegal settlements in any case which make it [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3106.72s)]
*  a viable Palestinian state impossible and you know it's been put to me that you know even if [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3113.2s)]
*  you've got an Israeli state which tries to dismantle those settlements to basically get civil war in [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3117.68s)]
*  Israel that would be essentially what would happen. And also there's just too much fury and anger now, [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3122.48s)]
*  so many Palestinians have seen what Israel have done and it is doing and on the other side you [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3128.8799999999997s)]
*  get many Israeli Jews will say well they'll know after what they've done that they risk [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3135.04s)]
*  terrible, terrible vengeance and they've seen 7th of October so it's not exactly an abstraction. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3141.84s)]
*  So then how could there ever be the democratic secular state where everyone has equal rights [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3147.84s)]
*  which would encapsulate, you know your background, your heritage shows what is possible [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3153.7599999999998s)]
*  but could it ever be possible and how do we get there? [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3160.0s)]
*  There used to be a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and it's the two-state [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3165.7599999999998s)]
*  solution and there's been a massive international consensus behind a two-state solution [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3175.12s)]
*  but it has become fashionable to say that the two-state solution is dead. Why is it dead? [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3185.92s)]
*  It's because Israel killed it with the settlements. If you want a two-state solution [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3193.92s)]
*  that means a Palestinian state with on the West Bank and Gaza with the capital city in East Jerusalem [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3203.1200000000003s)]
*  that is 22% of historic Palestine. It's not asking very much. It's asking for an independent [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3212.96s)]
*  Palestinian state on a fifth of the homeland and by signing up to the Oslo Accord in 1993 [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3222.7200000000003s)]
*  the PLO accepted the two-state solution but it was not to be because Israel continued to accept [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3232.08s)]
*  settlements on the West Bank and Israel built the so-called security barrier on the West Bank [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3240.4s)]
*  and Israel by its own territorial expansion has killed the two-state solution. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3251.6s)]
*  I believe that the two-state solution was never born because no Israeli government since 1967 [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3259.84s)]
*  have offered a formula for a two-state solution that is acceptable that would be acceptable even [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3270.56s)]
*  to the most moderate Palestinian leader and no American government has ever put any serious [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3280.96s)]
*  pressure on Israel to move towards a two-state solution. So today there is no possibility of [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3289.76s)]
*  a two-state solution and Israel rejects it utterly and totally. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3299.52s)]
*  So what are the alternatives today? The alternatives are more of the same continuing [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3306.08s)]
*  Israeli occupation which by necessity would become more and more brutal and would involve [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3315.44s)]
*  more and more ethnic cleansing and Israel is already an important partner in the two-state [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3323.28s)]
*  solution and Israel is already an apartheid state and this would carry apartheid to a new and more [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3333.04s)]
*  brutal form. That's one alternative. The status quo plus the current Israeli agenda of destroying [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3344.48s)]
*  Hamas altogether and depopulating Gaza, that's one alternative. It's not acceptable to me [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3360.48s)]
*  and the other alternative, the one that I support, is one state [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3369.2799999999997s)]
*  from the River Jordan to the Mediterranean Sea with equal rights for all its citizens [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3378.0s)]
*  regardless of religion and ethnicity. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3384.8799999999997s)]
*  I would add that the reality today is one state with Israel dominating the whole area [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3391.7599999999998s)]
*  and this is not a democracy, it's an ethnocracy, it's a political system in which [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3403.44s)]
*  one ethnic group dominates the other and the Israeli government as I've already said is the most [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3408.64s)]
*  overtly Jewish supremacist government in history. Israel is the only member state [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3415.44s)]
*  of the United Nations that I know which is officially racist. Why do I say this? [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3426.72s)]
*  I say it because the Jewish nation state law of July 2018 says that the Jews have a unique [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3434.48s)]
*  right to self-determination in the state of Israel so that creates two categories of people, [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3448.0s)]
*  Jews who are superior and Arabs who are inferior. That's racist but the present government has gone [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3456.48s)]
*  even further than that racist law because the policy guidelines of the present government say [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3466.1600000000003s)]
*  Jews have an exclusive right to self-determination in the whole land of Israel that includes the [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3475.44s)]
*  West Bank. So now this government denies any Palestinian national rights and this brings [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3483.84s)]
*  you back to the solution that would be acceptable to me and that is one democratic state with equal [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3494.48s)]
*  rights. This would seem like an impossible dream, maybe it is an impossible dream but [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3503.68s)]
*  it's a noble vision and it's a democratic vision and moreover because of the history of my family [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3515.04s)]
*  and of the Jews of Iraq when Muslim Jewish coexistence was the everyday reality, [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3529.2s)]
*  was the normal thing, that experience enables me to think of a better future for our region [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3536.72s)]
*  than the one that we see today. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3548.1600000000003s)]
*  I believe that more and more people would come to see this way, to see one state with equal rights [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3556.56s)]
*  as the only viable formula and the only formula that would ensure security for Israel and safety [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3567.52s)]
*  for the Jews because Israel was created as a haven for the Jews anywhere but today Israel is [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3581.04s)]
*  the least safe place for Jews in the world and Israel demands 100% security for itself which [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3588.8s)]
*  translates into 100% insecurity for the Palestinians and that Israel would never have security [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3599.36s)]
*  unless there is Palestinian independence and equal rights and my only solution, my only [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3610.24s)]
*  formula, the only formula I can think of that would provide peace and security [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3624.16s)]
*  for both people is the one state and one final point is that Israel has been demonizing the [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3632.56s)]
*  Palestinians, calling them terrorists, not just Hamas but the entire Palestinian people. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3641.76s)]
*  I regard Palestinians as a normal people, as a people which like any other people in the world [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3649.52s)]
*  would like to live in peace, in freedom and dignity on its homeland. Israel has prevented [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3658.08s)]
*  them, the Palestinians, from achieving this goal and one state would enable the Palestinians to [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3667.04s)]
*  realize their basic rights. I think that's a wonderful place to end, I mean it's been such [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3674.7999999999997s)]
*  an honour to have you, an honour for lots of different reasons and obviously providing us [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3682.8s)]
*  with a crucial historical context which I mean our media, particularly the British media, [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3690.7200000000003s)]
*  it all serves the public because it often treats news events as though they, you know, [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3697.28s)]
*  things day one was last week but that's particularly pernicious when it comes to something [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3702.4s)]
*  you know like when we're talking about Israel and Palestine but the other reason it's such an [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3708.2400000000002s)]
*  honour to have you is the most important two words for me since this current round of horror has [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3714.0s)]
*  began is moral clarity and you've shown I think moral clarity in spades throughout everything [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3719.6800000000003s)]
*  that you've said and I think moral clarity as I've said is crucial when we're talking about all this. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU1H7I3dE-I&t=3727.36s)]
