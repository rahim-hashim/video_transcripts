# PROOF Israel Deliberately Killing Aid Workers
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtkCMznHeCw)
*  Israel's genocidal campaign against Gaza has many pillars to it, and one of them has
*  been the execution of a strategy described by Israel's former head of the country's
*  National Security Council, Giora Ireland, who is now advisor to Defense Minister Yoav
*  Gallem. When at the very start of this horror, he endorsed the Israeli siege on Gaza with
*  the advice, the people should be told that they have two choices, to stay and starve
*  or leave. He declared Israel needs to create what he declared was a severe humanitarian
*  crisis in Gaza, demanding that Gaza becomes an area where people cannot live, that Israel
*  must create in Gaza such a terrible, unbearable situation that can last weeks and months.
*  Now, as part of his strategy to make this happen, he wrote that as well as the total
*  cutting off of the essentials of life, as Defense Minister Yoav Gallem had ordered,
*  that to make that happen, he said, in order to make the siege effective, we have to prevent
*  others from giving assistance to Gaza. Listen to that again. We have to prevent others from
*  giving assistance to Gaza. Very important. That has meant in practice, the mass slaughter
*  of aid workers. Indeed, at least 254 aid workers are known to have been killed. The
*  biggest slaughter of aid workers ever recorded in any conflict in such a short space of time
*  ever. Indeed, by the beginning of April, that is the beginning of last month, Israel had
*  killed more aid workers in Gaza, a strip of land no bigger than East London, than in all
*  of the countries in the rest of the world combined in any of the last 30 years. Now,
*  I'm going to revisit a notorious example with some evidence, which for some reason has been
*  completely disregarded. But let's first start with a new report from Human Rights Watch,
*  which looks at aid strikes and aid workers convoys in premises, even though aid groups
*  gave their coordinates to these radio authorities to ensure their protection. None of the aid
*  workers were given advance warnings. None of the aid organizations before these attacks got such
*  warnings, in which at least 31 aid workers and those with them were killed or injured.
*  Let's listen to Belkis Willey from Human Rights Watch talking about this on Democracy Now.
*  Now, we want such example. On the 18th of January, three people were injured in an Israeli
*  attack while staying in a joint guest house belonging to two aid organizations, likely carried
*  out with a US-made made munition delivered by an F-16 aircraft which uses British-made components.
*  Now, the victims of the attacks include the aid agencies Médecins Sans Frontières, who suffered
*  attacks on a convoy, shelter and a guest house separately, on UNRWA, the main humanitarian
*  agency in Gaza, that's the UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees, which Israel has raised an
*  unevident smear campaign against, with attacks on a guest house and a convoy, as well as an attack
*  on a guest house belonging to the International Rescue Committee, headed by the former Labour
*  politician David Miliband and medical aid for Palestinians. Now, there's new analysis by
*  Forensic Architecture, a research agency based at Goldsmiths, the University of London.
*  Their analysis of reported data identifies at least 80 separate attacks by Israel on aid
*  in Gaza since January. They write,
*  They have a disclaimer, they say these findings are preliminary and non-exhaustive.
*  What is the combined consequence of these attacks? It deters, of course, aid agencies from doing
*  their life-saving work, because they know they are placing their aid workers in danger, as well as,
*  of course, deterring Palestinian civilians for looking for aid. The combined consequences?
*  More starvation and Palestinians deprived of the essentials of life. Now, let's revisit the World
*  Central Kitchen massacre at the beginning of April, when seven aid workers were killed
*  in Gaza, foreign aid workers, largely. It does not and should not detract from the horror of
*  what happened to these aid workers, to point out that the presence of Westerners amongst these
*  fatalities gave their deaths international attention. Palestinian aid workers who have
*  been butchered have been routinely ignored, their deaths that is. Now, this massacre is telling,
*  World Central Kitchen worked with the so-called Israel Defense Forces. In this case, they offered
*  up their coordinates on a pre-approved route. Their trucks had massive World Central Kitchen
*  logons on them. There were no armed men in the convoy, we'll come on to that. The vehicles in
*  the convoy were far apart. They were then methodically attacked one by one. The first attacks,
*  the survivors go to the next vehicle. That was then attacked. Then the survivors go to the final
*  vehicle. During the attack, the IDF was radioed to tell them the convoy was being attacked. The
*  final vehicle attacked, everybody killed. Now, the Israeli whitewash was, sorry, investigation was a
*  whitewash, in which the authorities declared that it was a grave mistake, but there had been no
*  intentional harm with officers dismissed, but no criminal action taken against them.
*  Having listened to the information I've given you there, just take a moment to absorb what I just
*  said. In a statement, World Central Kitchen declared that the IDF preliminary investigation found
*  that the IDF had deployed deadly force without regard to its own protocols, chain of command,
*  and rules of engagement. The IDF has acknowledged that our teams followed all proper communications
*  procedures. The IDF's own video fails to show any cause of the fire in our personnel convoy,
*  which carried no weapons and posed no threats. They added, we demand the creation of an
*  independent commission to investigate the killings of our WCK colleagues. The IDF cannot credibly
*  investigate its own failure in Gaza. Well, indeed. Now, who was, let's come on to this, shall we,
*  who was the most senior IDF commander in this attack on the World Central Kitchen convoy?
*  He's a man named Colonel Noci Mandel. He's a far right extremist and a settler in the illegally
*  occupied West Bank. Two and a half months before the attack, he signed an open letter directed at
*  the Israeli War Cabinet and the IDF Chief of Staff, which implored them to do everything in
*  your power, not to allow humanitarian supplies and the operation of hospitals inside Gaza Strip
*  following its evacuation. Now, some might go, well, that just shows he's not representative
*  of Israeli state policy, which doesn't work like that. At the very start, Yoav Galan, as I've said,
*  very notoriously declared Israel was imposing a total season on all the essentials of life from
*  getting into Gaza on the grounds that Israel was fighting human animals. In subsequent separate
*  statements, very shortly after this, he declared that all restraints and all restrictions would be
*  lifted on Israeli soldiers. He directly addressed that to Israeli soldiers themselves. So the
*  defense minister in charge of Israel's war effort made clear at the start that Israel intended to
*  starve Gaza of the essentials of life and that the Israeli army would be granted impunity.
*  How, therefore, are we supposed to understand the biggest slaughter of aid workers in a conflict in
*  such a short space of time ever, including multiple examples when aid agencies offered
*  coordinates to the Israeli army, when they were housed, where they were housed in known locations,
*  designated to those aid agencies, when they were given no prior warning before any attack. Are all
*  of these just one-offs? Terrible tragedies, accidents. Where does this leave claims by the
*  Israeli military it's one of the most sophisticated and advanced armies on earth. So it's just one big
*  coincidence that the Israeli defense minister announced the essentials of life would be cut
*  off, that soldiers would have impunity and that his advisor, a general no less, and the former head
*  of Israel's National Security Council called for those delivering aid to be deliberately targeted
*  to ensure the success of the siege, which was announced by the defense minister he's advising.
*  Now the preeminent British barrister Michael Mansfield Casey responded to this incident by
*  rightly declaring, the document is plainly relevant to a particular state of mind. In other words,
*  it is not indicating that the target of the Israeli army is primarily Hamas,
*  but Gaza as a whole by weaponizing aid under siege conditions. Do you want to hear another twist?
*  Well listen to this, and bear in mind this isn't the Telegraph, a right-wing newspaper with a
*  committed pro-Israel editorial line, before we're accused of being tinfoil hat wearing conspiracists.
*  The investigation into Colonel Mandel and his colleagues was led by retired Major General Yoav
*  Ha'Avon, president and CEO of Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. It says sparking claims of bias.
*  Well, wait for it, just wait for it. The Telegraph says the IDF is one of Rafael's biggest buyers.
*  The company which sells nearly half of its arms to Israeli clients makes the spike missiles which
*  are reported to have been used to kill the aid workers. Are you kidding me? What do you even say?
*  The Telegraph article also had some other choice details. The alleged failure to realize the cars
*  belonged to WCK is perplexing for a number of reasons, but mainly because the entire WCK
*  operation had been approved in advance by the IDF and had been tracked for hours, almost certainly
*  days by the IDF and its drones. The IDF said the vehicle's roof markings were not visible to its
*  drones at night, but the drones had tracked the WCK aid agents convoy from the beach where the
*  supplies had been landed on a pier built a few weeks before under the glare of world media
*  attention. The trucks were then tracked all the way to WCK's warehouse in Deir al-Bala, warehouse A.
*  According to the IDF, the same journey had been made the previous day and several times before.
*  Each journey was approved by and closely monitored by the IDF. The Telegraph also mentions that in a
*  briefing by an Israeli Major General, someone watching the video feed from one of the drones
*  thought that one of the people getting into one of the vehicles was carrying a weapon,
*  but the article then says, however, when the video was rerun for the investigators,
*  there was no sign of that. No footage of this moment was provided, reported the BBC from the
*  briefing, but the military investigation concluded it was a misclassification. They saw that it's a
*  rifle, but at the end of the day, it was a bag. Now just a very basic question, where are all the
*  loud demands from Britain, the United States and Australia for an independent investigation
*  into the killing of their own citizens, for all the relevant footage to be released,
*  unedited for independent analysis. If Hamas had been responsible, can you imagine how they would
*  have responded? The brutal truth is that the Israeli state is clearly deliberately targeting
*  aid agencies and aid workers as part of a deliberate strategy of starving the people of Gaza,
*  and that is a key plank of what is a genocide. As ever, you just need to do two things, listen
*  to what Israeli leaders and officials say, and look at the overwhelming material evidence of
*  what they then did. It isn't hard, and those currently loudly refuting what we are saying
*  would be arriving at the exact same conclusions as us if it wasn't a state allied to the West
*  responsible for all of this. And what's more, they know it. Please like and subscribe,
