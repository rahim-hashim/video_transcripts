# Our Establishment Tries To Silence YOU On Gaza
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [February 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMrUN-U5c1k)
*  This should be a national scandal.
*  But it isn't.
*  And that should tell you a lot about how this country works, about how power works, and about how ours is a democracy with very heavy caveats.
*  This is about how our political and media establishment close ranks, about growing naked unapologetic authoritarianism,
*  and how those who are complicit in one of the great crimes of our age are,
*  now as well as Mastel to of Gaza, is transparently indefensible except to the completely morally depraved,
*  are trying to defend themselves from having that complicity challenged.
*  Now there's a few things going on here, so we need to just make sure we get the facts straight.
*  What we know has happened and is happening.
*  Now firstly, yesterday was one of the few opposition days given to the Scottish National Party.
*  And it's a good day when they can set the legislative agenda.
*  Now they get three of those, each parliamentary session just three.
*  Labour gets 17.
*  So Labour have no shortage of opportunities to put their arguments forward.
*  Now this is a point made very eloquently by the SNP MP John Nicholson.
*  Now listen to something Orwellian today from David Lammy, the Shadow Foreign Secretary,
*  that Sir Keir and he have always been in favour of a ceasefire.
*  Well we know that's not the case because we heard what they had to say.
*  Labour has had multiple opportunities to debate this issue on their own opposition days over the last four months.
*  If they were so passionate about the arguments they're putting forward today,
*  why did they not propose them in one of their days?
*  The problem is Labour has spent most of the last few months backing Israel's Mastel to of Gaza,
*  up to and including Kirstama supporting Israel's right to cut off water and energy to a civilian population.
*  That in lay speak is a war crime.
*  Now when predominantly Muslim Labour councillors quit the party, a Labour source briefed the party while shaking off the fleas.
*  Left wing MPs Annie MacDonald and Kate Osamor were purged from the parliamentary party,
*  the first for supporting peaceful coexistence of Israelis and Palestinians,
*  the second for describing Gaza as a genocide the day the world's highest court on earth put Israel on trial for alleged genocide.
*  Now the SNP took a different approach.
*  Its leader, Hunza Yousaf, denounced Israel's collective punishment on the 10th of October
*  and called for a ceasefire within days of this horror beginning.
*  While Labour shielded the Conservatives as they unequivocally supported Israel's mass murder,
*  the first poll on October 19th showed 58% of Britons supported an immediate ceasefire,
*  with 18% saying there probably should be one.
*  Just 3% said definitely not.
*  The position of Labour and the Tories at the time and the exact same percentage
*  as the number of Britons who think the earth is flat.
*  Now since then, public opposition to Israel's genocide or killing spree has increased and hardened.
*  So when the SNP used one of its only opposition days to call for an immediate ceasefire
*  and called out Israel for collective punishment, Labour was in a bit of a bind.
*  Either you back it or you face a massive rebellion with potentially even resignations from the front bench.
*  But Stalmers team briefed journalists they would not accept the charge of collective punishment against Israel,
*  which to date has slaughtered over 36,000 Palestinians, over 14,000 of them children,
*  severely damaged or destroyed 70% of homes, destroyed the healthcare system,
*  displaced almost the entire population and besieged the essentials of life like food and fresh water.
*  So Labour instead introduced a mealy-mouth amendment which watered down immediate ceasefire
*  to the more ambiguous immediate humanitarian ceasefire and stripped out collective punishment altogether.
*  Now parliamentary protocol meant that this shouldn't be called.
*  This is one of the few SNP opposition days, not yet another chance for Labour to have its day.
*  What happened next?
*  Well we know that Keir Stalmers met with the Speaker before the vote.
*  That is itself extremely irregular.
*  It is not normal for dealings between the Speaker's office and political parties to be handled by party leaders.
*  According to Labour sources who briefed BBC News now night,
*  the Leader of the Opposition blackmailed the Speaker of the House of Commons
*  into violating parliamentary protocol in defiance of the Clerk of the House.
*  Specifically the claim is that the Speaker was told that unless he did what Labour wanted,
*  then the Speaker, himself a former Labour MP, would be removed from his position after the next election,
*  which given the Tory self-destruction is in the bag for Labour.
*  Do what we want you to do or we will destroy your career.
*  That my friends is blackmail.
*  Now Stalmers denies this, so let's hear from him.
*  I can categorically tell you that I did not threaten the Speaker in any way whatsoever.
*  They convince him there from a party leader who very famously is a man of his word.
*  The Guardian further reports,
*  those briefed on the meeting said the Labour leader warned Hoyle that Labour MP security was at risk.
*  Many had been deluged by criticisms, threats and abuse and abstaining on a similar SNP motion in November,
*  with hundreds of protesters congregating outside parliament they worried worse might be to come.
*  So in addition to the previously reported alleged blackmail,
*  Keir Stalmer apparently claims that unless the Speaker did as Labour demanded,
*  then he would be putting the actual lives of MPs at risk.
*  The Daily Mail reports one Labour source telling them that Stalmer had told the Speaker
*  he had blood on his hands unless he did what Labour wanted.
*  Now whether or not Stalmer used that actual phrase, that is the sum of the argument.
*  What else does it mean in practice?
*  And why does it even make any sense in its own terms, you may ask.
*  Quite reasonably, why would Labour succeed in stripping out collective punishment in flame passions?
*  I mean clearly, as we've seen, not stripping out even, not stripping out collective punishment,
*  we've seen subverting the political process through blackmail and implied threats is more likely to cause anger.
*  Obviously. But this is now the publicly stated case.
*  Let's listen to the Speaker of the House, Lindsay Hoyle,
*  justifying his decision after he apologised to the Scottish National Party for what he described as his mistake.
*  I never ever want to go through a situation where I pick up a phone to find a friend of whatever side has been murdered by terrorists.
*  I also don't want another attack on this house. I was in the chair room that day.
*  I have seen, I have witnessed. I won't show the details.
*  This is beyond shameless, cynical and offensive.
*  Suggesting a terrorist attack could be made more likely, what, if he hadn't given in to Labour allegedly bullying him
*  to avoid Stalmer having a big backbench rebellion as well as defending Israel from the charge of collective punishment?
*  It doesn't even make any sense. But it is an argument being echoed by multiple politicians and newspaper commentators.
*  I just want to say something first about client journalism.
*  A lot of political journalists know that Labour government by the end of the year is completely nailed on.
*  They know what not to say if they don't want to compromise their access.
*  A lot of them frankly have world views which are, to say the least, very similar to those running the Labour Party.
*  You will, I guarantee it, see a revolving door between some of these commentators and a Stalmer number 10.
*  Mark my words, remember I said this because you will see it.
*  But the absolute shamelessness of those spinning this outrage is something to behold.
*  They know they would be exploding with rage if Boris Johnson had done this.
*  I know it. They know it. So who are they fooling?
*  Let's be clear about what's happening here.
*  A lot of politicians voluntarily made themselves complicit in one of the great crimes of our age.
*  That is Israel's mass slaughter.
*  Because at this point that slaughter is so self-evidently depraved, so unhinged, so indefensible, they know that they are exposed.
*  So they're now trying to protect themselves from scrutiny and protect themselves from public pressure.
*  MPs have every right to be concerned about their security.
*  Two MPs have been murdered.
*  One, Joe Cox, by a far extremist, the other David Amis, by a Islamist extremist.
*  What we are seeing here, however, is a cynical and frankly shameless attempt to conflate legitimate security concerns with questions of democratic scrutiny and public pressure.
*  If they get their way, the right to protest, already under siege and to build collective pressure on parliament, pillars of our democracy,
*  which our ancestors fought for at huge cost and huge sacrifice, will be criminalised and portrayed as dangerous incitement.
*  And indeed, there is a very obvious racist undercurrent here, which some right-wing commentators, to be fair, are helpfully spelling out in primary colours.
*  What they mean is that a significant number of those angry about the mass slaughter of Gaza are Muslim.
*  That has something to do with the fact that tens of thousands of predominantly Muslims are being slaughtered with Western weapons and diplomatic and political support.
*  So what they're trying to do is go, angry Muslims means dangerous Muslims.
*  I just think personally, if you cheered on a military onslaught which is butchering Muslims in huge numbers,
*  you're not really in a position to denounce the dangerous, inherent violent intent of others.
*  But in any case, let's just expose the cynicism for what it is.
*  Joe Cox was murdered by a far-right racist extremist, a terrorist.
*  Do you ever hear politicians and commentators going,
*  We need to tone down the debate about migrants and refugees because it might radicalise extremists like the terrorist who killed Joe Cox.
*  You don't. You just don't.
*  It's said that hideous murder is inserted in debates which are completely and utterly irrelevant to what happened there, like, for example, Gaza.
*  And here's another point. In 2017, as an example, the far-right terrorist Darren Osborne ploughed his van into Muslim worshippers, killing one.
*  After being arrested, he stated his actual intention was to murder Jeremy Corbyn and Sadiq Khan.
*  I bet few of you remember this because it's been memory-holed.
*  Anyone remember that being used as evidence for what I mean is a calm down rhetoric about left-wing politicians?
*  Well, bad luck because things only escalated after that particular incident.
*  When Corbyn was punched in the head with an egg in 2019, far from a national,
*  This shows we need to calm down about our rhetoric about the left debate.
*  Several commentators publicly made clear they actually found it extremely funny.
*  The double standards are unbelievable.
*  If I'm going there after being targeted and threatened by far-right extremists in the streets over and over again,
*  in 2019, I was beaten up by a far-right extremist who ended up jailed on the grounds it was politically motivated violence.
*  Is that incident ever relevant in the discussion about political violence?
*  You bet. If I was a centrist or a right-wing commentator and I was a leftist who'd done that, you'd never hear the end of it.
*  But of course it doesn't count because I'm left-wing.
*  Furthermore, one former Labour MP turned Telegraph columnist claimed threats were only coming from one side in the so-called debate about Gaza.
*  Oh really? Because personally, I've been inundated with often extremely detailed and colourful threats of violence and death from supporters of Israel's onslaught.
*  Including putting in quite graphic detail how they're going to murder me.
*  Why isn't that relevant to this so-called discussion?
*  Instead, they're trying to portray the hundreds of thousands who've taken to the streets against violence, against horrific violence, against mass slaughter.
*  They're trying to portray them as the violent mob without any evidence because they want to protect themselves from scrutiny and public pressure.
*  This is a return to 19th century debates against democracy when it was claimed democracy would unleash violent mob rule.
*  This is a shameless and cynical episode which should open your eyes about power in Britain, about how also, how so much of our media operates.
*  And I'd also say this, we already should have known how authoritarian Stalmer was because of what he's done to the Labour Party.
*  Now look how he's behaving to democratic institutions before he's even in power.
*  It does not bode well, does it?
*  Which is why it requires more people who aren't afraid to tell the truth to do so without fear or favour.
*  So let's get to work.
