# Israel Army Thinks Whole Gaza Strip Deserves To Be Killed - w. Gideon Levy
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuXDjLsF8e8)
*  Now, Gideon Levy is the most, in my view, courageous journalist in Israel. He's been
*  speaking truth throughout this horror and that's not easy to do in the climate which
*  exists in Israel at the moment. Moral clarity, the last time I interviewed Gideon Levy was
*  a few months ago and the term I used was moral clarity and it's rare that I've come across
*  someone I think who just personifies that. So it's really a great honour getting to be
*  joined to talk to you in these unrelentingly bleak and horrific times. So hello.
*  Thank you for having me again, Owen. Always a pleasure, really.
*  Yeah, well, I can't say enough how much of a pleasure it is. I want to start by talking
*  about the World Central Kitchen massacre. Now, let's be clear, 200 aid workers have
*  already been killed, overwhelmingly Palestinians, and they haven't had
*  attention. I'm not trying to detract from the horror that the families of those seven aid
*  workers are feeling, but that's why this suddenly has caused a crisis of some description.
*  Before I talk about that, though, I just want to talk about the investigation which the
*  Israeli authorities have now conducted. And I just want your thoughts, because this was
*  an aid at World Central Kitchen coordinating with the IDF in a supposedly deconflicted
*  zone. They gave their coordinates on a pre-approved route in trucks clearly marked with
*  World Central Kitchen. And then the first car was attacked with the drug.
*  And then as they fled to the second car, that was an attack. And then they fled to the
*  last car. That was attacked. Then they were all killed.
*  What I just wondered your thoughts on the investigation that have been produced and what
*  that tells us about how these the IDF operate?
*  Whatever happened here is exactly the opposite of what the IDF does usually.
*  Usually there is no investigation whatsoever.
*  And usually if there is an investigation, it lasts forever.
*  And I'm speaking about decades of military investigations of crimes of the occupation.
*  This time, because this dramatic phone call between Biden and Netanyahu, they rushed up
*  and they even found some guilty commanders for the occupation.
*  One of them, by the way, a settler.
*  Surprise, surprise. But by the end of the day, we should remember the world and Israel
*  unfortunately is treating the blood of those seven adorable volunteers of the Central
*  World Kitchen as much more expensive, dear than the blood of so many Palestinians who
*  were killed in such a similar way.
*  Let's just make the analysis, the analogy with the two weeks of attack on El Shifa
*  Hospital, the only real hospital in Gaza, the only hospital that can be called a medical
*  center for two weeks.
*  Israel had bombed there and killed hundreds of people and destroyed the whole compound
*  because there were there some members of Hamas.
*  We don't know who we don't know how many.
*  We never know. I doubt if the army knows, but they were.
*  This justified the whole killing and destruction of an hospital.
*  Same way of thinking happened a few days later in Deir el-Balach.
*  They saw there is one Hamas member.
*  Nobody knows who he was, how important he was in any case.
*  He wasn't in the car.
*  But that's enough for them to justify to kill anyone who is around him.
*  And that's a way of thinking.
*  This is not an incident, not a mistake.
*  That's a strategy.
*  That's a way of thinking.
*  That's a way of perceiving lives of Palestinians.
*  I mean, I'm wondering just in terms of what happened here, where they basically have
*  blamed the local unit and there aren't criminal sanctions, though, at the moment.
*  And kind of looking pretty pretty light action given the gravity of the crime,
*  which was on a purported one gunman.
*  There wasn't a gunman and therefore an entire aid convoy is attacked
*  with seven aid workers killed.
*  The reason I'm just interested and I just want to put this to you
*  and I don't want to go down too much of a rabbit hole here.
*  But Giora Island, for those who don't know who are listening,
*  the Israeli major general, the former head of the Israeli National Security Council,
*  and advised in some capacity to gallant the defense minister.
*  He said on the 7th of October in support of the siege.
*  And he said, in order to make the siege effective,
*  we have to prevent others from giving assistance to Gaza.
*  The people should be told they have two choices to stay in, to starve or to leave.
*  Now, Gaza suffered the worst fall in nutritional status
*  of any population in recorded history.
*  There is a famine growing.
*  I don't know. I mean, is it possible that this unit
*  deliberately targeted these aid workers in order to undermine,
*  to prevent others from providing aid?
*  I'm not sure.
*  If yes, this is not the policy of the army.
*  Then it was really an initiative of a high rank local commander.
*  Might be. We know the background, at least of one of the commanders,
*  a very radical settler.
*  But by the end of the day, I think that we should look at it differently.
*  We should look at it as if the army doesn't care who are they killing,
*  whom are they shooting.
*  They couldn't care less if those are journalists, medical teams,
*  aid workers, women, children, anyone.
*  The whole Gaza Strip is in danger.
*  The whole Gaza Strip is suspected by Israel, by the Israeli army.
*  And in many ways, the whole Gaza Strip deserves to be killed.
*  And you have those expressions by so many Israelis
*  that nobody is innocent in Gaza.
*  And if nobody is innocent in Gaza,
*  it includes also the seven international aid workers.
*  And that's the outcome.
*  If you talk like this, if you think like this,
*  the only difference was the national identity
*  of five out of those seven workers.
*  They were international.
*  If there would have been more international in Gaza,
*  we would have seen less killing, I believe.
*  And they, of course, blocked, they blocked foreign journalists from entering,
*  partly because those crimes, I suppose, would be more easily documented.
*  But also, yeah, you would end up with these sorts of incidents, wouldn't you?
*  And I mean, just in terms of what's happened since the conversation
*  between Joe Biden, this has triggered a crisis.
*  Well, all of a sudden, it does.
*  The world is being told very loudly as Palestinians said in the beginning,
*  Palestinian life is very cheap.
*  This has triggered a crisis.
*  Now, one of the outcomes is two crossings have been opened
*  into Gaza, which Israel could have opened
*  all the way through to allow aid in.
*  I mean, doesn't that show the US used a little bit of leverage
*  that it did actually have all along and it could have used that all along
*  and that Israel has been deliberately keeping
*  ways into Gaza, which could allow food to prevent famine?
*  Much more than this, Owen.
*  It showed not only that the United States
*  has leverage over Israel, which we knew,
*  it showed that the leverage is much bigger than we think.
*  And the United States is not using it.
*  Look what happened.
*  There are two things to be said here.
*  The first one is that this phone call changed
*  the regularities on the ground of entering aid within hours.
*  Only because of a phone call with the American president.
*  And that's proofs exactly what I thought for a long time,
*  that if the Americans would have really want to put an end to this war,
*  they could have
*  used one phone call to put an end to the war.
*  The fact that President Biden, with all the appreciation
*  to his good intentions, and I believe he has some good intentions,
*  with all the appreciation to this, by the end of the day,
*  he didn't put an end to this war.
*  In other words, he wants this war to continue.
*  In other words, the United States is a full partner.
*  And the second thing is this
*  hypocrite way of thinking.
*  And we will put, we will support Gaza with some food, some medicines,
*  and our conscience will be totally clean.
*  Or the American conscience or the White House's conscience
*  will be clean here instead of 200 trucks.
*  There will be 500 trucks a day.
*  And Gaza is safe and secure and happy.
*  So I must remind all of us in Gaza,
*  that there are over two million people without any protection
*  exposed to be killed in any given moment without any protection.
*  They are, most of them, replaced from the places, from the homes,
*  most of them homeless.
*  There are 17,000 children without any accompany of adults.
*  They lost everything.
*  There is not only starvation, there is fear.
*  There is despair.
*  There is nowhere to go.
*  So this way of thinking that if we only double the number of the trucks,
*  we should bring rice to the people, if there were animals.
*  And with this rye, our conscience will be clean and happy.
*  That's a very, very twisted way of thinking.
*  Gaza needs ending the war today.
*  Nothing but this.
*  Any day that this war continues means more horrible catastrophes
*  for the people of Gaza.
*  And thank you, President Biden, for the trucks, for the aid.
*  But that's not a way to really be humanitarian,
*  to really care about the people of Gaza, to really care about the international
*  law and to really care about the safety of hundreds of thousands
*  of women, children, adults, totally innocent people who deserve half a year
*  and end to their suffering.
*  Joe Biden could bring it to them in one phone call.
*  And he didn't.
*  I mean, on that, just sticking with food,
*  the basic point about food is, you know, what's often missing
*  in the conversation is the fact that local agriculture, food production
*  in Gaza has been so systematically trashed, destroyed.
*  And so, you know, when people talk about even comparisons
*  with aid coming in before, well, there was food production as well,
*  which is now gone.
*  But also, if you've got a war going on, the infrastructure,
*  the roads have been destroyed.
*  It's interesting, even Biden's administration has reprimanded
*  Netanyahu's government for blowing up, for targeting police
*  within Gaza as though they're legitimate targets on the basis
*  that they often provide the security for the trucks.
*  So, I mean, that's the problem that you get.
*  So you've got the destruction of infrastructure and local food production.
*  You've got a collapse in security.
*  You've got a lot of desperate, starving people.
*  So actually, just getting trucks in doesn't solve that problem, does it?
*  Absolutely. And you didn't mention also some kind of industry,
*  which was in Gaza, which is also totally destroyed.
*  Gaza produced some of its food by itself,
*  not only in agriculture, but also in certain factories.
*  Dairies and others, all this is gone.
*  So, but again, food is not the whole story.
*  I mean, food is essential.
*  And we have to provide it.
*  I'm very happy that there will be less starvation,
*  even though I'm not sure that this is enough.
*  But there are some other human needs.
*  What about them?
*  I mean, you mentioned health care, you mentioned Al-Shifa.
*  I mean, Gaza doesn't really have a functioning health care system.
*  And I mean, you just start to think people with cancer,
*  people with heart problems, pregnant women.
*  I mean, that imposes a daily death sentence on a significant number of people,
*  doesn't it, if you don't have a health system?
*  Yes, but they have a sex of sex of rice from from the United States.
*  This should they shut their mouths.
*  If I was going to go devil's advocate, I mean, wouldn't, you know,
*  the argument be, well, yeah, the US has this leverage.
*  But actually, if they told Netanyahu to end the war,
*  then Netanyahu's government would fall and Netanyahu fears going to prison.
*  So is that that stops the leverage?
*  What do you say to that?
*  Look, Netanyahu is doing whatever he wants.
*  As long as the Americans are supporting it,
*  the moment that the United States will stop supporting what he does.
*  In any case, Israel will have to stop.
*  We have I mean, it's it's so basic.
*  Israel cannot continue this war without the support of the United States,
*  maybe for a few days, not much more.
*  For sure not to face the next dangers from the North, from the East, from Iran.
*  So, you know, those are all considerations we are dealing here now
*  with lives of maybe tens or hundreds of thousands of people for the for the period to come.
*  And this is at stake now.
*  And therefore, if Netanyahu doesn't depend so much on Netanyahu.
*  If the Americans want to put an end to this war,
*  this war will end within hours or days.
*  And therefore, the responsibility of Biden is so big and therefore they betray.
*  I'm just wondering what happens next, though, in the sense, Rafa, where
*  a majority of Gaza's, as you say, desperate, homeless, hungry population,
*  traumatized population, are now concentrated on the border with Egypt.
*  And the Israeli government basically states everything on saying
*  there will be an offensive against Rafa, which the US has
*  done lots of hand wringing about, but carried on providing lots of weapons
*  to Israel in order to prosecute such an offensive.
*  Do you think such an offensive will happen?
*  Because obviously, you know, I interviewed, for example,
*  a UNICEF spokesperson live from Rafa a few days ago and spelled out in gruesome terms
*  what an offensive against Rafa would mean, particularly given they have nowhere to go.
*  So what do you think?
*  Where do things stand with this offensive against this onslaught against Rafa?
*  Again, it depends on the Americans, how decisive will they be until now?
*  Until now or until the last days?
*  Maybe they changed it in the last days, but until last days,
*  they did say very clearly no.
*  They just put conditions.
*  They wanted to see plans which cannot exist.
*  How to save those innocent people from being killed by messes.
*  It depends only on the United States.
*  If the United States will want to save the life of 1.2
*  displaced people who are staying now in Rafa,
*  they can do it and they should do it.
*  Israel, as you see, are talking a lot and doing a little about Rafa
*  because they understand the challenge, both the international one
*  and also the challenge on the ground.
*  To fight in a place where there are one million refugees is not an easy job, not at all.
*  So I still carry the hope that maybe it will end up
*  only in talking, not in actions.
*  But again, I don't see a very decisive American position.
*  Partly because it's in limbo, I suppose, because of the elections,
*  which are not that far away.
*  I mean, one thing I'm interested in is just, I mean, the question of the hostages.
*  I mean, you know, Hamas committed grave war crimes by taking civilians hostages.
*  No one should be any doubt about that.
*  What I'm interested in and just in terms of where this is in the conversation in Israel,
*  because I know there have been protests, obviously, including by relatives of some of the hostages.
*  Obviously, common basic sense shows because you'll hear people
*  aggressively supporting the war in Gaza on the basis of the hostages,
*  even though we've only seen mass release of hostages based on a ceasefire and a prisoner exchange.
*  The Israeli state has killed far more hostages through military action than it's saved.
*  Is that not just generally just I don't understand how within Israeli society
*  there couldn't be a basic that could be a common sense, given that's just empirically what's happened.
*  But it doesn't seem to be even registering.
*  There's no one in Israel who doesn't want to see the hostages being released.
*  But there is quite a big part of Israelis who are not ready to pay anything for.
*  And the polls show that the majority of Israelis
*  prefer crushing Hamas over releasing the hostages.
*  And those are two alternative goals.
*  They cannot go to the other side.
*  Or I keep on saying it from the first day.
*  You have to have your priority.
*  And this is your priority.
*  All this is. And these are quite clear.
*  So the interesting thing is turned into a political issue.
*  The left, so called, is for releasing the hostages in any price before anything else.
*  And the right wingers are in favor of continuing the war in any price
*  without ignoring the fate of the hostages,
*  claiming that continuing the war, as Danielle says,
*  so will bring also to the release of the hostages,
*  which is a totally twisted logic,
*  because the more the war goes on,
*  the more the life of the hostages is in danger for many reasons.
*  So Israel really changed
*  in a quite deep way in this war.
*  And you can see it in the attitude toward the hostages.
*  When we had Gilad Shalei,
*  one individual, one soldier,
*  the sentiment in Israel was overwhelming.
*  People were praying and wishing for seeing him released in any price.
*  There was very, very little resistance to the high price that Israel paid.
*  Over 1200 prisoners, including Yigye Sinuah, by the way,
*  was released for getting Gilad Shalei.
*  Israel became less with humanity and with
*  empathy and with mercy toward the weak ones,
*  toward those who suffer in this war.
*  And it's first of all, obviously aimed at the Palestinians.
*  But now we see it is also aimed at the hostages.
*  Israel cares today less about the hostages than a few months ago.
*  And that's horrible.
*  You've done lots of work,
*  I mean, just in terms of links to this, on the plight of
*  Palestinians who have been detained by the Israeli state
*  and who you've actually described as Israel's own hostages.
*  And we've heard just reports in the last few days of
*  the sort of conditions being tied up for months,
*  to the extent that people have had their limbs amputated.
*  Ben Gavir doing typically the extremist security minister,
*  another blood curdling kind of public statement saying conditions will be made even worse.
*  It doesn't matter how many bullets we need.
*  As I'm just wondering about what your thoughts on the general plight there was,
*  because we've had some horrific reports, of course, of the mistreatment of
*  well, the horrific treatment of Palestinian detainees.
*  One of the reports which was published yesterday,
*  the day before yesterday in Haaretz, was by a doctor who works there.
*  So it's not just the, you know, rumors or Palestinian sources,
*  an Israeli physician or wrote a letter.
*  This is, again, something that tells more about Israel than about anything else.
*  The fact that Israel is so indifferent.
*  To what every Israeli could have heard yesterday,
*  and weeks before.
*  The fact that they don't even care about the consequences of those reports
*  on the fate of our hostages in Hamas.
*  What do you think will a God of Hamas, who has two hostages under his guard,
*  what will he do when he hears that his colleagues, his friends,
*  are being kept in those unbelievable and inhuman conditions?
*  What will he think and how will he behave when he hears this?
*  And what came out of us?
*  Such reports 10 years ago, what become the talk of the day?
*  Here, Israel is yawning and doing nothing about it.
*  Those are really, I mean, Guantanamo starts to seem as a result place
*  relative to what we are hearing now about Zde Teimani,
*  one of those military camps where they are detained.
*  I don't know, I see those scenes in front of my eyes of people who are
*  handicapped and covered in their eyes and being fed with straw for half a year now.
*  And part of them, 27 died, at least 27 died out of those conditions.
*  Many of them, and the doctors say that's a routine,
*  lost their legs because of the woundings from the chains.
*  What came out of Israel? What is it?
*  And Israel was always had its problems, but it never got this low point, never.
*  I mean, I suppose, again, from a foreign perspective,
*  it's something I've asked you about before, but I mean, months have gone on
*  that, you know, Western public opinion has shifted very decisively
*  against the Israeli state and what's happened in Gaza.
*  There's no question about that.
*  And partly, obviously, it's just seeing the utter,
*  the hideous suffering of the Palestinian people in Gaza,
*  not just Gaza, but particularly in Gaza.
*  And it becomes hard for, you know, because we speak to people like yourself,
*  I speak to you, I speak to courageous Israeli peace activists.
*  You talk about the humanity of the Palestinian people, but that
*  that is not, I mean, it's just the general broad consensus within
*  Israeli society is quite shocking to a lot of people when they actually see the way
*  the conversation on television, the kind of almost kind of like
*  caricatured way of speaking in the most dehumanizing way about Palestinians.
*  You know, talking about, you know, how, you know, four year old children
*  aren't innocent because they'll grow up to be terrorists.
*  You just listen to this. It's kind of like caricatured.
*  I'm just wondering about that, just what the kind of general atmosphere is
*  and if there's any hope in that sense.
*  No, Owen, I don't see any hope.
*  I mean, when I cannot watch Israeli TV anymore, not the news programs
*  really cannot, I mean, almost physically, I cannot do it.
*  It is first of all, what you don't see.
*  You don't see anything on the suffer of Gaza, nothing.
*  And then from what you see, only our sacrifice,
*  only us and us and us, we are the victims, we are the only victims.
*  And as a soldier was killed, what will be with the hostages?
*  All very legitimate sentiments.
*  But you cannot remain so blind and so apathetic
*  to the suffer that you cause,
*  which doesn't have anything to yourself.
*  The fact that we are treating their prisoners like this
*  doesn't help in any way for the hostages, nothing.
*  It just destroys, first of all, the victims.
*  And secondly, also the guards, Israelis.
*  What will come out from all those phenomena?
*  What will come out of this indifference?
*  One day Israelis will be asked, where have you been?
*  You knew all this. What did you do about it?
*  And they will say we went to the streets and demonstrated
*  against Netanyahu as if replacing Netanyahu
*  will make an entire difference.
*  And after Netanyahu, Israel will turn into a liberal paradise.
*  There does seem to be some hope, though, in what you said,
*  in that the suggestion there is, I mean, this is what I cling on to,
*  so I'd just be interested if you expand on it, which is
*  people in future generations will look back and go,
*  what on earth happened there?
*  They'll look back at the blood curdling statements
*  of Israeli leaders, officials.
*  They'll see coverage from this time on Israeli television
*  and the sorts of statements that circulated in social media, telegram.
*  I've seen some of the telegram stuff about some of the aid workers,
*  people just mocking the deaths of these aid workers
*  and ridiculing these aid workers.
*  And you kind of think...
*  But your suggestion is actually people in the future will go,
*  what happened there?
*  This was an outrage. We have to come to terms with it.
*  So that does suggest that there is there is hope that things can shift.
*  I wish I knew where do you see hope here?
*  It's maybe your younger age than me.
*  Where do you see hope here? Hope for what?
*  This will shape a whole generation
*  with hatred, with really criminal thinking,
*  with racism, with believing that
*  all the Palestinians are garbage, that you can just smash
*  and go on and nothing happens.
*  What hope do you see here?
*  I really wonder.
*  Well, yeah, I'm struggling.
*  I'm not not going to lie.
*  Just a couple of things.
*  What I one thing I did want to put to you, actually,
*  that if you saw this article in Plus 972 magazine by Yuval Abraham,
*  I just think I was just thinking of a courageous journalist,
*  Yuval Abraham.
*  I was to be honest, it read like a sci fi horror film
*  and of the use of artificial intelligence, this lavender system,
*  which chooses low level so-called Hamas operatives.
*  I mean, it's basically they're judged to be that by artificial intelligence
*  and then, you know, waits till they're at home, bonds them and blows them up
*  with up to 20 civilians acceptable for collateral damage.
*  And in previous, you know, whatever we think about previous Israeli
*  onslaughts, you wouldn't low level operatives, not a single
*  civilian for collateral damage would have been acceptable.
*  But you can see from that how we ended up with the mass destruction of Gaza
*  because you had the proliferation of all these targets
*  and then they were acceptable to blow up and all the rest of it.
*  And I guess this just seems to me that you would never
*  there was the only human oversight per target 20 seconds.
*  And there was such that their verification was are they a man?
*  And they accept there's at least a 10 percent margin of error in any case.
*  I just look at it, I just think this, I mean, it looks like I'm reading a horror
*  film, a sci-fi horror film of the sort I grew up with.
*  I just wonder where does that take us?
*  Because I look at that and think, you know, is that the future for is that
*  is this a template?
*  Is this a template for something not just in Israel, but beyond?
*  Absolutely. I mean, it left me speechless.
*  This report by Abraham.
*  I am not a great expert for AI.
*  But I by the way, the army didn't even really deny it.
*  They had some some
*  things to say, but not a overall denial.
*  Someone in our it's a road to last Friday.
*  The destruction is already bigger than Nagasaki.
*  When you hear those figures, when you hear about those methods.
*  Is it really so far from.
*  Throwing a mass killing
*  weapon over Gaza, we are almost there.
*  It started with the drones, by the way, much before AI,
*  when 90 year old female soldiers sit in a room with
*  screens in front of them and with their joystick
*  killing human beings.
*  It starts there.
*  You know, in the battlefield, at least you see who is in front of you.
*  It started with the pilots who never see their victims.
*  They see black, black dots running on their lives.
*  They have no idea who they are, whom they are killing.
*  No idea. And they go.
*  So technology will bring us really to him.
*  I mean, just kind of where do we end, really?
*  I mean, I guess if there is, I mean, we spoke before
*  you spoke before about how I think you the hope you would look at
*  is in the US, which is obviously pulls in at the end of the day.
*  Has leverage of a huge amount that it can actually stop this with one phone call.
*  I mean, I mean, just firstly on that, I mean, I'll ask a two part question.
*  This could end as far as you're concerned.
*  If Biden picks up his phone, said this ends now,
*  I will end all weapon sales unless you immediately end this.
*  That would be it.
*  One word.
*  Which Biden knows to pronounce very well, don't.
*  It's enough.
*  But it must be followed by measures.
*  If it's only this word or any word, it is.
*  Totally meaningless.
*  It must be followed by measures.
*  And to say don't.
*  And in the very same day to supply Israel with more ammunition
*  and more jets.
*  Is really cynical.
*  I mean, I was struck by reading
*  it was a passage from it was about 1982 during the invasion of Lebanon
*  and one of Ronald Reagan's advisors
*  what marched into the Oval Office in the White House going this is I've said
*  this is too much, the atrocities, the children being murdered and slaughtered
*  and impressed on Reagan and Reagan rang the relevant general in Israel
*  and then was told within hours that all the relevant
*  all the necessary measures would be taken.
*  I just look back and think how far things have descended,
*  because these are a lot worse than 1982 in Lebanon, as brutal, as horrific
*  as that was.
*  I don't know.
*  You think that was Reagan.
*  That was Ronald Reagan.
*  Yeah, we are not aiming at any good place, I'm afraid.
*  I wish I'm wrong.
*  This war is not over yet.
*  And it might, you know, also ending the war is a very vague.
*  Perception, because what does it mean ending the war?
*  It can say there is a ceasefire.
*  But as long as the Israeli army stays in Gaza, the war is not over
*  because there will be resistance all the time and there will be retaliation
*  for the resistance.
*  So where do we aim it and then what?
*  Living Gaza and then what?
*  Staking Gaza and then what?
*  What is the end game for God's sake?
*  We asked from the first day and we're asking now after 180 days.
*  What is the end game?
*  What do you want to achieve?
*  I hope it's no genocide for the purpose of genocide.
*  I mean, is that what you I mean, based on what Israeli leaders have said
*  from the start, it's just the I mean, again, this is what I found disturbing
*  out coverage is for me, what I did from the beginning is just listen
*  to what Israeli leaders said and took it literally, which I always found like
*  the Western media coverage failure to just frame everything, you know,
*  Yoav Galan saying a siege against human animals and then saying
*  on the 9th of October, he's lifted all restraints on Israeli soldiers
*  than the day after all restrictions on Israeli soldiers.
*  I know it's a clue, it's a clue, but that has I mean, I just what's your fit?
*  Do you not look back at some of those statements and the actions and think,
*  well, this is just genocide?
*  By the end of the day, whatever they say,
*  almost all of them is aimed at their political base.
*  Nothing but this.
*  They want to be reelected in the central committee of the Likud.
*  So they want to show how radical and how cruel and how brutal
*  they are toward the Palestinians.
*  It's so much domestic politics that you can't even imagine.
*  There is no strategic thinking.
*  Not take even the last assassination in the Damascus.
*  Did anyone thought about the day after?
*  What might be the reaction?
*  Is it worth it at all?
*  Except of showing everybody Israeli, Israeli hero.
*  Here he is again.
*  James Bond.
*  He can assassinate anybody anywhere.
*  What? What does it serve exactly?
*  What did all this nation serve?
*  So there is no thinking.
*  There's only the thought about to know this program.
*  How will I come out from there?
*  Well, grim stuff that in brilliantly insightful and eloquent
*  and always full of moral clarity and humanity, honestly, getting
*  it's such a such an honor to share the video.
*  Everyone obviously like leave your comments.
*  Love to read what you think.
*  But I'm giddy and it's a big honor.
*  So thank you so much.
*  Thank you for having me again.
*  I went and keep up your work.
*  I'll do my best, but right back at you.
*  So do I. So do I.
*  All the best.
