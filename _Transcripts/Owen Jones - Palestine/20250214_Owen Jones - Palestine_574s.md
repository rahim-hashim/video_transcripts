# Netanyahu CAVES On Gaza
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [February 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg)
*  Benjamin Netanyahu has caved, for now. He was planning this weekend to destroy the so-called [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=0.0s)]
*  ceasefire and to renew Israel's genocidal frenzy against the Palestinian people in Gaza, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  but with an unprecedented intensity. We know this because Israel was deliberately violating [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=12.24s)]
*  the terms of the ceasefire agreement. Now Israel wasn't just repeatedly shooting Palestinians [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=18.1s)]
*  dead in Gaza as well as the West Bank, although you might consider firing at people to kill [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=23.72s)]
*  them qualifies as a violation of ceasing to fire. You might also conclude that if Hamas [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=29.64s)]
*  militants killed just one Israeli, let alone at least 25, there would be howls of outrage [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=36.52s)]
*  from the media and politicians, and Israel would immediately announce the ceasefire was [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=41.96s)]
*  over and unleash its firepower against Gaza again. When I say 25, I'm not talking about [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=46.5s)]
*  the vast numbers of Palestinians killed in the West Bank, including a pregnant woman [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=52.2s)]
*  and children. Now if you believe all that, that would be the same standards applied, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=57.9s)]
*  then you live in a parallel universe, because obviously the universe we live in, equal standards [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=66.9s)]
*  are not applied to Israel as to Palestinians or even close. More to the point, the ceasefire [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=72.58s)]
*  deal involved a massive upscaling of humanitarian aid, that was the agreement. The Israeli state [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=77.82s)]
*  has been relentlessly besieging the people of Gaza, which it made clear it would do [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=83.58s)]
*  from the very beginning. There was no subtlety, Yoav Galan, former defence minister, is amongst [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=88.22s)]
*  those who announced a complete siege on Gaza on the grounds Israel was fighting human animals. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=93.38s)]
*  That was the 9th of October 2023. Indeed, the main pillar of the arrest warrant issued [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=99.9s)]
*  by the International Criminal Court against Galan, as well as that against the Israeli [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=105.22s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, focuses on Israel's starvation policy towards Gaza. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=109.34s)]
*  And then in northern Gaza, the so-called General's Plan was put into place. That was, of course, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=115.42s)]
*  in the later part of last year. This was a grotesque plan devised by the retired Israeli [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=120.98s)]
*  General Giora Eiland, who served as an advisor to the former defence minister Galan, to drive [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=126.02000000000001s)]
*  its entire civilian population out. That is those who survived being bombed and shot by [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=131.44s)]
*  using starvation and the siege of all the essentials of life. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=137.1s)]
*  And of particular urgency in terms of humanitarian need required by Israel, which was in the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=140.78s)]
*  agreement, is to do with shelter. It is estimated by the United Nations that 92% of homes in [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=146.85999999999999s)]
*  Gaza are destroyed or damaged. The vast majority of Gaza's population, of course, have been [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=152.48s)]
*  violently displaced. It's also worth noting that multiple Israeli news outlets made clear [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=158.66s)]
*  that Netanyahu was looking for an excuse to violate the ceasefire agreement in order to [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=163.92s)]
*  renew the onslaught. Al Jazeera went through the violations of the promises Israel had [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=168.04s)]
*  made as part of that ceasefire agreement. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=172.32s)]
*  Now around 12,008 trucks should have entered the Gaza Strip, meaning there's a shortfall [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=175.6s)]
*  of around three and a half thousand. The agreement stipulated at least 50 fuel trucks should [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=179.64s)]
*  be allowed into the Strip every day. But on average, only 15 trucks have been allowed in [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=184.44s)]
*  daily. Two hundred thousand tents were supposed to enter Gaza, but only 10%, that's 20,000, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=189.44s)]
*  have made it in. And none of the 60,000 mobile homes promised have entered the Strip. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=195.48s)]
*  There was no explanation given for these violations. Israel was clearly just looking for an excuse [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=200.84s)]
*  to derail the ceasefire. So when Hamas then responded by saying the ceasefire had been [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=206.76s)]
*  violated and that the deal to release three Israeli hostages on Saturday would no longer [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=210.36s)]
*  like clockwork, Donald Trump said all hell would break loose, which was echoed by Benjamin [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=215.72s)]
*  Netanyahu and his allies. But suddenly that changed. Suddenly Israel allowed those temporary [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=220.84s)]
*  homes into Gaza and they not only allowed a surge in aid trucks to take place on Wednesday, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=226.0s)]
*  they let in 801, which was 201 more than the agreement stipulated for that day in order [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=230.36s)]
*  to retroactively make up for the lack of aid trucks on previous days. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=235.96s)]
*  As the brilliant Dutch-Palestinian analyst Muin Rabbani, who I've interviewed on this [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=241.6s)]
*  channel put it, Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, caved. He also notes that [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=245.4s)]
*  Hamas was responding to Israel's refusal to engage in negotiations on the second stage [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=251.2s)]
*  of the three-part January agreement to new proposals put forward by Netanyahu that tried [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=255.66s)]
*  to comprehensively revise what had already been negotiated and concluded between the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=260.38s)]
*  two parties and that on top, of course, of Trump's plot to forcibly remove the Palestinian [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=264.74s)]
*  population, which as Rabbani notes, renders the entire agreement meaningless and irrelevant. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=271.24s)]
*  That's a crucial point and an agreement for lasting ceasefire makes no sense whatsoever [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=276.68s)]
*  if the actual plan is to force the entire civilian population out of Gaza. That's one [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=281.12s)]
*  way of getting a lasting ceasefire, of course, by simply getting rid of everyone. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=286.04s)]
*  Now Rabbani also notes that the media spin of what has happened is completely false. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=289.8s)]
*  The media narrative was that the backlash against Hamas over three Israeli captives, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=294.16s)]
*  hostages being released looking gaunt and weakened is what caused Hamas to try and [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=298.76s)]
*  states that the ceasefire had been violated because they feared what would happen if further [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=304.18s)]
*  hostages were released looking the same. That is the resulting fury would provide an opportunity [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  for Israel to renew its onslaught. Now to be clear, as I always have been throughout, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=314.21999999999997s)]
*  taking civilians hostage is a grave war crime. The point is these claims for why the ceasefire [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=318.88s)]
*  was breaking down were false and yet media outlets who had access to the facts spread [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=322.84s)]
*  disinformation. Indeed, let's hear from Guy Paran. He's a former captain in the Israel [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  defense forces, so-called the Israeli occupation forces. He said on Israeli television that [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=332.64000000000004s)]
*  it was Israel rather than Hamas which violated the terms of the ceasefire deal. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=336.96000000000004s)]
*  We didn't need to have an emas this week. President Biden is the one who helped Israel [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=356.72s)]
*  throughout the war. Trump is the one who pressed for the agreement. That agreement [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=365.32000000000005s)]
*  was made a month ago, in which there were steps. Everything was done by Trump's representatives. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=374.68s)]
*  And now, right at the end, he is pressing Israel to violate the agreement that he himself [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=381.68s)]
*  pressed to sign. So this president is crazy. Everything he says about deportations is exactly [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=389.6s)]
*  the same as what he says about annexing Canada and the Netherlands. And at the same time, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=398.8s)]
*  it's him and Bibi who are going to kill the hostages who are staying there. Isn't it [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=404.28000000000003s)]
*  the same as Hamas who violated the agreement before? No, not at all. That's nonsense. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=409.8s)]
*  The fact that even Israel has this list of... That's an excuse. An inexcus. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=416.8s)]
*  Astonishing stuff there, saying it's Trump and Netanyahu who want to kill the hostages. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=423.8s)]
*  Indeed, the Times of Israel of all outlets had a headline which is very succinct and [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=427.52s)]
*  to the point. In first, Netanyahu's spokesman admits no talks ongoing on Truce's second [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=431.16s)]
*  phase in breach of deal. The question is why has Israel caved and what happens next? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=436.32s)]
*  It's worth noting that the polling shows that 70% of Israelis support the second phase [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=440.76s)]
*  of the hostage ceasefire deal. Before we get carried away here, a large majority also support [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=446.32s)]
*  Trump's proposal to ethnically cleanse Gaza, but clearly Israeli society wants to get their [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=451.15999999999997s)]
*  hostages back alive. If Netanyahu destroys the ceasefire, then those hostages will not [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=455.28s)]
*  return and that could produce a massive backlash in Israeli society. It's also worth contemplating [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=459.6s)]
*  whether Trump, feeling jubilation at claiming to be securing a ceasefire in Ukraine, really [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=464.9s)]
*  wants that overshadowed with massive violence regaining Palestine. However, all of this [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=469.9s)]
*  requires, I'm afraid, some very heavy caveats. Netanyahu has made clear over and over again [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=474.73999999999995s)]
*  he doesn't want a lasting ceasefire. He says he wants to continue the military onslaught [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=478.65999999999997s)]
*  until all of Hamas is destroyed. That's an impossible goal. As the former US Secretary [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=482.02s)]
*  of State Antony Blinken noted, after 15 months of genocidal mayhem and Gaza reduced to rubble, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=486.46s)]
*  Hamas had recruited nearly as many militants as it had lost by January. This is of course [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=491.78s)]
*  inevitable. If you slaughter vast numbers of innocent people, some of their loved ones [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=497.46s)]
*  will always respond by desiring to fight back. Netanyahu's stated goal was impossible and [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=501.46s)]
*  by definition gives Israel's onslaught its genocidal character. We also know from multiple [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=505.94s)]
*  Israeli news reports that Netanyahu has no intention of completing the second phase of [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=510.58s)]
*  the ceasefire deal. Clearly the calculation is to resume the onslaught when Israel has [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=515.5s)]
*  got back as many of its hostages as it can in order to diminish the backlash against [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=519.58s)]
*  Netanyahu from Israeli society. And that's why I'm afraid relief right now should be [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=524.4200000000001s)]
*  tempered by what is still likely to take place. For now, the respite for the Palestinian citizens [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=529.94s)]
*  of Gaza who have so far survived one of the most heinous crimes of our age will continue. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=534.96s)]
*  We should not expect that to last. With the support of the most powerful man on the face [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=539.96s)]
*  of the earth, Israel is likely to resume its genocidal frenzy against the people of Gaza. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TNf9ie3Chg&t=543.82s)]
