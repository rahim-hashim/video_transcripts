# Labour's Outrageous Israel Double Standards Exposed
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [February 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3pmtGWssak)
*  In the words of those great philosophers, Radiohead,
*  you do it to yourself, just you, and that's what really hurts.
*  Now, Labour is in crisis and its leaders only have themselves to blame.
*  Here is a story of grotesque double standards, grubby factional politics,
*  outright dishonesty and what should matter above all,
*  which is how amidst what is officially an alleged genocide,
*  it is those deemed to be critical of some of the worst crimes of the 21st century
*  being hounded from public life rather than those who support the mass slaughter of amongst others
*  many thousands of children. Where to begin?
*  Now, let's start with Azhar Ali, the former Labour candidate for the upcoming Rochdale by-election.
*  Azhar Ali is a leadership loyalist. He's a former New Labour advisor under Tony Blair
*  and Gordon Brown. He's in the in-group. That matters a lot actually.
*  He was recorded at a Labour meeting saying this.
*  Netanyahu deliberately, he was in political trouble, he's in political trouble, he cached it.
*  They deliberately, I believe that, I've said it publicly, they deliberately took the security off.
*  They allowed the massacre, and here's a massacre of 1200 innocent people,
*  they allowed that massacre and that gives them the green light to do whatever the bloody want.
*  Okay, so first off, this is a straightforward baseless conspiracy theory.
*  Now look, it's completely legitimate and based in fact that the Israeli state failed to act on
*  evidence and warnings about an impending attack. Everyone knows that. Indeed, that's the consensus
*  view in Israel itself and one of the reasons Benjamin Netanyahu was so determined to drag the
*  onslaught against Gaza out as long as he can is because it keeps him in power and deflects
*  from his responsibility. Also, totally reasonable to point out the 7th of October attack in which
*  grave and unjustifiable crimes were committed against Israeli civilians that has been used by
*  the most extreme government in Israel's history to perpetrate the sort of war crimes they've
*  clearly always relished perpetrating and indeed many of them have not exactly been subtle about
*  how this is an opportunity to drive the Palestinian people from Gaza an inherently
*  genocide light. That is not the same as Israel deliberately allowed 7th of October. That's just
*  a totally baseless and frankly wacky conspiracy theory when Occam's razor, that is the simplest
*  explanation is normally the most likely, would tell you that the Israeli state was drunk on its
*  triumphalism, believed that Gaza was a sealed tomb for its inhabitants from which nobody would ever
*  be able to escape and they could concentrate instead on tightening the noose around the necks
*  of the Palestinian people in the West Bank, stealing and settling their land, colonizing
*  illegally their land and burying a viable Palestinian state forever. Now the point about this
*  absurd baseless conspiracy theory as we'll see is that if this had been a Labour politician who
*  wasn't left waiting to say all this he'd have been immediately perched with much relish I would say
*  he also would have been publicly crucified from the outset. So how did the Labour leadership
*  respond? They believed that an apology was enough and they continued to support him and campaign
*  for him. Clearly it's an insult to anyone's intelligence to believe that Azar Ali suddenly
*  stopped believing this conspiracy theory because he got in trouble. If you're so attached to a
*  conspiracy theory that you're willing to publicly declare it in front of other people why would you
*  suddenly stop believing it because your bosses order you to apologize in order to save your
*  political career? Let's get real here who really believes any of that? Now what happened next?
*  Shadow cabinet minister Lisa Nandi was sent up to campaign with him a few hours later. The shadow
*  cabinet minister Nick Tommen-Simmons was sent out to defend him on the airways. Let's hear from that
*  shall we? What Councillor Ali has also said is that he apologizes unreservedly, he retracts the
*  comments and he's also said which I think is hugely important that he understands now the gravity the
*  scale of the offense that's been caused and knows he needs to rebuild trust huge task ahead of him
*  with the Jewish community and that is what I would now expect him to get on to do. Why should
*  the Jewish community accept his apology? Well look I take what Councillor Ali has said at face value,
*  he said he fell for an online conspiracy theory and that does not represent his view. But somebody
*  who can fall for an online conspiracy theory of this magnitude, is he the right person to represent
*  the good people of Rochdale? People can get things very wrong that's obviously what's
*  happened here and Councillor Ali has to learn lessons from that. What Thomas-Simmons does here
*  is attempt mitigation, it's actually a plea for sympathy that would not have been extended to a
*  politician who wasn't in the in-group or a left-wing politician. Well come on to that.
*  Then there's Louise Elman, the former Labour MP, she's close to the leadership, she said she was
*  appalled as are Ali's outrageous and offensive conspiracy theories then goes on to say she's
*  known him for over 20 years adding he's consistently supported me when I was subjected to anti-semitic
*  attacks, said that she's always found him to be an ally which makes these comments she says out of
*  character and that he should have the opportunity to work with the Jewish community to restore the
*  loss of trust that his actions have caused. Others came to his defense as well, we could go on. Now
*  I'll put these comments in proper context shortly but suffice it to say we can clearly conclude there
*  was a deliberate attempt by the leadership of the Labour Party to save Azar Ali's career. Then after
*  a couple of days of this and uproar further comments emerge, let's have a listen. It shouldn't have
*  been suspended right? It was suspended on what was said and you know I know him really well
*  and he's a solid Palestinian pro-Palestinian supporter. The media and some of the people in
*  the media from certain Jewish quarters were given **** about what he said. Now look let's be clear
*  when you're talking about people in the media from certain Jewish quarters you're just being
*  anti-semitic it's classic conspiratorial stuff about shadowy Jewish power and indeed if we're
*  going to just be accurate about what he was talking about lots of people who were Jewish were involved
*  and I'd note the leadership of the Labour Party which is not Jewish is itself looking for any
*  excuse to purge left-wing MPs like Andy McDonald, come on to that. So when all this happened they
*  clearly just had absolutely no choice but to withdraw support from the guy I mean it was just
*  ludicrous to suggest there was any other option for them. So listen then to Keir Starmer.
*  Information came to light over the weekend in relation to the candidate there was a fulsome
*  apology further information came to light yesterday calling for decisive action so I took
*  decisive action it is a huge thing to withdraw support for a Labour candidate during the course
*  of a by-election it's a tough decision a necessary decision but when I say the Labour Party has
*  changed under my leadership. Oh come on Keir, honestly just taking a piss decisive action,
*  gaslighting. Azar Ali was in their faction their gang one of their own so they tried to save it.
*  Straightforward compared to left-winger Andy McDonald let's hear what he said before he was
*  suspended. We will not rest until we have justice
*  until all people Israelis and Palestinians between the river and the sea can live in
*  peaceful liberty. He was suspended for that let's be clear there was absolutely nothing with what
*  he said there was a much repeated claim by apologists for Israeli crimes that from the
*  river to the sea Palestine will be free is somehow racist or even genocidal. Firstly that's a
*  nonsense the vast majority using that slogan simply support the national self-determination of
*  the Palestinian people who from the river Jordan i.e. in the West Bank to the sea i.e. in Gaza are
*  subjugated by Israeli oppression. I note the founding charter of Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud
*  party declares between the sea and the Jordan there will only be Israeli sovereignty and indeed
*  the Israeli ambassador to the UK Zippy Hotevelli has used the phrase between the sea and the
*  Jordan river there needs to be one state only the state of Israel so it's perfectly acceptable for
*  the current masters of Israel to use from the river to the sea to describe a project of stealing
*  Palestinian land building legal settlements of it subjugating Palestinian citizens with apartheid
*  and as things stand carrying out an alleged genocide but it's genocidal if supporters of
*  Palestine do it when referring to national self-determination that is ridiculous in any
*  case Andy McDonald did not use that phrase he said that the Palestinian people who were
*  and he did not use that phrase he specifically used the phrase to use peaceful coexistence so
*  what he did is answer the allegation that between the river and the sea could be construed as
*  something it isn't by explicitly spelling out peaceful coexistence between Israelis and
*  Palestinians so what happened to Andy McDonald when he said that he was suspended and he's still
*  suspended what did the aforementioned Louise Elman say when Andy McDonald was suspended the
*  Labour party's right to suspend the whip from Andy McDonald that's what she said when Jews are
*  experiencing unprecedented levels of anti-Semitism evoking the river to the sea is deeply provocative
*  and irresponsible Labour's acting on its pledge to make the party a safe space for Jews so he said
*  nothing nothing anywhere near as bad as Azhar Ali but suspending the whip in his case was making
*  the party a safe place for Jews when he was calling for peaceful coexistence between Israelis and
*  Palestinians ridiculous doesn't even begin to cover this double standard I mean honestly it is
*  ridiculous let's just use another example shall we okay Osamor also a left winger not in the
*  in-group on the day the international court of justice the highest court on earth placed Israel
*  on trial for alleged genocide she included gars in a list of genocides for that she was suspended
*  see again you can be just to be clear you can be a Labour MP and support war crimes which just so
*  you know who I'm referring to I mean Kirstama he supported Israel's right to cut off water and
*  energy to a civilian population a war crime but if you describe the honest thoughts against Gaza
*  as a genocide when the highest court on earth has just accepted it could be a plausible genocide
*  you're out now the defense of Ali is well he did an immediate fulsome apology of retraction because
*  he was forced to to save his political career but so did left wing Gideon Abba after comments she
*  made in a letter to the Observer newspaper she was immediately suspended and a 10-month
*  investigation has since been kicked into the long grass so what can we conclude from all of that
*  very obvious isn't it the Stammer leadership is just looking for an excuse to kick out left-wing
*  MPs so much so that it's purged two of the only black women in the parliamentary Labour party
*  but it will come to the rescue of one of its own I would note for example that the Labour leadership
*  briefed journalists that when Jamie Corbyn had the whip withdrawn following his response to the
*  Equalities and Human Rights Commission investigation they went around saying that that this was a
*  clause four moment that's what they described it as clause four just so you're aware was
*  the it is in the Labour Party constitution it previously committed labour to public ownership
*  labour Tony Blair got rid of it so it was about defining labour against his its left wing past
*  so what they said when Jamie Corbyn was suspended they went around briefing that it wasn't to do
*  with anti-semitism that they were gleeful about but that it defined labour against its left-wing
*  past that has nothing to do with anti-semitism that is completely driven by politics now if you
*  think about all this Azar Ali is guilty clearly of a far worse offense than anything the others have
*  done indeed Kate Osmore and Annie McDonald have done absolutely nothing wrong whatsoever
*  I completely support their comments completely support them let's just recall what Louise
*  Ellman said about knowing Azar Ali for 20 years and defending him on that basis so what matters
*  isn't what you say it's who you know and what your politics are if you've got people who you're part
*  of this in-group with the Labour leadership who can vouch for you then that's absolutely fine if
*  you're in the right faction but that's not about fighting anti-semitism is it that's just naked
*  factionalism I don't even think that's subtle it gets worse it gets far worse now Graham Jones is
*  a former Labour MP and now a parliamentary candidate now Graham Jones is on the most
*  right-wing flank of the Labour party I hold no candle for him to say the least he once called
*  me and I quote an Iranian hangman not a hangman he got that he got the grammar wrong because I
*  opposed the British back Saudi war in Yemen now I can confirm just in case anyone was maybe a bit
*  confused I'm not actually a public executioner employed by the Iranian regime I'd point out that
*  this sort of attack he launched on me there was obviously unhinged but it underlines that some of
*  us have a consistent record in imposing opposing western backed war crimes whether it be Saudi
*  Arabia or indeed Israel now let's just listen to some comments from Graham Jones shall we
*  fucking Israel again you know and I'm sure that all these people think when they go home but you
*  will not get Israel over the line unless we go at them hard but why is there British people in
*  the idea yeah that's a really good well this has been raised because we have a simple rule
*  unless unless unless there is a military alliance between us and that particular country
*  or whatever then or or an individual one you should not be fighting
*  no British person should be fighting for any other country at all full stop is against the law and
*  you should be locked up on a technicality I don't think he's got the law right but morally speaking
*  there's nothing wrong with what he has said here nothing wrong with it Israel is a state let's just
*  keep emphasizing this on trial for alleged genocide at the international court of justice
*  the evidence for war crimes being committed by the Israeli state is absolutely overwhelming
*  not least given IDF soldiers keep posting their war crimes on TikTok obviously British citizens
*  should not be serving in that army unlike the other Jones I happen to believe in due process
*  which means all British citizens who return after serving the IDF should be subject to an automatic
*  criminal investigation to ascertain exactly what they did in Gaza if they're found to have committed
*  war crimes they need to be locked up in any case Jones was suspended for his comments the fact that
*  I'm now having to defend my mortal one of my mortal political enemies is absurd completely
*  absurd but it's necessary on a point of principle you see questions of anti-semitism or indeed any
*  other form of racism should not be factional matters that was what a report overseen by the
*  lawyer Martin Ford Casey commissioned by Keir Starmer concluded and as Martin Ford said this
*  week in reference to his report one of his enduring concerns was the way in which anti-semitism was
*  weaponized along factional lines which is clearly what Starmer's faction has done and keeps doing
*  I'm not going to sleep to their level now listen to this just as a case in point and I have to say
*  this really is chef's kisses this is the icing on the cake Ed Balls, Labour's charming former shadow
*  chancellor who lost his seat in 2015 reinvented himself as a reality tv star he's the husband of
*  a Labour shadow cabinet minister and also a presenter on Good Morning Britain let's just
*  listen to him talking about Graham Jones stand back here second and get some facts um as Ali
*  said a terrible thing terrible the Jewish media thing that's what he's been dealt with Graham
*  Jones I know him really well yeah was an MP yeah he's not a Corbynite no not hard left absolutely
*  not and he was the Rocha candidate he's been absolutely not anti-israel yeah absolutely not
*  anti-israel in fact if anything on the other side of that argument very very deeply embedded
*  knowledge about the military I think what had happened was he and as well he had been told to
*  go to a meeting to reassure the community that they were being listened to but I don't think
*  he was intending to send those kind of anti-semitic messages at all you could all imagine say kind of
*  expletive America expletive France the thing he said about the military is true I think is
*  extremely unwise but to describe him yeah what he said as anti-semitic I think is untrue that's why
*  I think there might be Graham Jones is not an anti-semitic what do you even say what do you even
*  say here not even pretending just saying the quiet part out loud Graham Jones can't be guilty
*  because he's not left-wing that's what he's saying so if Graham Jones had said the same thing but he
*  was left-wing that would be different balls are saying here that you should decide whether claims
*  of anti-semitism are valid depending on whether or not the accusers left-wing or not they're just
*  saying this stuff out loud so if you're in the in-group of the Labour Party and you are baselessly
*  accused of anti-semitism you can get a TV presenter who is your mate to write you a character reference
*  on national television you want to see this spelled out even more in primary colours here's what Ed
*  Ball said two days before that particular clip about Andy McDonald and Kate Osamor two left-wingers
*  suspended who did not say anything anti-semitic Kate Osamor in Edmonton in London and Annie
*  McDonald in Middlesbrough have been suspended for saying things that frankly I didn't think they
*  should have been suspended I think Osamor's was very tasteless but McDonald's I don't think was
*  but anyway but nevertheless they've been suspended for what you would call lesser offenses but they've
*  been suspended for a very particular reason which is that Keir Starmer defined his leadership as
*  clearing up the anti-semitism of the Jeremy Corbyn period and then look at the well fair play to this
*  guy he's absolutely brazen not even hiding it nothing McDonald or Osamor said was anti-semitic
*  as the mirror is Kevin Maguire his credit makes clear here but suddenly Ed Balls justifies the
*  action taken against them on the basis of Starmer sharing tough leadership you see Osamor and
*  McDonald aren't Balls' mate and they're not in his faction how is this allowed according to
*  broadcast labels by the way just having a labor politician defending his faction on national
*  television and throwing members of who aren't part of his faction overboard look questions of
*  anti-semitism shouldn't be factional weapons I mean the fact that I even have to say this
*  is clearly ridiculous anti-semitism is an evil it is real it's rising and it needs to be fought
*  it is not an excuse to clobber your opponents but if you expect me to have some shadenfoy in here to
*  go ha ha ha how do I get them apples that the labor rights attempt to crush their opponents has
*  rebounded on them so even the owner getting purged I'm not going to do that because there's something
*  far more serious at stake here the Telegraph this week has a article pointing at several labor
*  politicians some on the right of the party some on the left none of them are guilty of anti-semitism
*  all have expressed criticism of Israel and not least it's war crimes all of them are seven of
*  them are asian the right-wing blogger Guido Forks who keeps leaking the recordings of the meeting
*  involving Azar Ali and Graham Jones and is thus driving a scandal about supposed racism in the
*  labor party tweeted this the thing that nobody says yet we all know is that the labor party have
*  chosen to seek unsophisticated muslim community support for numerical reasons at the expense of
*  sophisticated jewish support that's what he wrote absolutely incredible behavior just wanton racism
*  he deleted the tweet so what clearly it's what he believes indeed when someone replied that sounds
*  flat out racist to me I don't know what the muslim community in Rochdale or anywhere else in britain
*  is unsophisticated how do you what evidence are you basing that slur on he replied well tomorrow
*  you will be able to hear to listen to more of their thinking I mean what is this a right-wing
*  blogger dripping with racism there powering a political crisis in labor based on adjudicating
*  who's racist and who's not this is absurd and it underlies the total hypocrisy this entire episode
*  this is not about fighting racism as the Telegraph shows it's clear where all this is heading
*  where anyone who opposes the mass slaughter of palestinians is driven from public life treated
*  as hateful extremists well those who support this historic crime being committed by Israel
*  with western support and weapons they suffer no repercussions whatsoever what a despicable outrage
*  and what all of us have to fight against and that means being principled and consistent please like
