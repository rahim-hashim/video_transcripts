# US 'Gives OK' To Israeli Catastrophic Invasion
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sroqameTxis)
*  This disturbing report reveals so much about how Israel is allowed to get away with terrible
*  crimes on a mass scale and about how the US plays a pivotal role in facilitating them.
*  Now around 1.5 million Palestinians, a majority of Gaza's pre-war population,
*  that is those who survived, are crammed into Raffa, a city in the very south near the border
*  with Egypt, a town which had a very small pre-war population, certainly not meant to accommodate
*  a population of that size or anything close. Now most of Gaza's civilian infrastructure has been
*  severely damaged or destroyed over the last six and a half months. In nearby Khan Yunis,
*  after Israeli forces withdrew, we saw pictures of total devastation with around 90% of buildings
*  estimated to have been destroyed. We can see that the Israeli state has willfully,
*  intentionally left most of Gaza uninhabitable, as indeed many of its leaders and officials
*  promised they would do. In Raffa, meanwhile, up to 40% of buildings are estimated to have been
*  destroyed, which in any other context would rightly be regarded as frankly apocalyptic,
*  but makes Raffa one of the least devastated parts of Gaza. Now supposedly the US, Israel's main patron
*  and protector of course, has been warning Israel off from an assault on Raffa, but Israel keeps
*  saying loudly and proudly that they're going to attack Raffa, indeed Benjamin Netanyahu has
*  suggested that is a date already finalised. If that happens, the consequences will be completely
*  catastrophic as we'll discuss, but now we hear a change of plan is mooted from the United States.
*  According to the Qatari media outlet Al-Arabi Al-Jadid, Egyptian officials have told them the
*  following, the American administration showed acceptance of the plan previously presented by
*  the occupation government regarding the military operation in Raffa in exchange for not carrying
*  out a large scale attack against Iran. The officials tell the outlet that preparations are
*  underway so Egypt can deal with any possible impact of the planned assault on Raffa. Now the
*  US has denied these reports, but we know according to Reuters that the US and Israel held a virtual
*  meeting about Israel's plans for Raffa today, Thursday, a follow-up to a similar meeting held
*  at the start of the month. Reuters says the meeting comes as Israel considers launching an attack on
*  Iranian targets in response to Iran's launching of a barrage of drones and ballistic missiles
*  last weekend against Israel. It adds Washington has tried to dissuade the Israelis from retaliatory
*  strikes to avoid inflaming an already tense situation, a second US official said.
*  Now let's just consider how depraved all of this is. How monstrously cynical this is.
*  The Israeli state bombed Iran's consulate in Damascus on the 1st of April, killing several
*  Iranian generals and military officers. According to the New York Times, they told their military
*  protector the US just before they did so. It notes publicly US officials voiced support for Israel,
*  but privately they expressed anger that it would take such aggressive action against Iran
*  without consulting Washington. Well that just sums it up doesn't it. The US
*  provides unequivocal, limitless support for Israel in practice. Occasionally engages in private and
*  public hand-wringing, but uses none of its actual massive leverage to stop Israel behaving like
*  this for example. It then says the Israelis had badly miscalculated, thinking that Iran would not
*  react strongly, according to multiple American officials who evolved in high-level discussions
*  after the attack, a view shared by senior Israeli officials. Now here I'm going to have to arc my
*  eyebrow in a very cynical way. I don't believe for one second that a country like Israel would
*  bomb a foreign consulate, clearly violating international rules and norms, and wipe out
*  their generals and army officers unless they expect a substantial striking response. And I
*  know the reasons they didn't tell the US is almost certainly because it isn't obviously in the
*  interests of the United States. The United States is a profoundly damaged power after the military
*  cataclysms of Iraq and Afghanistan in particular, so triggering a wider war is just not in its
*  interests. Iran and all the destabilization that would mean. Now apparently as well Israel had
*  planned this strike for two weeks previously. What actually happened here is Israel clearly,
*  intentionally willfully began a military escalation with Iran. You'd have to be, I'm sorry,
*  profoundly stupid and or gullible to think Israel did not deliberately initiate an escalation.
*  That then raises the specter of regional war that distracts everyone from Israel's genocidal campaign
*  in Gaza, which a has proved a strategic failure for Israel. After well over six months, they
*  failed to achieve their war aims and B which has decisively shifted public opinion against them in
*  the states which arm and support them. Now it forced this action or it forces the action
*  or the US to stop succumbing to public pressure. Instead then Joe Biden describes what will be the
*  ironclad support for Israel against Iran. So it stops them backsliding and it drags out the war.
*  So Netanyahu can't be removed from power and jail for corruption charges. But we can also see
*  another benefit here, which is Israel says to the US, well guys, we either trigger a regional war
*  with another attack on Iranian territory or you let us do the murderous onslaught of Rafah that
*  you told us we can't. It's your choice. What do you want us to do? Pick one. Well, you can see
*  that can't you? How this escalation, which we're supposed to believe was a miscalculation,
*  has played in their favour. As a brilliant Israeli journalist, Demi Rida puts it,
*  the most Netanyahu thing to do now would be to use the threat of re-vitalization in Iran
*  to secure a green light for a massive attack on Rafah. He actually wrote this just before the
*  reports came out. So obviously this guy knows what he's talking about. The most binding thing to do
*  would be to fall for it, allow the former and then likely get the latter anyway. Well indeed. Look,
*  some might go, well, look, this is just one report from one source to one Qatari news outlet. But the
*  point is, look at what's happened all the way through. The US has allowed Israel to commit some
*  of the worst crimes of the 21st century, self-evidently cause massive destabilization,
*  which frankly even more destructive consequences for an already hobbled United States quite
*  plausibly destroyed Joe Biden's chances of getting re-elected with all that means for the future of
*  US democracy. And the hanging of the US throughout has counted for nothing. At the beginning of last
*  month, just to put all of this in the proper context in which it deserves, the human context,
*  The Intercept reported that a leaked diplomatic cable from the US embassy in Israel written by
*  officials with the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance at the US Agency for International
*  Development, the acronyms USAID, about the consequences. This is about the consequences
*  of an all out Israeli invasion of Ratha. What it would mean for actual human beings, which is what
*  we should talk about. It said that a potential escalation of military operations in within
*  southern Gaza's Ratha governorate would result in catastrophic humanitarian consequences,
*  including mass civilian casualties, extensive population displacement and the collapse of the
*  existing humanitarian response. Multiple relief actors have warned USAID's Levant Disaster
*  Assistance Response Team. They added an offensive in Ratha would likely block the entry and transport
*  fuel and life saving humanitarian assistance throughout the enclave, rendering critical
*  infrastructure inoperable and leaving people in Gaza without food, medicine, shelter and water.
*  Well, that's a really key point, which is completely missing in all of this because
*  Israel has prevented the aid that Gaza desperately needs from entering. I've covered this at huge
*  length and I'm going to do more on this in terms of how they've willfully starved the place and
*  stop people getting the necessities of life. But Ratha is the main, obviously means just there,
*  the border with Egypt for getting that assistance across. And then all of that will be prevented by
*  a military onslaught, which will have consequences, catastrophic consequences for people throughout
*  Gaza. Now, this leaked cable also made clear that Ratha was already in a catastrophic situation then.
*  That was the beginning of March and we're in mid-April now. Well, look, yesterday it was reported
*  Israel has deployed extra artillery and armoured personnel carries the Gaza periphery, suggesting
*  preparation for their long threatened, drowned offensive. Now, here's another key point. What
*  Israel's entirely manufactured standoff with Iran has done is shift attention away from the atrocities
*  being committed by Israel every single day. Atrocities which, as I keep saying, rank amongst
*  the worst committed in the 21st century. Atrocities which, if just a single of these atrocities, was
*  committed by a state hostile to the West, we would see wall to wall coverage of just one of
*  those atrocities. And I'm going to give you an example. Just listen to this report from Al Jazeera.
*  We're looking at a very horrific attack that just took place at a Marazi refugee camp within the
*  past 45 minutes or so. A drone fired the missiles on a group of people. Later on, we learned it from
*  eyewitness in the area that this where a group of children at a playground that was set up near
*  a camp for displaced families. And those children are regularly visiting this playground. And just
*  as a father of three children, I understand why displaced families would send their kids just for
*  an hour or a couple hours just to keep them entertained and release the old and negative
*  energy in them. Because right now, displaced families have the hardest time inside tents or
*  inside other people's residential homes trying to stay protected and safe. But it's as necessary as
*  also staying safe just to give space to those children. So 11 children have been killed in this
*  attack. And just one wonder what threat these children have posed to have the Israeli military
*  fire a missile drone on them. Eleven reported killed with more with dozens of injuries in the
*  area. Those who had seen of the of the of the attack described horrific scenes of the children
*  torn apart by the massive explosion caused by by the missiles.
*  11 Palestinian children slaughtered after an Israeli drone fired a missile into a group of
*  children in a playground. Again, should I have to play these games? Imagine it was 11 Israeli kids,
*  or 11 British kids, or 11 American kids. You know what the answer is. And you know what it says
*  about the value attached to Palestinian life. And let's go on. I mean, you know, remember that the
*  Israeli state claims their military is amongst the most advanced in the world with sophisticated
*  high tech beyond our imagination. So what the hell is happening here exactly? Do you know what?
*  Disgust me. I'll be honest. Unlike Iran's attack on Israel, which killed no one, there won't be
*  wall to wall outrage over the Israeli killing of 11 Palestinian kids, as there's been a lack of
*  outrage over over 14,000 of these kids being slaughtered. Why? Because Palestinian life is
*  considered worthless. Now, I'm sorry to add further finally to your disgust, but let's just listen to
*  this clip now from the Israeli ambassadors to the UK, Zippy Hottivelli. So many missiles being
*  thrown on Israel, and barely no, you know, damage and the people of Israel are safe. It's just
*  because one reason they didn't hit Israel, most of them. And just imagine how things would have
*  looked if the missile that our defense secretary was showing to the world, defense minister Galant
*  was showing to the world. This is a five story size, 18 meters. This is huge missile. And think
*  about it, you know, falling in the middle of a city like Jerusalem, we're now in beautiful
*  scenery of Jerusalem. But look how populated it is. Just think about it, you know, hitting
*  neighborhoods and people and children. It would have been a disaster. Well, there's no better
*  illustration of the mentality these people is there. She asked us to imagine the horrible
*  destruction if an Iranian missile had landed in the middle of Jerusalem, as if we have no
*  other reference point for the mass destruction of innocent civilians, including children.
*  Apart from a minute that Iran's weapons were aimed at military targets from everything we know,
*  and were done knowing they would not succeed at hitting them. Not justification, I should add,
*  for either Iran's regime, for which I have no truck, or indeed for their military strike,
*  which I oppose as I oppose all military escalation. Unlike the people on team bomb things who have
*  frankly caused mass death and mass destruction, and are still fetid as men and women of moderation
*  and statesmen and people who dominate our foreign policy. The fact is Israel has virtually wiped
*  Gaza from the face of the earth. As I keep saying, it has been so horrifically bombed Gaza that it
*  now looks like a different color and texture when looked at from space, that when including those
*  buried under the rubble, we could now be looking at an estimated well over 50,000 Palestinians
*  slaughtered. And that's just those who suffered violent deaths, not those who are dying, for
*  example, for lack of medical care, food and all the rest, around 20,000 of them kids. But those
*  are responsible for this abominable crime, simply don't regard Palestinians as human beings. So they
*  can't look at these hideous atrocities they've inflicted on them and feel any pain that they're
*  suffering. So they have to invent hypotheticals that if those they regard as their own people
*  to be killed by an attack which never happened instead. And indeed, earlier this year on national
*  radio, this ambassador refused to deny in a UK radio interview that she was arguing for destroying
*  the whole of Gaza. And when asked if she was advocating destroying every building in Gaza,
*  she responded, do you have another solution? It should be abundantly clear. This is a genocidal
*  onslaught and a key plank of this genocidal onslaught is destroy Rafa, ensuring there's
*  nowhere habitable in Gaza for its population combined with a policy of mass starvation,
*  the intentional famine caused by Israel and the siege on the essentials of life. And the US
*  administration and its Western allies have done nothing to stop this just empty hand wringing
*  while the Israeli state has made it clear will behave as it wishes because it can call the bluff
*  of those who have in practice, massive leverage. And that's why the horrors that are to come
*  on top of the horrors that have already happened are not only on the Israeli state,
*  but on the Western states who made it possible. Please like and subscribe, do leave your comments,
