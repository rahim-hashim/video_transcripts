# Ex-Israeli Negotiator's SHOCKING Analysis Of What's Really Happening - w. Daniel Levy
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHFTn-O8Dgs)
*  Now we've seen over a year of course of hideous horror. What's currently taking place in
*  northern Gaza is unspeakable. Well, unfortunately, literally in a sense, because the Israeli
*  state has attempted to suppress all communications coming from northern Gaza as it is believed,
*  and this has been widely circulated in the Israeli press, including particularly Haaretz,
*  that the so-called General's Plan is being executed, which in essence means the ethnic
*  cleansing of northern Gaza. At the same time, we've had this conference organised by the
*  ruling party, Likud, which is openly advocating colonising, settling Gaza. Now we've got us
*  to talk about, but we've got a brilliant guest, Daniel Levy, who is a former member of Israel's
*  negotiating team. He's also an esteemed analyst. We interviewed him many months ago. We should
*  have interviewed him far more recently than we have, because there's so many incredible
*  insights. I think it's to say, so Dan, great to see you. How are you doing in this dystopian world?
*  Yes, that's the only way to describe it, but it's good to see you, Owen.
*  Yeah, you seem wrong. I want to start with someone called Yura Island, who is an Israeli
*  general and the former head of the Israeli National Security Council. A year ago, he wrote an article
*  in a journal, which is quite obscure to most people, I would say, called Fathom, which is a
*  journal which is published by BICOM, which is the main pro-Israel lobbying organisation in Britain,
*  I would say. The point about this article is, from day one, the Israeli state has not been subtle
*  about its intentions. It's very rare, actually, for a state to be so open about intentions,
*  which are clearly in violation of the most rudimentary basics of international law.
*  In that, he called for the whole of Gaza, for its entire population, to be removed. He said
*  either temporarily or permanently. He said, using siege, he supported the total siege,
*  which was imposed openly by the defence minister, Jobe Gallant, on October the 9th,
*  when he said famously that they were fighting human animals. In this article, he said,
*  the people should be told that they have two choices, to stay and to starve or to leave,
*  just openly inciting war crimes in a British journal there. The point there I'm just putting
*  to you is, more recently, he is the architect of something called the General's Plan,
*  which advocates basically imposing what I just said in northern Gaza.
*  I mean, let's just be clear about this. Do you think it's just obvious that's what's happening?
*  Is the General's Plan, the whole population of northern Gaza, being removed? And is that permanent?
*  What do you think? Yeah, I would like to believe that the journal that you referenced, Fathom,
*  would have put in some kind of acknowledgement to distance themselves from the calls from war crimes.
*  They called it a briefing. They said it was a briefing.
*  And I imagine that material was shared as perfectly legitimate stuff. Look, there is an awful
*  lot of accounting that will need to happen after this in terms of who and in what ways,
*  and in violation of what national and international laws people were complicit in actively encouraging
*  genocide. But let's understand what's going on first, and then we can come to that accounting
*  in the course of history. So I also want to start by acknowledging it didn't take that plan
*  for Israel to be conducting itself in this way in Gaza, right? Because you referenced
*  what Gallant said in terms of human animals, the commitment within hours of the reality
*  of what itself was a crime on October 7th, coming to light, being known. Netanyahu says we're going
*  to turn Gaza into rubble anywhere there is Hamas, having predefined all of Gaza in that way.
*  The defense minister says no food, fuel, water, and electricity. Already signalling on day one,
*  we are going to commit war crimes. By day six, the Israeli president, drawn from the Labor Party,
*  not from the so-called extreme right, has said, what is this distinction? There are no innocent
*  civilians. There is no distinction. We're all familiar with that. So I say that because it
*  doesn't take your island. And the plan, and I understood Stan, came out of something called
*  the Forum of Commanders and Soldiers in Reserve. It's up on their website still, I believe.
*  It didn't take this plan. A lot of this was being put into effect already. But what we have now,
*  I think, is having shunted Palestinians from one unsafe place to another as everything was destroyed.
*  You now have this focus on northern Gaza. Israel has created this netzerim corridor in the middle
*  of Gaza. So it's kind of separated Gaza into two. Gaza may be separated into three different
*  stages. And so the intention here is to clear one area. As you said, the Giora island has talked
*  about starvation. He's also talked about spreading of disease as a way of removing people from this
*  area, making it impossible for anything to get in. Haaretz has run an investigative piece,
*  which actually quotes reservists serving in Gaza saying it is not declared, but their understanding
*  is that the general's plan is what is being implemented. One thing we should note is that
*  subsequent to the starts of these hearings in the International Court of Justice, in the case brought
*  by South Africa on violations of the Genocide Convention, when those hearings began, the
*  remarkable thing was, it wasn't like we've excavated these writings and we've discovered
*  that there were documents being passed and then leaked from one government official to the other
*  that called for the following. It wasn't that. It wasn't what Israel sometimes kind of says,
*  hey, we found this document like they did in the hospitals at some stage. Here's the lists of all
*  the hostages and the crimes being committed. It was a list of days of the week. I mean, stuff that
*  was amateurish. No, exhibit A in that case were the statements of senior Israeli officials,
*  were the videos of Israelis recording themselves proud of what they were doing. Okay.
*  So fast forward to where we are now. The understanding is that what is being implemented
*  is a plan to displace all of the Palestinian population in northern Gaza,
*  destroy what hasn't been destroyed already, anyone, anything that is left. And I mean,
*  I want to let you in into some of the conversations happening inside Israel. So you reference there,
*  Owen, a meeting that took place hosted by Likud, hosted by Likud parliamentarians,
*  with also the ministers from the far right party, with settler leaders such as Daniela Weiss, who's
*  a whole world of joy in her own right. And in that meeting, you have the call and the meeting is
*  entitled planning for the resettlement of Gaza. You have people making the case because there are
*  a few important threads here. First, we have people making the case where settlement ends,
*  security ends. And here you see an alignment after a long period in which it's not like
*  settlement wasn't happening. It's not like violations of the rights of Palestinians weren't
*  happening. Those were happening all the time, every day for decades. But there was this
*  disconnect between a security mindset, which actually said settlements are not good for
*  Israel's security. There are things that we're doing which cannot offer Israeli sustained security,
*  as was witnessed on October 7th, and the ideological messianic thrust of ethnic cleansing,
*  displacing Palestinians, settling the land for Jews only. And here what you see is the
*  reintegration of those themes. You have seen emerge. It's been there already, but it has emerged as
*  somewhat hegemonic in this past period, a new national security thinking, which says we need
*  to be permanently there. The answer is resettlement of Gaza. And there is a cohort. Your island,
*  who we've been referencing, is kind of a thing unto himself. But you have people like Yaakov Amid
*  Rol, Gershyn Hakoen. People can look up those names who have been making this argument in national
*  security times. You've had the journalist closest to Netanyahu, Amit Segal, saying that he understands
*  that the plan is part of Gaza will no longer be Gaza. Gaza will be smaller than it once was. Of
*  course, it's destroyed, everyone displaced. But he's also saying we will have to take some of that
*  land. Aluf Ben, the editor of Aretser said that the plan for Gaza is to resettle Gaza.
*  And then you have these other plans coming out, apparently backed by the Americans,
*  apparently with Emirati and others involved, to place there private security firms. There's a firm
*  headed by someone called Mati Kahana, GDC. It's almost like a Western Wagner Group,
*  right? That they're thinking of inserting into Gaza to run things. They'll be in charge of
*  killing civilians, of doing whatever the nasty work that needs to be done.
*  S0N0N0M1S
*  Grim stuff there. Just to give you an idea, no, no, this is the reality we're dealing with. You
*  mentioned about epidemics, just so people are clear about the quote there. He said to Giro Island
*  that Israel should embrace the spread of epidemics because it will bring victory closer and reduce
*  casualties among IDF soldiers. And he also denounced talk of the poor women of Gaza on the
*  grounds that all the mothers, sisters, or wives of Hamas murderers. You're quite right,
*  he's a self-described advisor to Yoav Galant, the defense minister. But what that entails
*  exactly, obviously, is not entirely clear. He's not associated with the Israeli right.
*  He's against Benjamin Netanyahu, if that's people's metric.
*  Okay, so just on this, it is what Israel is actually executing here, in plain sight.
*  Despite their efforts, they've now put targets on the backs of six Al Jazeera journalists, having
*  already implemented the biggest slaughter of journalists in recorded history in such a short
*  space of time. These are the six journalists, which just coincidentally happened to be in
*  northern Gaza, who they've now just labeled to be Hamas or Islamic. He had terrorists.
*  They did something similar to an Al Jazeera journalist a few months ago. The document which
*  came out, which Israel produced, suggested, if you believed it, that the Al Jazeera journalists
*  in question must have received Hamas military honors at the age of 10 years old. So the committee
*  to protect journalists and others have pointed out that clearly this evidence is not actually
*  credible. But the point I'm making is we know there's enough, it's clear, it's not subtle.
*  This speaks to a level of impunity, doesn't it? They don't think the U.S. under the Democrats
*  presented any serious obstacle to them doing any of this. So this is so blatant and so such an
*  affront to the basic rudiments of what the international is supposed to say.
*  So their view clearly is there will be no consequences. They've pushed at the door.
*  It kept pushing. Nothing stopped them. Is that what's happening? They concluded they really can
*  get away with anything. And I'm just interested, do you think it's ad hoc,
*  or do you think this was kind of what they were always going to end up doing?
*  Well, I mean, as you've implied, there's a piece of this which is there are all kinds of
*  plans. Some are more battlefield related, but many are more politically, ideologically driven.
*  And there's a panoply of things there. And then you test the water. And as you say, you see what
*  the traffic bears. You see what you can get away with. And it's almost like you keep falling
*  through another door thinking, are we really here? And that just happened. I mean, one of the things
*  we've talked about the highly self-incriminating stuff from the first weeks and months,
*  there are still things that fall into that mold. I think you have a bit less of that, like the
*  disowning declaratively of what they're doing in Gaza, because they have noticed that it's...
*  And let's come back to this question of how does impunity sit with some quite strong rulings of
*  the International Court of Justice and of the International Criminal Court, which are, of course,
*  not self-implementing. But they did notice that maybe you should say things differently. So what
*  is in the public domain looks a bit different now, but what doesn't look different is what they are
*  doing. And you touched on something that I think really matters and is a badge of shame for
*  mainstream Western media outlets, which is they are not in Gaza. They are not allowed into Gaza,
*  rather than working more extensively with local stringers. They constantly go to Israeli official
*  sources who have time and time again been caught in the act of disinformation. And you very rarely
*  hear or insufficiently hear from those local and other sources. And I say that also against the
*  backdrop of what we see in Lebanon right now, because there still is access to Lebanon.
*  So when Israel says, well, we bombed this hospital and there is money under the hospital, the kind of
*  stuff, the kind of claims that are not credible that we heard coming out of Gaza. But they go
*  to that hospital in Beirut. There was a BBC report. They went there and lo and behold, nothing.
*  But in Gaza, and this is media talking about how media is treated and just ignoring it. 128,
*  according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, 128 journalists killed so far.
*  And their bar is higher than that of others. There are other numbers out there that are higher in
*  terms of the number of journalists killed. A target on the back of Al Jazeera journalists,
*  as you say, actively preventing the story from northern Gaza getting out. And just this
*  really lame attempt to go into that. And it's more than lame. It's also that there is,
*  it's not a narrative. There is a truth about what is going on that is pretty much inadmissible
*  in polite Western political and media circles. And if you can't acknowledge what is being
*  done, what is happening, what is the ideological thrust behind it, then you can never get the
*  policy right. And what I see is a world in which there is a Western elite political media narrative
*  and there is a reality on the ground seen by the rest of the world. And they've been going like
*  this, going more and more distance. And in a way, the moment of Simwa's death,
*  I thought, brought that home really powerfully. And also told us how much even the Israelis,
*  who let's face it, they have invested a lot in Psiops and in how do we influence the other side
*  and what's going on there. They released this video of Simwa thinking that it will be a
*  demonstration of, I don't know, his weakness, his detachment from his people. By the way,
*  Jeremy Bowen then from the BBC reports on this is how it is being understood amongst Palestinians
*  in Gaza across much of the Arab, Muslim and rest of the world. And he gets castigated for simply
*  telling a rare journalistic truth on the part of mainstream media. It's as if we are not allowed
*  to draw on our own history, anything in global history. It's as if British colonialism
*  and the struggle against British colonialism never existed. It's as if French colonialism,
*  Algeria, it's as if American, Vietnam never existed. Because these are Arabs, these are Muslims,
*  so you have to talk about them in a different way. And it means that we have no clue. We are
*  BSing ourselves. And so you can have Western leaders attempting to sound sensible and credible,
*  telling us after Simwa, well, now we can have a ceasefire. What are you talking about?
*  Are you paying any attention to what Israel is saying are its goal, to what Israel is doing,
*  to the nature of this entity today? It is such a disservice to the consumers of that media.
*  I'm glad you said this. So the theme I've constantly referred to, which is the Israeli
*  state makes its intentions very, very clear. And not only is Western media coverage not
*  media coverage, not framed around those statements of intent that often in many
*  cases not quoted. We just again go back to the first days. Major General Gassanallian,
*  RB coordinator of the entire occupied territory said Hamas became ISIS and the citizens of
*  Gaza celebrating said of being horrified. Human animals are dealt with accordingly, as well as
*  impose the total blockade in Gaza. No electricity, no water, just damage. He wanted hell. You will
*  get hell. The best possible guide to what Israel actually went and did was just listening to what
*  Israeli leaders and officials said in taking it literally. Just on that. And of course,
*  Owen, and of course that all predates October 7th, the coalition guidelines of this government. I
*  mean, it's not as if, you know, this was a radical break from the past, but let's just take this
*  government for what it has stated. Its coalition guidelines say the Jewish people have an exclusive
*  and inalienable right to all parts of the land of Israel. And you carry on as if everything's
*  normal. America has Greece's visa waiver, the Brits upgrade their bilateral relations.
*  You have people in that government who openly have called for ethnic cleansing, displacement,
*  second knockback. And we carry on as if all this is, this is Israel. It shares our values. It's
*  the only democracy in the Middle East. It's our ally. As you say, it is this willful
*  self-deceit. And as for what's being done in Gaza, there's a piece really worth looking up by Adam
*  Tewes in his substack from May, where he says, look, this is the prime minister's office has
*  actually put out a plan for Gaza 2035. They talk about creating something called the Gaza
*  Rehabilitation Authority. It says from total destruction, the area will be reborn. So what
*  are you telling us here in terms of what you're intending? You're intending total destruction.
*  This paper has Gaza will be a commercial center. It won't be a center of Palestinian life.
*  It certainly won't be part of some Palestinian future state, et cetera. It's all there.
*  Yet, and yet the acknowledgement of that truth is pretty much inadmissible. You're depicted as
*  some kind of mad, wokeist or crazed radical. If you simply tell the story,
*  as the Israeli leadership tells it, as its real critics tell it.
*  Interesting. Keir Starmer, the British prime minister keeps referring to Israel as she,
*  her, the pronouns, people suggesting as though she's a damsel in distress in the way he talks
*  about in his speeches. There's another Israeli official though, and this is very interesting.
*  This is Eran Etzion. He's the former deputy head of the National Security Council.
*  Now he tweeted out two days ago, I never call for refusals. That is for Israeli soldiers to
*  refuse to serve. He said, in my opinion, this is a step that should be reserved for the most extreme
*  and distinct black flag cases of a manifestly illegal order of a crime. Well, we have reached
*  that point. Now he says Netanyahu and the cabinet have passed the decision hidden from the public,
*  he says, to implement the general's plan. This plan is a war crime. He says, this is after
*  the US wrote a letter, which basically wrote in detail about how Israel was deliberately
*  preventing food and the basic essentials of life and getting into Northern Gaza. He said,
*  it's difficult to describe circumstances more seriously than this. If you are a soldier or
*  an officer, regular permanent reserve, it is your duty to refuse to take part in any action that
*  constitutes a war crime. If you're not a servant, it's your duty to call on the servants to refuse
*  to take part in a war crime. Netanyahu and the 7th of October government are turning Israel into a
*  Leper state and they suggest bringing closer officers and soldiers of the IDF going to the
*  Hague and to other prisons around the world. What do you think about the significance of what he
*  said? How significant is that? Look, I think it's very significant for Iran personally.
*  I know some listeners may be, well, we say, oh, well, good morning. Wake up and finally realize
*  they've been doing this. What did you think the whole project of actual existing? And I really
*  urge people not to go there actually, because I think for someone who is there,
*  is in his position, he's, he's, it was unsuccessful, but he's made runs for the Knesset before
*  he is plugged into and known to be plugged into the actual political opposition on the
*  center left. But he has stepped out of that comfort zone. And I actually want to give credit to Iran
*  for publicly saying these things. And to me, it is a big deal. Now, and by the way, I know,
*  and you've, I saw that you did something really urge people to look at in terms of what were
*  Israeli influences, Israeli Twitter, X, whatever posters, how they responded to that video of the
*  young Palestinian girl carrying her sister and being given a lift and
*  look, the entrenchment of such a dehumanization is a story, probably for someone who has more
*  of a psychologist training as not just kind of political and policy and analyst, but
*  but I say that because look at the responses to Iran, called a traitor, calling for refusal in a
*  time of war. Where's the police? Why is he being investigated? This is typical of leftists,
*  actually an interesting response from the Peace Now movement, which said, yes, and it's all about
*  settling. And Iran responds says, yes, settling, but these are war crimes. Can we focus on those?
*  Which is this thing? And what it also is, is you have no political opposition in Israel.
*  I would say he has is probably the most, if I can call it mainstream establishment, adjacent,
*  that's the word we use, right? Establishment adjacent person to have said war crimes,
*  to have said it is the general's plan to have said refuse these orders. These are illegal actions
*  that you are being asked to carry out. Too little too late, absolutely, but not from the person who
*  stepped out of his comfort zone and did that. But you have an Israeli Labour Party leader.
*  You have the entirety of the Zionist political spectrum in parliament who are unwilling to
*  question what is being done in Gaza from the perspective of legality,
*  the legality of orders of actions from the perspective of morality.
*  Now, I continue to tell myself that there might be a moment where people look at this and they say,
*  okay, not only is something happening here that I'm aware of and I'm suppressing,
*  but I have to speak out and do something. I don't think, I say this with regret,
*  I don't think what Eran Etzion has done will open the floodgates. But I do think that
*  there is the potential for things to shift over time. It's not going to go mainstream political,
*  as I said, Ilkolan continues to reject. I'm using him just as an example of the leader of
*  the supposedly most left Zionist bloc in parliament. There was a vote in the Israeli
*  Knesset on July 18th. Netanyahu put forward a resolution that there could be no Palestinian
*  state, not a single Zionist member of Knesset voted against that resolution.
*  But there was one left, one left is Jewish non-Zionist.
*  Now, look, it's significant in a number of ways, but the question is,
*  is Eran and our others shouting into a void? Or are we going to see the kinds of actions that,
*  and the kinds of legal requirements that now exist on paper actually being picked up? And
*  you've referenced the US a couple of times in the West and the UK government. And so far,
*  those are not being picked up. I think one of the interesting things that has been largely
*  overlooked in the discussions around Sinwa is that you now only have two people and their
*  Israeli leaders, Netanyahu and Defense Minister Galant, with ICC chief prosecutor arrest warrant
*  requests against them. The three Hamas leaders to whom that applied, Haniya Sinwa and I can't
*  remember if it was Day 4 Issa, all no longer among the living. Now, I think there are lots
*  of reasons that Netanyahu went after that cohort of people, but I would like to suggest
*  that Netanyahu will now say, it is inconceivable that arrest warrants will only be issued against
*  Israelis and therefore America and anyone else willing to go along with it. Germany,
*  I don't know, UK, this government did withdraw that. You have to make sure, you have to double
*  your pressure on the ICC. These have been standing there for ages, this request warrant, this request
*  for arrest warrants from Kareem Khan. And I think Netanyahu very methodically now will say,
*  it is simply impossible that we will have those arrest warrants issued. And I fear
*  whether the court will be intimidated. But I want to draw your attention to,
*  because we're talking about whether there might be these dynamics in Israel. Something has really
*  caught my eye and some friends are involved in initiating it and it's a cohort of academics and
*  some from the cultural and other spheres in Israel. Israeli citizens calling for true
*  international pressure on Israel for an immediate ceasefire, that's the title of it.
*  And it calls for every possible sanction to be taken. It says change from within is not currently
*  realistic in Israel. It says the state of Israel is on a suicidal path. And it says there is a lack
*  of true international pressure. These are Israeli citizens, Jewish and Arab, but I think this was
*  focused on getting Israeli Jewish citizens to sign. How can you continue arms supplies, it says. And
*  it calls statements that are made by the internationals for a ceasefire empty words without these actions.
*  Yeah, I, my understanding is these people are all violating Israeli law. This is,
*  I think these things should be echoed and they really matter.
*  That they, and they matter, by the way, not because again, this is going to be a floodgate.
*  They matter because if people are looking for cover, which they shouldn't have to,
*  this is the application of international law. But here are Israelis who, and a former, you know,
*  deputy national security advisor. But again, I unfortunately don't see the West budget, but
*  one just has to keep building, keep pushing. One never knows what the tipping point is.
*  No, indeed. And it is important for accountability in the future. I mean,
*  these will hopefully be read in court. There was no excuse for saying you did not know,
*  listen to what was said at the time. I just want to finally ask you just to fold this in together,
*  I suppose, in terms of Lebanon, of course, but also, I mean, well, Benjamin Netanyahu
*  in a speech basically said to the people of Lebanon that if you don't, you know,
*  Lebanon will end up like Gaza unless you deal with Hezbollah yourself, I have a big civil war,
*  which is what that means in practice with huge sectarian war implications. I mean, Israel at
*  the moment, if you're going to be Benjamin Netanyahu, you could go, well, look, do you know what?
*  I face down all the people, you know, the kind of wimps on my own side and I've been vindicated.
*  We've taken out Hezbollah as a mess. We've wiped Gaza pretty much from the face of the earth,
*  got away with it, guys. I don't know. What do you think? Where is this heading? Because,
*  you know, Israel at the moment could be awash if you're Benjamin Netanyahu or awash with
*  triumphalism, all the kind of, you know, hand-wringing for the United States for domestic
*  purposes. But, you know, I'd prove them wrong, guys. What do you think? Where's it heading
*  Lebanon? And what do you think of that sense of Israeli? Is it hubris?
*  Yeah. So, first of all, let's just acknowledge that Netanyahu has now turned to the Iranian people,
*  said, overthrow your regime, to the Lebanese people, said, overthrow your regime,
*  to the Palestinians in Gaza after the killing of Simwa, overthrow your regime.
*  Not only did he, in that speech, after the killing of Nasrallah and after the massive
*  escalation by Israel in Lebanon, of course, against civilian targets yet again, not only
*  did he turn round and say, paraphrase, either kill each other or we kill you. But earlier than
*  that, at the UN, Netanyahu says, there's a missile in every kitchen, I'm quoting here,
*  a rocket in every garage. Netanyahu has just justified yet again, this time at the UN,
*  that everything is a target. He's done exactly what they said about Gaza. And then he has the
*  temerity to say, to call the UN itself as something like a cesspool of anti-Semitism.
*  A cesspool of anti-Semitism. So you know my beef on the abuse and the conflation and the
*  instrumentalization, weaponization of anti-Semitism. Let me park that for now.
*  Okay. So this is where Israel is at. And I want to point out something that I think is factual,
*  which is that Israel has suffered some battlefield setbacks and has achieved some
*  battlefield successes. But it cannot translate that into something that is a sustainable political
*  achievement because it has no plan that even borders on being realistic or achievable politically
*  or achievable politically for the region. The premise is, okay, you killed someone,
*  you bombed something. So what next? Well, I kill and bomb more. And that's exactly what he
*  committed to doing off the back of killing Sinwa when there was all this naivete around this.
*  And now surely you've killed Sinwa. You could know you've not been paying attention. So
*  what we have instead is it's almost like the dusting off of the old neo-conservative myths
*  and fantasies of remaking the Middle East. When Netanyahu first became prime minister,
*  folks can look this up, in 1996, the then out of power neo-cons in America led by Richard Pearl,
*  Doug Fythe, Worms are in office, write a paper, strategy for a clean break, how to remake the
*  Middle East. They then get into power when Bush gets elected and they then have their moment
*  after 9-11. And Netanyahu goes to Congress as an opposition leader then at the time in 2002
*  and testifies what a fantastic opportunity and moment an invasion of Iraq would be.
*  The positive repercussions that would have for the region. And here we are,
*  learning nothing, pretending that we're not paying attention. More than two decades later,
*  this talk of we'll have regime change in Lebanon and regime change amongst the Palestinians
*  and regime change in Iran. And we're going to build a Middle East premise on
*  Israeli hegemony, the permanent vanquishing and removal from the scene of Palestine,
*  the Palestinians, that cause. It's not going to happen. It's precisely the hubris that got
*  Israel to this place. I think it's precisely the fantastical thinking that leads this group of
*  Israelis to sign that petition to say we are committing national suicide. Because the anger
*  that this is generating. I mean, look, we know each other. I cannot deal with what is being done
*  in the name of something that caused itself, a Jewish state, two Palestinians, two others.
*  But I also think the Israeli Jews are super endangering their own future. And that is the
*  largest Jewish community in the world today. It cannot survive acting like this. It will not have
*  safety or security if it acts like this. And yet they are going down this road. Actually,
*  Rasan Salama has an interesting piece in the FT recently. And he says, you can have some wins,
*  but do you really think you can achieve hegemony when you are going about it in the most
*  anti-Gramscian? He actually uses that phrase, the most anti-Gramscian of ways, because you are
*  offering an exclusivist messianic vision, which no one in the region, even those who don't like the
*  people you're killing, no one in the region can buy into that. So you have infiltrations from Jordan.
*  You have the mythology now around Sinwa, which will last for generations. And the only way
*  you are going to be able to change this is if you have a political plan which front and centers
*  the need for Palestinians to have their rights, for Israel to live. Perhaps not as the Israel we
*  know it today. I don't see how that is. Israel will have to change fundamentally. Actual existing
*  Zionism, I believe, has been a disaster for the Jewish people. It is going to have to do the things
*  which we always refuse to do, even in peace talks, like talk about truth and justice and
*  reconciliation. Those things were always forbidden in the talks. It had to be Israel gets its way
*  and an end of conflict. And of course, there was no intention to ever de-occupy it anyway.
*  So I do think that those who look at this and say, wow, Israel has done fabulously. We need to
*  increase our arms trade and we need to increase our support, because how great can it be in the
*  world today to have such a hard-ass ally in that part of the world? Not only are you making a
*  fundamental geopolitical error, not only are you undermining any claim that you might have to
*  support international law, the rule of law, any kind of norms and values. Of course, not only are
*  you sowing the distrust of Palestinian and other peoples in the region, but you are not actually
*  doing any favor to Israeli Jews. But I think, and I will close with this, I think that for now,
*  at least, and I don't see where it's going to change, but like I say, one never knows where
*  one hits that point that tips over. For now, at least, I think the West looks at, the West
*  seems to have made a decision that we still have some of this leftover rhetoric around international
*  institutions, international law, but essentially we are in a struggle for supremacy. We have
*  made arrangements with Israel, its technology is useful, its spyware has been useful, NSO,
*  Black Box, sometimes it's news against us, but essentially it's useful. They're really good at
*  cyber. They're testing some new weapons. We see the future of, the terrifying future of the battlefield.
*  Today, in Lebanon, in the Palestinian territories, the use of AI robotics automation
*  and I think they basically say, we're okay with this arrangement and they shouldn't be okay with
*  this arrangement and no one should be okay with this arrangement. Sorry, I've not ended on a
*  joyful note, but I do think people are slowly acknowledging this and I do think that
*  acknowledging this and I do think that if we keep pushing, and it's clearly not just in the West
*  and maybe not particularly in the West, but let's make it uncomfortable for Western governments to
*  keep going down this track as uncomfortable as we can. Searing stuff, I think perhaps the most
*  searing bucket of cold ice water poured over my head I've ever had, which I'm sure I speak for
*  my audience. Brilliant, eloquent stuff. Hugely insightful and scary, but there was actually some
*  hope in there. You can find the hope and there is hope. There is always hope, otherwise why are we
*  even talking? What's the point? Honestly, Dan, it's such a huge honour, Daniel, to have you,
*  to hear your hugely insightful thoughts, wisdom and I learned as ever, I could listen to you for
*  hours, which is not true for every single person out of you. For everyone listening, obviously do
*  leave your comments, including your appreciation of course for Daniel, press like, share the video,
*  make sure it gets out, but thank you, Dan. Really appreciate it. Brilliant stuff.
*  Thank you, I thank you for what you do and it's really good to talk to you.
