# Israeli Academic: "I Was Wrong" About Gaza Genocide - w/. Shaiel Ben-Ephraim
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc)
*  Genocide, that's a term which many of us have been using for a long time to describe as well as [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=0.0s)]
*  on-store against Gaza. And many genocide scholars such as the Israeli-American associate professor [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=5.2s)]
*  Holocaust Genocide Studies, Rassi Gow, Omar Bartov, the Brown University Professor of Holocaust [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=14.0s)]
*  Studies, Amnesty International, for example, releasing a report, we all know of course, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=22.72s)]
*  South Africa's case against the State of Israel in the International Court of Justice. Now, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=26.72s)]
*  many have resisted that term. And I'm really fascinated to speak to our current guest, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  great to see joining us, who is Shael Ben Aframe, who is an Israeli-American academic, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=37.84s)]
*  who has gone on a journey, I think it's fair to say, and has now recently posted that he has come [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=46.08s)]
*  to the conclusion that Israel is committing genocide. Firstly, it's great to see you, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=52.32s)]
*  how are you doing? Doing great, how about you Owen? Not too bad, not too bad. I just wanted [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=57.92s)]
*  to just ask you straight away, why did you decide now that Israel is committing genocide? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=62.96s)]
*  Well, I early on thought that Israel was not committing genocide, as like just about every [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=67.52s)]
*  other Israeli I know. And if you'd asked me as recently as a month ago, I would have been on [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=75.76s)]
*  the fence. But I think that the overwhelming evidence has been clear. And I've probably been [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=81.52s)]
*  denying it to myself for quite a few months now. The turning point, there's been several turning [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=90.96s)]
*  points for me. The major turning point for me was when I realized that the IDF was not fighting this [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=97.19999999999999s)]
*  war in order to defeat Hamas. And that took me many months to understand. Because after the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=104.16s)]
*  events of October 7th, I, as a committed Zionist and Israeli citizen, felt that Israel needed to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  act in Gaza. And I still believe that Israel needed to act militarily in Gaza. And Israel has [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=118.88s)]
*  acted militarily in Gaza many times before. And I wouldn't classify any of those operations as [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=124.08s)]
*  genocide. But very early in the war, or maybe five months into the war, it became very clear that [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=131.84s)]
*  Netanyahu wasn't doing what you needed to do in order to defeat Hamas. Which would require, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=138.08s)]
*  in many ways, more force than what was being used, just in a different way. Taking over all of Gaza [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=145.28s)]
*  and creating an alternative government. That's what would be needed to defeat Hamas. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=151.6s)]
*  Now, that doesn't need to be the goal of the operation, right? You could have a limited [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=156.32s)]
*  operation. Israel has had limited operations in Gaza before, and then stopped. But the stated goal [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=160.0s)]
*  of the operation was to destroy Hamas. And massive amounts of force were being used in Gaza, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=165.76s)]
*  but not in a way that could possibly, even theoretically, defeat Hamas. Because Hamas [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=172.08s)]
*  is sitting there in its tunnels, and it's controlling the major population centers. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=177.12s)]
*  And when Israel goes into major population centers, it withdraws. And Hamas remains in [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=182.24s)]
*  control of the Gaza Strip. And it's not that this is because it's a bad strategy. It's a bad strategy. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=186.48s)]
*  But there's also, the IDF is well aware, and Prime Minister Netanyahu is well aware, that you can't [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=192.39999999999998s)]
*  defeat Hamas this way. These are people who understand military. You know, I understand [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=197.83999999999997s)]
*  military quite well. I have a PhD in military strategy. But they know even better than I do. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=202.64s)]
*  Okay? Once I started realizing that they're not doing that, I started thinking, okay, what are they [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=207.51999999999998s)]
*  doing? So the other thing that they were doing is trying to keep Netanyahu in power. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=212.4s)]
*  The longer the war goes on, the longer he can stay in power. He's become very unpopular. He's even more [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  unpopular now than he was five, six months ago. And he knows that as long as he's in power, he can [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  use the powers of war and try to rally support, patriotically, blah, blah, blah. So for a long [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=231.44s)]
*  time, I thought that was the main goal of the war. And that's certainly still part of the goal of [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=236.56s)]
*  the war. But some things have changed. There is and always has been a genocidally inclined [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=240.56s)]
*  element in the Israeli government, right? You have your Itamar Ben-Gavir, you have your Betel-El [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=250.48s)]
*  Smotrich, and you have people in the army as well, who want to kill Palestinians, hoping that if [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=256.64s)]
*  they kill enough Palestinians, they'll go somewhere else or something like that. They've gained [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=263.52s)]
*  increasing power. They have veto power over Netanyahu. They can decide when they're removing [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=269.12s)]
*  him, when they're not removing him. And they can exploit the anger that the Israeli population has [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=275.2s)]
*  at the Palestinians to forward this approach. And then, of course, once Trump came up with that plan, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=282.88s)]
*  the Trump plan to remove the Palestinians from Gaza, that gave them a motivation to increase the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  level of violence against the Palestinians in Gaza in order to encourage them to leave. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=298.32s)]
*  So what we're seeing is an increasing amount of crimes against humanity committed by the IDF [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=305.84s)]
*  against the Palestinians in Gaza, with absolutely no intention of defeating Hamas, and with an [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=312.4s)]
*  intention to make life in Gaza unbearable for the Palestinians. And I'm hearing this [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=322.72s)]
*  from people in the army. I'm hearing this from people in the Israeli defense ministry. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=328.96000000000004s)]
*  One of the things that changed my mind is I started hearing people, who I used to think of as sane and [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  moderate people, saying that this is what they want to do. And whistleblowers, who early on were [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=338.24s)]
*  telling me the IDF is committing war crimes, started telling me, listen, this is full-on genocide, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=344.16s)]
*  what they're doing. So I just changed my mind based on the information on the ground. It gives [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=349.76s)]
*  me no pleasure at all to say that my friends and my family and my country is committing genocide. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=354.88s)]
*  But there's no escaping it. Just on, I guess, your journey, and just interrogating, I guess, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=361.76s)]
*  maybe see if there's more of a journey to go on. And I should say, by the way, I should have said [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=368.4s)]
*  very briefly, Shail is the presenter of History of the Land of Israel and Israel Explained. Do [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=372.47999999999996s)]
*  check those out. You mentioned previous Israeli onslaughts against Gars, which you supported. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=376.88s)]
*  Is that what you suggested? I mean, human rights organizations like Amnesty International and [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=384.64s)]
*  Human Rights Watch made clear that in every single one of those, Israel committed [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=391.68s)]
*  grave war crimes and crimes against humanity. So for example, Operation Castile-led, which killed [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=396.56s)]
*  well over a thousand Palestinians. And Amnesty International said that soldiers reported being [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=402.16s)]
*  allowed or even encouraged by the commanders to fire anything that moved, even if there was no [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=410.0s)]
*  danger to their lives. The reason I'm bringing that up is many of us would say this didn't happen in a [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=414.64000000000004s)]
*  vacuum. I mean, I'm going to talk to you about Zionism, something which I know you say you're [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=419.36s)]
*  still committed to as a so-called liberal Zionist. Would you not accept that actually [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=423.28000000000003s)]
*  these weren't genocidal onslaughts in the past, but they were onslaughts in which the Israeli [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=429.04s)]
*  state committed grave war crimes against Palestinian civilians. And this is taking that approach [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=434.32s)]
*  to its logical conclusion. No, no, I don't agree with that. I'll tell you, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=441.2s)]
*  when I look at previous Israeli campaigns in Gaza, I agree that war crimes were committed, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=448.48s)]
*  but I also think that war crimes are committed in just about every campaign. I never bought the whole [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=457.28000000000003s)]
*  Israel's, the idea of the most moral army in the world and all that, all that stuff, never bought [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=464.08000000000004s)]
*  that. I know the Israeli army intimately. I'm talking about in the past when it was doing a [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=468.96000000000004s)]
*  lot better than it is now. I know the Israeli army intimately. I know its advantages and [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=474.48s)]
*  disadvantages, and it's not particularly moral army. But also going back, its standards of [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=480.08s)]
*  procedure were very standard. And I know the mechanism that it has in order to identify [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=487.35999999999996s)]
*  civilian infrastructure, in order to identify civilian targets and avoid them. And it doesn't [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=494.96s)]
*  always do the best job, but it has that capacity and it has done those things badly sometimes in [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=500.56s)]
*  previous operations. Let me finish. This is an important point. What I'm seeing right now [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=506.8s)]
*  is that they're using that capacity of identifying civilian infrastructure to destroy the civilian [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=512.4s)]
*  infrastructure. So you have like salination plants in Gaza that Israel is targeting intentionally. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=518.32s)]
*  And in the past, it would look at those salination plants and say, let's not bomb those [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=526.08s)]
*  salination plants. It would not take enough care with family members next to terrorists. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=530.24s)]
*  It would not take enough care with bystanders next to terrorists. Those are all very bad things. It [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=536.8s)]
*  wouldn't allow in enough aid sometimes when it was blocking, all those things. The difference is, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=541.84s)]
*  Owen, that now it's doing it intentionally. And that's why it's genocide and not war crimes based [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=546.16s)]
*  on targeting lack of proportionality, all that stuff. I don't know everything that happened in [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=553.44s)]
*  previous campaigns, but I have no evidence that there was genocide or anything like that. But [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=558.8s)]
*  you're right. War crimes happen in every war and the idea commits them. I think there's a lot of [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=563.68s)]
*  people who regard that as quite dangerous attitudes, that the normalization of war crimes, that it's [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=569.28s)]
*  just part and parcel of war. I agree that it's a dangerous attitude. It's just really a 20-40 [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=573.1999999999999s)]
*  illness, or at least it didn't used to be. Well, I suppose many would argue that, again, these are [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=580.4799999999999s)]
*  war crimes which have been taken to the logical conclusion. That's why I'm just trying to tease [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=586.16s)]
*  that out. In 2014, 635 women, for example, and children were wounded, for example, in that. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=589.36s)]
*  This was Israeli attacks in, I'm talking about the Human Rights Watch. Since July 7, 2014, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=602.48s)]
*  Israel officially said, delivered more than 500 tons of explosives and missiles, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=606.9599999999999s)]
*  air bombs with artillery fire killed at least 170 people and wounded 1,361 people as of July 14. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=609.84s)]
*  So that was just the first week. And they said that- 2014? 2014, and found that attacks had [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=616.88s)]
*  destroyed 1,255 homes. Human Rights Watch said Israel's rhetoric was all about precision attacks, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=624.32s)]
*  but attacks with no military target and many civilian deaths can hardly be considered precise. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=630.48s)]
*  So, I mean, when we talk about war crimes, do we agree that people should be prosecuted for war [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=634.8000000000001s)]
*  crimes or not? And that's, I guess, the question many would say Israel had impunity before this [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=640.0s)]
*  happened. It knew it had impunity, which is precisely why it could take these war crimes to [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=645.6s)]
*  the logical conclusion. That's why I'm talking about these war crimes in the past. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=649.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So listen, I don't want to push back too much on what you're saying because I agree with [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=653.84s)]
*  a lot of what you're saying, but I don't agree with everything. So I'll tease this out. 2014, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=659.12s)]
*  other Israeli campaigns in Gaza, not just in Gaza, Lebanon, everywhere, war crimes were committed. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=665.04s)]
*  I don't even want to say less than other countries because I don't think that's helpful or true. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=671.36s)]
*  And as far as impunity is concerned, you're absolutely right. Israel has always lived behind [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=678.64s)]
*  a partial lie, at least. It's at least partial lie. Now it's a total lie. That it had an independent [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=684.72s)]
*  judiciary that would prosecute war criminals. It is so rare that the Israeli independent judiciary, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=691.6800000000001s)]
*  which is independent in many other ways, did do that. So rare that basically you had impunity. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=699.0400000000001s)]
*  If you didn't go personally and shoot a baby in the head with 10 witnesses, you know, no one's [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=705.9200000000001s)]
*  going to prosecute you. And that's the truth. And now even the limited independence that the [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=712.72s)]
*  judiciary had, which was really a fig leaf in terms of not its independence generally, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=718.32s)]
*  but in terms of what it did with war criminals, IDF war criminals, even that fig leaf is gone. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=723.9200000000001s)]
*  They don't even pretend anymore. Right. So there's absolute impunity. And that has led [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=729.0400000000001s)]
*  absolutely to what's happening now. And now if you tried to prosecute IDF soldiers, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=734.5600000000001s)]
*  you would have so much backlash. And there's cases that were landmarks in this. You probably know [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=740.64s)]
*  Elior Azaria, the case of Azaria. He killed a terrorist and was filmed killing the terrorist, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=746.56s)]
*  an absolute war crime. And he was turned into a hero by the Israeli right, but not just by the [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=755.92s)]
*  right. You know, average Israelis thought he didn't do anything wrong. He just killed a terrorist. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=761.76s)]
*  And that's a case where, you know, it's a terrorist. No one in Israel really cares, but it creates this [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=765.84s)]
*  precedent, you know, and then you had what happened in Sedet Eman. And in Sedet Eman, you had people [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=772.48s)]
*  invade the base. And that was that builds on what happened with Elior Azaria. So actually, I actually [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=776.72s)]
*  totally agree with you. There's a real problem here. And Israel talks about, oh, the ICC and the [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=781.92s)]
*  ICJ, they're anti-Semitic and they're out to get us. It's not true. Absolutely not true. I know [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=786.8s)]
*  people who work for both organizations, especially the ICJ. They're not anti-Semitic at all. Some of [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=793.5200000000001s)]
*  them are Jews. And they're trying to take over where the Israeli courts are doing nothing, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=798.72s)]
*  doing nothing. And there's some partial efforts every now and then to prosecute someone. It's [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=806.24s)]
*  only when there's massive international attention that they admit to Sedet Eman, that they've [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=812.08s)]
*  admitted killing those paramedics. So I agree, there's a link, but it's gotten progressively [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=816.48s)]
*  worse. We agree. In terms of the journey you've gone on, I'm interested, I'm just going to quote [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=822.24s)]
*  what Israeli leaders and officials were saying at the beginning. The 9th of October 2023, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=827.6s)]
*  Defense Minister Yoav Galant said that Israel was imposing a complete siege on Gaza, no electricity, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=832.72s)]
*  no food, no water, no fuel. Everything is closed. We are fighting human animals and we are acting [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=837.92s)]
*  accordingly. On the same day, Major General Ghassan Alyan, the Israeli army general who's in [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=843.36s)]
*  charge of Koga, which is a civilian arm of the Israeli army for those who don't know, he said, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=850.24s)]
*  Hamas became ISIS and the citizens of Gaza are celebrating instead of being horrified. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=855.04s)]
*  Human animals are dealt with accordingly. Israel has imposed a total blockade on Gaza, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=861.84s)]
*  no electricity, no water, just damage. You wanted hell, you will get hell. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=869.04s)]
*  Would you accept those are genocidal statements? Absolutely. But at the time, you didn't have all [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=876.64s)]
*  these actions to match it with. And at the time, I also felt that this was anger that would pass. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=883.6s)]
*  And to some extent, that is anger that passed. So this argument might be a little bit complicated, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=893.84s)]
*  this is what I see, because I talk a lot to the people who are doing this. Okay. So this is what [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=899.6s)]
*  I see. I remember the day that it happened, October 7th. I talked to some of my friends, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=904.8s)]
*  and I'm a relatively left-wing guy by his right, now very left-wing, saying there's genocide, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=910.3199999999999s)]
*  very left-wing. But at the time, I was considered much more moderate, but still left-wing. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=916.48s)]
*  A lot of my friends were a lot more left-wing than me. I talked to them that day, and a lot of them [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=919.6s)]
*  were telling me we need to kill every single person in Gaza. These are people who were saying [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=925.12s)]
*  these are people who were saying we need to dismantle the state of Israel and create a one [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=930.4000000000001s)]
*  nation state. Now they're telling me let's go into Gaza and kill everyone. That's what these [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=935.6s)]
*  people were telling me. I knew things were going to get very bad. I knew the anger was outraged. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=939.76s)]
*  I felt the anger too. I wasn't in Israel, so probably a little bit less, but I felt the anger [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=944.48s)]
*  too. Not going to lie. I wrote things back then not quite genocidal, but also very angry. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=948.32s)]
*  And I thought to myself we're going to do horrific damage to Gaza. I had no doubt that what was going [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=955.2s)]
*  to happen in Gaza would be terrible, and there'd be war crimes involved. I didn't think for a second [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=961.2s)]
*  there'd be genocide involved. And the reason is because I thought the anger would pass, not in [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=964.8s)]
*  terms of Israel wouldn't be angry at Gazans and Hamas, but in terms of slaughtering every single [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=970.48s)]
*  Gazan isn't something that they're going to be thinking in two, three months. To some extent, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=976.5600000000001s)]
*  that was correct. People start talking more about removing Hamas. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=980.8s)]
*  S2 – Let me just scrutinize that a little bit. So Air Wars, which is an NGO, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=984.9599999999999s)]
*  which investigates civilian harm from aerial bombardment, they established that in October [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=989.92s)]
*  2023, so between the 7th of October and the 31st of October, at least 5,139 civilians were killed [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=996.4s)]
*  of those 1,900 children. They said it is by far the most intense, destructive and fatal conflict [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1007.12s)]
*  for civilians that Air Wars has ever documented based on that first month. They also said they [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1014.4s)]
*  looked at 606 incidents of civilian harm in that 25-day period, and they found that in which 5,139 [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1018.8s)]
*  civilians were killed, they found that the number of militants killed was between 1358. Benjamin [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1026.48s)]
*  Netanyahu was also quoted in Ynet, the Israeli media outlet, and he was presented by the [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1031.76s)]
*  Israeli army chief of staff with a list of 1,500 targets. Netanyahu reportedly erupted in anger, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1037.04s)]
*  yelling and banging on the table, why not 5,000? We don't have 5,000 approved targets, the chief [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1042.32s)]
*  of staff replied, and Netanyahu said, I'm not interested in targets, take down houses, bomb with [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1046.72s)]
*  everything you have. Isn't it the case actually that the rhetoric and the actions were married, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1051.12s)]
*  and it actually was genocidal from day one based on the rhetoric and the actions? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1058.08s)]
*  Yeah, so the quote you brought from Netanyahu, can I ask when you first were aware of that quote? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1062.4s)]
*  Because I'm asking out of curiosity, not to make it clear. It was revealed last month. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1068.0s)]
*  Right, so I heard it the first time, yeah, two, three weeks ago, so maybe a little bit after it [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1072.5600000000002s)]
*  was revealed. I had no idea at the time that Netanyahu was saying things like that. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1076.96s)]
*  In retrospect, it's very clear that the at least beginning of the mechanism of genocide was said [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1083.6000000000001s)]
*  at that time. The tone he used at that meeting, and I'm not saying that was the first time, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1093.2s)]
*  I'm not saying that was a landmark thing, because I don't know the other quotes, right? But the fact [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1098.8s)]
*  that he said something like that, and the impact it has when a prime minister yells that at the [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1102.88s)]
*  chief of staff is massive, right? I didn't know that. Nobody, not nobody, very few people knew [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1108.32s)]
*  that, right? So- No, you knew what they were saying in public, which was a whole litany of [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1117.12s)]
*  genocidal statements. Look, Owen, at the end of the day, you were calling this a genocide early, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1122.48s)]
*  and I wasn't, and you were right, and I was wrong. No, but why? I mean, this isn't me [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1129.6799999999998s)]
*  prosecuting you. This is me interested because you're very important in terms of your journey, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1134.96s)]
*  because the vast majority of Israeli citizens at the moment, I interviewed lots of Israeli, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1139.52s)]
*  very courageous Israeli commentators, and indeed genocide specialists who concluded [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1145.8400000000001s)]
*  it's genocide a long time ago. Courageous because it's exceptional, and that's not, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1149.52s)]
*  unfortunately, unique to Israel in terms of states which descend into this sort of [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1154.88s)]
*  genocidal mania. It is what it is. I suppose what I'm interested in is the journey, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1159.04s)]
*  what I'm talking to you about is because we need to understand those who are currently very [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1164.56s)]
*  passionately pushing back at the idea it's genocide, because you've gone from that to this [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1169.6s)]
*  point. And that is important because that's, if we could understand how that process happens, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1173.44s)]
*  then we'd be in a pretty good position to stop this. Yeah, well, so I've always had a [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1179.28s)]
*  a sympathy or empathy for Palestinian life that goes beyond a lot of my fellow countrymen. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1188.0s)]
*  That's just a fact. So from the beginning of the war, I've been very concerned about Palestinian [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1201.84s)]
*  lives and concerned about Israeli violations of international law. I also taught international [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1208.48s)]
*  law, so I'm very aware of what Israel is breaking and what it's not breaking at any given time. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1215.2s)]
*  So it's always been a little bit easier to convince me. The problem is that a lot of Israelis [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1220.48s)]
*  don't care about international law. They build, but not most Israelis aren't, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1230.0800000000002s)]
*  most Israelis don't want all Palestinians to die. Most of us don't want Israel to be guilty of [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1240.48s)]
*  genocide. Let's take the average median Israeli, because there's all kinds, right? Yeah. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1244.96s)]
*  Israeli doesn't want there to be genocide, doesn't want to kill all Palestinians. What the average [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1248.96s)]
*  median Israeli says is this, and this is not going to be something that you're not aware of. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1253.2s)]
*  Hamas started this, the Palestinians support Hamas. If they want this to end, just release the hostages [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1258.4s)]
*  and surrender. International law doesn't really matter because these people don't follow it. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1264.16s)]
*  And war is brutal. This is the Middle East. What are you going to do? That's the Israeli [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1269.1200000000001s)]
*  defense mechanism. It's very hard to get through that because you show them all this stuff. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1274.96s)]
*  First thing they react is it's a lie. It's anti-Semitic media. Once you convince them, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1279.68s)]
*  it's not that hard to convince them because you can show them this evidence. Once you convince them, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1284.16s)]
*  they tell you, okay, but what are you going to do? You have to make Hamas surrender. And they [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1288.64s)]
*  brought this on themselves. So I don't know if my specific journey is really that helpful. I never [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1294.72s)]
*  really had that. Well, actually, I'll give you an example, actually. I never really had that [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1302.24s)]
*  mechanism that they do. I never thought the Palestinian people brought it on themselves. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1307.04s)]
*  I always thought that people are separate. These are important points. Well, actually, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1312.08s)]
*  the reason I'll give you an example, because I'm going to quote what you said at the time. And [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1316.0s)]
*  again, this isn't aggressive. This is because- No, no, no. Do it. So you said on the 19th of October, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1319.04s)]
*  anyone describing a bombing campaign against terrorists, including a fair warning for [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1325.36s)]
*  civilians to evacuate as genocide is spreading anti-Semitic libels. The point of labeling every [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1328.64s)]
*  Israeli military action as genocide is to water down the importance of the Holocaust. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1333.8400000000001s)]
*  You said on the 3rd of December, the genocide libel is being used as an excuse to target [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1338.4s)]
*  Israelis and Jews everywhere. 15th of October, 2023, at the moment, we are waiting for civilians [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1343.2800000000002s)]
*  to leave before our invasion. Not much of a genocide. When my grandparents went through [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1349.3600000000001s)]
*  actual genocide, no one spared them. The point there, the reason I'm bringing that up is those [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1352.88s)]
*  who have argued that Israel is committing war crimes, let alone genocide, have routinely been [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1356.64s)]
*  called and denounced as anti-Semitic. And anti-Semitism is a grave evil. It's a grave evil, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1361.5200000000002s)]
*  which within- I don't need to lecture you as a Jewish person, I'm a guy. But obviously, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1366.16s)]
*  it's responsible for within living memory, the industrialized extermination of Jewish people. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1370.5600000000002s)]
*  That use of anti-Semitic blood libel is referring to the medieval anti-Semitic claim [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1377.68s)]
*  that ordinary Jewish people were murdering children as part of some sort of ritualistic sacrifice. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1384.64s)]
*  That term blood libel has been used over and over again when we're talking about a state, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1391.28s)]
*  not ordinary people. We're talking about a state and its behavior. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1396.88s)]
*  I guess, did you really think that? Did you really think that people talking about [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1401.04s)]
*  genocide were trying to basically resuscitate medieval claims of Jewish people murdering [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1406.16s)]
*  children for religious ritualistic sacrifices? And do you see now that actually the very real evil [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1413.12s)]
*  of anti-Semitism, which has to be fought, there has been a weaponization to just shut down anyone [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1419.76s)]
*  who just doesn't like Israel committing really quite heinous crimes, which you've accepted now? [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1427.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. So I did absolutely believe that a lot of people were using the genocide claims and the [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1432.4799999999998s)]
*  blood and as a blood libel. And I still believe that, honestly. I'll tell you why. I think that [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1441.44s)]
*  early on in the war, Israel hadn't gone in yet. Israel hadn't been doing a lot of things that it [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1450.0s)]
*  would do later. It was reacting to the worst attack that had ever occurred to it. And people [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1455.2s)]
*  were already calling it genocide when there was no evidence of it at all. And some people were [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1459.6000000000001s)]
*  calling it a genocide on October 8th already. So we have a lot of protesters and a lot of bad faith [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1465.28s)]
*  actors who use what Israel does in order to delegitimize not only Israel, but also Jews [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1473.28s)]
*  all around the world. And some of them have millions of followers. And that's a real problem. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1484.88s)]
*  And then meanwhile, the pro-Israeli system, the Hasbara system, has increasingly turned the word [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1491.6s)]
*  anti-Semitism into code for anyone who says that Israel is committing crimes in any way, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1500.9599999999998s)]
*  while often minimizing the damage of real anti-Semitism. Like saying Jews have killed [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1509.36s)]
*  Christ and Jews control the world and things like that. So what you have here, and this is something [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1515.52s)]
*  that I think everyone needs to face, is two echo chambers of horror. You have Islamophobic, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1521.04s)]
*  justifying war crimes on one hand, and you have anti-Semitic hatred of Jews and support of terrorism [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1531.28s)]
*  on the other. And anyone who tries to go in between those two blobs gets hurt. And I've seen this even [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1540.32s)]
*  happen to you. I've seen you go after Hamas and be called the liberal Zionist, which to a lot of [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1546.88s)]
*  people is a terrible slur, and be denounced for it. And that's happened to me. I've gotten death [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1552.96s)]
*  threats on the same thread. My point is, no, let me finish. My point is there's malign actors [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1558.88s)]
*  who are delegitimizing Israel and have been delegitimizing Israel from day one. And there's [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1569.5200000000002s)]
*  malign actors on the quote unquote pro-Israel side as well. And it's very difficult to pick out [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1575.04s)]
*  those who are well-meaning versus those who are not when you're being bombarded by people who are [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1581.28s)]
*  not well-meaning all the time. I suppose my concern there is this, what you said there really brings [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1585.84s)]
*  into my mind, in the McCarthy era, there was a description of people who opposed fascism [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1591.68s)]
*  as premature anti-fascists. That they had come to that, and that meant they were communists. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1600.08s)]
*  That was the point. That's what McCarthyism claimed. Raz Sigal is an Israeli American, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1605.6799999999998s)]
*  and he is an expert in Holocaust and genocide studies. He's an associate professor of genocide [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1611.84s)]
*  and Holocaust studies. On the 16th of October, 2023, he said Israel's assault on Gaza is a [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1616.24s)]
*  textbook case of intent to commit genocide. That's what he said. He's a scholar. He's an expert. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1625.04s)]
*  When you say even now, and this is what I'm interested in during this journey, hopefully [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1632.8s)]
*  still going on, people just listen to what Israeli leaders and officials said. And that proved to be [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1636.72s)]
*  the most accurate roadmap. It wasn't of what would happen. It wasn't venting. It wasn't, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1644.56s)]
*  we'll get this out of our system. We're just really mad because of the terrible atrocities [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1650.0s)]
*  committed in 7th of October. It is what they went on to do. They went on to make abundantly clear [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1653.28s)]
*  they did not see a demarcation between the civilian population and military targets. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1659.52s)]
*  They saw the Palestinian people themselves as having a form of collective guilt, whatever you [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1664.8799999999999s)]
*  want to call it. So you wouldn't call Raz Sigal a promoter of blood libels, an Israeli American [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1669.04s)]
*  associate professor of genocide and Holocaust studies. He said this at the very beginning, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1675.04s)]
*  within days of Israel's onslaught happening. He did have a point, didn't he? [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1678.96s)]
*  No, no. I need to qualify what I said before. When I said I still believe it, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1683.3600000000001s)]
*  I didn't mean to say that anyone who said that at the time was an anti-Semite and committing [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1688.16s)]
*  blood libel. What I meant to say is a lot of the people who were, that was their intention. I think [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1692.0s)]
*  there's a lot of people, not him necessarily, not you necessarily, who whatever Israel does, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1696.64s)]
*  they look to label it in the worst possible way. And at the time, Israelis were very defensive [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1704.64s)]
*  over these attempts because the feeling was after these terrible crimes had been committed against [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1713.2s)]
*  us, we were being told that any form of retaliation was genocide. And that seems very unconvincing at [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1717.52s)]
*  the time and to most Israelis, still very unconvincing. Because the actions that Israel [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1726.3200000000002s)]
*  had committed on the ground had not justified that label. I mean, I would be very hard pressed [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1732.32s)]
*  to say Israel was committing genocide in October. You could say that it was indiscriminately bombing [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1738.0s)]
*  people. That's not genocide. Well, I mean, I don't know what you mean, I suppose, by that, [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1742.96s)]
*  because in no genocide is everyone killed on day one. That's not what genocide means. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1747.76s)]
*  The genocides which have gone on for, we're talking generations. I mean, it's not an overnight. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1753.04s)]
*  People think about the Holocaust, I think, and that distorts their understanding of [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1758.3999999999999s)]
*  genocide. That was obviously a genocide. It's also an outlier, because it was an industrialized, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1761.44s)]
*  systematic extent to exterminate an entire people in a very short space of time. Every genocide is [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1766.64s)]
*  uncharacteristic. Rwanda is another example. I mean, Rwanda, that genocide began because the [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1771.76s)]
*  Tutsi rebel army invaded in 1990, committed terrible war crimes, incidentally, and who, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1776.48s)]
*  to extremists, said they're going to commit genocide against us and we're going to kill them [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1781.68s)]
*  first. There's actually quite a lot of power. You know, it's often the case that genocides happen [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1784.24s)]
*  in our complex. But what I was making is, I mean, October was the bloodiest aerial bombardment of [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1788.32s)]
*  the entire onslaught. And they were saying at the time that the civilian population were human [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1793.76s)]
*  animals. I mean, Israeli generals were saying that, and they were saying, we're going to inflict, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1799.36s)]
*  we're going to give you only damage to civilians. He was talking to civilians there. I mean, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1804.56s)]
*  the tweet was addressed to Hamas and the residents of Gaza. I mean, people were saying it's not to be [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1809.2s)]
*  offensive. I mean, they were just saying it because that's what Israeli leaders and officials [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1815.92s)]
*  were saying literally, and they could see Gaza being reduced to rubble, which it was. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1819.76s)]
*  — There are people who did it for genuine concern, and there are people who did it to [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1822.8000000000002s)]
*  score points. And there are still people who make things up about what Israel does in order to score [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1828.48s)]
*  points and make Israel look as bad as possible. That's just a fact. As far as they're being [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1833.6000000000001s)]
*  genocide on the ground in October, November, December, I still don't think so. Because the [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1840.48s)]
*  reason I believe there's genocide now is because of a lot of things that Israel started doing later, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1846.48s)]
*  like blowing up the entire hospital infrastructure. If you remember, at first there were hospitals [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1851.84s)]
*  Israel was going into, and there was a lot of controversy around it, and Israel was saying, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1856.16s)]
*  we're only going to this hospital for this reason and that reason, and so on and so forth. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1861.92s)]
*  Later on, they started blowing up every single hospital in Gaza. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1866.16s)]
*  — They started bombing hospitals from the very beginning. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1869.68s)]
*  — Right, but there's a systematic escalation. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1871.3600000000001s)]
*  — It was just a continuum. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1876.4s)]
*  — We're creating an argument here because you're creating an argument that's needless, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1877.28s)]
*  in my opinion. Because I agree with you that everything that turned into the genocide started [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1883.8400000000001s)]
*  at the very beginning. But where I disagree with you is really that there's an escalation. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1889.8400000000001s)]
*  The thing about a crime like genocide is that you need to have a lot of evidence that it happened. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1895.68s)]
*  Over time, more and more and more evidence accumulated. The level of evidence that we have, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1902.56s)]
*  because time passed, because actions escalated, is now much higher than it was at the beginning. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1907.68s)]
*  That's just a fact. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1912.16s)]
*  — Well, I suppose we would say, those on the other side of this from the beginning would say [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1912.88s)]
*  the intent was very clear, and it was stated, and intent matters. But I think the argument, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1917.28s)]
*  I think it's interesting, because in this, in terms of teasing Nisar, and you're talking about [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1924.56s)]
*  Israeli people, like people within Israel, and the mentality they had afterwards, which was, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1928.1599999999999s)]
*  well, Hamas brought this on themselves. But I mean, Hamas, I mean, that's what they said in 7th [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1932.8799999999999s)]
*  October. They said, well, you know, I mean, in 2023 alone, before 7th October, 240 Palestinians [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1937.6799999999998s)]
*  were killed, 40 of them children. Thousands of Palestinians, including thousands of children, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1946.0s)]
*  were killed between 2008 and 2023. So I mean, it's interesting, isn't it? Because I mean, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1951.2s)]
*  that's much bloodier. You know, it's much more extreme violence, which Palestinians have actually [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1956.64s)]
*  suffered. But actually, you know, that sense of, well, they started this war, and they're only [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1963.04s)]
*  getting what they deserve. I mean, that's, you know, that's starting the clock in 7th October, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1968.16s)]
*  I get it. But that's the same argument. It's just a different dynamic, isn't it? [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1972.16s)]
*  Yeah, that's one of the reasons it took me a long time to realize how bad things were. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1978.24s)]
*  In 2007, Hamas take over Gaza. Hamas, we, look, Israelis see Hamas as pure evil. You know, I grew [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1984.3999999999999s)]
*  up in the 90s, two times, buses blew up with people from my class, and we had to have, you know, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=1995.4399999999998s)]
*  ceremonies for the dead from Hamas when I was a kid. This happened repeatedly. You know, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2003.12s)]
*  I grew up in Jerusalem during the 90s. They were always blowing up our buses. They were always [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2007.6s)]
*  blowing up downtown. To us, you know, we grew up with Hamas being pure evil. Then one day, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2010.8s)]
*  they take over Gaza. So Gaza, for us, becomes a center of terrorism. And it has been. And it [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2016.9599999999998s)]
*  becomes very difficult for an Israeli who believes that Hamas is an evil organization, and it is, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2022.3999999999999s)]
*  I had not changed my mind about Hamas in any way, to separate between what's legitimate and [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2027.36s)]
*  what's not legitimate. And also, there's the argument that Israelis have, which has less [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2033.12s)]
*  salience over time, that the people of Gaza voted for Hamas, brought them in. So, you know, it's [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2037.4399999999998s)]
*  their problem. Like, what would you say to Nazi supporters who got bombed in Dresden and so on? [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2043.6s)]
*  But they said, yeah, they said they- [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2048.64s)]
*  Those are things Israelis say. I'm not fully- [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2050.16s)]
*  Yeah, of course. I know, I know. It's because the Palestinians play well. I mean, you know, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2051.68s)]
*  look who Israelis voted for. I mean, on just Israeli society, because this is what, again, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2055.44s)]
*  I suppose I'm interested in this kind of- because I do think this is a case of the [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2062.24s)]
*  genocidal mania meets impunity, which is a problem, because there's nothing to stop the mania. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2065.12s)]
*  There's nothing to pull it in check. Because there's other examples. You could say, you know, [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2070.56s)]
*  Serb nationalism during the Balkan Wars, again, sense of the Serbs at the time where we were [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2074.32s)]
*  victims of the Holocaust- not the Holocaust, we were victims of genocide in World War II. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2079.04s)]
*  And we face an existential threat. We either kill them or they kill us. That was the same [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2083.68s)]
*  mentality. And they suffered terrible war crimes against Bosnia-Syria civilians. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2089.6s)]
*  But, I mean, if we look at the Israeli population, a poll last year showed that amongst Jewish [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2093.84s)]
*  Israelis, one and a half percent thought too much firepower was being used in Gaza, and the rest [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2100.96s)]
*  were evenly divided between enough firepower and not enough firepower. And another- other polls [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2107.92s)]
*  showed consistently 60% thought all humanitarian aid should end, which it has now for the last two [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2115.28s)]
*  months. I mean, that's just- I mean, everyone knows what that means in practice. It means civilians [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2119.6800000000003s)]
*  will starve to death. That, I mean, when we say, well, you know, it's not like they want to kill [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2124.32s)]
*  all Palestinians. I mean, when you've got half, almost, of Jewish Israelis thinking not enough [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2130.32s)]
*  firepower has been used in Gaza, what does that even mean? I don't know. What does that even look [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2136.08s)]
*  like? You know? Well, I think what you're missing here, not that I don't- not that I fully disagree [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2139.7599999999998s)]
*  with you, but what you're missing here is the goal. If you ask them, would you want that to continue [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2146.56s)]
*  once the hostages are released, you would get very different numbers. I don't know what the numbers [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2152.88s)]
*  would be. You'd get very different numbers. Because the reason for stopping humanitarian aid [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2156.88s)]
*  and bombing the bejeezer side of Gaza for the median Israeli is to get them to release the [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2161.84s)]
*  hostages and surrender, not to get all people in Gaza killed. The difference between what you're [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2166.6400000000003s)]
*  saying and what I'm saying is that I'm saying Israelis don't care enough about Gaza civilians, [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2172.96s)]
*  and you're saying, sort of, they want them all dead. I don't think the median Israeli wants them [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2178.0s)]
*  all dead. I even don't think a lot of Ben-Gur supporters want them all dead. What a lot of [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2182.88s)]
*  Israelis want, honestly, which is also not good, is for them to be pushed out. I want them to maybe [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2186.48s)]
*  stay but release the hostages, and until they release the hostages, they don't care what happens [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2194.8s)]
*  to them. So that's where Israelis are. I talk to Israelis all the time. I very rarely hear anyone [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2199.28s)]
*  tell me, we need to kill all the Palestinians. I do see that sometimes in WhatsApp channels, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2203.84s)]
*  Telegram channels. Those people exist. I even know one or two, but that's not the average Israeli. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2207.76s)]
*  They want to feel secure. They feel like they don't trust the Gazans at all. They feel like [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2213.76s)]
*  they're all Hamas supporters, or there's so few that aren't that it doesn't really matter, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2218.96s)]
*  and that's what their policies are based on. Now, the trouble is, and this is where I had trouble, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2224.0800000000004s)]
*  and you were correct and I was wrong, is that even if your intentions aren't purely genocidal, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2229.1200000000003s)]
*  that doesn't mean the outcome isn't genocidal. You have these policies continuing, and some of [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2235.0400000000004s)]
*  the people who are enacting them want genocidal or semi-genocidal outcomes, so the outcomes are [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2241.28s)]
*  genocidal. It doesn't matter if everyone wants all the Arabs, Palestinians. I don't think [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2248.4s)]
*  Netanyahu wants all the people in Gaza. Let me see what you think about this quote. I mean, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2253.36s)]
*  how would you describe this quote? I mean, this is, I think, really interesting. So here's a quote. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2256.96s)]
*  We'd all like to wake up one spring morning and find that seven million Palestinians who live [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2260.48s)]
*  between the sea and the river have simply disobeyed. How would you describe that? [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2264.5600000000004s)]
*  Who said that, by the way? I want to hear what you think about it before I tell you. It's not you, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2268.4s)]
*  by the way, just so everyone's clear. That isn't you. It's not some sort of trick. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2274.56s)]
*  No, of course not. That's horrific. Well, you know, you have this question here of whether [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2278.0800000000004s)]
*  that's genocidal or ethnic cleansing. I don't know if it really matters that much, but you know, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2285.2000000000003s)]
*  it's a horrific statement. That's Yair Golan. He's the leader of the last so-called Zionist [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2288.7200000000003s)]
*  left party in Israel, the Democrats. He's the moderate opposition. I had no idea Yair Golan said [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2294.56s)]
*  that. But I suppose that's the issue, I suppose, is that I think isn't the problem, the inherent [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2298.88s)]
*  structural problem, that that is actually a widespread view. It's just the division is [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2305.52s)]
*  how much what you start, people, the Israeli leaders start from that premise and work backwards [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2312.08s)]
*  based on what is politically possible at that given time. Because, for example, in 2015, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2317.7599999999998s)]
*  2016, a poll, this was by Pew Research, found that nearly half of Jewish Israelis believed [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2324.7999999999997s)]
*  that Palestinian citizens of Israel, not Gaza, not the West Bank, nearly half thought they [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2332.16s)]
*  should be expelled or transferred from Israel. I mean, that is a vast, I mean, that's the, [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2339.84s)]
*  we're talking about the 20% who are Palestinian citizens. This is, that was years before 7th [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2345.04s)]
*  October. I mean, they're not Gaza either. I suppose that's the issue. Is it not just embedded [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2349.6s)]
*  in Israeli society as a, this is, I suppose, why I'm interested in, is a settler colonial [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2354.96s)]
*  mentality, which is we are superior with the settlers. We don't want these people, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2360.56s)]
*  the indigenous people who are there on this land to exist anymore because they're a threat to what [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2366.4s)]
*  we want to build, which is a state which is for us, the superior people. And that's a long, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2371.36s)]
*  that's not, nothing that's not specific to Israel. That's the history of settler colonialism for you. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2377.76s)]
*  But I mean, that's, you end up thinking, well, we'd just rather these people weren't there [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2381.44s)]
*  or they're an existential threat. Yeah, I don't think that that's embedded into Israeli culture [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2386.5600000000004s)]
*  the way that you do as someone who grew up in Israeli culture. You know, I remember [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2396.0s)]
*  when they took us, my class, for example, to go to an Arab school and they said, this teacher said [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2400.64s)]
*  to us, listen, children, they're a little bit different from you, but they're, but they're, [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2408.16s)]
*  they're people just like you and you'll learn to play together, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And I [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2412.72s)]
*  remember our principal telling us, by the time you're 18, you won't have to go to the army because [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2416.72s)]
*  we'll have peace, you know, and going to, and I remember going to peace rallies in the 90s. You know, [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2422.4s)]
*  my point is not that Israelis are good. My point is, this is based on circumstances. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2429.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's not about good. It's about a mentality that arises. It's not to do with [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2436.24s)]
*  being Israeli or anything. It's to do with the settler colonial mentality. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2440.0s)]
*  I deeply disagree with that. I deeply disagree. What about the colonial? What's that? I mean, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2443.44s)]
*  I think we disagree with the settler colonial mindset part. I think you're being over [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2447.2s)]
*  determinative here. And you have situations that arise over decades. You know, you don't sit around [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2451.44s)]
*  your whole life being in a settler colonial mentality. You have periods where it feels like [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2459.6s)]
*  you can make peace and you have periods where it feels like it's impossible. And I've lived through [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2464.88s)]
*  both. And when you have periods where you think that peace is impossible, people start getting more [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2469.28s)]
*  and more extreme opinions. And that's true for both sides. And that's, that's like, it's missing [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2474.7200000000003s)]
*  from your analysis. How is it not? Let me finish. Let me finish. What's missing from your analysis [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2479.2s)]
*  is the other side. The other side is just like us. They wanted peace in the 90s. Most of them [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2484.48s)]
*  wanted peace in the 90s. Then they started feeling like Israel's building all these settlements and [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2489.68s)]
*  doing all these horrible things to them, 100% correct. And they stopped believing in a two [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2493.6s)]
*  state solution. They started believing more in terrorism. Israel stopped believing in a two [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2498.0s)]
*  state solution, started believing more in occupation and building settlements and committing war crimes. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2503.3599999999997s)]
*  And the difference between your analysis and mine isn't just academic. It's policy oriented. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2509.12s)]
*  Because if it's situational, if it's not based on being born in sin, based on being born in a [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2514.88s)]
*  settler colonial mindset, then you can fix it. But if it's based on original sin, you can't fix it. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2521.2s)]
*  I don't believe in original sin. I don't believe in a settler colonial mindset that is, that you [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2528.16s)]
*  can't change. I believe that circumstances can change. I believe that peace can be made. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2532.72s)]
*  Well, I mean, this is very difficult because I suppose I would support a [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2537.52s)]
*  single state where everyone has equal rights. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2542.16s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, look, I don't really care what the structure is politically, morally speaking. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2545.76s)]
*  Because you're still a Zionist, aren't you? I suppose in that sense. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2556.0s)]
*  Let me finish. Yes, I am a Zionist. I'll tell you why. I do believe it's not practical to [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2559.36s)]
*  to have a one state solution for several reasons. First reason is Israelis will never agree to it. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2565.44s)]
*  They will die to the last Israeli with the last gun before they agree to it. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2571.92s)]
*  That's what white South Africans. It was exactly the same what people said about white South Africans. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2576.32s)]
*  Yeah, but the white, well, you know, if what a lot of people say, and this has to do with what I [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2581.2000000000003s)]
*  remember, I said, I don't have a moral objection necessarily to another structure. The trouble is, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2586.96s)]
*  and this is an Israeli cliche, but it's true, the Palestinians don't have a Nelson Mandela. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2592.4s)]
*  If there was a Nelson Mandela, maybe we could talk about that. Maybe if you could reassure the [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2596.2400000000002s)]
*  security concerns of Israelis with a sense of what we're doing is nonviolent. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2603.52s)]
*  Nelson Mandela did it. That's not true. Nelson Mandela supported our struggle. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2611.28s)]
*  I mean, he was a supporter of our struggle. He managed to convince. He's a unique person. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2614.7200000000003s)]
*  But there's also there's Biko. There's a lot of other people. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2620.88s)]
*  Marwan Barghouti is a Palestinian political. Of course you do. Of course you do. Sorry. I'm [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2624.4s)]
*  just saying everybody else. And he is often compared to a Palestinian Nelson Mandela. And [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2629.6s)]
*  Israel has kept him locked up for years and years and years because they know the polling [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2635.12s)]
*  showed he's actually quite a unifying figure in Palestinian society. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2639.2000000000003s)]
*  I think that Israel has a lot of blame here. And I don't know if my guess honestly [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2641.76s)]
*  is that Marwan Barghouti is not a Palestinian Mandela. Maybe he is. I don't know. And if he [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2650.3999999999996s)]
*  is, then it's Israel's fault. But be that as it may, there has been no message, no clear message [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2655.6s)]
*  from the Palestinian people that they want to resolve this peacefully. There have been moments. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2666.16s)]
*  Let me finish. There have been moments where they have. There are leaders who've suggested it. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2673.2799999999997s)]
*  But I can tell you that message has not been consistently received by the Israeli people. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2678.8s)]
*  And I, who am as left as you're going to find right now, or pretty close to it, [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2684.1600000000003s)]
*  haven't fully received. I'm not fully convinced. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2690.96s)]
*  Yeah. But I guess that point about dynamic, because what we're doing here. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2693.92s)]
*  Let me finish. I'm not fully convinced that they want to resolve things peacefully. I think Israel [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2696.8s)]
*  can take steps to make that more likely that they'll want to. So I don't think it's their [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2702.88s)]
*  completely different thing like that. But on the left fringe, they need to do more to convince [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2708.3199999999997s)]
*  Israelis than they are. A lot more. I get you're definitely, definitely an exception at the moment. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2713.3599999999997s)]
*  And obviously this is why, this isn't about hostility at all. I'm not trying to work out [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2718.4799999999996s)]
*  the journey and to see where other people in Israeli society. It would help if you listen to [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2722.24s)]
*  me a little because. I am listening. I'm listening. Remember, the Palestinians have a lot more agency [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2726.56s)]
*  than you're giving them. We have even more agency because we're more powerful. And I say that all [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2731.6s)]
*  the time, but they have a lot of agency and that's missing from. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2735.52s)]
*  Let me just put, I suppose what I'd find frustrating there is there is a both sides [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2738.16s)]
*  isn't going on there. Israel. And let me just explore. Yeah, but I don't agree with it. I mean, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2743.2s)]
*  Israel is an occupying power. It's responsible for the longest belligerent, just greatly occupying [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2748.08s)]
*  power. So longest belligerent occupation in modern history in the West Bank. It is armed to the teeth [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2752.56s)]
*  by the United States, the world's only superpower. The Palestinian people are in many ways a collection, [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2759.6s)]
*  partly refugee camps. They're partly, it's extremely poor, oppressed and occupied people. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2766.96s)]
*  They don't have an advanced military. And the point just when you say, well, why aren't they, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2775.68s)]
*  where's the interest in peace? From the Palestinian perspective, just to quickly see what you would [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2781.7599999999998s)]
*  say to this. And this is why I'm confused about saying it's not a set of colonial mentality. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2786.32s)]
*  When the Balfour Declaration was issued in 1917, the population of Palestine was, [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2791.04s)]
*  who were Jewish, was less than 10%. And that was then promised to design this movement of the time. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2797.84s)]
*  And obviously, from the Palestinian perspective, that was a case of, well, our land is being [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2802.88s)]
*  handed to somebody else and it's been promised by the British Empire to somebody else. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2810.96s)]
*  And then with what happened in 1947, and people go, well, the UN offered this. Well, the UN offered [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2816.08s)]
*  much more land to the Jewish population compared to their actual percentage of population. So they [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2824.96s)]
*  handed most land, even though they were still a minority. Obviously, the Palestinian people [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2831.6s)]
*  didn't accept that. And I don't really think anybody would have accepted that in that situation. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2836.4s)]
*  And then they were ethnically cleansed, 750,000 driven for homes, 15,000 killed. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2840.24s)]
*  And then in 1967, the Gaza and West Bank were obviously occupied. And then a million Palestinians [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2845.6s)]
*  were arrested. After 1967, we got incarceration. We got then colonization, the land being taken [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2851.92s)]
*  away and used for settlements, which anyone would see as an existential threat. I mean, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2860.7999999999997s)]
*  the point I'm making, and then huge thousands of Palestinians killed. You kind of look at that, [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2864.88s)]
*  you just kind of think, well, we were the majority, not like a century ago. And now we're [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2869.3599999999997s)]
*  being handed tiny, offered very small parts of what was our land, and we're being brutally [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2874.16s)]
*  oppressed by a state which is armed to the teeth by the will's only superpower. So from that [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2879.68s)]
*  perspective, why would the Palestinian people be interested in peace? Because they think from [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2885.92s)]
*  their perspective, peace just means their land being colonized and then being occupied, [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2890.3999999999996s)]
*  and being offered very little compared to what they could have had. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2893.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm used to being arguing with right-wing Zionists and so on. And then they give me the [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2897.44s)]
*  history lesson by ignoring all the points you made and stressing a bunch of points that you didn't [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2904.3199999999997s)]
*  make. All of their points are true and all of your points are, well, okay, not all of their points [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2909.44s)]
*  and not all of your points, but most of the points that you both make are true. And then what happens [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2914.8799999999997s)]
*  is you leave out everything else, right? So then you're forcing me into making these Zionist [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2918.7999999999997s)]
*  points, right? So I'll just go back. The Balfour Declaration wasn't for a Jewish state, it was for [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2924.48s)]
*  a Jewish home, right? It said, we don't deny the rights of Palestinians, they didn't call them [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2929.92s)]
*  Palestinians, but Arabs living there. What happened after that was a series of violent uprisings [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2936.48s)]
*  to try to reverse the idea of having a Jewish home, which led 1921, 1929, 1936 to 39, lots of [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2944.16s)]
*  Jewish casualties. In the 20s, the Jews didn't even have a militia to defend themselves, never [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2952.88s)]
*  mind an army. They started building that in the 1930s. And you had the attempts to divide Palestine [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2957.52s)]
*  in 36, where most of the territory would have gone to the Arabs, which the Zionists stress, [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2966.6400000000003s)]
*  and people on your side ignore, right? And in 47, you had the war that started, was started by [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2972.4s)]
*  the Arabs, and Israel was invaded by all the neighbors. And in 67, Israel told King [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2981.7599999999998s)]
*  Hussein, who was occupying the West Bank, we don't want the West Bank, just leave us alone. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2985.8399999999997s)]
*  And he bombed Israel, so Israel went in. You have all these issues that you're ignoring, [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2990.64s)]
*  which is exactly the point. The reason, no, let me finish, the reason that Israelis don't [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=2998.0s)]
*  trust the Palestinians is because from day one of the Zionist movement, they've been trying to [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3004.16s)]
*  destroy the Zionist movement. There's a response here. They lost. They took on a movement they [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3009.6s)]
*  thought was weaker than they were, and they lost. And that's a historical fact. Now, after that [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3016.0s)]
*  happened, and Israel became stronger, it exploited its strength to treat Palestinians terribly. But [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3022.08s)]
*  that doesn't mean that you get to go back in time and reverse the fact that their movement was [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3028.3199999999997s)]
*  stronger. And they gambled, which was a good gamble from their perspective, on destroying [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3033.12s)]
*  the Zionist movement, which was very weak. Zionist movement cleverly used diplomacy, [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3037.28s)]
*  state building, and military power to defeat the Palestinian nationalist movement. And it was a [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3042.48s)]
*  fair fight, and it won. And if the Palestinians had won that fair fight, there would be no Jews [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3048.1600000000003s)]
*  in Palestine. Let me finish. Let me finish. Okay. You invited me. I know, I know, but I support it. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3053.52s)]
*  Because I mean, let me finish. So you have a battle between two national movements, and one of [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3061.52s)]
*  them won. Neither one is born in sin. Neither one is evil. What you have is a competition between [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3069.12s)]
*  two movements. And ultimately, both sides are here to stay. And both sides need to learn to live with [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3075.6s)]
*  each other. There's nothing to be gained. And this is your problem, Owen. There's nothing to be gained [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3081.2s)]
*  by demonizing one of the sides. Right now, Israel's committing a genocide, and that's evil. But [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3085.84s)]
*  that doesn't mean- No, just two more sentences. It doesn't mean that Israel's evil. Just like [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3091.12s)]
*  when Palestinians were committing October 7th and other terrible things to Jews, that doesn't mean [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3095.8399999999997s)]
*  that they were evil. This is a competition between two movements, and it needs to be settled. It's [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3100.48s)]
*  not God versus Satan. There's no good and bad here. Just in terms of what happened early on, [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3104.64s)]
*  you mentioned the Balfour Declaration says that it wouldn't be the foundation of a Jewish home [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3112.24s)]
*  to the disadvantage of those already living there. But the problem is, Zionist leaders at the time [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3116.96s)]
*  were not saying that. They were making very, very clear they did not see Palestinians as equal human [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3123.6s)]
*  beings. They specifically referenced and compared what they planned to do with European colonialism. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3129.6s)]
*  And Theodore Herzl, the way he spoke about the Palestinian people was gratuitously racist. So [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3137.36s)]
*  what actually happened is they were prophetic about what they thought would actually happen. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3142.64s)]
*  And you say a fair fight. That's true. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3146.72s)]
*  Your knowledge of Zionist history is partial. So Herzl was a man who lived in the late 19th century. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3150.72s)]
*  So he was no progressive, woke person. But he said, if you read Alten Euland, that Arabs will [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3158.3999999999996s)]
*  do very well in the Jewish state. By the standards of the time, he was super enlightened. Read the [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3166.3999999999996s)]
*  book. And then the Zionist movement didn't announce that it's pursuing a state. It did in [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3170.64s)]
*  various ways. Announced it's pursuing a state until the Biltmore Declaration of 42. Until then, [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3176.48s)]
*  they were willing to compromise on whether it's going to be a state or a home in different ways. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3182.64s)]
*  The Zionist movement during the early 20th century were not saints. I am not saying that. I can find [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3187.28s)]
*  a lot of terrible examples of things that they did. But obviously you got the Zionist movement. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3193.12s)]
*  Was not a no saint either. In fact, they were much worse early on. And that's a fact. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3198.72s)]
*  So just on that, well, the Zionist movement did make clear that they wanted a state for [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3205.52s)]
*  Jewish people, which was to the exclusion of the Palestinian people. But nonetheless, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3210.16s)]
*  when we talk about a fair fight, in 1947, 1948, when Zionist militia were launching [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3213.4399999999996s)]
*  vicious terrorist attacks, it must be noted, as well as slaughtering Palestinians. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3220.64s)]
*  I mean, it's not a fair fight, is it? I mean, they committed, I mean, they expelled 750,000 people. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3226.1600000000003s)]
*  Well, the war started in November 1947, when Palestinian militias put a siege on Jerusalem, [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3230.88s)]
*  including slaughtering convoys, including convoys of nurses and doctors. And the attack, [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3239.52s)]
*  the Nakhshon operation, all that stuff, where the Jewish militias ended up committing what [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3247.44s)]
*  turned into ethnic cleansing, started as a military operation to clear the roads. You had the roads [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3256.6400000000003s)]
*  going from Jerusalem to the ports. They went into the villages that were over the roads that were [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3263.92s)]
*  being used to slaughter the convoys and empty them of people. And this is what I mean. There's no [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3270.6400000000003s)]
*  saints here. There's a war. Yeah, I guess, again, I mean, the entire context, and this is a real [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3275.84s)]
*  problem. If you want there to be peace, you have to understand the context. You have to understand [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3281.92s)]
*  the genuine concerns, security concerns of the Jewish people, because the way they're acting right [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3286.7200000000003s)]
*  now, the way they're lashing out right now in Gaza, isn't because they're evil. It's because they feel [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3291.6800000000003s)]
*  incredibly insecure because of the Holocaust, because of October 7th. I get, you know, in the [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3296.88s)]
*  same way. You would be doing the same thing if you were Israeli, and I would be doing the same [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3303.36s)]
*  thing in Gaza if I was Palestinian. This is a question of circumstances. No one disputes that, [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3308.96s)]
*  by the way. And again, you know, the British Empire. You say, set the colonial mindset. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3314.56s)]
*  You're giving an original sin mindset to all Israelis, which is not helpful. You talked about [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3319.36s)]
*  ethnic cleansing. In Israel itself, the pre 1967 Israel, the one founded in 1948, obviously, [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3327.44s)]
*  thousands of hundreds of Palestinian villages were destroyed and they were settled on by [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3334.56s)]
*  Israeli settlers. And obviously, then you've got the expansion of those settlements to all over the [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3341.12s)]
*  West Bank, where there are over 700,000 illegal Israeli settlers. That idea of settling and [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3345.76s)]
*  colonizing land is obviously what Zionism is all about. And that's the issue because you then see [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3354.88s)]
*  yourself as you see the land as, you know, if you're a settler colonial movement, as somehow [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3361.6s)]
*  you are the deserving people. And this is obviously wrapped up often in biblical and religious [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3369.04s)]
*  terminology. And therefore, the people who are living on the land already, the Palestinian people, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3372.32s)]
*  are problems. And you work backwards from that, which is why even moderate in Israel today, [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3378.0s)]
*  moderate so-called leaders will talk about the existence of the Palestinians as a problem. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3382.32s)]
*  That's the issue. I think what you're mixing up here is basic human instinct for conquest [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3386.4s)]
*  with settler colonialism. I think settler colonialism is a frame. I've written about [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3392.8s)]
*  settler colonialism. I have a peer reviewed article about settler colonialism. I think it's [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3397.2000000000003s)]
*  a useful prism for many things, but you're using it in a way that I don't think is useful. Why? [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3400.56s)]
*  Because throughout history, every single people who had military power used that to take over land, [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3405.1200000000003s)]
*  settle and push other people off. Your people did that all over the world. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3412.08s)]
*  Yeah, it was criminal. Of course. No, I'm not justifying. I'm just telling you, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3415.6s)]
*  the Arabs did that coming out of Arabia, you know, in this in the seventh century. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3420.3199999999997s)]
*  We did that in Israel in the West Bank. That's just what, you know, [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3425.04s)]
*  they have military power. They see someone else who has the land they want. They go in, [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3431.2799999999997s)]
*  they take it, they settle. It's not illegal. It shouldn't be done. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3436.3199999999997s)]
*  That's what human beings do. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3440.24s)]
*  No, you say that. You say that because it is... [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3441.68s)]
*  Let me finish. Just because your grandfather did that doesn't mean that you're part of some kind of, [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3443.68s)]
*  you know, primal evil culture that can't be fixed. Everyone's grandparents did that. Everyone's [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3450.4s)]
*  grandparents who had power, who weren't victims, did that because that's what people do. We need to [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3457.36s)]
*  stop people from doing that, but we don't need to label people as evil forever because... [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3462.08s)]
*  I didn't say evil. I think you're inserting moralistic terms here. I'm looking at what I [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3465.68s)]
*  think are clinical descriptions of a political phenomenon, which is different. And that's just [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3470.3199999999997s)]
*  for you. Just to point out quickly... [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3474.56s)]
*  Where I'm looking at you is not the diagnosis, as much as in the fact that that behavior can change. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3476.08s)]
*  No, I don't disagree with that, but I think that means dismantling the state as it is in order to [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3482.56s)]
*  create a new state where everyone has equal rights, which is why I advocate. That's it. I just want [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3486.64s)]
*  people to be equal citizens. And I want that to mean Jewish citizens of Israel as they are now [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3490.48s)]
*  having equal rights. That's what I support. But just the point that you made about settler [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3495.6s)]
*  coll... I suppose, you know, because I hear this argument a lot, which is, well, yeah, Israel did [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3499.36s)]
*  that in, you know, night for eight onwards. And it is an ongoing process. That's the point. It's not [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3502.96s)]
*  just people's grandfathers. It's people now. People a lot younger than me are settlers in Israel, [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3507.04s)]
*  not people's grandparents, people who are 20 year olds people are settled in the West Bank. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3512.32s)]
*  Absolutely. I don't even... [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3517.36s)]
*  But the point is, when people say, well, Israel did that night for a year and, you know, almost [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3519.04s)]
*  but so what did Britain do? You're right. But then that would be like a state being founded in 1948, [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3523.44s)]
*  which practiced slavery and then going, well, the Americans practice slavery, didn't they? [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3527.68s)]
*  So yeah, in a different era. And it was defeated because it was a grave evil. And I think that's [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3531.44s)]
*  the problem that you were talking here about something which actually was in terms of settler [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3537.2s)]
*  colonialism overwhelmingly has been stopped and fought against. And in fact, almost with the one [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3542.72s)]
*  exception being Israel, European settler colonialism was brought to an end on the basis it was [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3549.52s)]
*  understood to be a grave injustice. But this is the one exception. It's not the one exception. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3555.52s)]
*  You know, you look at China and Tibet and with the Uighurs and you can look at the Western Sahara and [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3562.3999999999996s)]
*  you can look at Cyprus. It's not the one exception. It's terrible. It's illegal. It needs to stop. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3567.92s)]
*  It's not the one exception. It's human nature. It's human nature. And that's why what we need to do [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3573.2000000000003s)]
*  is have incentives to stop it. Well, finally, that's why we disagree. I mean, you know, [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3577.6s)]
*  Well, this is what's interesting to me because it's about, you know, because I'm really interested in, [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3584.64s)]
*  I mean, that's why I find this fascinating, by the way. I think you've been really, really [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3589.12s)]
*  fascinating and I just I find engaging this really educational just in terms of having that [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3591.92s)]
*  discussion. But just finally, then, I mean, what then next? Because I suppose as things stand, [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3598.16s)]
*  Gaza has been levelled. There is a plan to remove its surviving population. That's an [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3603.44s)]
*  innately genocidal act. And but the West Bank is being asphyxiated of its Palestinian population. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3608.08s)]
*  Life has been made more and more livable. And you kind of just think this ends with a greater [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3614.16s)]
*  Israel in which the entire Palestinian people is removed entirely from what was historic Palestine. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3618.32s)]
*  I mean, how do we stop that? Yeah, I think we'd probably agree on how to stop that at this point. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3625.44s)]
*  I'm going to say things I would never have said a couple of months ago. Israel needs to be [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3630.56s)]
*  sanctioned. I think Israel needs to stop selling arms to Israel. I think they need to put trade [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3633.44s)]
*  embargoes on Israel. I think that Benjamin Netanyahu, Yoav Gallant and many other people [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3639.52s)]
*  need to go before the ICC. I think Israel needs to be punished for what it did. I think people need [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3644.4s)]
*  to be held accountable. I think Israel needs to be reformed from the ground up. It needs to have a [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3648.48s)]
*  judicial system that will actually charge the people who did this because they can't all go to [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3654.4s)]
*  international tribunals. They need to be reforms in the military. I think the only way to do that, [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3660.1600000000003s)]
*  unfortunately, is to sanction Israel and make it pay a very heavy price for what it did so that [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3666.1600000000003s)]
*  the average median Israeli understands that this was a disaster and doesn't support it. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3671.04s)]
*  I said you're never going to get Israel to dismantle itself, but what you can get is for [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3677.68s)]
*  Israel to stop doing what it's doing because I don't believe that it's an inherent element. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3683.52s)]
*  I think there's a lot of trickery and lies behind it to make Israel support this. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3688.4s)]
*  I think if the consequences of it were more apparent to the Israeli people through sanctions [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3693.04s)]
*  and the military not getting weapons, so that the military tells Netanyahu to stop because the [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3699.04s)]
*  military is so powerful. The military, by the way, isn't fully behind this operation. I talk to [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3702.56s)]
*  people very high up and they tell me I don't really understand what we're doing. I don't understand [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3707.84s)]
*  why we're doing it. I don't understand our strategy and why is that important because if you tell them, [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3710.88s)]
*  if you stop selling them arms, they'll be saying what are we doing? We're fighting a war that has [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3716.08s)]
*  no point and now we're not going to have arms. We're not going to be able to defend ourselves. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3721.12s)]
*  So you need to pressure Israel on these points. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3724.64s)]
*  The reason I think what you're saying is, well, obviously I support that, is wise. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3728.3199999999997s)]
*  This is a conversation which I found chilling but instructive. When I first [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3732.08s)]
*  moved to London, I'm a northerner, people weren't very friendly. There's this woman [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3737.2s)]
*  speaking to me and she's a young white South African. I name drop the fact that my dad [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3742.16s)]
*  shared a Coke bottle with Harbin and Becky in Brighton in the 1960s. She just went, [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3749.3599999999997s)]
*  yeah, I just wasn't working anymore and I did not like that. I'll be honest. But the point was many [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3754.64s)]
*  white South Africans ended up being forced to conclude whether they liked it or not. It had run [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3760.7999999999997s)]
*  out of road because of the international pressure against their country, which is I think exactly [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3766.72s)]
*  how this ends. By the way, I should say because I did, I mean, I found it just obviously going [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3772.7999999999997s)]
*  through this, but you really are, it's commendable the journey you've gone on. It's really important. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3776.48s)]
*  It is based on, you clearly see Palestinians as humans, obviously, and you are aware that a [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3780.4s)]
*  grave crime is being committed and things we don't agree on, fine, but we do agree on what I think [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3785.76s)]
*  is obviously one of the great horrors of our time because it's genocide. I mean, for me, the reason [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3791.2000000000003s)]
*  I speak out about it all the time is obviously I thought it was genocide obviously a lot earlier [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3796.1600000000003s)]
*  than you, but I think my government is helping to facilitate a genocide. And I think if you, [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3800.96s)]
*  well, they are exactly. And if you're, my view is, which is why I speak out about this, [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3806.88s)]
*  and I felt I had a responsibility to speak out is just because if you are a citizen of a country [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3811.36s)]
*  with any position or influence or any platform, you kind of got a responsibility. If you think [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3816.2400000000002s)]
*  it's a genocide, you have to speak out because what's worse than that. And I think that's why [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3821.44s)]
*  what you're saying is really important. And I think it's very important. I think people have [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3826.96s)]
*  found this really fascinating and interesting actually and will respect greatly the. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3832.24s)]
*  – Let me complement what you're saying. The most responsibility, you have a responsibility, [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3835.8399999999997s)]
*  everyone watching this has a responsibility. The most responsibility is for Jews and for Israelis. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3842.16s)]
*  We are culpable for what's happening in Gaza. It's our fault. It's being done in our name. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3848.3199999999997s)]
*  We need to stop supporting it. We'd stop supporting it now. And when I came out and I [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3853.9199999999996s)]
*  wrote this tweet saying, I think it's genocide. I waited too long to say this or took a long time [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3860.72s)]
*  to say this. Honestly, too long to say this. I got a lot of very sharp responses. The responses [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3866.48s)]
*  I got from Israel, the ones I got from diaspora Jews, from people here, mostly would not surprise [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3872.9599999999996s)]
*  you. They were very angry, including some people who are livid at me. Some people said, are you [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3878.3999999999996s)]
*  sure in America? And so on. But the responses I got from Israelis were much more interesting. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3884.64s)]
*  A lot of them said, you're right. I'm not really ready to say it yet, but you're right. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3889.52s)]
*  A lot of them feel that this has gone too far. They're closer to it than the American Jews are. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3896.32s)]
*  – Well, that's interesting because, well, I mean, because obviously in America, so many [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3902.16s)]
*  Jewish, because the Jews have always been overrepresented in movements for justice and [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3906.32s)]
*  emancipation and liberation. That's actually one of the reasons that anti-Semites would often go [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3911.92s)]
*  after Jews because they would go on about, they'd say they're subversives. And actually, [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3915.12s)]
*  a poll last year showed 38% of American Jews under the age of 44 for Israel's committing genocide. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3921.2799999999997s)]
*  30% of Jewish Americans overall for Israel's committing genocide. And I think I'm always [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3927.2799999999997s)]
*  inspired when I see Jewish Americans, particularly younger Jewish Americans speaking out. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3932.4s)]
*  – That's a younger generation thing. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3935.92s)]
*  – No, it is great because it's a great tradition. It's a Jewish humanist. The left wouldn't exist [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3937.52s)]
*  without Jewish people in the way that we understand it. Honestly, it's been really, [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3942.32s)]
*  really fascinating. And you should, you know, I do commend the honesty. And I know it's not easy, [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3946.1600000000003s)]
*  obviously, what you've done. And you face the fact that you've done obviously the right thing. And [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3952.1600000000003s)]
*  so many others, I hope, will follow in your footsteps. Please like and subscribe, everyone [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3955.84s)]
*  watching. Please leave your comments, your thoughts. Share the video. But Shai, honestly, [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3958.56s)]
*  it's been an honor. Thank you so much. – Thank you, Owen. It's been a pleasure. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3963.6800000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJCixlcdzc&t=3972.32s)]
