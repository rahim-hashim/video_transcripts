# Official Gaza Death Toll Reaches 40,000 - But It's Wrong
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [August 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7II3ie9IuFA)
*  The official death toll in Gaza since Israel's genocide onslaught began has surpassed 40,000.
*  Now this has been widely seen as a horrifying milestone. Let's listen to Volker Turk. He's
*  the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. Today marks a grim milestone for the world.
*  The people of Gaza are now grieving 40,000 Palestinian lives lost, according to Gaza's
*  Health Ministry. Most of the dead are women and children. This unimaginable situation
*  is overwhelmingly due to recurring failures by the Israeli Defense Forces to comply with the
*  rules of war. As the world reflects on and considers its inability to prevent this carnage,
*  I urge all parties to agree to an immediate ceasefire, to lay down their arms, and stop the
*  killing once and for all. The hostages must be released, Palestinians arbitrarily detained must
*  be freed, Israel's illegal occupation must end, and the internationally agreed two-state solution
*  must become a reality. Well the official death toll is wrong and we shouldn't be using it. We
*  certainly shouldn't be relying on it. It shouldn't be at the center of how we describe this genocidal
*  onslaught and the human impact. Now before you get alarmed and think I've become an atrocity
*  denier or an apologist for this genocidal onslaught, I'm saying this because the official
*  death toll is much too low and I'm going to come on to that. Now firstly, as the brilliant Asal
*  Rad, an academic I've interviewed on this channel who monitors, headlines exposes, media organizations
*  have stripped accountability from Israel when reporting on this milestone in the official
*  statistics. Let's look at these examples. Associated Press, more than 40,000 Palestinians
*  have been killed in Gaza, the territory's health ministry says. No accountability for Israel. CNN
*  World, more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in 10 months of war in Gaza, health ministry
*  says. No accountability for Israel. The BBC, more than 40,000 killed in Gaza, Hamas run health
*  ministry says. No accountability for Israel. Note how they put in the sly Hamas run health ministry
*  to discredit the figures. Sky News, Gaza conflict, thousands remain unidentified as death toll
*  reaches 40,000. No accountability for Israel either. What happened? Was it a natural disaster?
*  A hurricane? A tornado? A tsunami? Anyway, we could go on. Now as the Israeli newspaper Hararet's
*  details, if you just use the 40,000 figure, then Gaza is one of the bloodiest quote unquote wars of
*  the 21st century. I say quote unquote because this should be regarded as a genocidal onslaught
*  primarily, not a war. It's too asymmetrical to be described accurately as a war. Now this focuses
*  on the rate of mortality based on looking at deaths compared to the overall population,
*  which of course should be the key measurement. Now 40,000 would be around 2% of the pre-war
*  population, which Hararet's puts at around 2 million. For Israel, the equivalent, the newspaper
*  notes would be nearly 200,000 people. Now according to Professor Michael Spagger of
*  University of London, a researcher of war and our conflict who monitors the number of casualties in
*  conflicts, he assumes Gaza is already amongst the top five deadliest in the 21st century. He adds,
*  if we factor in the amount of time it took to kill 1% of this population, then it could be
*  unprecedented. Now if we look at all the so-called wars, take the Syrian civil war. Now that's
*  regarded as a truly brutal horror show and quite rightly too horrific. Around 2% of the
*  population is believed to have been killed in Syria, a similar number as estimated in Gaza,
*  but with a key difference. That's over 13 years. Gaza is 10 months. Iraq, about 1% of the population
*  in that hideous war, but over the course of 20 years, not 10 months. Yugoslavia, half a percent
*  of the population. Look, the Yugoslav wars are regarded as hideous, truly hideous. I've just got
*  back from Serbia, from Belgrade, half a percent over 10 years. Ukraine, 0.5% of the population
*  over two and a half years. That's still hideous by the way. That's a hideous, horrible war.
*  It's just what's happened in Gaza is specifically horrific. It's a crime of a truly colossal scale.
*  The article adds, the death of 2% of the residents of a region within less than a year is an extremely
*  exceptional occurrence in the era of warfare after World War II, especially outside of Africa.
*  It goes on, during the Vietnam War, estimates are that 5% of the population was killed, but that was
*  a war that lasted almost 20 years in various incarnations and weaponry was used indiscriminately
*  and widely. In Syria, according to strict estimates, about 2% of the population was killed,
*  similar to Gaza, but the difference is significant. The Syrian war has dragged on for 13 years.
*  Now, we know the official figures are not an overestimate, as has been claimed by
*  apologists for the Israeli state, because they were vindicated in previous conflicts.
*  Key agencies from the United Nations to NGOs have validated them. The Lancet Medical Journal,
*  the most prestigious on earth, has validated them. Other researchers have done detailed work
*  validating them. US officials have validated them. Israeli officials do read Plus 917 magazine,
*  which has gone into that. But they're likely to be a very significant underestimate.
*  For many reasons. Now, I'll give you a few key reasons. The first reason is they don't include
*  people buried under the rubble classified as missing. They're clearly dead. I'm sorry to have
*  to say that, but they are. That adds thousands of people to the death toll. The second is that the
*  figures exclude indirect deaths. Think about it. Imagine the entire healthcare system of your country
*  was obliterated in the absence even of invasion and the total violence that Gaza's enveloped.
*  That would impose a terrible death toll on any country. Now, think about that in Gaza,
*  in the context of Israel's onslaught. The healthcare system there has been destroyed
*  in a meaningful way. So think of cancer patients, thousands of cancer patients,
*  they're not getting the medical treatment that they need. Some being killed now, others will die
*  in the future as a consequence. Think of other health conditions, diabetes, heart conditions.
*  Think of pregnant women. Think of newborn babies in these apocalyptic conditions. The third is many
*  deaths are not being reported to the authorities, not least when entire families or groups of people
*  are killed without witnesses. We have seen footage of the Israeli army killing civilians and then
*  burying their bodies. The fourth is frankly crucial. The reporting system is virtually collapsed.
*  The Ministry of Health figures relied, of course, on the medical system, on hospitals.
*  But the medical system, indeed, the hospitals have been destroyed. So those figures just aren't
*  reliable anymore. Society itself, the basics of civilization have virtually collapsed. A
*  bureaucratic system which can accurately report this level of death simply isn't there anymore.
*  So that's why estimates of the death toll given by medical experts ranged from 92,000 to 186,000
*  people. Now, a spokesperson for the US State Department was challenged about this
*  slaughter by Saeed Arikat, who is a Palestinian journalist. Let's have a listen.
*  One word Jennifer mentioned about crossing the 40,000 mark. I mean, this is more than 10 to 1,
*  as far as how many, you know, all lost life is precious and so on. But now we have at least
*  10 to 1 Palestinians that have died. When will enough be enough? Because I know you say, you know,
*  one more we don't want to see. But the fact of the matter is that you've been saying this
*  since last December, you know, and we have killing every single day, every single day,
*  no 24 hour goes by without killing at least 36, 40, 50 Palestinians, most of them children. So,
*  I mean, when will enough be enough? Saeed, what we are exactly focusing on is trying to have a
*  resolution that would allow the fighting to stop. That's why we have time and time again. And again,
*  just a moment ago, I said that the best thing for the parties to do to minimize impact on all,
*  including the Palestinian civilians is to accept and finalize a ceasefire deal, one that is
*  encompassing of the hostages being returned and influx of humanitarian aid and broader diplomacy
*  to happen for the region to get out of this endless cycle of violence. Tom, go ahead.
*  Utterly contemptible. Utterly contemptible. This mass slaughter has been made possible every step
*  of the way by the United States government. Most of those vitally killed were killed with
*  US supplied weapons. They've just given Israel a massive new shipment of weapons. They have offered
*  diplomatic support, aid, the works. This is one of the worst crimes of our age. Bear in mind that,
*  and I'm sorry to say this, that so many more people are likely to be killed. This is a horrible
*  term, excess deaths over the coming years, excess deaths, that's deaths above what would have been
*  the trend otherwise. Who even knows what that will be? There have been estimates already of
*  what that could be and they are horrific. This may end up being the deadliest military onslaught
*  since World War II. And it is important to make this point. Certain things flow from the fact
*  that this is one of the most abominable crimes of our age. That is those who cheered us on,
*  who legitimized this, must be held to account, including through the justice system. And those
*  who had platforms, who had power, who had influence, who chose not to speak out and not
*  to call this out for what it is. And I'm not talking about plasitities and hand-wringing.
*  They too need to be held to account because all of this is on them too. Please like and subscribe.
*  Do leave your thoughts and comments. Always read them. We've got a very big news story to come,
*  which I'm very excited about. You'll see what I mean. That's what I've been working on for
*  the last few weeks. You may have noticed intermittent coverage. That's why. You'll see
*  why. You're going to find it. Well, you'll see what I mean very shortly. Keep it straight on
