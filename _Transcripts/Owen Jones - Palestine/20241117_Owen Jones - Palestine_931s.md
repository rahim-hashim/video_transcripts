# Trump Appoints UNHINGED Pro-Israel Stooges
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [November 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM)
*  Well, look, Donald Trump recapturing the White House was never going to be a fun ride, but [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=0.0s)]
*  the appointments he has made should frankly be considered terrifying, both for the impact [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=4.12s)]
*  they will have on Americans, including many of those who voted for him, and the people [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=7.68s)]
*  of Palestine, which is what I'll focus on, given the central role of the United States [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=11.8s)]
*  in facilitating that genocide. Now Trump understandably feels emboldened. He not only won 312 votes [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=15.68s)]
*  in the Electoral College compared to June 26th for Kamala Harris, he's also the first [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=21.68s)]
*  Republican presidential candidate to win a higher share of the popular vote than his [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=25.88s)]
*  democratic opponent. And so far, it looks like he's going to be just under 50% of the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=29.84s)]
*  overall popular votes. He didn't actually win a majority of those who actually voted. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=37.6s)]
*  We'll talk about the question turn out and who didn't vote in videos to come. But nonetheless, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=43.76s)]
*  he won this victory while clearly peddling more extreme and vengeful rhetoric than he [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=50.3s)]
*  did last time, surrounded by more menacing individuals. That triumphalism is reflected [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=54.0s)]
*  in the extreme nature of the people he's appointed. In this carnival of horrors, let's begin with [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=59.4s)]
*  Mike Huckabee, the Republican former governor of Arkansas who ran for the presidential Republican [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=64.12s)]
*  nomination in 2008 and 2016. He's on the hardcore religious right. That matters because in the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=70.64s)]
*  United States it is evangelical Christians, not Jewish Americans by quite a distance, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=75.8s)]
*  who are the most hardcore cheerleaders for Israel and indeed its most extreme elements. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=80.88s)]
*  Indeed, a poll a few months ago found that 30% of Jewish Americans thought Israel was [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=84.96s)]
*  committing genocide, rising to 40% among the under 45s, not so with right-wing evangelical [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=88.56s)]
*  Christians. Now, Trump has proposed Mike Huckabee as the new US ambassador to Israel. Let's [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=94.16s)]
*  start with this video from 2008. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=98.56s)]
*  There really is no such thing as, I have to be careful in saying this, because people [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=110.56s)]
*  are really good at this. There's really no such thing as a Palestinian. There's no [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=113.56s)]
*  Bibleist that wants that. There's no such thing as an Arab. There's no such thing as [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=118.36s)]
*  an Arab. There's no such thing as an Arab. There's no such thing as an Arab. There's [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=123.36s)]
*  no such thing as an Arab. There's no such thing as an Arab. There's no such thing as [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=126.36s)]
*  a Palestinian. There's really no such thing. That's been a political tool to try to force [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  land away from Israel. What my point is, if that's the issue, if it's real estate, if [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=131.88s)]
*  you look at it now and say, here's how much Israel has, and here's how much the Arab [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=140.24s)]
*  States hold, there's plenty of land for them to have. Let them take it out of Egypt. Let [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=143.24s)]
*  them take it out of Syria. Let them take it out of Jordan. There are plenty of places [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=148.24s)]
*  for this to be without sacrificing the Golan Heights, which would be suicide, suicide. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=154.24s)]
*  And what worries me is, I mean, we've got to respect Israel's decisions to self-govern, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=161.24s)]
*  but when I hear some Arab leaders talking about giving up the Golan Heights, I'm thinking, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=166.92000000000002s)]
*  tell me... [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  There is no such thing as a Palestinian, he says. Well, let's be clear, that is genocidal [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=170.92000000000002s)]
*  in its implications as a perspective. He uses that to justify illegal annexation and indeed [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=176.28s)]
*  ethnic cleansing. He's even here criticising Israeli leaders at the time for not being [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=180.8s)]
*  extreme enough in their treatment of the Palestinians. What he's suggesting here is [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=184.60000000000002s)]
*  Palestinians, many of whom have already been driven from their land in 1948 in particular [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=188.28s)]
*  and in 1967 and indeed on other occasions, not least in Gaza today, should be permanently [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=192.72s)]
*  expelled. Saying they should go to other Arab countries is like saying we should expel, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=197.8s)]
*  I don't know, French people to Germany or Italy because they're all European. I mean, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=202.24s)]
*  I don't know why I'm even trying to rationalise his comments, given they are, of course, so [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=205.72s)]
*  extreme. Next, from 2017. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=210.76s)]
*  There is no such thing as a West Bank. It's Judea and Samaria. There's no such thing as [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=212.52s)]
*  a settlement. They're communities, they're neighbourhoods, they're cities. There's no [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=216.56s)]
*  such thing as an occupation. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=220.32s)]
*  He says here there's no such thing as the West Bank. There's Judea and Samaria, which [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=222.56s)]
*  is the biblical term used to justify expelling Palestinians from their homes on the grounds [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=226.28s)]
*  that it has been given by God to the Jewish people. He then says contrary to what international [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=231.2s)]
*  law firmly adjudicates, there is no such thing as an occupation and dismisses the idea of [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=235.68s)]
*  settlements which are completely illegal under international law being what they are instead [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=240.96s)]
*  calling them communities. Well, you know, if someone stole his land and illegally settled [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=246.28s)]
*  people there, I doubt he'd be calling those communities. As for the idea of no occupation, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=250.84s)]
*  the West Bank has been subjected to the longest belligerent occupation in modern history. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=255.4s)]
*  At this point, what do you even say other than is this dude sniffing glue? What does [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=259.28000000000003s)]
*  he think the armed presence of Israeli soldiers is, imposed against the will of three million [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=263.68s)]
*  Palestinians in the West Bank? Let's hear this one, shall we? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=270.16s)]
*  But there is something else about Israel that I believe mirrors that of the history of the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  United States. I do not believe that it is possible to understand, to even comprehend [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=279.2s)]
*  the United States of America without believing that it involved the providence of God. And [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=286.2s)]
*  I do not believe that it is possible for anybody to look at the remarkable, stunning history, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=293.8s)]
*  not only of ancient Israel but of the modern nation of Israel, and somehow believe that [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=300.91999999999996s)]
*  that could be without the providence and the hand of Almighty God. There is simply no other [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=306.44s)]
*  explanation. I am one who believes, and this is not a political view, this is deeply personal, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=312.96000000000004s)]
*  and whether I'm in politics or not, I still hold this view. I held it when I was a teenager, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=322.6s)]
*  I held it long before I ever got into politics, and a hundred years from now I will still [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=327.76s)]
*  hold it. In a different citizenship, no doubt, a hundred years from now. And it's this belief [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=332.72s)]
*  that though we may break many of our promises to God, He never breaks His promises to us. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=341.96s)]
*  Never ever ever. And for those of you who embrace and believe in the Bible, and I would [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=350.12s)]
*  assume that most of you in the RJC do, then I would have to say that I affirm the reality [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=358.12s)]
*  of Genesis chapter 12 verse 3. God says those who bless Israel will be blessed and those [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=365.12s)]
*  who curse Israel will be cursed. That's either true or it is not. I believe it is true. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=373.12s)]
*  Oh, we've really got a live one, haven't we guys? He's a Christian fundamentalist, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=380.12s)]
*  sure, who believes God justifies expelling indigenous people from their lands and murderously [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=385.12s)]
*  stealing that land. Interestingly, that includes the expulsion of Christian Palestinians. What [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=390.84000000000003s)]
*  does he think about that? Does he think it's the Christian God's will that Christian Palestinians [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=397.96s)]
*  were driven en masse from their homes in 1948 and not 1947? Is that what he thinks? Does [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=405.16s)]
*  he think the Christian Palestinians who've been killed in Gaza today, does he think that's [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=413.16s)]
*  God's will? I'd be interested to know. He also believes that if you oppose, I don't [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=418.16s)]
*  know, Israel's policies of apartheid, colonisation, ethnic cleansing and genocide, then you will [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=423.16s)]
*  be cursed by God. Well, I'm not a believer. I do strongly believe in respecting the religious [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=427.16s)]
*  beliefs of others, which I know can play a really important role in many people's lives [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=432.16s)]
*  and even spur them on to help others. But if such a God existed, I would clearly regard [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=436.16s)]
*  him not as a God, but as some sort of devil. Now, after being nominated as ambassador, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=441.16s)]
*  he repeated this view. As you well know, I've never been willing to use the term West Bank. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=445.16s)]
*  There is no such thing. I speak of Judea and Samaria. I tell people there is no occupation. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=451.16s)]
*  It is a land that is occupied by the people who have had a rightful deed to the place [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=458.20000000000005s)]
*  for 3500 years since the time of Abraham. So a lot of the terms that maybe the media [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=466.2s)]
*  would use are even people against Israel would use are not terms that I employ because I [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=472.2s)]
*  want to use terms that live from time immemorial. And those are the terms like promised land [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=478.2s)]
*  and Judea, Samaria. These are biblical terms and those were important to me. And so I will [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=484.2s)]
*  continue to follow that nomenclature unless I'm instructed otherwise, but I don't think [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=491.2s)]
*  that will happen. Well, this is a Manichaean view and one with hideous potential consequences. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=496.2s)]
*  If you believe those who support the right of Palestinian national self-determination [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=501.2s)]
*  are cursed by God, then that will clearly have a major impact on how you will behave [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=506.2s)]
*  towards them. Just a little note here. This underlines how zealous support of Israel and [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=511.2s)]
*  believing in the innate equality and security of Jewish people don't go together. You see, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=516.2s)]
*  the biblical prophecy Huckabee believes in is that all Jews must return to Israel because [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=520.2s)]
*  that will then hasten the return of Jesus Christ and bring about Judgment Day. In other [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=525.2s)]
*  words, the apocalypse and that Jewish people then either convert to Christianity or face [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=530.2s)]
*  extermination. Lovely stuff. And to think it's those who think Jewish people should just [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=534.2s)]
*  have equal rights and security wherever they live, to be equal human beings, to be protected [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=538.2s)]
*  and not face, I don't know, divine extermination. They're the ones who get smeared as anti-Semitic. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=545.2s)]
*  Cool. It's enough to make you want to blaspheme, isn't it? Next up, Pete Hegseth, a Fox News [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=551.2s)]
*  presenter and Trump's pick for defense secretary. Well, he's another far-right Christian zealot [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=556.2s)]
*  with tattoos pointing to hardcore Christian nationalism, such as a Jerusalem cross on his [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=560.2s)]
*  chest as well as Daus Voltz, God Will's it, which is a battle cry of the first crusade. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=564.2s)]
*  It is, as experts say, a call for religious violence. He wrote in his 2020 book American [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=569.2s)]
*  Crusade that Muslims plan to outbreed native, in a verse, quote, Americans and that the [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=574.2s)]
*  United States faces a cultural invasion that Christians should fight like 11th century [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=579.2s)]
*  crusaders. That's a curious comparison, given the crusaders were murderously invading foreign [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=583.2s)]
*  lands. He wants to release US soldiers accused of war crimes. He believes so-called woke [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=588.2s)]
*  generals have left the military weakened of feminists and questioned women having combat [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=592.2s)]
*  roles. He was also investigated for alleged sexual assault in 2017. Now let's hear his [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=598.2s)]
*  views on Israel and Palestine. And today, Jennifer and I and others had a chance to go [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=603.2s)]
*  see the Western Wall of the Temple Mount, the Western Wall tunnels, so much of the old [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=608.2s)]
*  city. And as you stand there, you can't help but behold the miracle before you. And it got [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=614.2s)]
*  me thinking about another miracle that I hope all of you don't see too far away, because [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=620.2s)]
*  1917 was a miracle, 1948 was a miracle, 1967 was a miracle, 2017, the declaration of Jerusalem [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=626.2s)]
*  as the capital was a miracle, and there's no reason why the miracle of the reestablishment [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=637.2s)]
*  of the temple on the Temple Mount is not possible. I don't know how it would happen. You don't [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=642.2s)]
*  know how it would happen, but I know that it could happen. That's all I know. And a [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=647.2s)]
*  step in that process, a step in every process, is the recognition that facts and activities [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=659.2s)]
*  on the ground truly matter. And that's why going and visiting Judea and Samaria, understanding [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=664.2s)]
*  that sovereignty, the very same sovereignty, is the only way to achieve that. And I think [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=669.2s)]
*  that's why I'm standing here today, understanding that sovereignty, the very sovereignty of [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=674.2s)]
*  Israeli soil, Israeli cities, locations, is a critical next step to showing the world [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=679.2s)]
*  that this is the land for Jews and the land of Israel. And I believe, as was mentioned, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=684.2s)]
*  he said, you need to, what was mentioned is you need to buy the ticket. Don't just wish [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=689.2s)]
*  for 40 years to win the lottery, buy the ticket. I would submit to you, in light of the support [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=694.2s)]
*  you have in Washington, D.C., the support you have amongst patriotic Americans, amongst [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=700.2s)]
*  evangelical Christians, amongst believers, amongst Republicans, even amongst some Democrats [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=705.2s)]
*  who can barely say it anymore in Washington, buy the ticket, take your action, do what [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=710.2s)]
*  needs to be done here in Israel, because I truly believe this is a moment where America [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=717.2s)]
*  will have your back. You have Donald Trump in the White House, you have Mike Pence in [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=722.2s)]
*  the United States, you have Nikki Haley at the UN, you have true believers in Israel [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=726.2s)]
*  and America that have your back. Then there's Mike Waltz, a Republican politician he has [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=731.2s)]
*  picked as National Security Advisor. Let's have a listen. President Trump has been the [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=736.2s)]
*  best, the best president for Israel and for the Middle East in our lifetime. And let's [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=741.2s)]
*  take America back and let's take the world back. And let's take the world back. And let's [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=746.2s)]
*  take America back. And let's stand shoulder to shoulder with the greatest ally we've [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=751.2s)]
*  ever known, the state of Israel, as we fight evil all over the world. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=760.2s)]
*  Best president for Israel, Israel is the best ally the US has ever had and so on. Not much [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=765.2s)]
*  to subtlety here, is there? Then there's Steve Witkoff, a real estate advisor with [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=770.2s)]
*  no apparent foreign policy expertise, appointed as Trump's special envoy to the Middle East. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=774.2s)]
*  He has spent vast sums of money supporting pro-Israel causes and raising money specifically [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=778.2s)]
*  for the Israeli military. When Biden did the barest of minimum, pausing the shipment of [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=782.2s)]
*  2,000 pound bombs which have been used to slaughter so many Palestinian civilians, the [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=787.2s)]
*  New York Times reports Witkoff used that as a fundraising opportunity for Trump and has [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=791.2s)]
*  lauded Trump as the strongest and most vocal supporter of Israel in generations. Then there's [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=796.2s)]
*  Marco Rubio, US Republican Senator for Florida, portrayed as the most moderate of this lot, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=801.2s)]
*  who back in March was recorded being challenged over his opposition to a cease-fighting Gaza. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=806.2s)]
*  Well, that is the view, of course, that whatever war crimes Israel commits, then it's Hamas's [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=810.2s)]
*  fault, which gives Israel carte blanche to behave as it so wishes. He also there falsely [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=838.2s)]
*  claims that the number killed has been inflated when actually all the evidence points to it [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=843.2s)]
*  being much, much higher. The evidence is, I'm afraid, overwhelming. Trump's administration [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=847.2s)]
*  will be viciously pro-genocide. It will let Israel do exactly what it wants when it comes [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=851.2s)]
*  to the genocide being committed against the Palestinian people. Now some will go, well, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=855.2s)]
*  maybe people shouldn't have been so hard on Joe Biden and Kamala Harris when the alternative [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=860.2s)]
*  is so much worse. Let's be clear. That administration facilitated genocide and is still facilitating [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=863.2s)]
*  genocide. They're still in power. And Biden will go down in history accordingly as a monster. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=868.2s)]
*  It was under Biden that Gaza was wiped from the face of the earth and some of the most [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=874.2s)]
*  depraved and extreme crimes of our age were committed. What may well have happened is [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=878.2s)]
*  those crimes will continue. Sorry, what may well happen is those crimes may continue, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=881.2s)]
*  but without the occasional empty hand-wringing we saw before. But take the West Bank, which [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=885.2s)]
*  faces being formerly annexed and recognises such under Trump. The West Bank is already [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=888.2s)]
*  de facto annexed. The fact is, the US political establishment are all guilty. All of them [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=892.2s)]
*  must be held to account. There's no question that renewed horrors now face the Palestinian [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=897.2s)]
*  people and we must never go silent about that. By the way, if you're on Blue Sky, the social [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vu1TUvzTjM&t=901.2s)]
