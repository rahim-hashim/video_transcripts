# 'Biden Could END Gaza War With A Phone Call': Jeremy Scahill Exposes US and Israeli Claims
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [December 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE)
*  Hello, hello, hello. I am particularly delighted today to be joined by the incredible [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=0.0s)]
*  Jeremy Scarhill. Many of you will know his work. He is senior correspondent at The Intercept, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=4.32s)]
*  who have done fantastic work over the last few years. Particular initiatives, which maybe some [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=8.96s)]
*  of the media outlets haven't given sufficient time and resources to. And also the podcast, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=14.4s)]
*  Intercepted, which he also co-hosts. It's great to see you, Jeremy. How are you doing? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=21.2s)]
*  Thanks for having me back on. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=25.52s)]
*  Let's just begin actually at the moment with some of the propaganda that we're actually seeing in [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=27.12s)]
*  this hideous war, if war is the correct term. So we're seeing at the moment, we've seen how, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=32.64s)]
*  you know, images of prisoners stripped, detained, and then flaunted on, you know, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=41.2s)]
*  paraded on camera, which violates the Jemah Convention. And we've seen, you know, kind of [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=49.919999999999995s)]
*  very degrading kind of attempt to degrade or humiliate, some would say, the Palestinian [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=57.76s)]
*  population. I'm just interested in what you think Israel's tactic is in terms of what it's doing [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=62.08s)]
*  there. Well, Owen, let's remember that in the immediate aftermath of the Hamas raids into [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=66.56s)]
*  Israel on October 7th, Galant, the defense minister, who's a truly ghoulish character, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=73.84s)]
*  stated that we're not fighting human beings, we're fighting human animals. And this kicked off [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=81.36s)]
*  what has been a sustained campaign to dehumanize all Palestinians, all people of Gaza. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=87.92s)]
*  The president of Israel, Isaac Herzog, has stated that there are actually no civilians, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=95.2s)]
*  no innocent civilians in Gaza. I mean, I could spend an hour with you reading off what I think [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=101.6s)]
*  can just rightly be called genocidal comments by Israeli officials and lawmakers. You have also [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=107.19999999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu talking about the, you know, the children of the dark versus the children of the light and, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=113.83999999999999s)]
*  you know, invoking the story of Amalek and whatever. We can go on and on about this, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  but I'm bringing that up because from that mentality and that tone being set, what you're [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=123.28s)]
*  trying to do is groom your public to accept any crimes that you commit in pursuit of what you tell [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=130.24s)]
*  the public is your job. So according to the doctrine that Israel is refining and deploying [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=136.72s)]
*  now, they've done this for a long time, but we're seeing it in a very, very overt way right now, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=143.04000000000002s)]
*  there are no Palestinian children. There are only Hamas terrorists in training. There are no [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=147.12s)]
*  Palestinian hospitals. There are only command centers for Hamas, which by the way, was a complete [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=153.36s)]
*  farce. We can talk about that later if you want. There are no UN workers in Palestine. They're all [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  Hamas. There are no real journalists in Gaza. They're all Hamas. In fact, the prime ministers [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=165.84s)]
*  of Belgium and Spain and Ireland, they're also Hamas. The UN secretary general, he's Hamas. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=170.48s)]
*  So when you go to that extreme and everyone is Hamas and everyone is a human animal, then you have [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=175.6s)]
*  shows like the propaganda theater that Israel has been putting on where they round up what [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=183.35999999999999s)]
*  seem to be overwhelmingly civilians. In fact, by the IDF's own estimation, only 10 to 15% [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=190.0s)]
*  of the prisoners, the people that they have taken and stripped down to their underwear, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=196.96s)]
*  had any affiliation with Hamas. And they actually haven't even provided evidence that those 10 to 15 [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=201.28s)]
*  have true affiliations with Hamas. But one of the most grotesque episodes that took place was [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=206.16s)]
*  last week when video footage was put online, filmed by Israeli forces, of Palestinian men [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=211.92s)]
*  stripped down to their underwear and then ridiculously being forced to lay down rifles [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=220.39999999999998s)]
*  in front of the... It doesn't even make sense. What was going on there? Set aside the kind of [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=227.44s)]
*  questions. And then you can see in one clip, he has the rifle in his right hand. In the other clip, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=233.2s)]
*  he has the rifle in his left hand. It seems quite clear that this was a macabre Israeli production [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=237.52s)]
*  where Palestinians, many of whom now have been identified to be well-known civilians, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=244.24s)]
*  were forced to be actors in a propaganda film and they were forced to play Hamas terrorists, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=249.04000000000002s)]
*  in the words of Israel, for the consumption of the Israeli public. And the whole point of this [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=256.32s)]
*  was to reinforce the idea there are no civilians, these are human animals. And in fact, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=262.24s)]
*  the Geneva Conventions don't apply to them because they're animals. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=266.88s)]
*  I mean, the kind of brazenness of this. I mean, you mentioned, obviously, it's that kind of propaganda, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=271.36s)]
*  the degraded, the violations of the Geneva Convention when you parade [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=277.52s)]
*  people in front of the cameras in that humiliating kind of way. And I mean, if we take the rhetoric, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=280.88s)]
*  you mentioned Amalek when Benjamin Netanyahu spoke of a quote from the Bible where the Amalek [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=288.56s)]
*  nation attacked the Israelites and God commanded the Israelites to kill all men, women and children, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=295.44s)]
*  which repeated both to the population but also separately to soldiers. And then as another [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=299.04s)]
*  example, just as a brazenness, they blow up a school cheering, you can't blow up civilian [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=305.44s)]
*  structures according to international law unless you can claim this proportionality in terms of [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=310.32s)]
*  a military use. Obviously, if they went in and covered it in explosives, that couldn't possibly [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=314.48s)]
*  be the case. I suppose what hangs this all together is they kind of behave as though they [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=319.36s)]
*  can get away with essentially anything. And they're right. I mean, isn't that part that's partly what [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  I'm trying to demonstrate here? Yeah. Well, I mean, look, let's remember one of the premier [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=330.48s)]
*  episodes of this propaganda war that now almost no one ever talks about. The American public, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=335.2s)]
*  the world public, the Israeli public was told that the most important hospital in Gaza, the Al-Shifa [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=340.56s)]
*  Hospital, which was built originally as a British military barracks, it then was [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=346.32s)]
*  converted into a hospital under both Egyptian and Israeli occupations of what is now Gaza. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=353.36s)]
*  In the 1980s, Israel built tunnels underneath it. It was designed, they built tunnels and underground [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=360.15999999999997s)]
*  operating room. It was designed by two Tel Aviv architects. In fact, oh, and in the late 1980s, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=365.36s)]
*  you know, Hamas was created in 1987. The Israelis were doing construction on Al-Shifa all through [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=370.71999999999997s)]
*  the 1980s. And in the late 1980s, according to the son of one of the main Israeli architects, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=375.44s)]
*  they actually hired Hamas as security guards to guard their construction projects so that it [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=380.16s)]
*  wouldn't be attacked. I say all of that because Israel knew because they built them that there [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=384.71999999999997s)]
*  were tunnels under the hospital. In fact, anyone who's covered Gaza for any length of time knows [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=390.24s)]
*  that there are hundreds of kilometers of tunnels underneath Gaza, by some estimates, 500 kilometers [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=394.56s)]
*  or more. And Israel seems to be now going to flood them with seawater, which is a whole other [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=399.92s)]
*  issue. But what I'm getting at here is Israel told the world and they produced this slick [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=406.24s)]
*  three-dimensional video where it's almost like out of a Bond villain movie that descends down [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=411.92s)]
*  from under Al-Shifa and shows us what amounts to a Hamas Pentagon. And they told us this is not just [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=417.36s)]
*  any command center. This is one of the central command centers of Hamas's operations. The entire [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=424.08000000000004s)]
*  thing was a lie. The entire thing was a fraud. They present a few dozen weapons total, some of [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=429.44s)]
*  which were stored behind an MRI machine, which makes no sense for anyone who understands the [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=435.44s)]
*  electromagnetic qualities of an MRI machine. But just set that aside for a moment. It was a lie [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=439.2s)]
*  that was also cosigned by the president of the United States and his senior advisors who said [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=446.32s)]
*  they had their own intelligence indicating this. We know that five days before that, Israel had [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=451.2s)]
*  actually found a major Hamas command and control center that was many kilometers northwest of there. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=456.64s)]
*  So why did they do that? They did it so that they could convince the world that there were actually [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=462.64s)]
*  no civilians. There are no civilian hospitals in Gaza and they've laid siege. In fact, as we speak [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=468.15999999999997s)]
*  now, they're laying siege to yet more hospitals and now they're starting to do it in the West Bank [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=473.44s)]
*  as well. So we as journalists or just as ordinary people watching this cannot participate in any way [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=477.76s)]
*  in disseminating Israeli propaganda. Nothing Israel says, and this is their own fault, should be [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=485.12s)]
*  believed without verification. Nothing. Not one single thing they say should ever be believed [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=490.16s)]
*  unless there is clear, concrete, independent evidence. And on that, I mean, you mentioned that [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=495.84000000000003s)]
*  video, the kind of Bonn-Sall video of Al-Shifa Hospital. And in that tweet, they specifically [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=501.76s)]
*  said that Al-Shifa Hospital is the commanding control center of Hamas. I mean, the facts, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=507.12s)]
*  do you find that astonishing that they were allowed to just show a few guns then walk away? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=515.44s)]
*  But let's also talk, wait, let's talk about tunnels though for a second, because the mere [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=520.4s)]
*  existence of tunnels is not a scandal. Why are there tunnels underneath Gaza? Well, there are [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=524.72s)]
*  tunnels underneath Gaza because Israel is regularly bombing Gaza. They're calling it, you know, mowing [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=530.32s)]
*  the lawn, mowing the grass, and they periodically do this. Whatever you think of Hamas, Hamas is the [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=535.2s)]
*  ruling party in Gaza. Whether you hate them, think they're terrorists, think they're freedom [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=542.08s)]
*  fighters, it doesn't matter. It's irrelevant. They control it. It makes perfect sense that they [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=547.0400000000001s)]
*  would operate under tunnels. They've been under siege. They've been under blockade. The tunnels [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=550.72s)]
*  are not just used for Hamas terrorism. They're used to smuggle in goods. Israel now has closed [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=554.4000000000001s)]
*  many of them down. They shut down the tunnels going into Egypt. But Israel has engaged in a [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=560.0s)]
*  relentless targeted assassination campaign against Hamas officials, including political Hamas officials [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=564.96s)]
*  that are not even part of the Hamas armed wing. So it's logical. It's not a scandal that they have [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=571.6s)]
*  tunnels. And even if there were some Hamas members, which I know that that's the case, that used [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=576.48s)]
*  Al-Shifa to meet with journalists or whatever, that we all know that. That doesn't justify [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=582.48s)]
*  laying siege to a hospital, shutting its electricity down and killing infants [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=588.5600000000001s)]
*  that are abandoned in a neonatal intensive care unit. I mean, there is no lie too obscene [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=594.64s)]
*  to justify the totally unjustifiable. And anyone's been to Sarajevo, I've been to Sarajevo, you do the [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=600.48s)]
*  tour Sarajevo, knows that that was a city under siege with extensive tunnels underneath. It's not [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=606.72s)]
*  actually unique to Gaza. You get besieged city, besieged areas. Israel is building tunnels under [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=611.9200000000001s)]
*  their hospitals right now. Oh, and I mean, there's been articles in the Israeli press about how [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=616.96s)]
*  they're building underground operating rooms. And it makes sense. They're getting hit by rockets. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=620.8000000000001s)]
*  They want to be able to have facilities where the most vulnerable people can be protected. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=624.5600000000001s)]
*  But Palestinians are never allowed context. Palestinians are not allowed any context whatsoever, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=629.52s)]
*  historically or right now, just never. Just just because I know you mentioned Amelette before [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=634.5600000000001s)]
*  this thing I just want to put by you. So I interviewed Raz Yal, who's the Israeli American [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=640.5600000000001s)]
*  academic in Holocaust studies for those who don't know. But without without getting again talking [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=646.96s)]
*  about genocide or not genocide, the point he did make is it's very rare for intent to be so [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=651.84s)]
*  so openly stated that you often get I mean, if you look, I don't know, the [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=658.4000000000001s)]
*  Slobodan Milosevic, for example, and the Balkans, or affiliated forces or Assad, there is often a [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=663.12s)]
*  attempt to cover up if you like, or employ some form of cynical subtlety about what they're doing [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=670.24s)]
*  and in an effort to deflect from very serious war crimes. But you mentioned human animals, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=677.6s)]
*  when we could go on, we'll reduce Gaza to a city of tents, there are 2 million Nazis in the West [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=682.24s)]
*  Bank, there are no innocents in Gaza. And this is quite, I would say, rare or unique in a conflict [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=688.0s)]
*  for a leadership. If you have a hypothetical war crime tribunal, you wouldn't need to go through [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=696.64s)]
*  secret Israeli files to work out what their intent was, you would just listen to the rhetoric [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=701.76s)]
*  of their own leaders. I mean, it is quite rare, isn't it? Having covered lots of conflicts [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=706.8s)]
*  to be so open in that kind of language. Yeah, I mean, Benjamin Netanyahu and many Israeli [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=710.48s)]
*  officials are using the language that typically you think of as cartoonish warlords from some [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=717.92s)]
*  weird Bruce Willis movie. I mean, that's, I mean, Yoni Galant, the defense minister, I mean, he [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=724.56s)]
*  literally is like some gangster warlord that Bruce Willis is sent to go hunt down somewhere. I mean, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=730.88s)]
*  they are talking in that explicit of a way. But also, Owen, I've been monitoring the telegram [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=736.56s)]
*  channels that are very popular in Israel right now, that are just, and many of them run by private [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=742.2399999999999s)]
*  individuals that have, some of them have north of 100,000 followers that are showing very graphic [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=748.4s)]
*  videos of Palestinians who have been killed having their bodies mutilated. And there sometimes are [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=754.7199999999999s)]
*  these pop music songs or even folk songs for little kids that are played over them. And we [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=762.7199999999999s)]
*  learned this week from Haaretz, an Israeli newspaper, one of the major papers in Israel, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=769.52s)]
*  that the Israeli Defense Forces Psychological Operations Division is covertly operating its [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=775.92s)]
*  own snuff video telegram channel. And I went through it, and it shows images of cars rolling [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=782.32s)]
*  over Palestinians' bodies and then rolling over them again, mocking Palestinians who are carrying [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=789.84s)]
*  their dead children into a hospital with the desperate hope that maybe they can still be [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=796.1600000000001s)]
*  saved. I mean, it's utterly sick. It's utterly depraved. And the whole, you know, on one level, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=801.2800000000001s)]
*  the images in some of the private channels are far more sadistic and sick than the channel that is [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=808.08s)]
*  already sadistic and sick that we understand is being run by the IDF. But why are they doing this? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=813.0400000000001s)]
*  Why would the IDF want to do it? This is aimed at their own public. This is aimed at whipping them up, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=817.6800000000001s)]
*  at making the thirst for blood unquenchable, dehumanizing. These aren't real people. These [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=823.44s)]
*  are animals. Over and over and over, I looked through hundreds of the images on it and was [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=831.0400000000001s)]
*  just thinking last night and in my insomnia, why would they do this? They're doing it because the [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=835.2s)]
*  first step of waging a war of annihilation is to convince your population that these aren't really [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=839.76s)]
*  human beings and therefore they're not really being, they're not people being killed. And that's [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=846.32s)]
*  what the point of this is. And you mentioned there that that telegram channel, 72 Virgin Censored, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=850.8000000000001s)]
*  run by the IDF, according to Harex with, you know, messages like we're burning their mother, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=855.6800000000001s)]
*  you wouldn't believe the video we got. Listen to the bones crunch. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=860.88s)]
*  Really sadistic stuff. One thing I just want to ask you about as well, a couple of things, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=864.48s)]
*  is Joe Biden. Now, I suppose this week, I think a term invented for what the administration is [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=867.92s)]
*  doing is called hand-wringing. Where all of a sudden they're going, oh, he's well, you're good. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=873.68s)]
*  It's a bit much, this, isn't it? Could you tone it down a little bit? I mean, what in terms of the [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=879.12s)]
*  role of the Biden administration, because obviously there's the question of arms and direct, obviously, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=884.88s)]
*  military weapons supplied by the United States are killing children in Gaza. And without those [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=891.12s)]
*  weapons, would this assault be possible? Just in terms of how important arms are. But in terms of [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=897.28s)]
*  political and diplomatic, how important has that been throughout? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=903.28s)]
*  Well, I mean, remember Joe Biden in, you know, in a sea of completely pro-Israel American political [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=907.4399999999999s)]
*  institutions and politicians, and this goes back decades, Joe Biden stands out as one of the most [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=913.92s)]
*  extreme backers of Israel. You know, he says he's Israel's best Catholic friend, that even though [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=918.8s)]
*  he's not Jewish, he's a Zionist, and you don't have to be Jewish to be a Zionist. If there wasn't a [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=923.92s)]
*  state of Israel, we would have to invent one to protect our interests in the Middle East, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=928.56s)]
*  all of that stuff. But also Biden has this long track record of defending Israel's worst atrocities. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=932.0s)]
*  He was the American politician who in 2010 defended the rating of a humanitarian ship trying to, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=938.4799999999999s)]
*  where they killed 10 people, 10 civilians, where they were trying to bring aid into [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=944.4s)]
*  blockaded Gaza. In 2021, he was supporting his great, great friend, Bibi, who he's been friends [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=947.68s)]
*  with for 30 years. So I think that we have to conclude, because of the undying support that [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=953.4399999999999s)]
*  Biden has given, particularly at this time, that things are unfolding exactly how he wants them [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=960.16s)]
*  to unfold. He could end this with one phone call. I truly believe that. So, but on a more granular [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=965.04s)]
*  political level, I think there's a split within the administration where you see the CIA Director, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=971.12s)]
*  William Burns, who is fluent in Arabic, has spent a lot of time in the region, and then Lloyd Austin, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=975.6s)]
*  the US Defense Secretary, who certainly knows war, both of them are deeply concerned that what [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=981.84s)]
*  Israel is doing is trying to pull the United States into an open war with Iran. And so you see the [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=987.36s)]
*  people that have actual military experience trying to stop this, not for humanitarian reasons, for [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=993.12s)]
*  geostrategic political reasons. And then on the other hand, you have Tony Blinken, who is a lifelong [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1000.64s)]
*  Zionist and has been the lead US official in pushing this war. He then is running around on [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1007.1999999999999s)]
*  a PR tour trying to convince the world that the Biden administration cares deeply about Palestinian [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1014.64s)]
*  civilians. And at the same time, they're talking out of that side of their mouth. On the other side [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1019.04s)]
*  of their mouth, we have the moment at the UN Security Council where the Deputy Ambassador Wood [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1023.6s)]
*  does his voting against, and puts his arm up like this, voting against the ceasefire, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1029.12s)]
*  making the United States a totally isolated rogue power when it comes to this issue. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1034.56s)]
*  Biden is concerned about his election. Biden is concerned that he may lose the state of Michigan [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1040.24s)]
*  because it has a large Arab American, large Muslim population. And I think that if it comes to pass [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1045.44s)]
*  that a nightmare occurs and we get Donald Trump, possibly from jail, winning the election, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1053.36s)]
*  it's not the fault of Arab Americans or others who say, I won't vote for Biden after what he's [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1058.8799999999999s)]
*  done in Israel. It's the fault of the Democratic Party for running Joe Biden. And it's the fault [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1063.9199999999998s)]
*  of Joe Biden for so gleefully supporting a war of annihilation against an overwhelmingly defenceless [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1068.56s)]
*  civilian young population. I do think it was just fascinating what you said there, that Biden could [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1075.12s)]
*  end this with one phone call. Yeah, people make fun of that. But that is the nature of American power. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1080.32s)]
*  And I think that what they initially set out to do was open the spigot, let it burn, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1087.0400000000002s)]
*  let Bibi destroy, get it out of his system, which on a human level is sociopathic. But I really think [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1093.92s)]
*  they felt like, okay, we're going to let Bibi burn Gaza to an extent, and then we'll tell them to tone [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1101.1200000000001s)]
*  it down. They're not toning it down. And this business about, well, we've made clear to the [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1106.0s)]
*  Israelis that we're deeply concerned. No, if you were concerned, you would have not vetoed the UN [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1111.12s)]
*  Security Council resolution. You wouldn't then secretly go behind the back of the democratic [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1116.1599999999999s)]
*  process in Congress and rush through 13,000 more tank rounds, part of a much larger package that [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1121.28s)]
*  the Biden administration is ramming through. Everything they're saying is it crumbles into a [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1126.32s)]
*  pool, a swirling pool of bloody hypocrisy when you see the action. The only thing that matters, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1132.0s)]
*  Owen, is the action. And the action is full political support, full military support, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1136.88s)]
*  and crucially promoting the lies of the Israeli military that have been used to continue massacring [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1142.0s)]
*  civilians. Just finally, I did want to ask you about Hamas. And look, I watched the, you know, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1147.6000000000001s)]
*  some people may be aware that I watched the film of the IDF, of the horrific- Yeah, some people, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1155.0400000000002s)]
*  I saw some people, a few people commented on that. Oh, did you? You noticed that, did you? You noticed [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1159.5200000000002s)]
*  that? Yeah, I saw that. I also noticed that. But, you know, Hamas committed terrible atrocities on [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1163.36s)]
*  7th of October. People shouldn't be under any illusion of that, as I made clear repeatedly in [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1170.0s)]
*  that video, which apparently my critics didn't seem to listen to. But these were series from [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1174.32s)]
*  grave war crimes. And, you know, a lot of people would look at that and go, whatever, you know, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1178.6399999999999s)]
*  the context of siege, of occupation, the longest belligerent occupation in history, the longest [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1184.32s)]
*  siege in history, and the horrors meted out to the Palestinian population. A lot of people, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1190.32s)]
*  one of the reasons they've stayed aloof from what's happened is they've gone, well, this is [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1195.6799999999998s)]
*  terrible what Israel are doing, but equally look how horrific Hamas are. And obviously the Biden [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1199.6799999999998s)]
*  administration and others have tapped into that. How do we understand that kind of, that violence, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1205.36s)]
*  what happened on 7th of October in a kind of, in a broader context? Yeah, I mean, I think that any [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1210.24s)]
*  honest explanation of it, I mean, I think, first of all, I think you're right. There were very clear [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1217.44s)]
*  war crimes committed. The perpetrators of that violence absolutely should be brought to justice. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1222.0800000000002s)]
*  It should be treated as the horrifying crime that it was. And that's the same way I viewed 9-11 as [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1228.16s)]
*  well. This is a law enforcement operation. These are criminals who have committed acts of [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1234.0800000000002s)]
*  terror and war crime against civilians. Now, not everything that happened on October 7th was a war [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1240.72s)]
*  crime. I think there are serious questions about whether or not Hamas had some legal justification [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1245.36s)]
*  to attack an Israeli military outpost, but the 845 civilians that we understand were killed. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1251.12s)]
*  And then the many dozens of civilian hostages that were taken. This is completely unacceptable. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1257.76s)]
*  It's illegal under international law. It constitutes a war crime. But that doesn't answer the question [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1263.1999999999998s)]
*  of why there's a group like Hamas or why this kind of an action could take place. And by the way, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1268.0s)]
*  I also think that we don't fully know which factions did what on October 7th. And I think [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1272.4s)]
*  that there are indications also that there were groups of people and other organizations like [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1279.68s)]
*  Palestinian Islamic Jihad that participated in those attacks. So, Hamas is being accused of the [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1285.44s)]
*  entire thing. And certainly they broke the concentration camp fence that led to the raids, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1290.4s)]
*  but it's important to know the actual facts on the ground. It's also important, I think, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1294.96s)]
*  for the Israeli public to understand how many people that day were killed by Israeli forces [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1298.88s)]
*  that responded. Was the Hannibal Directive initiated? I'm not a conspiracy theorist. I [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1303.1200000000001s)]
*  read the Israeli press. And clearly there are questions about how Israeli forces responded on [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1308.8000000000002s)]
*  that day. Setting all of that aside, why is there a Hamas? Well, there's two reasons. One, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1313.7600000000002s)]
*  which I think bears mentioning, is because of Benjamin Netanyahu and his like-minded people [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1319.3600000000001s)]
*  who said, it's much better to have a Hamas than a more moderate force because this is the best way [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1324.24s)]
*  to stop the achievement of a Palestinian state. The New York Times this week had a huge expose [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1329.36s)]
*  talking about how Benjamin Netanyahu was essentially the money facilitator for Hamas [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1333.6s)]

*  flowing. Netanyahu's caught talking to Likud party members about how anyone who wants to stop an [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1343.84s)]
*  independent Palestinian state needs to bolster Hamas. But that doesn't explain the whole thing. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1349.52s)]
*  Groups like Hamas rise and become popular because of the conditions imposed on the oppressed. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1354.8799999999999s)]
*  I don't think you can directly compare Hamas to the IRA or to the African National Congress, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1362.0s)]
*  but they fit within the same category of when you strip people of all legitimacy to a right to [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1366.72s)]
*  defend themselves, to fight for their self-determination, the people that take up [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1374.24s)]
*  arms start to become very popular. We cannot talk about Hamas. We cannot talk about October 7th [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1378.24s)]
*  without talking about the Israeli occupation and the direct support and indirect support that [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1384.64s)]
*  Netanyahu and his like-minded people have given to the rise of Hamas. Absolutely, these were war [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1390.48s)]
*  crimes when you're talking about the massacring of civilians. We should know the facts though and not [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1395.92s)]
*  use incendiary allegations like beheaded babies like Joe Biden did without knowing if it's true. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1401.1200000000001s)]
*  The issue there was Joe Biden knowingly put forward unverified information and claimed to [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1408.0s)]
*  have seen photos of something and he lied about that. So we need the facts. The Israeli victims [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1411.92s)]
*  of these attacks deserve to have a full public accounting for what they and their loved ones [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1417.04s)]
*  experienced. That's also true for the Palestinians who've been abducted, the children that have [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1422.56s)]
*  been put in military tribunals. Since 2019, 2,700 Israelis have been killed by Palestinians, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1427.44s)]
*  roughly. More than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed during that same period. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1434.64s)]
*  You can't talk about disintegrating or destroying a group like Hamas unless you're willing to talk [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1439.36s)]
*  about full liberation for the Palestinian people. And I know I'll get attacked for saying that, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1444.56s)]
*  but that's the truth. That is the truth. You will not have peace. You will not destroy the conditions [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1449.44s)]
*  that lead to armed resistance unless you treat Palestinians with the full dignity that all human [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1454.56s)]

*  Jeremy, that was a tour de force. I would have expected nothing less. So thank you. It was a [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYUlJVukhE&t=1475.68s)]
