# Israelâ€™s Occupation DESTROYED By World's Highest Court
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [July 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdfT54CTjsg)
*  Israel is an apartheid state. It is annexing the West Bank via an illegal occupation which it is
*  illegally using to steal and colonise land. Prior to 7th October 2023, as per international law,
*  Gaza was under Israeli occupation because Israel in practice exercised full control over it thanks to
*  the siege which itself is the longest siege in modern times. I'm not reading out my opinion here,
*  I'm just reading out to you the law. I'm reading out what the International Court of Justice, the
*  highest court on earth, has decreed to be international law. At the end of 2022,
*  the General Assembly of the UN voted to ask the ICJ to set out its position on the legality of
*  Israel's 57 year long occupation, the longest belligerent occupation of modern times. The
*  legal judgement is absolutely devastating with near unanimity from the judges involved in many
*  of the opinions. To be clear, this is an advisory opinion, so Israel's cheerleaders will jump on the
*  fact that this is not a legally binding ruling, but the point is, this reflects how the world's
*  top court understands international law. What it says here with the overwhelming approval of the
*  world's top judges should be understood as international law. Now, according to the ICJ,
*  Israel violates international law through its occupation of Palestinian land in multiple ways.
*  It diverts resources to settlers and Israeli citizens, defying the responsibility it has as
*  the occupier under international law to provide sufficient resources to the occupied population
*  and for the Palestinian people to have permanent sovereignty over their natural resources. It
*  finds Israel is breaking international law by expanding Israeli law into the occupied territories,
*  North East, East Jerusalem and the settlements of the West Bank. It finds Israel is depriving the
*  local Palestinian population of the means of subsistence and that's causing their unwilling
*  departure. This constitutes illegal, forcible transfer of people. Now, let's listen to the call
*  on the forcible transfer of the protected population. Turning next to the question of
*  the extension of Israeli law to the occupied Palestinian territory, the court called that under
*  Article 43 of the Hague regulations, the occupying power must in principle respect the law enforced
*  in the occupied territory unless absolutely prevented from doing so. In principle then,
*  the law of occupation does not breach the prohibition of forcible transfer and therefore
*  are not covered by the exception set out in the second paragraph of Article 49.
*  The court considers that Israel's policies and practices including its forcible evictions,
*  extensive house demolitions and restrictions on residence and movement often leave little
*  choice to members of the Palestinian population living in area C but to leave their area of residence.
*  The nature of Israel's acts including the fact that Israel frequently confiscates land
*  following the demolition of Palestinian property for reallocation to Israeli settlements
*  indicates that its measures are not temporary in character and therefore cannot be considered
*  as permissible evacuations under the Forzineva Convention. In the court view, Israel's policies
*  and practices are contrary to the prohibition of forcible transfer of the protected population
*  under Article 49 paragraph 1 of the Forzineva Convention.
*  The court notes that Israel's settlement programme leads to violence from settlers and given Israel's
*  systematic failure to either prevent or punish such violence as well as the excessive use of force
*  by the Israeli state against the Palestinians that there is a coercive environment which
*  Palestinians suffer from violating international law. Its settlements of the West Bank are maintained
*  established in violation of international law. It finds Israel guilty of annexation that is the
*  forcible acquisition by the occupying power of the territories that are occupied including intent to
*  exercise permanent control of the territory. It treats occupied East Jerusalem as its sovereign
*  capital and has created an inhospitable environment for Palestinians there treating them as foreigners.
*  Let's hear the court on the systematic discrimination suffered by the Palestinians
*  at the hands of the Israeli state. The court concludes from the evidence presented to it
*  and on the basis of its analysis that a broad array of legislation adopted and measures taken
*  by Israel in its capacity as an occupying power treat Palestinians differently on ground specified
*  by international law. The court knows that this differentiation of treatment cannot be justified
*  with reference to reasonable and objective criteria nor to a legitimate public aim.
*  Accordingly, the court is of the view that the regime of comprehensive restrictions
*  imposed by Israel on Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian territory
*  constitutes systematic discrimination based on inter-area race, religion or ethnic origin
*  in violation of article 2 paragraph 1 and 26 of the ICCPR, article 2 paragraph 2 of the
*  ICESCR and article 2 of CERN. Now this point about discrimination needs a word to describe it.
*  Let's listen further. A number of participants have argued that Israel's policies and practices
*  in the occupied Palestinian territory amount to segregation or apartheid
*  in breach of article 3 of CERN. Article 3 of CERN provides as follows, I quote,
*  states parties particularly condemn racial segregation and apartheid and undertake to
*  prevent, prohibit and eradicate all practices of this nature in territories under their jurisdiction.
*  This provision refers to two particularly severe forms of racial discrimination,
*  racial segregation and apartheid. The court observed that Israel's legislation
*  and measures impose and serve to maintain a near complete separation in the West Bank and
*  East Jerusalem between the settler and Palestinian communities. For this reason, the court considers
*  that Israel's legislation and measures constitute a breach of article 3 of CERN.
*  The court considers that Israeli legislation and measures constitute a breach of article 3 of the
*  International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. Article 3
*  specifically condemns, and I quote, racial segregation and apartheid and undertake to
*  prevent, prohibit and eradicate all practices of this nature in territories under their jurisdiction.
*  In other words, Israel is guilty of the crime of apartheid. It is an apartheid state.
*  That has of course already been found by the likes of Amnesty International,
*  Human Rights Watch, the Israeli human rights organization, Bezalem.
*  The court goes on to say that Israel is not entitled to sovereignty in any part of the
*  occupied Palestinian territories on account of its occupation, nor can security concerns override
*  the prohibition on acquisition of territory by force. Its presence in the occupied Palestinian
*  territories is unlawful, and it has a legal obligation to bring an end to the occupation
*  as rapidly as possible. It must cease all new settlement activities, repeal all laws
*  that create discrimination and measures aimed at modifying the demographics of the territory it
*  occupies, and it must offer full reparations including the returning of land, assets, cultural
*  property it has taken unlawfully, as well as evacuating all settlers and allowing the return
*  of the Palestinian people rightfully to where they belong. If that restitution is judged impossible,
*  then Israel must offer full compensation to those who have suffered damage.
*  These judgments had overwhelming support from judges. By 11-4, they ruled that Israel's presence
*  in the occupied territory was unlawful. The same number declared that it must end the occupation.
*  By 14-1, they found that settlers must be evacuated, and by the same number that reparations
*  must be made. Crucially too, the ICJ also found that the UN Security Council, its General Assembly,
*  and all states have an obligation not to recognise the occupation as legal, nor render aid or
*  assistance towards maintaining Israel's presence in the occupied territories. By 12-3, they found
*  all states have an obligation to not recognise the occupation as legal. Again, by the same number
*  international organisations must not recognise the occupation as legal, and the same number
*  that the UN General Assembly and Security Council must bring forward precise next steps to bring an
*  end to Israel's unlawful occupation of Palestine. In other words, it is a violation of international
*  law to assist this occupation. Our governments are directly facilitating an egregious violation
*  of the law in their behaviour. Let's listen to British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer,
*  who previously tried to wash his hands of making any judgments on what Israel is doing, because
*  it's not the role of politicians to adjudicate on international law.
*  As to whether each and every act is in accordance with the law, well that will have to be adjudicated
*  in due course. I think it's unwise for politicians to stand on stages like this, or to sit in
*  television studios and pronounce day by day which acts may or may not be in accordance with
*  international law. I think it's not the role of politicians.
*  Well, this man is a lawyer, a former human rights lawyer no less, who brought a case on behalf of
*  Croatia, the state of Croatia at the ICJ. So what's his excuse? He must accept what the court has
*  overwhelmingly concluded, an accident. Where is he? Where's his statement? Why is he not saying
*  anything? Why are journalists not asking him about it? It just goes to show, the media in Britain,
*  and in many other states, is fundamentally unserious. This is the sort of questions they
*  should be asking him on international issues. It's not the only thing they should be asking
*  about before people set up a false dichotomy, it's not either or. But clearly, what's going on in
*  Gaza, Israel, Palestine, is of immense global significance. British history has quite a lot
*  to do with it. I know we don't talk about history in those terms, we just pretend it didn't happen,
*  but it did, and the consequences are being felt today in heinous ways.
*  Now this must mean ending all arms sales to Israel, it means supporting the chief prosecutor
*  of the International Criminal Court's request for arrest warrants, it means imposing sanctions
*  on Israel. Now predictably Israeli politicians have denounced the ICJ's antisemitic. Their view
*  is anyone and everything which does not justify Israeli crimes is antisemitic. It's not just a
*  deranged, grotesque, it's also dangerous because it devalues the meaning of the word antisemitic
*  and antisemitism. When anti-Jewish hatred is real, and it's growing, it's a terrible evil which must
*  be fought. Another point, many prominent Labour politicians and liberal commentators
*  stye themselves as great believers in such liberal precepts as the rule of law, as respect for
*  international law. Many of them will damn, say, Russia on that count. Well that's easy to do,
*  isn't it? It's the easiest thing in the world to do. It requires no moral courage. Russia, after
*  all, is an official enemy, and there's a consensus here from the world of politics to media on the
*  behaviour of the Russian state. But when it comes to a Western ally, and indeed the complicity of
*  our own government in outrageous violations of international law, well, virtual silence. This
*  exposes these people for who and what they are. Hypocrites with no discernible moral compass.
*  Well those who champion the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement can say with full accuracy
*  that they are acting to protect international law. There are so many who have shown themselves
*  to be on the wrong side of history. Well, in my view, the verdict of history will be damning
*  indeed. Please leave your thoughts, please leave your comments, as ever. Always love reading
