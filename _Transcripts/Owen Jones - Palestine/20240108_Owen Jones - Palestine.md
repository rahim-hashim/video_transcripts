# Live From Gaza Palestinian Journalist Mansour Shouman Joins Me From Khan Younis
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loVjuyHkFZs)
*  Yes, yes you have you have done this right and from the first time
*  This is firstly what honor to have my first IG live with you
*  So I'm very honored. I'm your face. It's a
*  It's a very big moment
*  Very we thought you actually taught me how to do it just everyone's clear
*  I think I am I inherit this off my father and technically that you taught me how to do it. You taught me through it
*  So thank you for that gift already
*  No, and it's a pleasure. It's an honor to be here with you. Thank you. Thank you very much for having me on your platform and
*  Good evening. Good afternoon or good morning to your audience as well
*  Here from us from can you miss from NASA?
*  It's a huge honor
*  Many many of the people watching
*  Live and obviously people join later
*  We've got people I can see joining from Q8 Canada where you're obviously you're passing Canadian
*  I'll talk to people about that all over Europe all over the UK and elsewhere and
*  Firstly just tell everyone everyone knows a lot about you already. You've got a very big following
*  You've made a big impact on people with your journalism
*  And you're one of the current why call the lions of the world's press
*  Pack
*  The journalists of Gaza the eyes and ears to the great atrocity of our age, which is currently being committed
*  Risking your lives. So just tell us firstly a bit about your about you and your background
*  Thank you Owen
*  Appreciate what appreciate it
*  Honestly, we are not heroes. The real heroes are the men the women that are every day
*  Running their families from the morning to the night
*  They're the ones baking the bread trying to get food clean water caring for their children
*  Those who are injured those who are in long-term patient cares those who have lost their homes lost their loved ones
*  Those are the people that we are trying to get their stories
*  Through lives like this audiences around the world. We are just facilitations. Thank you very much
*  My name is monsoor shuman. I'm a Palestinian Canadian. I'm 39 years old
*  I'm married with five children the eldest is 16. The youngest is four. I
*  have an engineering degree and
*  MBA from Canadian universities. I lived in a dozen countries during my lifespan and
*  I'm I'm not a reporter by
*  career I became a
*  Reporter slash journalist
*  Volunteering for this around three months ago. I'm originally
*  working in consulting
*  I worked with the big four companies if you heard about
*  The PWC and the Deloitte and all that I worked in the public sector manufacturing distribution
*  I did a lot of
*  Commercial work, so that's my original line of work. I came to Gaza around two years ago
*  I'm originally from Jerusalem. My wife is originally from Gaza and
*  Gaza was for 16 years under siege
*  However, we decided to come to live in Gaza because we couldn't go to the West Bank due to a lot of
*  Especially in Jerusalem, so we decided to come and live in Gaza so that my family can be closer to people
*  That's their social norms closer back to our homeland
*  We wanted to try to see how it's going how you know how things were here and we had a great life here for two years
*  Yes, it was difficult. We only had electricity for eight hours
*  There was a lot of restrictions on the kinds of goods and services
*  There was a lot of restrictions on the kinds of goods and services that we can access here in Gaza
*  But you know things things things were things were good
*  however life did change for us on October the 7th and
*  Together with 2.3 million other Palestinians
*  We are now living in the biggest open-air prison in the world
*  Going through a very difficult
*  security
*  Situation there's a lot of
*  restriction
*  Aid is only trickling in like it's more of a PR stunt on the behalf of my opinion of the UN and the US and
*  Israelis we can go more into that
*  However, despite all of these challenges
*  Something that I can tell you for sure is that the morale here is high
*  People here feel that they're on the right side of history
*  They are fighting and striving for what is just and what is the right and
*  Seeing the support from the free world people like yourselves your audience and millions of others has definitely
*  Boosted the morale here. Thank you very much
*  Well, that's that's really good to hear and I'm glad you can see all the love the solidarity that you've been receiving
*  Over what must be an intolerably difficult period?
*  I know you said the other that the journalists aren't the heroes
*  But and of course, there are so many others in Gaza who are doing
*  Incredible work in the most impossible conditions
*  Not least medics as a healthcare system is deliberately targeted by Israeli forces itself a very grave war crime
*  But you are the eyes and ears of the world
*  To what is happening you're bearing witness and you are risking your lives. And so this is the biggest
*  killing of journalists in recorded history in any conflict and I just wanted to just just tell us about about
*  that danger that you face
*  Including of course talking. I mean what's such so many of us as well. They do the Al Jazeera and
*  Gaza correspondent first his family were were killed and his wife and many children his grandson
*  He went to work immediately afterwards
*  Then he was injured and his colleague killed he went to work immediately afterwards
*  And then his beloved son a fellow journalist of yours was killed
*  Tell us a bit about about him and what that shows that all that
*  Lost that many of us would struggle I think to even imagine how we'd cope with but he's still he's still so determined to
*  do that job
*  Definitely
*  Mr. Well, and I do or until well as we call it here
*  He's been our not only our friends and our mentors
*  But he's also been we've been neighbors for the last three months sitting in tents beside each other eating together
*  Socializing together
*  It's an honor to be
*  serving in this line of reporting together with him and
*  he always teaches us things not only through words but through acts and
*  as you rightly said
*  Even so he experiences the loss of his wife immediately
*  After that, he carries the mic proudly with honor trying to remember her her
*  her
*  You know her legacy and same thing with his son
*  His son passed away immediately at night he was on Al Jazeera covering the news
*  He
*  believes that it is a message to
*  the
*  Idea to the IOF that look regardless of what you try to do to us here
*  We will continue down this path
*  we will not stop and
*  if they believe that doing acts like this to journalists will
*  Lose them their morale or make a make us
*  Try to run away or whether
*  They are mistaken. I
*  Have the opportunity to leave Owen
*  I have a Canadian passport and my name has been approved by the Israelis to leave the Raffa border
*  However together with hundreds of others. We decided to stay here
*  It's a choice that we made and trust me if the Raffa border opens tomorrow
*  The Israelis think that thousands will leave Gaza
*  Thousands will leave Gaza. I tell them that millions from the around the world will come to us to help us
*  Not the other way around
*  So going back to the journalists over a hundred and eleven journalists have been killed since the start
*  many of them with their family members
*  being a journalist here even a volunteer journalist like myself or
*  someone who tries to be active on social media makes you an immediate target unfortunately and
*  Every day we express
*  We hear the news about someone who lost their family member or we lose a family we lose we call their family members
*  Journalists around us who we lose here every day
*  however, this only increases our determination to remember their blood that was spilled and to continue our
*  Journey to ensure that the outside world listens to what's happening here through images through our voice
*  Through our determination to the videos
*  Personally, like I said, I started only around 90 days ago
*  People from the media team called onto me and said monster
*  We heard that you lived in the West you can speak with good English and we have a lot of requests from international TV stations
*  Asking for people civilians to talk in English to explain to the world. What is really happening here in Gaza?
*  Especially because especially in the first week Owen if you remember the Zionist propaganda was very strong
*  Palestinians were called animals
*  rapists
*  Baby killers, you know, it was it was really bad, especially especially in the Western the world
*  so together with many others we tried to change that and
*  personally, I did over 85 different live interviews with international TV stations and I
*  Thought that I was doing a good job until someone told you monster you're missing out big time
*  I'm like why I'm going on Al Jazeera. I'm going on CNN BBC
*  I appeared six time with Fox News like he's like no
*  Social media is where it's at. I'm like, yeah, but isn't like Instagram and tick tock
*  Oh aren't these like just time wasters like I I thought people just do it for you know, like no
*  You have to go and check it out. So so I was wrong and
*  the reach
*  That the social media especially on snapchat Instagram tick tock even linked in Facebook
*  YouTube
*  threads
*  shorts reels
*  Not only doesn't give you access to a different audience the new generation those who actually change the game right now
*  But but the numbers are like
*  Mind-boggling so for example, we started a hashtag tick tock
*  Called I stand with Palestine a month and a half ago and within two days
*  It reached over 1 billion mentions just on tick tock alone
*  So this is to show you the power of social media and how you the listener the viewer the social media creator
*  The ones who like share comment you have changed the game
*  Before we used to rely on mainstream media who were controlled
*  by governments controlled by those who pay the
*  Their paycheck at the end of the day, but right now we have a lot of freedom through social media. Thanks to you and
*  Yeah, sorry again for the long response over back to you. No, no, no, no, the long responses are very very appreciated and
*  and
*  It's just so important given what you said
*  Genes are being deliberately times. I think it's very clear and it should be very clear that genus are be deliberately targeted that itself is a very grave
*  War crime so it's so important that we elevate the voices of people like yourself
*  Using social media and you're right. It is having a huge impact reaching
*  Huge numbers of people particularly younger generations who I think are more politicized about Palestine than than any generation previously
*  That's that in large part. Thanks to the work of people like yourself the humanitarian situation
*  So you mentioned this earlier the Israeli human rights organization Betzalem says 2.2 million people of Gaza are going hungry
*  And they say very clearly Israel is starving Gaza
*  they say it's not a byproduct of war but a direct result of Israel's declared policy which denies them food and
*  Gazans and then it goes through the attack on agriculture making it possible to grow food because of the the answer
*  So just want to just tell us about that because it's very clear
*  They're using hunger as a weapon of war a very grave war crime again
*  It's a violation the Geneva Conventions
*  But just tell us what what's the daily in terms of the challenge just being able to eat how much you're able to eat
*  The challenges in getting food water that kind of thing
*  Yes
*  Just to answer a lot of comments that came on my life
*  Yes, Owen is recording this and at the end of this live he will share with us all the recording
*  Instagram give us the option to share the recording. So just just just answer the question there. Yes
*  unfortunately
*  The Zionist regime is using food and water
*  electricity
*  communications
*  fuel
*  medication
*  access to borders as
*  tools as they as they as they
*  Commit this
*  21st century genocide against the Palestinian people and they openly say that and mentioned that and it's part of their agenda
*  Especially the their elected politicians their right-wing elected politicians and for many of us. It's like this is illogical
*  I mean why why why would they do this and why would they proudly you know talk about this?
*  Talk about this
*  And that's why one of the things I would like to request or suggest your fellow listeners is to learn more about what Zionism
*  Is because once they understand what Zionism is what's that ideology?
*  Hello
*  Sorry about that. Okay. Don't wait. I was just saying I'm impressed. You've got the reception you have at all
*  So yeah, so the government so not not not not hospital is relying now on fuel
*  to ensure that there is enough electricity running and
*  that
*  Through this electricity, you know, we have our routers working etc. And because this is like a media station
*  So all the different TV channels are connected through our Internet routers
*  sometimes the electrical generators here in the hospital stop working and
*  Sometimes there are technical difficulties and sometimes the Israelis just cut off
*  Internet from the service providers and this happened 11 times since the start of the war
*  So I I was I was at the first hearing that this is another cut which will go on for days
*  But thank you now we are back. Sorry. Where did I miss out?
*  What would you like me to continue that context of Zionism of needing to understand that historical context?
*  Yes, and the displacement I suppose of the Palestinian people the Mac the 1948 onwards that that
*  Context which is which is stripped away from much of the Western media coverage
*  Yes
*  Yes, I think it's extremely important that when we act Owen
*  We don't just act out of emotion out of the disturbing images we see on TV because one day
*  Especially the official media and TV stations might decide to change the subject, right?
*  We will focus now on something else. We need to address the Palestinian cause coming from a source of history credibility
*  Evidence right? So that's why I strongly advise to learn more about three different topics
*  One of them is Zionism because sometimes people claim all your aunt is really it means you're anti-jewish
*  It means that you're anti-semitic. Well, no, that's not the case at all. My best friends are Jewish
*  My my best manager ever was someone who was Jewish. My mentor was Jewish
*  I have friends who are Jewish colleagues who were Jewish
*  I have people that I grew up as a child in Jerusalem who were Jewish friends. It's not about Judaism
*  Please let's learn more about what Zionism is because a person who truly abides with Judaism and learns the Torah
*  Will understand that whatever ideology the Zionists are standing for is against Judaism is against the teaching of Judaism
*  So that's number one number two. Like you said learn more about the Palestinian Israeli history
*  It didn't just start on October the 7th
*  Learn more about what happened at the time of her exam how they came up deciding that okay
*  We need to create a state to bring Jews in from all around the world and they were thinking
*  Okay, which country do we need to send them to etc?
*  And during those times Jews were persecuted in different countries around the world
*  Especially the in Europe and where were the Jews seeking refuge?
*  They were seeking refuge in North Africa in the Middle East in Arab and Muslim countries and this is noted historically, right?
*  That's why you have hundreds of thousands of Jews still living in the Middle East still living in North Africa still living in Iran, right?
*  so they
*  Please take the time to learn more about what happened in 1948 1967
*  My ancestors my wife's ancestors 95% of people in Gaza are refugees
*  Gaza isn't their original home and there are tens of millions of Palestinians around the world
*  Who shouldn't be living where they are right now?
*  But they've been forced out of their homes and displaced due to the atrocities committed by the Zionist
*  Forces in the last decade in the last century
*  The third thing I would suggest is to learn more about Islam because learning more about Islam
*  Will enable the people to understand more the mentality of the majority of the population here in Gaza
*  How come they are remaining steadfast despite going through over 90 days of?
*  hardship of
*  challenges of things that are beyond the imagination of what we stand for as human beings
*  So I invite the audience to learn more about these three things and because it will help us move forward
*  from from a stance of
*  Historical facts and credibility and understanding of what is happening here on the ground
*  Um as well, I mean I'll keep asking obviously about kind of why the political questions and it's just you mentioned obviously the hospital the
*  Generator there and I just want to ask about the medical
*  System such as it remains because we know now that there are no operational
*  hospitals up in northern Gaza northern Gaza 70 percent or so of
*  Buildings up now with houses estimated to be damaged or destroyed absolutely ruinous
*  But most of the remaining hospitals in the south are obviously in a catastrophic position
*  many doctors nurses and patients have been
*  Massacred and again very grave war crimes
*  So just wondering in terms of just that
*  Given how many people are being injured? It's not just people being injured as people with underlying health conditions
*  It's pregnant women
*  So you just tell us a bit about that and the impact that's having on on people who are obviously very seriously ill and injured
*  First as you rightly said the medical system in the north is is completely out of service
*  They are trying to restart operations in a shifa hospital, but they are now operating like a small clinic
*  So all the cases have been shifted to the hospitals in the middle region and the south the middle region is called
*  They're in bala. The main hospital there is an Aqsa martyrs hospital
*  Maybe in the news now you are hearing that there is a lot of
*  Iof strikes around the hospital there. So now they are going through a very rough time
*  I am here in the south in master hospital and there is another hospital called the European Hospital
*  These are the three major hospitals now working here and most of the cases that have come to us from the north
*  Have come to to these three hospitals
*  They have created over 250 tents
*  Around the hospital inside the hospital space to accommodate the influx of patients that have come from the outside
*  There are several units here that care for patients with diabetes
*  the patients that need kidney dialysis
*  patients that need
*  Amputations patients that lost their eyesight patients that now have disabilities. They cannot walk
*  These are cases that need immediate attention and referrals to the outside of Gaza
*  but every day only a very limited number of people are allowed to go through and
*  This comes after a lot of effort and approvals that have to come from the Egyptians from the Israelis from the UN and
*  From the receiving medical entity whether it's in Egypt in Jordan in the Middle East, etc
*  We need as soon as possible here field hospitals and they are ready. They are available
*  They are behind the borders with different NGOs who have contacted that and say most so we are there
*  We are ready to come in and help with our staff with all of our equipment or medications
*  However, we are still stuck behind the borders. So you are right. We need to use hospitals. We need medications
*  We need the resources we need staff the staff here
*  Many of them are working 24 7 many are working without having been paid
*  Many have are working despite losing their family members losing their houses, right?
*  These are the heroes behind the scenes one of them is my brother-in-law to give you an example
*  He's heading the operations in the middle area in there in Bella. We're not some art. Here's dr. Ayman harm
*  he is caring for all the operations that require bone surgeon and
*  we speak regularly and
*  We share the knowledge of what happens between both areas and it is nothing less than atrocious
*  Hospitals are operating at over
*  250 percent capacity
*  Cases of people are just lying on the floor in the emergency units
*  They are lying on the stairs. If you go inside the hospitals, you will see people lying on the stairs lying in the waiting rooms
*  it's
*  it's it's like
*  The problem is that someone like me unfortunately got used to seeing this
*  But when you talk about it and we try to explain what is happening to the outside world
*  It's difficult it's difficult
*  Despite all of that own I repeat what I said earlier and I repeat what uncle was said
*  We will remain steadfast our moral will not be diminishing
*  It is we are actually even putting more effort into trying to get the word out more right to help in all ways
*  We can and we feel your support when we see everyone and we love them and we thank them for what they are doing
*  And
*  I think that message is so important that people hear it that people aren't just yelling into the void by
*  Acting on what you're saying people are making a difference people need to continue doing that and in terms of the
*  obviously occupying Israeli forces and
*  I mean to be honest Israeli forces are using tiptoe often to flaunt war crimes and you can see that in terms of
*  Just the very acts for example of parading people stripped
*  Virtually naked in front of cameras is that's a violation of the convention let alone anything else
*  there's one video today of them forcing a group of men including children to chance denouncing Hamas and
*  Just completely humiliating and degrading treatment, but they also ideas
*  You know of them going around blowing up civilian homes and laughing about it on tik-tok going through people's prized possessions
*  stealing them
*  sleeping in the beds of
*  children who may well be dead because of
*  their bombs in their bullets and also reports of torture of detainees and
*  Field executions so can you tell us what you know about what's actually happening in terms of Israeli forces and those sorts of reports
*  They are failing miserably on the ground Owens and
*  They are taking out their failures on the ground
*  a
*  militant versus militant to militant versus civilian
*  That is that is the explanation of what is happening because there is no logical explanation, right?
*  Why would you humiliate old men civilians children women and do that to them, right?
*  They have failed miserably on the ground
*  They have thousands of casualties and once the Israeli people know the reality of what has happened to their soldiers
*  Over the last three months once they learn about the Hannibal Doctrine being applied all of October the seventh to their own settlers
*  around Gaza
*  To the people who are partying at that party by the Apache helicopters by the tanks
*  Once they learn about the casualties which hit their own hostages here in Gaza, right?
*  They will know how much of a criminal their government is not only to the people of Gaza or the Palestinian people
*  But even to their own even to the Israelis their own they don't care they have a right-wing
*  Agenda they have a certain ideology they are following
*  They believe that we are at the end of times and that they have to spill blood
*  in order to ensure that whatever they believe in has to come into fruition, so
*  We do not know. I have a lot of cases of people not knowing the whereabouts of some of their loved ones who are in the
*  They've been taken into the bear sub desert in
*  Concentration camps some have been killed and sent their bodies back. Some are still there
*  Many have been injured and and they have been brought here to Nasser Hospital to
*  to get
*  To get treatment some of them successfully left Gaza to be treated outside
*  However, despite all of that Owen the surprising thing is that over 600,000 still remain steadfast in the north
*  right
*  You are talking about people who went through over 90 days of hunger over 90 days of
*  Of of of killing either through ground through air strikes through strikes from the sea
*  They've saw they've seen death. However, they still decided to remain dead
*  They still decided to remain there even with the Israelis claiming that there are open pathways open routes for them to go to the south
*  This is mind-boggling
*  mind-boggling, especially when you know that the Israeli government is offering over 1 million sheikin or
*  270,000 US dollars or 200,000 British pounds per
*  individual to go back to the settlements around Gaza and
*  No one is taking that offer even with a house even with a car on the other hand
*  Palestinians are willing to stay on their land free of charge
*  willing to pay with their own life that
*  That that price because they know that this is their land
*  They know that they are the ones that are right on the other hand. You have half a million Israelis who left
*  Israel not willing to come back. They've bought a one-way ticket, right because
*  They can I think foresee that their civilization their country. They've already lost right?
*  They have already are already collapsing from within look at how openly now there are disagreements among their own elected cabinet members
*  within their own war committee between the different Israeli generals and the politicians between their own public and
*  by the way, all the Israelis are
*  Armed with pistols with clashing of course with war with machine guns. It's part of their ideology and
*  If they differ in opinion and they decide to open fire with each other. It's game over is a man
*  so I
*  Hope that people who are still seen who want?
*  the future of the Israeli people
*  Come into light
*  See that they have to put an end to the madness that is being done by the right-wing governments by Benjamin
*  Netanyahu strike avoid presentment a
*  Permanent ceasefire will happen. The question is who from them will enable it to happen
*  We are calling for immediate permanent ceasefire immediate of open borders
*  immediate humanitarian aid to enter especially reaching our brothers and sisters in the north and
*  They need to understand that we are not going anywhere
*  We will not allow what happened in 1948 and 1967 happen again. We will not allow for a third knock that will happen
*  But
*  Before I ask there's a couple of finer things I want to ask because we're so privileged to have just the time
*  you're spending as it is and I mean it just just you mentioned hostages we
*  We know that three hostages who were waving a white flag Israeli
*  Hostages were shot dead by Israeli forces a few weeks ago and many people said at the time if they're cheating dead
*  Israeli hostages waving white flags one of Palestinian
*  Civilians and we saw today footage which was released by Middle East
*  I which showed a group of Palestinian civilians led by woman holding the hand of her kid or waving white flags and Israeli soldiers shot
*  Dead the mother in front in front of a child in front of over there, but that point
*  Ask about about
*  About another Macba obviously the great catastrophe in 1948 when 750,000 Palestinians were violently driven
*  From their homes and it's clear from the statements of many Israeli politicians that they intend to make Gaza
*  inhospitable and then
*  Force the people of Gaza to leave and they've already you know
*  The reports of the negotiating various countries in Africa and elsewhere in order to make that happen
*  I'm just winning, you know, how sure what what is your sense of that?
*  Actually is a brave real menace that after a while however strong people may feel
*  Israel will make life so impossible and so intolerable that they will force people those who would survive out from their own land
*  Yes, that's their plan very openly from the beginning they try to persuade Egypt and Jordan Lebanon and Syria
*  to take
*  refugees however, everyone said no now and then they try to talk to some of the
*  Aging countries around the world in the Western world and like Canada Australia
*  Germany those who need a new workforce need need a new generation of taxpayers
*  But it seems that they are also getting refused from there for example, Canada said we can only take 1000
*  You know has since and this is after a long process so they are trying to find like solutions through
*  African nations who are very generous and and we love them to death
*  But it's not about
*  It's about it's about that. This is our land like
*  we are not leaving and
*  Our actions are speaking louder than our words. Like I said earlier
*  Despite the very bad situation on the ground you have over
*  600,000 still remaining in the city and in the north they have the option to go south
*  They have the option to go to the middle region
*  however, they decided to stay there and
*  Yes, who withdrew from the north the Israeli forces announced three days ago that they did not
*  Accomplish any of their military
*  Targets in the north in Gaza City. They didn't dismantle the edgeward group
*  they didn't free any of their hostages through military and
*  Still rockets are being fired from the northern refugee camps, which they said they cleansed around five weeks ago
*  So even within the Israeli media they are making fun of their military and their politicians saying that what are you guys doing?
*  The people are still there we're still getting attacks from there and you withdrew all of your military operations. What did we achieve?
*  What did we achieve? They achieved nothing and today the IDF announced that it was their worst day of war ever in
*  Their battle here in the middle region and the south throughout the day we can hear sounds of RPGs
*  TPGs
*  Kalashnikov tanks firing air strikes all around it was it was it was
*  It's basically in the middle of a war zone here and they announced that this is the worst day for them in terms of cash
*  Which is so I think that the Palestinians will continue to strive for what is right. I do not think that
*  they will succeed in
*  in
*  Convincing other countries because the other countries will tell them no we like
*  The world the world
*  Recognizes that who is strong the way the world is
*  It has been designed right now when it comes to politics and economics, right?
*  It doesn't give you a right if you if you have the right it gives you
*  The right if you show that you are strong if you show that you are steadfast and I believe that
*  countries from all around the world will now join South Africa and
*  You will see that countries who are now pro-israeli will now be more neutral
*  Because they see where things are going they see that Israel is losing they already lost the media war
*  They already lost the war of winning the hearts and minds of the regular Joe. They already lost the war on the grounds here
*  They are losing their own people. So I think that
*  Governments from around the world politicians from around the world will now say look
*  We'll now say look we need to support the Palestinian people and
*  Supporting the Palestinian people is not by giving them another country to go to because they do not want this
*  They are fighting for the right right it is by convincing
*  Now through different means those superpowers who are now siding with Israel that look
*  stop
*  Stop giving this life support
*  Unconditionally to Israel let's revise our plans and let's listen to our people's because they see that
*  What's happening is not only wrong
*  But they're also now being seen as supporting the side that is losing and this is what the Israelis fear most
*  Just just my final question just both legates and space in terms of what happens next and what people can do
*  Because we know South Africa are taking Israel to the International Court of Justice
*  They filed the claim of genocide against Israel is I've read the document. I've done a video about the document is
*  one of the most devastating
*  Documents I've read in my entire life. It's extremely serious loyally hundreds of footnotes evidence
*  They've taken this very seriously obviously South Africa former victim of apartheid itself
*  So it's clear why they've taken the lead there so I'm interested in your thoughts on that but I suppose finally just
*  Kind of for the sake of everyone watching or listening
*  So many people all around the world as you say are
*  Desperate to do anything anything they can they're watching every day people like yourself reporting on these horrors
*  They're seeing the atrocities being committed and they know in Western countries that their own governments are ensuring that this can continue
*  Those governments are backing Israel that arming Israel
*  Without the support of those governments Israel would simply not be able to continue this horror
*  So I'm just interested South Africa has taken leadership. That is something it's very important
*  And so you thought some back, but what you think people and the rest of us can be doing right now
*  100% the people here in Palestine are supporting what South Africa did and
*  Despite
*  Having second thoughts about the way the legal system is running around the world
*  we still believe this is a step in the right direction and that
*  Together with ensuring that the Palestinians remaining steadfast here on the Gaza together with this court case and together
*  With some of the actions I'm going to mention to you now. I believe that we are on the right path
*  I believe that there is light at the end of this tunnel and I believe that
*  Similar to the women giving labor in the paternity ward beside me. Yes, we are going through challenges
*  However, the result the outcome is a beautiful baby
*  The result the outcome is a free Palestine and a domino effect that will take place to anyone who wants freedom
*  from those
*  ridiculous man-made
*  Political social and economic system that has that has done a lot of unjust to people around the world
*  So number the first thing you can do is
*  Boycotting
*  Continue your boycotting efforts to those
*  Zionist corporations to corporations that are openly supporting the Zionist agenda
*  You have seen what you did to Starbucks. You have seen what you did to McDonald's
*  These things take time don't think that you will see the effect overnight
*  These companies release their results quarterly semi-annually annually, right?
*  Trust me when this CEO sees that his bonus his paycheck is going to get affected
*  They will put pressure on the politicians in their countries to put a stop to supporting Israel with an open paycheck
*  Like they're doing right now. So trust the process
*  Continue boycotting in a strategic manner
*  Follow the different trends see who the companies are and continue the boycotting. That's number one number two
*  You guys are already doing it social media
*  Don't stop telling the truth. We are not saying we are not making propaganda. We are telling the truth about what's happening here
*  Continue to create content on different platforms
*  Just liking sharing commenting don't be little any of these activities like uncle uncle
*  Well said pebble by pebble, you know these small pebbles
*  They don't create a big difference but millions of pebbles together they create a solid mountain
*  So don't stop doing the work you are doing on social media. So number one boycotting number two social media number three
*  Demonstrating on the ground don't underestimate these public demonstrations that are happening in the millions in cities all around the world
*  with people from different perspectives or some different norms or people with different religious or
*  Clean backgrounds get together talk to each other. Let the world see what you are talking about
*  You don't know how many people who are neutral have now been convinced because of what they have seen
*  You don't know how many politicians have been swayed because of what they are seeing
*  They are afraid to lose their actual electoral vote and you don't know how much it boosts the morale of the people here
*  Everyone here has a smartphone and whatever they have access to the social media
*  The first thing they see is wow, look at the people around the world supporting us in different languages different skin colors
*  Different time zones they would never have thought this will happen and this gives us a big boost
*  That's what is happening here is now not only about Palestinians, but it's a global movement
*  So don't stop demonstrating
*  number four
*  continue to lobby or politicians
*  Different countries have different ways and maybe in the UK or when you can tell us a little bit more about how people can act
*  There in the US there's an app called five call apps. There are different ways that people can reach the different MPs
*  They're different
*  Elected officials right make sure that you have your voice listened
*  Make sure they understand that
*  They should line up with the truth with what you believe in and that you elected them
*  You are the ones that put them in position of power so they need to represent you so make sure that you love your politicians
*  Number five donate but wisely, you know right now unfortunately, I
*  Don't like to talk about this, but it's a reality. There are a lot of online scams right now happening
*  There are a lot of people taking them
*  Trying to use this way in order to enrich themselves in illegal manners, right?
*  People think it's saying that all we are in the last etc or
*  Organizations even the proclaiming to help but actually don't have any kind of help on the ground here
*  So do your homework?
*  Donate wisely connect with organizations who you are sure have work here on the ground
*  Speak to Palestinians that you trust your colleagues at work your friends your neighbors
*  People with people with family members here in Gaza ask them
*  What is the best way to ensure that a breach of the sphere immediately because this aid is needed now not later
*  Number six
*  Continue education and learning we talked about learning more about Zionism
*  Palestinian Israeli history and Islam because again, we want to act from facts not for the emotions
*  Finally make the intention of visiting us here in Russia
*  This war will end soon
*  Borders will open soon and we are looking forward to seeing all the different volunteers from around the world like yourselves
*  Coming and joining us here
*  Come and enjoy the Mediterranean weather come enjoy the the Palestinian hospitality
*  try to enjoy different kinds of foods and
*  Hopefully together we will rebuild us this one inshallah back to you
*  Thank you so much
*  You're your wonderful communicator and I think everyone listening to this
*  I think you've had a really I've been reading some of the comments a really profound impact on and I think that was such a
*  Rousing but practical way to end this just to add
*  I did an interview with Omar Barghouti who is the co-founder of boycott divestment sanctions those who don't know a Palestinian activist and
*  That's my youtube channel. I'll also be sharing a clip of that on Instagram as well
*  But he talks about boycott divestment sanctions very much modeled on the anti-apartheid
*  Movement which was instrumental in ending apartheid you had struggle from within South Africa
*  You had an international struggle as well. And also in that spirit I interviewed the former
*  ANC a member of parliament Andrew Feinstein is a Jewish South African and his
*  parents is so his family they were Holocaust survivors and he just
*  Spoke about the struggle against apartheid and why he says Palestine is a great moral issue of our time and making that connection
*  Because with apartheid it looked
*  Invincible until it wasn't and I do think there are lessons there, but just finding my soul. Honestly, it's such an honor
*  And we are I think all of us just in complete awe
*  Of the work that you're doing and I know how humble you are
*  And but the pressure you're under is something which I think many of us would would struggle to really imagine
*  But the fact you kept your moral clarity your your your determination to speak truth
*  And if you can do it in the circumstances you're in then we have a responsibility in far more infinitely more privileged
*  Circumstances where we don't face the threat of death and injury just by telling the truth
*  So if you can do that, then the least we can do is to do the same and to keep elevating your voices
*  And to keep elevating your voices, so i'll be sharing this video up on youtube it'll be shared on instagram
*  I know lots of people always most people always watch after the live, but you know, hello to everyone
*  But this will be on youtube it'll be on the podcast. I'll click it as well for for twitter
*  So hello to all the different audiences. Um, but man, so honestly, well, you know, i'll be checking up you
*  On your instagram your content every single day. Make sure you're following him if you're not already following him spread his content
*  Keep sharing his content and the content of other brilliant courageous palestinian journalists who are the eyes and ears bearing witness to one of the great crimes
*  Of our age and that history will I think well I know
*  Will give the these the brave lions that are the journalists of of gaza
*  They will be celebrated just as much as those who are responsible for this grave crime will be damned. So again, man
