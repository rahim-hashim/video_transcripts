# The Palestinian Brit Taking On Starmer Ally Wes Streeting
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [June 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY)
*  You know what? This is really fascinating. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=0.0s)]
*  We are in Ilford North. That is East East London. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=1.8s)]
*  This is a Labour seat. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=4.4s)]
*  The local MP is actually the Shadow Health Secretary, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=5.68s)]
*  Wes Streeting, the kind of arch-player, right? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=7.88s)]
*  But Leanne Mohammed is a British Palestinian, just 23, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=10.4s)]
*  and she's standing in an independent campaign [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=14.32s)]
*  and she's trying to give Wes Streeting a run for his money. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=17.32s)]
*  Does she have a chance? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=20.32s)]
*  This should just be in the bag for the Labour Party. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=21.76s)]
*  The Conservatives came second last time [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=23.76s)]
*  and I think we all know what's happened to the Tories. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=26.2s)]
*  They are in total meltdown at the moment. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=28.119999999999997s)]
*  So it should just be a massive landslide here [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=30.479999999999997s)]
*  for the local Labour Party. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=32.6s)]
*  But will it be? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=34.12s)]
*  Is Leanne Mohammed's grassroots campaign, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=36.2s)]
*  is it cutting through on issues of course like Gaza, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=38.72s)]
*  nationally Labour, back to Israel's onslaught, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=41.96s)]
*  Kirstama at the very beginning, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=44.04s)]
*  back to Israel's right to commit war crimes? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=45.72s)]
*  How much is that an issue? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=48.0s)]
*  Is it just about Gaza or is it about other issues as well? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=49.32s)]
*  Could this be an upset? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=52.68s)]
*  And what does it say about politics, disillusionment, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=54.48s)]
*  and what happens next in Britain? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=59.239999999999995s)]
*  We've got a lot to find out. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=60.76s)]
*  We're going to go out knocking on doors with Leanne Mohammed. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=61.64s)]
*  We're going to get the general vibe. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=64.24s)]
*  Let's see what we find. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=66.08s)]
*  It's just another election, if I'm honest. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=71.24s)]
*  Not that excited. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=73.47999999999999s)]
*  Just hoping, you know, whoever gets in [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=75.47999999999999s)]
*  will actually be genuinely caring about other people. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=77.8s)]
*  What do you think of Kirstama? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=80.16s)]
*  She ain't bad. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=82.28s)]
*  Leanne is good as me. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=83.24s)]
*  What do you think you'll vote for? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=85.72s)]
*  Well, probably an independent candidate. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=86.91999999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's the thing, because most Labour voters [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  just don't know really what the Labour Party stands for again. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=95.64s)]
*  How did I vote last time? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=99.28s)]
*  I actually don't think I voted last time in all honesty, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=100.44s)]
*  but I'm definitely going to be voting this time around. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=102.72s)]
*  I feel like people connect better with somebody [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  that they see, they can engage with, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=106.72s)]
*  and you know, they see around and stuff like that. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=109.39999999999999s)]
*  If you don't see somebody around, then it kind of feels distant. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=112.0s)]
*  You're not really going to feel connected to that [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=114.88s)]
*  or relate to that or want to vote for that person. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=117.28s)]
*  So, yeah, you know what I'm saying? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=118.96s)]
*  So, yeah, Leanne gets my vote, really. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=121.96s)]
*  So tell me about yourself. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=137.32s)]
*  Tell me how you grew up in Cambridgildford. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=138.35999999999999s)]
*  What was that for you as an experience? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=139.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so Ilford is my entire life. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=141.84s)]
*  I went to primary school here. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=143.48s)]
*  I went to high school here, sixth form. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=144.72s)]
*  I was a local youth worker, literally, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=146.64s)]
*  in the youth centre down the road for a number of years. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=148.48s)]
*  I was a volunteer at my local food bank [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=151.16s)]
*  and volunteer at my local library as well. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=153.48s)]
*  I come from a Palestinian background. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=156.04s)]
*  And, you know, Ilford is where my parents found home. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=158.0s)]
*  And it just means so much to have such a wonderful community. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=161.95999999999998s)]
*  And it would be a real honour for me to be able to represent it. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=164.64s)]
*  How would you feel if you were woken every morning [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=167.56s)]
*  by bombs and not birds? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=170.84s)]
*  How would you feel if you didn't even feel safe in your own home? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=173.2s)]
*  How would you feel if you witnessed your own family die in front of you? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=177.84s)]
*  Our freedom is incomplete without the freedom of the Palestinians. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=182.56s)]
*  So let's together all say, free Palestine. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=187.16s)]
*  I was 15 years old, did a speech titled, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=193.44s)]
*  and it won first place in Red Bridge. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=196.44s)]
*  The video went viral. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=198.35999999999999s)]
*  Embarrassingly, you can still see it online. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=199.48s)]
*  But unfortunately, I was subjected to an avalanche [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=202.12s)]
*  of online abuse of comments and videos, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=204.83999999999997s)]
*  calling me a 15-year-old suicide bomber, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=207.16s)]
*  an evil anti-Semitic KKK Nazi schoolgirl. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=210.0s)]
*  And this was just the tip of the iceberg. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=212.83999999999997s)]
*  But I had so much support from people that I didn't know. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=214.39999999999998s)]
*  And with Pay Income's learning, with the support of my family, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=217.2s)]
*  my friends, you know, I was determined not to fall. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=219.67999999999998s)]
*  They were not going to win. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=222.35999999999999s)]
*  And it's proved it helped me to be heard as far and beyond [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=223.32s)]
*  as I could imagine. And I continued. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=225.2s)]
*  Ever since I was 15 years old, I said that nobody would ever [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=227.04s)]
*  silence me and I will continue to shout louder about the plights [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=229.44s)]
*  of my people. And that's exactly what I've done ever since then. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=232.0s)]
*  I've continued. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  I don't actually vote. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=247.95999999999998s)]
*  I voted years ago and I was really disappointed with the outcome. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=249.16s)]
*  So when I saw the YouTube video of Leah, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=254.20000000000002s)]
*  I thought this time I'm going to make an effort and vote for her. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=257.04s)]
*  So this is the first time you've ever voted in any election? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=260.72s)]
*  It'll be the second time. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=263.72s)]
*  Second time? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=265.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=266.2s)]
*  Wow. What was the other time? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=267.2s)]
*  When Margaret Thatcher was in and I wanted her out. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=268.8s)]
*  We get that a lot, by the way. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=271.32s)]
*  A lot of people, for the first time ever, are voting for me. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=272.84000000000003s)]
*  Who've never voted before. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=275.72s)]
*  I've seen her video walking along here [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=277.12s)]
*  and into the school down the bottom. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=280.0s)]
*  There's a centre. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=282.32s)]
*  Hello. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=283.32s)]
*  Hello. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=284.32s)]
*  Say hello. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=285.32s)]
*  Hello. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=286.32s)]
*  I'm literally horrified of what's going on. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=287.32s)]
*  And I was just saying to my son, I said, I can't believe that the whole world [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=290.35999999999996s)]
*  is just sat there and not doing anything. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=294.03999999999996s)]
*  In Kirstama, I expected a lot more from him, basically. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=296.35999999999996s)]
*  As a human being, we can't watch these atrocities being done to children. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=301.67999999999995s)]
*  I mean, I've got grandchildren and my heart goes out to those people. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=306.47999999999996s)]
*  So, yeah, that's why I'm going to vote for her. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=312.59999999999997s)]
*  I used to support Conservative, Labour, you know... [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=315.76s)]
*  Oh, has he voted Conservative before as well? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=319.52s)]
*  I have, in the past, yeah, I'm not going to lie. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=321.2s)]
*  Because it was good for business, you know, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=324.11999999999995s)]
*  and I came from a business background. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=325.88s)]
*  Why not Labour? Why not West Street? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=328.23999999999995s)]
*  Because he said no electricity and no water for people, human beings. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=330.91999999999996s)]
*  So, Kirstama's interview about the Labour leader. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=335.55999999999995s)]
*  I think that was awful, was it LBC? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=338.03999999999996s)]
*  So, when he said Israel had the right to cut off water and energy to... [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=340.48s)]
*  It's not a human right, lawyer. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=344.0s)]
*  A siege is appropriate, cutting off power, cutting off water. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=345.76s)]
*  I think that Israel does have that right. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=349.4s)]
*  It is an ongoing situation. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=353.48s)]
*  Obviously, everything should be done within international law, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=356.64s)]
*  but I don't want to step away from the sort of core principles [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=360.36s)]
*  that Israel has a right to defend herself. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=365.52s)]
*  As a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, why would you say something like that? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=367.68s)]
*  He has no excuse because he knows what the law is. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=371.4s)]
*  Exactly. You can't pick and choose who has a right to live and who doesn't. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=373.28s)]
*  And it's completely wrong, the words that he used. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=379.24s)]
*  And I do believe that, you know, I mean, I'm born and brought up in this country. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=383.52s)]
*  I was very proud of my country, but the words that he used, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=389.0s)]
*  I feel ashamed of myself, you know? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=394.24s)]
*  I don't feel like... I feel ashamed of Britain. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=396.64000000000004s)]
*  Why are we not doing something to stop this? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=400.04s)]
*  We've been voting Labour for generations. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=402.48s)]
*  It's kind of been a thing within the family. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=404.8s)]
*  Father did, but the other family members do. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=408.56s)]
*  However, this time round, it's very different. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=411.84000000000003s)]
*  We've moved away, not just myself, the family and friends have moved away [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=414.04s)]
*  from voting Labour, but really feel strongly about the humanitarian rights [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=418.68s)]
*  of the Palestinian people and feel like we've been let down [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=424.36s)]
*  by Labour and the other parties in power and feel that, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=430.92s)]
*  you know, we'll try and make that difference and make our voices heard. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=434.44s)]
*  Just on that road, guys. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=439.88s)]
*  Yeah. So, guys, we'll start on this road. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=441.92s)]
*  Perfect. The last election, was you just able to vote? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=444.6s)]
*  Yeah. So how did you vote? Labour. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=448.0s)]
*  If voters were key in the West Street, what would be your answer to them? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=450.48s)]
*  Yeah, I just tell them, what has he done for you? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=454.64s)]
*  I mean, this is someone who refused to vote for a ceasefire. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=456.71999999999997s)]
*  And we've now seen over 15,000 Palestinian children killed, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=460.08s)]
*  19,000 children orphaned. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=463.44s)]
*  If someone like that can't vote for peace, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=465.44s)]
*  then why would you want that person anywhere near power? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=467.6s)]
*  Why would he... What would he do for you here? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=469.92s)]
*  I just... You know, for me, it's not just about Gaza as well. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=473.24s)]
*  It's about the NHS. It's about privatisation as well. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=475.56s)]
*  I mean, West Street will be the... He will be the health secretary [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=478.24s)]
*  if he wins in this race. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=481.20000000000005s)]
*  The NHS is Labour's proudest achievement. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=483.8s)]
*  And he says he's going to bring down the waiting lists, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=486.48s)]
*  put the NHS back on its feet after the Tories destroyed it. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=489.04s)]
*  What would you say to that? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=495.04s)]
*  Well, I would say that, you know, he's openly said that he'll open the doors [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=496.64000000000004s)]
*  to more NHS privatisation, and that is not the solution to protecting our NHS. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=500.04s)]
*  People are worried. And I speak to doctors here in Ilford North. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=504.52000000000004s)]
*  I have a health policy analyst team that are helping me on my policies here. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=506.92s)]
*  On the NHS. And the NHS is so important to me [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=510.76s)]
*  because my family work in the NHS as well. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=512.84s)]
*  And so West Street's plans for the NHS are something that worries us all. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=515.3199999999999s)]
*  To have this person as our health secretary is something that we definitely don't want. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=519.12s)]
*  And that's what I'm hearing on the doorstep. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=523.28s)]
*  People want this person out of power. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=524.76s)]
*  People are counting on me all around the country to save our NHS right now. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=526.08s)]
*  No pressure. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=529.08s)]
*  It's not just Gaza. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=541.0s)]
*  I've been living in this area for 22 years. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=542.36s)]
*  My local services are going downhill. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=544.64s)]
*  We had the Tories for 10 years. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=547.12s)]
*  We had Labour for another 10 years. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=549.0s)]
*  There's been absolutely no improvement. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=550.64s)]
*  Not only there's not been an improvement, we're literally going down in every dimension. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=552.36s)]
*  And we're talking about long waits for doctors. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=556.76s)]
*  The NHS is awful. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=559.16s)]
*  Crime has gone right up. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=560.76s)]
*  The litter, antisocial behaviour, you name it. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=562.16s)]
*  Every single problem you can think of, we've got it in this area. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=565.12s)]
*  No one seems to be addressing it. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=567.76s)]
*  My gut feeling is that West Streeting is managing the situation rather than actually fighting for us. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=569.8s)]
*  But then when the Gaza thing happened, it was just outrageous. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=575.3199999999999s)]
*  Absolutely outrageous. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=578.96s)]
*  I mean, I'm Jewish and I've been living here for 22 years. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=580.16s)]
*  And I was just shocked, horrified and absolutely frustrated at Labour's response. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=583.68s)]
*  What made you so particularly horrified, including maybe what West Streeting said or done? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=589.92s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=594.04s)]
*  I mean, obviously what Starmers said to start with. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=595.04s)]
*  But then we've been protesting outside West Streeting's office. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=597.08s)]
*  He never bothered to come out. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=600.4000000000001s)]
*  And if he did, we obviously would have asked him to clarify how he really thought about things. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=602.4000000000001s)]
*  But we did catch him a couple of times and he said, well, you know, we'll call for a ceasefire at the right time. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=607.76s)]
*  There's women, children, babies, elderly, men being murdered. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=614.12s)]
*  And we'll call for a ceasefire at the right time. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=618.24s)]
*  I mean, what is it that they couldn't see that we're seeing? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=620.48s)]
*  I mean, it's shocking to me. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=623.6800000000001s)]
*  So I'm sorry to say they've obviously got an agenda and we don't want to be part of that agenda. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=625.2s)]
*  We want to take control. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=630.12s)]
*  It's West Streeting's seat. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=631.72s)]
*  And I'm just very worried about what his plans are. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=633.5600000000001s)]
*  To me, it feels like PFI all over again. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=636.96s)]
*  Private Finance Initiative. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=639.96s)]
*  Yeah, Private Finance Initiative. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=641.0s)]
*  And I think and I'm also very upset at the way people have been treated within the Labour Party. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=643.2800000000001s)]
*  And I think I don't know if Leanne will win. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=653.52s)]
*  I really hope she does win. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=656.12s)]
*  But I hope that she gives West Streeting a run for his money. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=657.4s)]
*  And I hope that they realise that they really can't treat the progressive part of their party like this and expect us just to just do nothing about it. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=660.72s)]
*  I just feel independent candidates in this election are going to be really critical because they're going to be I think they're going to be an outsized voice if they win. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=671.28s)]
*  And I think they're going to hold the government to account probably more than any backbench MPs are going to be able to do. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=680.24s)]
*  I mean, particularly because they stripped out all the independent voices within the Labour Party. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=686.84s)]
*  You're now left not just with a party that's going to have a landslide, but also a party that's going to have very one dimensional thinking. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=692.08s)]
*  So I think having other voices is going to be really critical. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=699.2s)]
*  One of the challenges you have as an independent is parties have big machines and they have they can mobilise people, including from all over the country. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=702.8s)]
*  So, I mean, how are you how are you fighting back against that? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=710.84s)]
*  Because that is a massive advantage for any established party. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=714.12s)]
*  It makes independence lies very difficult when they stand. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=717.12s)]
*  Correct. Parties have big machines, but we have people. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=719.32s)]
*  And my campaign is a people powered movement. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=722.0400000000001s)]
*  It's a simple grassroots campaign. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=724.08s)]
*  And you know what? I have even more canvases than West Streeting. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=725.8000000000001s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=728.24s)]
*  Correct. It is. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=728.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, look, I tell my volunteers all the time that, guys, we can actually walk the streets of Ilford with our heads held high because we stand on the right side of history. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=730.84s)]
*  We have morality and, you know, for them, they can't they can't do the same because I don't know why you supporting a kind of party that, you know, has abandoned us all. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=738.32s)]
*  Right. Labour has abandoned us. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=748.5200000000001s)]
*  So we are proud to be standing here. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=749.84s)]
*  We are people. My volunteers are proud to be a part of this campaign. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=752.96s)]
*  I think that's the difference here. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=755.4000000000001s)]
*  A lot of people go, look, as great as having independence is, there needs to be a national movement. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=757.0400000000001s)]
*  That parties are big machines. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=761.0s)]
*  And at the end of the day, it will be at the moment you get a Tory government or you get a Labour government. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=763.12s)]
*  But actually, there's a need for a new political party. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=768.12s)]
*  And obviously, there's the Greens that exist. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=772.0400000000001s)]
*  I don't know what relationship that would have with the Greens or if people just join the Greens and then that becomes people's homes. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=773.5600000000001s)]
*  What do you say about that? Because at the moment, otherwise, you kind of fragmented. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=778.6s)]
*  You've got you, you've got Pfizer, then you've got the Greens. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=780.84s)]
*  It's like a random hot pot. So what do we do about that? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=782.9200000000001s)]
*  We are fragmented now. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=784.9200000000001s)]
*  But I think this is the beginning of something even bigger, something that is a new kind of politics that we all want. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=786.08s)]
*  I think this is the beginning of that movement, right? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=791.8000000000001s)]
*  This independent movement. You've got independence standing all around the country. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=793.6s)]
*  And it's a new kind of genuine, honest, compassionate politics that we all want to see and be a part of. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=796.52s)]
*  And I think none of these parties offer that to us right now. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=801.8s)]
*  I think independent is the way forward. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=804.04s)]
*  You know what? I was impressed. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=817.16s)]
*  Independent campaigns are always up against formidable challenges because, you know, if you've got the Labour Party, machine, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=818.4s)]
*  behind you, you're West Streeting, you're on TV, you've got this big profile. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=826.2s)]
*  Those are really, really big advantages. But she's got cut through. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=830.5600000000001s)]
*  She's got a base of support here. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=833.5600000000001s)]
*  What will that mean on election day is difficult to know, but she's definitely going to turn out a lot of supporters. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=835.6400000000001s)]
*  And on and off camera, that included people obviously voted Labour all their lives for generations, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=840.72s)]
*  people who voted Conservative, people who've never voted before. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=845.5600000000001s)]
*  That is something, if I were West Streeting, that I would be anxious about. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=848.88s)]
*  I mean, in theory, you should walk it. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=851.5600000000001s)]
*  It should be a Labour landslide and it will be a Labour landslide nationally. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=853.1999999999999s)]
*  And that will hugely bolster his chances here. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=856.56s)]
*  But clearly he has problems. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=859.9599999999999s)]
*  And that is symbolic of what's happening all over the country, that the Labour electoral coalition is fragmenting. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=862.8s)]
*  Large chunks of it are not happy. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=870.36s)]
*  And I think what will be particularly interesting is what happens when they are in power, because disillusionment will kick in swiftly. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=872.92s)]
*  There won't be the whole, oh, you've got to support us because you've got to get the Tories out. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=879.04s)]
*  That will go and people will look for leaders. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=882.96s)]
*  And this extremely charismatic individual is just one of the leaders I think people will end up looking to. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=885.32s)]
*  So I think whatever happens here on election day, definitely Liam Mohammed, I think someone to watch. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjNfkur1gY&t=891.5600000000001s)]
