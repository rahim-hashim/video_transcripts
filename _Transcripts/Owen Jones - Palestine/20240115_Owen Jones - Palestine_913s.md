# Those Silent On Gaza Must Be Shamed
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhD7kWyYhhE)
*  Enough is enough is enough. It's time to play hardball with this because this is about life
*  and death on a colossal scale. Now my words here don't focus on those still actively cheering on
*  one of the great crimes of our age by which I mean Israel's massacre of Gaza through bombs,
*  bullets, starvation, thirst, disease and medical conditions left untreated because of the near
*  wholesale destruction of the healthcare system. Don't get me wrong, knowing everything we know now,
*  those people should be considered morally depraved beyond redemption. It is a damning
*  endowment of the societies in which we live that these people are not treated like pariahs,
*  exiled from public life and polite society. You cannot be a cheerleader for Vladimir Putin after
*  all and be deemed a respectable person in western society and understandably so. And yet far worse
*  crimes are being committed against the people of Gaza, not to belittle the horrors in Ukraine but
*  to emphasize the sheer horror against the Palestinians and yet not only are those
*  who cheer on this moral abomination not pariahs, they're still fetid, as respectable, as moderates.
*  They have deliberately tried to deflect from what should be regarded as their endless moral shame
*  by trying to portray those who oppose the mass slaughter of tens of thousands of innocent people
*  as the real dangerous hateful extremists. Those of us who have condemned both the war crimes and
*  atrocities of Hamas as well as the far greater war crimes and atrocities committed by the Israeli
*  state, the latter of course, armed and backed by our governments, a crucial point, we're treated
*  as moral disgraces even though the key difference between us and our critics is we have a consistent
*  record in condemning all war crimes and they don't. Know how they constantly harass that national
*  treasure, Gary Lineker, a liberal with a conscience, when he draws attention to the crimes committed
*  by the Israeli state suggesting he be driven from his job at the BBC as though it's those who oppose
*  mass murder who deserve to be exiled from public life rather than apologists for it. Many of them
*  have gone pretty silent, must be said, have you noticed that? Perhaps after a rough and recarbon
*  estimate here based on the amount of blood contained in the bodies of the average adult and the average
*  child, around 125 000 liters of Palestinian blood have been spilled, even these cheerleaders,
*  for this massacre feel some creeping shame. But alas, it's not these straightforward moral
*  disgraces that I'm focusing on here, it's those who remain silent except perhaps some occasional
*  bit of hand-wringing, something along the lines of oh sad, how sad, how tragic, what a cruel world in
*  which we live, behaving as though some truly unfortunate natural disaster has befallen those
*  poor souls of Gaza rather than the full might of a regional military superpower armed and backed
*  by a global superpower crashing down on the backs of a defenseless civilian population.
*  Perhaps they think that ultimately meaningless platitudes will shield them from the accusation
*  that they stayed silent while thousands of Palestinian children had their bodies ripped
*  apart or suffered hideously painful and prolonged deaths, their last tortured breaths exhaled from
*  their mangled and shattered little bodies under the rubble, all with the direct involvement of
*  our own governments. Well they should not be allowed to get away with it, most of them did
*  not hold back, note this, when it came to moral outrages, for the war crimes committed by the
*  Russian army in Ukraine, in that case they spoke with eloquence, passion, disgust, horror,
*  lied passionately, denounced and condemned those crimes too, repeatedly in fact. I did so under no
*  illusion that my condemnation would have any impact, I just felt it was the right thing to do. You see
*  Russia is not a western ally, it is a hostile state, its crimes are not backed by the west,
*  the west does not arm Russia, it does not offer aid or diplomatic and political cover for Russia,
*  every single mainstream newspaper in say the UK and other western countries has opposed and denounced
*  Russia's war crimes, nothing you say will have any impact on this at all, you are merely repeating
*  what an overwhelming consensus has already agreed on, what almost everyone with a major
*  public platform has already got covered. Why do I say this? It's not just that those who use
*  their public platforms to denounce Russia's war crimes have often acted as though they are somehow
*  sharing courage, somehow standing up to Putin, as though the Russian autocrat will somehow be
*  shaken by their fiery tweets in videos and podcasts, it's not just that if you speak out
*  about war crimes when there's a hostile state committing them, but not when a western ally is
*  committing them, then you don't really care about human rights at all, it's that you are choosing
*  to denounce war crimes when you have zero leverage over them and you're choosing not to denounce
*  those war crimes when you do have leverage over them. You see if you speak out about the war crimes
*  being committed by Israel then you can encourage public opinion to turn against those war crimes
*  and for the elector to put pressure on their governments to stop arming and backing Israel
*  and giving it a de facto blank check to slaughter innocent people with impunity,
*  the truth is that you know that if you speak out against Russian war crimes then you'll get nothing
*  but applause, pats on the back commended for your moral righteousness, but you know that if you
*  condemn Israel for its war crimes then you may well be attacked, aggressively so denounced your
*  public position even menaced. If you speak out against war crimes when you know there is no cost
*  but refuse to speak out against war crimes when there is a cost then there is a word in the English
*  language which has you bound to rights. You are a coward, a straightforward coward. Now it's extremely
*  obvious that there are various liberal commentators out there who have big audiences thanks to their
*  no-holds-barred denunciations of Brexit which they do nothing to stop and the Tories who face a
*  landslide defeat purely because the Tories have self-immolated not because of a single thing these
*  commentators have said or done despite the delusions perhaps of some of them and these
*  audiences may offer them a source of lucrative incomes and there's nothing to begrudge them
*  for that unless of course they choose not to speak out because they believe that audiences
*  may be divided over the question of Gaza and that taking a moral hit may mean taking a financial hit
*  and being denounced by those they consider their allies. What is more important to these people
*  stopping Palestinian toddlers having their body dismembered by western-supplied missiles or whether
*  they're making quite as much money as they'd like or getting some flak on Twitter? Please indulge us.
*  What does it take for you to speak out and demand with the full force of your platform
*  for this nauseating spectacle to finally end? It did not take 24,000 dead Palestinians killed
*  by the Israeli state with another 8,000 missing that is buried under the rubble and therefore
*  it must be said almost certainly all dead meaning around one in every 69 Palestinians in Gaza have
*  suffered violent deaths in a hundred days. Perhaps you try to assuage your conscience that this
*  death toll isn't really real, that all those disclaimers of according to the Hamas run health
*  authority assuage your conscience even though you must know by now that in previous conflicts that
*  final death toll has been validated by Israel and the United Nations, even though you must know by
*  now that independent aid agencies have repeatedly confirmed that figure as credible, even though you
*  must know by now that the health ministry released the names, personal details and Israel approved
*  IDs of all the dead when Joe Biden publicly questioned that death toll. You may not know that
*  a senior Biden official previously declared that the actual death toll was likely higher than
*  officially reported, it was after all to give you some credit under reported at the time, fine,
*  but you know now. The truth is because of those buried under the rubble yet to be identified and
*  some never will be after decomposition and the starving dogs of Gaza have set to work
*  and because of those dying from untreated diseases and underlying health conditions
*  or hunger or thirst that official death toll is likely to be a significant underestimate. Indeed
*  as one leading public health professor has pointed out on the current trajectory a quarter of Gaza's
*  population is set to die over the course of the next year from the collapse of the health care
*  system alone. Maybe you think the shadow cast by the atrocities committed by Hamas and other armed
*  groups on 7th of October means you can stay silent about the mass murder of the Palestinian
*  people and your moral integrity will somehow stay intact. The atrocities committed against
*  Israeli civilians were real, abominable, indefensible. You don't really believe in
*  collective punishment or do you? Do you think the crimes committed against Bosnian Serb civilians
*  justified the genocide committed by the Bosnian Serb army or the crimes committed by the Rwanda
*  Patriotic Front justified the Rwanda genocide? Probably not and you don't really think the
*  clock started on 7th of October did you? You almost certainly know that this horror goes back many
*  decades to the mass expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homes in
*  1948 accompanied by thousands of them being killed followed by another mass expulsion in 1967. You
*  certainly knew that their land was being stolen through illegal settlements in the West Bank
*  making the prospects of a viable independent Palestinian state all but impossible. You've
*  probably heard of numerous human rights organizations like Amnesty International or Human
*  Rights Watch or the Israeli human rights organization Bet Salaam finding Israel guilty of the crime
*  of apartheid. If you didn't know that thousands of Palestinians many of them children are
*  incarcerated by the Israeli military often without charge many of them children as I say would save
*  the children reporting that many of these children are physically and sexually abused well you know
*  now don't you? And you should listen to the courageous Israeli journalist Gidea Levy who
*  describes these prisoners as hostages just like the hostages Hamas so criminally took and furthermore
*  according to the UN's figures 96 percent of all deaths between 2008 and 6th of October 2023 were
*  Palestinian that is over 6,700 Palestinians including several children in Gaza in Israeli
*  airstrikes in May 2023 just four months before 7th of October. Maybe you didn't know that around
*  240 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank last year by Israeli forces and illegal settlers
*  before 7th of October but you do now and you know you know that if 240 Israelis dozens of them
*  children had been killed by Palestinian militants last year before October the 7th
*  you would not have pretended that there was a ceasefire in place. If you express rightly your
*  horror and disgust at the 36 Israeli children estimated to have been killed on the 7th of October
*  where's your horror and disgust at the over 12,000 Palestinian children now estimated to have been
*  killed by the Israeli state in Gaza in other words 343 times as many kids and every day that
*  number rises indeed nearly three and a half times as many Palestinian children are believed to be
*  suffering violent deaths every day since this horror began as those Israeli kids so criminally
*  killed on the 7th of October. One Israeli baby is believed to have been killed on the 7th of October
*  a hideous crime in its own right. How many Palestinian babies have been slaughtered since then?
*  Do you know? I don't but I do know that if over 12,000 Palestinian kids have been killed
*  then many of them will be toddlers and babies with their weak bodies more susceptible to being
*  ripped apart by bombs. If you condemn the 7th of October as an indiscriminate attack then where in
*  your language does that leave an onslaught against Gaza which has killed not just a much much higher
*  number of women and children but a much higher proportion and you must know that so many of the
*  Palestinian men being slaughtered are innocent by any definition doctors, aid workers, first responders,
*  journalists or just ordinary civilians. Perhaps you've convinced yourself that these deaths are
*  due to the use of human shields. Surely you must know that subjecting a strip of land no bigger
*  than east London to firepower equivalent to more than two Hiroshima bombs is inevitably going to
*  lead to a colossal loss of innocent life. That this is a bombing campaign with an intensity with
*  essentially no modern parallel. That human shields are no human shields if you drop 2,000 bombs 200
*  times in areas designated as safe zones you're going to kill a huge number of innocent people.
*  What does it take? Seriously what does it take for you to speak out? They cut off water, energy, food,
*  medical supplies, the basics of life. You didn't speak out. They repeatedly deprived hospitals of
*  energy and bombed and shelled them, massacring doctors, nurses, patients, leaving newborn babies
*  suffocating to death. You didn't speak out. They damaged or destroyed more than half the buildings
*  in Gaza. You didn't speak out. All those genocidal statements by Israeli ministers and politicians
*  and army officers justifying cutting off the essentials of life on the grounds of population
*  of human animals. Declaring an entire nation is responsible. Declaring there are no innocents or
*  uninvolved civilians or non-combatants in Gaza. Describing Palestinian civilians en masse as Nazis.
*  Declaring Israel will eliminate Gaza. Everything. Fabrily quoting a biblical passage which demands
*  the murder of all men women and children. Calling for Gaza to burn. Threatening to nuke it. Declaring
*  military focus is on damage not precision. Repeatedly calling for Gaza to be ethnically
*  cleansed. An unprecedented orgy of genocidal incitement intent from the very top downwards.
*  Not enough for you to demand this horror ends. You must see at least some of the horrors of Gaza in
*  your timeline. You are seeing them aren't you? Like one of the 10 Palestinian kids estimated to
*  be having one or both legs amputated every single day. Many without anesthetic. Like a girl I saw
*  today having a leg sawn off without that anesthetic on a kitchen table. Like all those bodies of
*  children. Or the children screaming for their dead parents and siblings. Or the mothers and
*  fathers screaming for their dead children. Or the numerous tweets declaring that a doctor or an
*  aid worker or a journalist has been killed alongside their entire family. Or those tweets
*  announcing an entire bloodline has been wiped from the face of the earth. Or the image of footage
*  or footage of of Palestinian civilians stripped to their underwear and humiliated some of them
*  children. Or a newborn baby that's lost an eye. Or reports of repeated massacres by bullets of
*  civilians. Or the Israeli soldiers gleefully posting their war crimes on TikTok rejoicing
*  as they blow up civilian homes and infrastructure singing there are no innocent civilians
*  and that Gaza will be cleansed and populated with Israeli settlers. You can probably guess what
*  they're doing off camera can't you? What do you feel when you see these crimes? Clearly the tip
*  of a hideous iceberg when you remain silent notwithstanding some occasional futile and
*  pointless handwringing. Ashamed? Guilty? Worried about how history will judge you? Well you should
*  be worried but the judgment of history is not enough. Those who remain silent as a crime of
*  historic proportion are being committed should be shamed in the here and now. Silence is complicity.
*  Those who don't speak out in the full knowledge of the terrible atrocities being committed with
*  the full involvement of wrestling governments should be publicly shamed into speaking out.
*  They may resort to crybullying and consider this to be harassment but to be honest I don't care.
*  I care that one of the greatest crimes of our age is being committed in full sight,
*  live streamed to our social media feeds on a daily basis and that those with power and influence are
*  making a choice not to use their platforms to encourage the people to speak out and end
*  this madness. So that's why the silent needs to be shamed. Not threatened. Shamed. There are no
*  excuses. None. Zero. And they should be called out. People's lives depend on it and we should not hold
*  back in saying so and that's why it's time to take on that silence. Please like and subscribe.
