# Israel's Peace Movement FIGHTS BACK
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s)
*  Hello, hello, hello. Welcome. I am so delighted today to be joined by Alan Lee Green. Alan Lee Green is a peace activist in Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=0.0s)]
*  He's the national coordinator of Stand Me Together, which brings together Israeli Jews and Palestinian citizens of Israel who are striving for peace. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=7.36s)]
*  And to say the least, they are in a very challenging position right now, given the horrors of the last few weeks. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=15.92s)]
*  So it's particularly, particularly grateful, I have to say, Alan Lee, to have your very, very courageous voice, and I mean, courageous in the most sincere possible way. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=22.84s)]
*  I just want to start, actually, in terms of for those of us like yourselves campaigning outside of Israel for a peaceful and just settlement, which ends a horror, which goes back many decades. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=31.68s)]
*  What things maybe that you think it's important to say, including what happened on the 7th of October? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=44.44s)]
*  I think it's important to remember that it showed in the clearest way possible that we are all victims of this reality, that what happened on the 7th of October was just a horrific event to many families in Israel, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=52.839999999999996s)]
*  families that some of them actually worked for peace for so many years, some of them working against occupation, being a very clear voice against it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=71.72s)]
*  And since then, we're in this state of a trauma, a state of collective shock. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  And it's been so difficult for so many of us to try and navigate the complexities and the moment after the 7th of October, talking as a peace activist and as a citizen in Israel that is working against the occupation and to bring Jews and Palestinian citizens of Israel to cooperate and to struggle for equality. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=88.11999999999999s)]
*  The space to do that has narrowed down dramatically since the 7th of October. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=113.08s)]
*  A lot of people that are not bad people, normal people, people that have voted for the left even in the last decade have been shattered by what Hamas did. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=120.28s)]
*  And a lot of people have lost hope. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=135.4s)]
*  And it's a very sad moment in our society. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=137.8s)]
*  Can I ask what sort of pressures you're currently under as peace activists, whether from, I guess, the states, but also from a public opinion which has shifted markedly in a very particular direction? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=141.56s)]
*  What are the sorts of pressures you're under? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=153.0s)]
*  So it starts with the legitimacy of our message right now. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=155.64000000000001s)]
*  There are a lot of people that think that it's even not legitimate to talk about peace at the moment, to talk about the Palestinian innocent lives that are being lost at the moment by the Israeli bombings. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=160.2s)]
*  It's not very easy to say that also in Gaza there are innocent children that are dying at the moment. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=175.07999999999998s)]
*  And you can get really attacked. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=184.44s)]
*  Not that I feel a victim. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=185.72s)]
*  I am part of my society. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=187.56s)]
*  I love my society. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=189.48000000000002s)]
*  And I'm a patriotic person of my interests and my society's interests. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=191.0s)]
*  But at the moment there are extremists in our society that are doing everything that they can to try and portray the entire Palestinian Arab citizen of Israel as traitors, as the enemy from within, as people that are siding with Hamas. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=197.88s)]
*  And that they are trying to create a new violent front. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=217.72s)]
*  They're doing it inside the Israeli society, but they're also doing it in the West Bank. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=221.32s)]
*  We need to remember that in the West Bank Hamas does not rule, but systematically the extreme right-wing organizations and the settlers are going from one Palestinian village to the other, armed with rifles, and they are trying to provoke violence. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=224.92s)]
*  Ten Palestinians lost their lives, were murdered by those extremists since the 7th of October. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=241.48s)]
*  And that's next to what the army is doing in the Palestinian villages and towns in the West Bank. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=248.6s)]
*  And I think in total a hundred Palestinians died in the West Bank and not in Gaza. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=254.76s)]
*  And when we see these attempts to create more violence, which we don't need at the moment, we need to understand that some of this violence is also directed against the opposition. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=259.24s)]
*  And we see the same voices right now in Israel. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=270.84s)]
*  And it also comes from the establishment, from the government, from the parliament members, from the police. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=273.23999999999995s)]
*  We see a lot of people from the Palestinian minority in Israel that would, I don't know, follow a page on Instagram, News from Palestine, for example. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=278.52s)]
*  And that will get someone to an investigation by the police or being fired from their workplaces or being kicked out of the universities. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=291.32s)]
*  We started a hotline in standing together in our movement to support citizens in Israel that are being chased politically because of who they are or what they think. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=300.20000000000005s)]
*  And we get hundreds of messages and calls a day from citizens that are just being witch hunted. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=309.32000000000005s)]
*  And that's the only way to describe it. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=316.84000000000003s)]
*  And I think it's a widening phenomenon right now. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=319.72s)]
*  And next to that phenomenon, we also see a lot of violence and brutal responses to things that are humane message at the moment. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=322.28s)]
*  And I want to say that I understand the anger. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=332.76s)]
*  I understand even the feelings of revenge. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=335.48s)]
*  It's a natural response. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=338.91999999999996s)]
*  But if we will act by our feelings of revenge or just by our feelings right now, it will not be a work plan. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=343.48s)]
*  It will be just something that will create more problems and more violence and more death. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=349.88s)]
*  And we don't need it right now. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=355.08s)]
*  I mean, here in Western Europe, it's difficult enough to say, obviously, to talk and acknowledge. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=357.32s)]
*  It's important to acknowledge the horrors committed on 7th October by Hamas. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=364.52s)]
*  It's difficult even here to say we have to look at a broader context that this didn't begin on the 7th of October. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=368.84s)]
*  You have to have contexts going back decades. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=375.96s)]
*  And that's not justification. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=378.2s)]
*  It's a precondition for understanding the situation we're in and how to have a lasting peace. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=379.88s)]
*  But that must be almost impossible at the moment to have that conversation in Israel. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=385.8s)]
*  Yes, it's a very challenging conversation to have. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=391.72s)]
*  But we are growing. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=395.32s)]
*  A lot more people are joining this message. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=397.8s)]
*  I think that the right wing in Israel is doing fantastic work showing how it is just discriminating [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=401.08s)]
*  and or actually not discriminating and saying that all the Arabs must die. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=410.52s)]
*  All the Arabs are terrorists and all the children in Gaza will grow up to be terrorists. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=414.91999999999996s)]
*  We see this message quite strongly from the right wing. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=420.44s)]
*  And I think it does push a lot of people to join just the humane camp in the Israeli society. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=423.4s)]
*  Our camp. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=430.76s)]
*  And I think it is challenging to have this discussion. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=431.56s)]
*  But it's also mandatory to have this discussion right now because it's a real discussion [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=436.03999999999996s)]
*  not only about humanity and morals. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=441.4s)]
*  It's a question and a discussion about strategy. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=443.4s)]
*  Will this war bring us security as Israelis? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=447.8s)]
*  Will it achieve a quiet life for us? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=451.32s)]
*  Will it achieve the end of all wars? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=454.68s)]
*  Or is it the 17th time in the last decade and a half that we're going to a war that [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=457.08s)]
*  our leaders promise us that this will be the last war but it's not. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=463.4s)]
*  And it does not achieve us any security. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=467.15999999999997s)]
*  I question even whether it will be possible to defeat Hamas or whether it will actually [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=469.4s)]
*  strengthen Hamas as Israel does for the last decade. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=474.59999999999997s)]
*  It is an open policy by our government to prefer and to threaten Hamas than to actually [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=479.47999999999996s)]
*  work with the Palestinian Authority and President Abbas. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=484.44s)]
*  And just to say something about the international discussion, I do think we need to acknowledge [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=489.16s)]
*  the fact that there is a society in Israel. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=495.56s)]
*  As any other society, we have our conflicts. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=498.84s)]
*  We have conflicts with our government. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=502.44s)]
*  We have interests. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=504.04s)]
*  We have fears. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=505.48s)]
*  We have hopes. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=506.68s)]
*  We are not all targets, legitimate targets that are, you know, I've seen a lot of people [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=508.68s)]
*  saying you're all settler-colonialists, which means that you are entitled to die. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=515.48s)]
*  Is that what they mean? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=522.12s)]
*  And I think we need to really address the toxicity of how terrible this message is [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=523.1600000000001s)]
*  towards people, towards women, towards children. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=529.48s)]
*  We are not all targets. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=533.0s)]
*  And it is not legitimate to target innocent people. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=535.08s)]
*  And what Hamas did is not a fight for freedom. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=538.84s)]
*  It's a massacre. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=543.0s)]
*  And indeed, I mean, parallels often are made with apartheid South Africa. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=544.7600000000001s)]
*  And what should not be forgotten about how apartheid ended was an emphasis on a so-called [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=549.4000000000001s)]
*  rainbow nation where all citizens, black, white, Jewish for that matter in South Africa, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=555.1600000000001s)]
*  people from Indian backgrounds, that they would be equal. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=561.88s)]
*  And whatever happens, I know the idea of, you know, whether it be a two-state solution [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=565.64s)]
*  or, you know, what a secular one-state solution, all of these seem very distant. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=569.96s)]
*  But that the point, whatever people think about how this, a just, peaceful settlement [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=574.76s)]
*  can be achieved, it has to be based, as you wrote very eloquently on Twitter, in the end, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=579.0s)]
*  millions of Jews and millions of Palestinians will stay here and live here on this land. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=584.36s)]
*  And they have for centuries and centuries. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=587.96s)]
*  Despite the dreams of the extremists, no one is going anywhere. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=590.68s)]
*  And if we understand that and who is just delusional, then the only way to survive is [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=592.92s)]
*  together in Israeli Palestine in peace. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=596.1999999999999s)]
*  This is the future. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=597.9599999999999s)]
*  It is the only choice we have that includes life. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=598.5999999999999s)]
*  That's what you said very eloquently. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=600.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=601.4799999999999s)]
*  And that's a real message that's the only message that can actually bring us life or [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=603.2399999999999s)]
*  hope right now, because some people are delusional in our society, thinking that they will be [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=609.64s)]
*  able to, or we should, kill two million people in Gaza or, you know, transfer those people [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=616.28s)]
*  and, you know, to relocate them somehow. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=623.64s)]
*  It's not going to happen. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=626.04s)]
*  And you can easily forget that there are Palestinians also in the West Bank, in East [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=627.4s)]
*  Jerusalem, in Israel, and in Gaza. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=631.72s)]
*  And there are millions of Palestinians and millions of Jews. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=633.9599999999999s)]
*  And if we will not be able to find a solution of ending the bloodshed, first of all, and [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=636.76s)]
*  it's before, you know, having an academic discussion whether a one secular state or [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=642.92s)]
*  two states is possible. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=647.24s)]
*  I personally support, you know, Socialist Federation of the Middle East. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=648.68s)]
*  I think that's the best idea of all those. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=652.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=655.24s)]
*  But the first thing, the first mission is to end the bloodshed and to understand how [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=655.88s)]
*  to come to terms of political will in both of our society. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=661.0799999999999s)]
*  But I'm an Israeli Jewish person and I need to create this political will within my society [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=667.24s)]
*  to end the occupation, to end the idea that we can control millions of people and to expect [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=672.6s)]
*  that there will not be violence. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=679.96s)]
*  No, it's a situation that creates violence. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=681.72s)]
*  And if we will not change this reality, we will continue to suffer, you know, death and [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=683.88s)]
*  destruction and, you know, a continuous cycle of blood. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=688.6800000000001s)]
*  Just a couple of final things. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=692.84s)]
*  I mean, you mentioned what's happening in the West Bank at the moment, which is, I have [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=693.8000000000001s)]
*  to say, largely been ignored, but huge numbers of Palestinian civilians have been killed [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=697.0s)]
*  by either Israeli settlers or by Israeli forces, as well as being driven from their homes and [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=701.88s)]
*  talk of, you know, leaflets saying they're going to be driven to Jordan unless they flee, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=708.36s)]
*  that kind of thing. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=712.6s)]
*  What's your fears as well? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=713.32s)]
*  Because, you know, Palestinian citizens of Israel make up about a fifth of Israeli society. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=714.28s)]
*  What's your fears there in terms of their plight? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=718.76s)]
*  So the most, like the strongest feeling you can feel right now from the Palestinian citizens [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=722.28s)]
*  in Israel, which are 20 percent of our society, is fear. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=731.8s)]
*  They're fearing to write something on Facebook or Instagram because they can lose their job. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=737.4s)]
*  They fear to say that they support peace because it's, you know, might be traitorous at the [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=742.8399999999999s)]
*  moment. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=750.12s)]
*  And you see that even the most common response in the last week, which is changing your profile [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=750.68s)]
*  picture into a black picture, just black, even that is being attacked. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=756.76s)]
*  And that's the minimum thing they did and also the maximum thing. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=761.08s)]
*  And it's being widely attacked as supporting Hamas, which is not. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=765.08s)]
*  It's just grieving for this moment. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=768.84s)]
*  And it's kind of impossible to be a Palestinian citizen in Israel right now because if you [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=771.8s)]
*  condemn, you're not condemning enough and you're not saying enough. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=776.04s)]
*  If you don't condemn, why don't you condemn? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=779.0s)]
*  If you say something, how can you side with terrorism? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=781.32s)]
*  It's impossible to drive this terrible existence at the moment. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=785.4000000000001s)]
*  And standing together is trying to be a safe haven for both Jewish citizens and Palestinian [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=791.5600000000001s)]
*  citizens trying to survive this moment together. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=797.88s)]
*  We have a hotline and we have solidarity watches all across the country, especially [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=801.48s)]
*  mixed cities. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=806.76s)]
*  And it's very, very dangerous at the moment because we're sitting on, I guess you would [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=808.12s)]
*  say, a barrel of explosives right now. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=813.2399999999999s)]
*  It's enough to have one spark to see also violence erupting in our own society, in our [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=816.04s)]
*  streets. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=822.92s)]
*  We've seen in in Netanya in the last weekend, hundreds like a mob of hundreds of people [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=823.88s)]
*  chanting death to all Arabs, trying to break into dorms of a college because 50 Arab students [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=829.64s)]
*  were hiding there. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=837.2399999999999s)]
*  And we acted quickly and we managed to prevent the violence there. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=839.0799999999999s)]
*  But it's so dangerous at the moment and we need to survive this war. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=843.7199999999999s)]
*  We need to survive this moment. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=848.92s)]
*  And if we will have more and more fronts, lots more of more people will die. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=850.4399999999999s)]
*  Valently, I mean, it's sobering stuff, but also you give us huge amounts of hope. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=855.24s)]
*  And, you know, the tradition in which you stand is a critical tradition. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=859.48s)]
*  As I always say, there wouldn't be a left in its modern form without the disproportionate [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=864.12s)]
*  contribution of Jewish fighters for justice like yourselves. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=867.64s)]
*  And that tradition lives on. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=872.12s)]
*  And the future, the future for Jews and Palestinians alike depends so much on your tradition, which [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=874.12s)]
*  is why I'm sobering. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=882.92s)]
*  I'm so proud to be able to speak to you today and you you're full of courage and determination. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=884.84s)]
*  And I hope everyone shares this video as widely as possible, listens very carefully to what [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=889.96s)]
*  you had to say. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=894.52s)]
*  So thank you so much, Alomni. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=895.16s)]
*  Really appreciate it. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=896.36s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=897.16s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=898.12s)]
*  Please like and subscribe and I'll speak to you all soon. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Fq6gGcd4s&t=898.52s)]
