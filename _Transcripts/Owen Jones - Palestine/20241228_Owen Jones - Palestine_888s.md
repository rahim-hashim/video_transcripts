# New York Times' Latest Gaza Shame
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [December 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c)
*  The role of the New York Times throughout Israel's genocide has been, let's put it this way, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=0.0s)]
*  instructive. It has frequently whitewashed Israel's atrocities, often simply ignored them, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=5.2s)]
*  given undue deference to Israeli claims and indeed lies, deference of course to Israeli [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=11.52s)]
*  official narratives, erased Palestinian voices and experiences. Well, we could go on. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=17.6s)]
*  It's all too infrequent investigations into Israel's atrocities have been detached from the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=23.52s)]
*  newspaper's overall narrative of what Israel is doing to the Palestinian people. Even then, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=29.68s)]
*  they often water down, omit, offer apologetics whilst regurgitating what has already been long [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=36.64s)]
*  established by journalists and media outlets elsewhere who have only a fraction of the same [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=42.64s)]
*  resources. Enter stage right. Their new investigation, Israel loosened its rules to [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=48.0s)]
*  bomb Hamas fighters, killing many more civilians. This is a new piece which the New York Times [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=53.2s)]
*  has released a few days ago. Some might go, just be grateful that establishment media outlets [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=60.56s)]
*  are publishing this stuff at all. The piece, which focuses on Israel's bombing campaign in [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=64.88s)]
*  the first few weeks after 7th October 2023, confirms that Israel has committed multiple [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=70.08s)]
*  war crimes in that bombing campaign. The newspaper notes how an order is issued at 1pm on 7th October [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=75.12s)]
*  2023 which granted mid-ranking Israeli military officers the authority to approve missile strikes [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=81.52s)]
*  against thousands of supposed militants and military sites and that they could now aim for [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=88.64s)]
*  those classified as the lowest ranking fighters. Crucially, these mid-ranking Israeli military [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=94.24s)]
*  officers now had the approval to target those classified the lowest ranking fighters if it meant [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=100.39999999999999s)]
*  risking killing up to 20 civilians. That is 20 civilian deaths being an acceptable level of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=106.72s)]
*  collateral damage for one supposed strike on a lowest ranked fighter. Which we'll discuss later. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=115.6s)]
*  According to this New York Times article, mid-ranking officers had never been given [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=127.2s)]
*  so much leeway to attack so many targets, many of which had lower military significance at such [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=130.96s)]
*  a high potential civilian cost. Crucially, the newspaper states the order which has not previously [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=136.79999999999998s)]
*  been reported had no precedent in Israeli military history. Let me just read PATH again. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=142.39999999999998s)]
*  Which has not previously been reported. As soon as I read that sentence, it jarred. Because what was [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  being reported was instantly familiar to me. And I knew why. Because I had covered an investigation [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=158.0s)]
*  into this by the Israeli-Palestinian media outlet Plus 972 magazine back at the beginning of April. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=165.67999999999998s)]
*  That is nearly nine months ago. When discussing the use of an artificial intelligence targeting [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=173.6s)]
*  program, which would literally come up with targets without human input to be obliterated, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=180.16s)]
*  often alongside their entire families, a program named Lavender, the article in Plus 972 magazine [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=187.92s)]
*  stated the following. In an unprecedented move, according to two of the sources, the army also [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=194.4s)]
*  decided during the first weeks of the war that for every junior Hamas operative that Lavender marked, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  it was permissible to kill up to 15 or 20 civilians. In the past, the military did not authorise any [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=205.6s)]
*  collateral damage during assassinations of low-ranking militants. The article also quoted an [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=212.16s)]
*  Israeli military source who said the following. Every person who wore a Hamas uniform in the past [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=220.64s)]
*  year or two could be bombed with 20 civilians killed as collateral damage, even without special [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=225.27999999999997s)]
*  permission. In practice, the principle of proportionality did not exist. That source [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=232.72s)]
*  went on to say in this calculation, it could also be 20 children for a junior operative. It really [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=237.76s)]
*  wasn't like that in the past when they were asked by Plus 972 magazine about the security rationale [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=243.11999999999998s)]
*  for such a policy, the source replied, lethality. So what is the New York Times talking about? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=248.32s)]
*  They're claiming this has never been reported before, yet here I am quoting from an article [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=255.44s)]
*  which I covered myself on this channel, some of you may remember, it's in a video entitled [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=259.52s)]
*  Israel's Dystopian Killing Machine Exposed. Now, another quote in the article, let's go for it, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=264.4s)]
*  shall we? Strikes that endangered more than 100 civilians were occasionally permitted to target [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=272.64s)]
*  a handful of Hamas leaders as long as senior generals or sometimes the political leadership [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=278.08s)]
*  approved according to four Israeli officers involved in target selection. Let's go back to that Plus [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=282.47999999999996s)]
*  972 magazine article which says that sources told them, in the event that the target was a senior [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=288.32s)]
*  Hamas official with a rank of battalion or brigade commander, the army on several occasions authorized [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=294.4s)]
*  the killing of more than 100 civilians in the assassination of a single commander. Here's another [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  chunk from that article, in the bombing of the commander of the Shira battalion, we know that we [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=306.24s)]
*  would kill over 100 civilians, this is one of the sources referring to a December 2nd, 2023 bombing [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=313.36s)]
*  that the IDF spokesperson said was aimed at assassinating Wissam Farhat. They said, the source, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=321.92s)]
*  for me, psychologically it was unusual, over 100 civilians it crosses some red line. In actual fact, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=327.84000000000003s)]
*  the New York Times waters down what was originally established by Plus 972 magazine. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=334.0s)]
*  Plus 972 magazine say strikes that, sorry, let me get this right, the New York Times say strikes [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=338.56s)]
*  that endangered more than 100 civilians were occasionally permitted, that's what they said, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=345.76s)]
*  endangered more than 100 civilians were occasionally permitted. Plus 972 magazine said [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=350.16s)]
*  that the army on several occasions authorized the killing of more than 100 civilians. Now, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=354.8s)]
*  the New York Times know all about Plus 972 magazine, how do we know this? Because they [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=361.76s)]
*  actually refer to Plus 972 magazine in this piece, in the following paragraph. In other units, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=367.44s)]
*  three officers said, an individual considered a confirmed militant if he was simply listed in [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=374.24s)]
*  lavender. Details of that process were previously reported by Plus 972, an Israeli-Palestinian news [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=378.88s)]
*  website. The Israeli military has denied that was military policy and said that any analysts [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=386.48s)]
*  who relied solely on lavender would have been overruled by superiors. What a striking here, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=391.52000000000004s)]
*  they're not attributing their work properly. What they do is bring up in passing Plus 972 [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=396.56s)]
*  magazine, then undermine them by using a denial from the Israeli army to combat the claims made [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=402.08000000000004s)]
*  by Plus 972 magazine about the use of this artificial intelligence system in the selection [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=406.96000000000004s)]
*  of targets. That is, that there was human input when Plus 972 magazine made clear there was not [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=411.36s)]
*  in that targeting. Now, the framing of the New York Times article tells you what you need to know. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=416.08s)]
*  The subheading reads as follows, surprised by October 7th and fearful of another attack, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=420.56s)]
*  Israel weakened safeguards meant to protect non-combatants, allowing officers to endanger [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=427.76s)]
*  up to 20 people in each airstrike, one of the deadliest bombardments of the 21st century followed. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=434.08s)]
*  So what the New York Times does is offer empathy for Israel's decision to commit grave war crimes. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=439.52s)]
*  More, it should be noted, empathy is offered there than for the actual victims of these war [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=446.0s)]
*  crimes, the countless Palestinians who've been slaughtered by Israeli airstrikes. The way it's [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=451.59999999999997s)]
*  framed there is completely euphemistic. Safeguards, you know, surprised, wanted to prevent another [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=457.91999999999996s)]
*  attack as well. You can understand why they did the things they did. That's what the New York [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=465.2s)]
*  Times is doing, isn't it? Oh, this is hideous. But given what they were up against, given what [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=470.48s)]
*  they'd gone through, not how they would have framed 7th of October, is it? No. Indeed, it's a classic [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=478.88s)]
*  example there, isn't it, of what the Palestinian Canadian lawyer, Dandabuti, said along the lines [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=487.68s)]
*  of the mantra being nothing justifies 7th of October, but everything can be justified by 7th [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=493.04s)]
*  October. In this case, well, terrible war crimes, but there is a context. Now, the New York Times [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=497.92s)]
*  push notification for the peace goes along those lines. How Israel loosened its rules, followed by [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=505.68s)]
*  shocked by October 7th, Israel severely weakened its system of safeguards meant to protect [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=512.96s)]
*  civilians to fight Hamas, the Times found. I mean, they frame again Israel's decision to commit war [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=519.2s)]
*  crimes as an understandable emotional response. And then they portray what is mass-set slaughters, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=525.76s)]
*  the mere weakening of safeguards. I mean, it sounds like an airline which just cut around the [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=531.12s)]
*  edges a bit, doesn't it? It's like safety protocols, red tape, not quite abided by. Indeed, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=538.8s)]
*  the article itself makes Israel's slaughter seem careless rather than a calculated policy, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=547.76s)]
*  which was of course fleshed out by the repeated statements of Israeli leaders and officials, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=553.6s)]
*  which repeatedly made clear in the most unsubtle fashion possible that they regarded Palestinian [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=558.48s)]
*  civilians as collectively guilty and therefore fair game. Now, for example, discussing the Israeli [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=564.32s)]
*  military striking at such a pace that it made it harder to confirm it was hitting legitimate targets. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=569.52s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure they were truly devastated by that in the command rooms. The article then says [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=574.96s)]
*  the Israeli military burned through much of a pre-war database of vetted targets within [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=579.28s)]
*  days and adopted an improved system for finding new targets that used artificial intelligence [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=583.1999999999999s)]
*  at a vast scale. In other words, a rationale for mass indiscriminate bombing. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=587.52s)]
*  As the work of all this has established, allowing for so-called lowest ranking militants to be [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=592.4s)]
*  targeted means a vast swathe of society because Israel uses Hamas as an indiscriminate label [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=598.24s)]
*  for so many people in society who are not legitimate military targets by any rational [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=604.0s)]
*  definition. That's the point, lowest ranking Hamas official thereby or Hamas militant, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=610.6400000000001s)]
*  all sorts of civil servants, people working in public administration. That's what we're talking [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=617.2s)]
*  about. Or in the past, they were linked to that somehow, or maybe their cousin were there. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=620.72s)]
*  Here's the issue. Throughout Israel's mass slaughter, there were those of us who pointed [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=629.12s)]
*  to the obvious, that the Israeli state is slaughtering Palestinian civilians en masse, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=632.8000000000001s)]
*  that it's bombing campaign in Gaza alone, but just by focusing on the bombing campaign, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=639.2s)]
*  the many planks to the genocide, but just that bombing campaign alone, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=643.44s)]
*  that's a litany of extreme war crimes. We said that from the start because it was obvious, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=649.6800000000001s)]
*  because we could see what was happening. This is the whole ludicrous nature of this entire [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=654.16s)]
*  genocide. We're literally constantly trying to argue that what we can see and hear in the most [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=661.92s)]
*  evidence genocide in history, the most evidence genocide has happened, I should clarify, that it [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=669.52s)]
*  is what it looks and sounds like. That's the ludicrous nature of all of this. It was clear they [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=676.7199999999999s)]
*  were obviously wiping the place off the face of the earth. We're now 14 months on and the New York [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=681.12s)]
*  Times pops up and goes, well, actually, maybe there's a point there. The mainstream narrative [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=687.76s)]
*  throughout was that this was the right to self-defense, that mass civilian killings [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=691.44s)]
*  were being avoided by Israel. They kept telling Western media, not their own people, click a [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=696.32s)]
*  tweet in Hebrew and press translate on Israeli leaders and officials. They weren't saying this, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=703.2s)]
*  but when they were turning up to, oh, no, of course we don't kill civilians, to Sky News, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=706.5600000000001s)]
*  whatever, and the presenters were like, oh, lapping it up. It was a mistake. Occasionally, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=710.64s)]
*  things happen in wars. The other, of course, key point, which was indulged by the Western media [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=717.1999999999999s)]

*  human shields. It was that these Palestinian civilians were being put in harm's way, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=727.92s)]
*  not by the Israeli military. If we tried to push back any of this, we were all hamastujas. That's [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=733.76s)]
*  what happened. Those people have to pay the price for that, by the way. It's not a case of, oh, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=739.76s)]
*  we were right, they were wrong. Oh, well, never mind. These things happen. Sometimes you make [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=744.96s)]
*  the right call, sometimes you don't. No. If you literally defy all the evidence to justify [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=751.28s)]
*  genocide, even if you don't think, you don't claim it's a genocide, it doesn't matter, it's what [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=758.72s)]
*  actually is what matters. If you try and rebut the truth about a colossal crime, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=764.24s)]
*  just by having all the evidence at your fingertips, and you try and destroy the people [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=772.88s)]
*  who were actually telling the truth all along about what was happening, you have to pay a price. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=779.6s)]
*  You can't get away with this. I'm not calling for violence, just to be clear. I'm calling for [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=785.36s)]
*  careers to be ruined and for people to be arrested. This ends in arrest. This ends with [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=790.08s)]
*  people going to prison, not just politicians. Now, the New York Times comes along to confirm [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=794.72s)]
*  the obvious 14 months after the bombing campaign started. And indeed, just to know, another article [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=798.88s)]
*  by Plus917 magazine published November 30th, 2023. It's entitled, A Mass Assassination Factory, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=804.88s)]
*  Inside Israel's Calculated Bombing of Gaza. It went into detail about how Israel was wiping Gaza [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=812.24s)]
*  from the face of the earth with its bombs. This was all there for anybody, all the evidence there [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=817.28s)]
*  for anybody who was interested. And here's a really important point. Plus917 magazine have [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=824.3199999999999s)]

*  all of this a long time ago in great detail, and they chose not to, while indulging Israel's [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=837.68s)]
*  deceitful narratives. And now, as Gaza is rubble and so many of its citizens have been butchered [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=843.28s)]
*  and maimed, they claim to exclusively report what was already established a long time ago. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=848.4s)]
*  What I would say though is this. The article, however woeful its limitations, should be added [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=853.76s)]
*  to the overwhelming body of evidence that Israel is guilty of some of the worst crimes imaginable, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhXu97hF7c&t=857.8399999999999s)]
