# Netanyahu BRAGS About Genocide - And Our Media COVERS IT UP
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs)
*  This is the plan, we're not hiding this. These are the words of Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=0.0s)]
*  the Israeli Prime Minister, wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  and crimes against humanity, and he was talking about the forcible removal [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=10.0s)]
*  of the entire Palestinian population of Gaza. Now ever since Israel's genocide against the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=13.92s)]
*  Palestinian people began, you've heard me say something along these lines a lot. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=19.68s)]
*  Why isn't this headline used in the Western media? Why is the Western media failing to cover [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  it either properly or at all? Now when I say that, there are two purposes. One is rhetorical, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=29.2s)]
*  I'm fleshing out the outrageous pro-Israel bias of the Western media, which is driven by Israel [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  being a key ally of the West and thus treated as us, as well as shameless, unapologetic, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=41.12s)]
*  undisguised racism towards the Palestinians who are them. The other is a desperate plea to never [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  ever stop being shocked that without being naive or ignorant about the power dynamics and context [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=52.8s)]
*  in history, to never ever ever stop screaming inside, I cannot believe this is actually [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=57.6s)]
*  happening. As Israel continues to unleash utter depravity against the Palestinian people in [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  full view of the world, it equally does nothing, zero zilch to hide its intentions. Let's hear [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=67.76s)]
*  what Netanyahu said in this speech, which received almost no coverage of any significance in the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=73.2s)]
*  Western media. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=77.76s)]
*  To be clear, the use of the term voluntary migration is a disgusting Orwellian affront to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=87.6s)]
*  language. When you raze an entire land from the face of the earth, damaging or destroying 93% of [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=105.6s)]
*  all homes, when you wipe out its hospitals and slaughter its medics, when you besiege the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=110.56s)]
*  essentials of life from food to medicine while destroying its agriculture and livestock, when [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=115.84s)]
*  you attack its fresh water supply, when you repeatedly drive the traumatised survivors from [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=120.4s)]
*  place to place to place under threat of violence and death, when you kidnap thousands of innocent [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=124.8s)]
*  people and torture and rape them, when you incessantly rain down missiles and bombs and [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=129.04s)]
*  shoot bullets so that the civilian population there constantly fear it will be their last moment [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=133.44s)]
*  alive and every day it is the last moment alive of countless civilians. When you do all of this, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=137.84s)]
*  when you make life completely and utterly unbearable in what is now 542 days of apocalyptic [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=142.96s)]
*  misery, and when you also make it clear there will be no reconstruction or attempt to make [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=149.36s)]
*  Gaza livable again for Palestinians, then the idea of voluntary migration is an obscene, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=153.28s)]
*  nauseating deceit. And as genocide scholars have pointed out, this proposition is a genocidal act. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=158.72s)]
*  Genocide means acts driven with the intent to destroy in whole or in part a national, ethnic, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  religious or racial group, and the intent here is to erase the Palestinians of Gaza from the Earth [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=171.36s)]
*  as if they never existed. You can only do this through the hideous slaughter of the sort we are [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=177.04000000000002s)]
*  currently seeing in full display of the world. That by definition includes all the worst crimes [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=181.68s)]
*  imaginable, committed in full view of the world, like attacking a convoy of ambulances and civil [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=186.8s)]
*  workers, handcuffing them, executing them by shooting them one by one in the head and the chest, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  then tossing their bodies into a mass grave and then even trying to bury their ambulances [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=197.60000000000002s)]
*  and fire trucks. This is the latest atrocity the Israeli state has committed, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=202.16s)]
*  an atrocity that could hardly be more depraved, and as far as the Western media is concerned, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=206.32000000000002s)]
*  this does not qualify as a war crime that can be spelled out accurately for what it is. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=210.56s)]
*  Let's just begin by listening to Sky News. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=215.52s)]
*  Now the father of a medic, one of 15 people allegedly killed by the Israel Defense Forces, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=218.24s)]
*  has called for greater international protection for emergency workers in Gaza. The IDF denied [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=224.08s)]
*  that they were deliberately targeting the individuals, saying they opened fire at [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=230.88s)]
*  suspicious vehicles that were travelling without coordination in an active combat zone. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=235.52s)]
*  As the British-Palestinian writer Hamza Youssef puts it, Sky News just called Israel's massacre [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=240.48s)]
*  of 15 medics an alleged killing. They then uncritically repeated Israel's version and [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=245.68s)]
*  justification as fact. This is deliberate misinformation. Shame on you Sky News. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=249.76s)]
*  Let's listen, shall we, as well, to how the BBC reported this. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=254.48s)]
*  Yeah so we've got the UN calling for a full investigation to exactly what happened [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=258.64s)]
*  back on the 23rd of March. That's where these 15 people were killed in Rafah in the very south [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=263.44s)]
*  of Gaza. And really this is continuing to generate so much controversy. You have on the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=272.64s)]
*  one hand these allegations that Israel has committed an apparent war crime, a clear breach [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=279.2s)]
*  of international humanitarian law, but the Israeli military in its latest statement has [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=284.4s)]
*  been stressing that these were vehicles that it says were acting suspiciously and appeared to [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=289.91999999999996s)]
*  pose a direct threat to Israeli forces who were operating in the area. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=295.91999999999996s)]
*  As the award-winning journalist Richard Sanders put it, classic BBC, everything that happens in [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=301.52s)]
*  Israel is presented as some sort of hopeless puzzle will probably never resolve. This isn't [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=306.24s)]
*  journalism, a case study in why Israel gets away with it. Exactly this. Every time Israel commits [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=310.32s)]
*  an atrocity so obscene and so depraved that the BBC actually has to cover it, although that isn't [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=316.4s)]
*  actually always the case, the BBC then reduces it to a game of he says she says, along the lines of [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=321.03999999999996s)]
*  in the fog of war, who's to know what the truth really is? Did they play this game with Hamas [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=326.0s)]
*  atrocities on the 7th of October? No, they did not. And as well as rightly accepting crimes that did [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=329.76s)]
*  happen on the 7th of October without any equivocation and describing them, for example, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=334.4s)]
*  as massacre and terms like that, which they don't use with Israeli atrocities, I would know that on [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=338.8s)]
*  the BBC website, contrary to the corporation's claims that they correct errors when they make [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=344.24s)]
*  them, there are still false claims in their coverage about atrocities which did not happen [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=348.32s)]
*  on the 7th of October. Do they play this game with Russia and Ukraine? No, they don't. They do not [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=353.84s)]
*  treat claims by the Russian authorities as credible or trustworthy. So why do they do this [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=358.48s)]
*  with Israel, even though it has been proven over and over and over and over and over again that [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=363.12s)]
*  the Israeli authorities lie and lie and lie and lie and lie about the crimes they commit? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=368.96000000000004s)]
*  What the BBC has done all the way through this conflict is protect Israel as it commits infamy [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=373.44s)]
*  of the world, only thanks of course to mobile phones and social media, not because of them, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=377.92s)]
*  heinous atrocities, while its leaders and officials flagrantly just tell us over and over again that [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=382.96000000000004s)]
*  they're committing war crimes, as Netanyahu does here, by preserving a narrative along the lines of [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=388.08s)]
*  Israel is fighting a war self-defence. And let's have a little debate about whether that response [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=393.03999999999996s)]
*  is proportionate or not, with both claims being legitimate, which is a bit like treating both [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=396.56s)]
*  sides of an argument about whether the earth is flat as legitimate, with the rather substantial [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=400.4s)]
*  difference that this is about the ongoing mass slaughter of innocent people facilitated by [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=404.88s)]
*  Western governments, including, notably for the BBC, the British government that it is supposed [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=409.91999999999996s)]
*  to be holding to account. As the so-called self-described, I should say, as the self-described [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=415.36s)]
*  liberal Zionist academic, Shail Ben Aframe, who has increasingly, I know, repudiated his support [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=420.96000000000004s)]
*  for the Israeli onslaught since it began, writes, however, an IDF source admitted to me that there [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=427.28000000000003s)]
*  is evidence that soldiers executed the workers. It is also not IDF practice to bury Palestinian bodies, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=434.32s)]
*  the source confirmed, suggesting they knew they had something to hide. He says, this confirms that [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=440.08000000000004s)]
*  some of the ambulance staff were still alive after the IDF hit them, then they were murdered. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=444.96s)]
*  This is a new low for the IDF. Those responsible must face justice. Well, good luck with that one, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=449.28s)]
*  Shail. Given Israeli soldiers have committed every crime under the sun, whilst in many cases [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=454.32s)]
*  boasting about those crimes in social media without facing any justice, I'm fascinated to see how [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=459.2s)]
*  this one goes. Meanwhile, the Israeli state has ordered the evacuation of Ra'far, that is to drive [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=463.67999999999995s)]
*  all of the people out. The main city in southern Gaza, where Palestinians had previously been [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=469.35999999999996s)]
*  ordered by Israel to flee. Today, Israel bombed a clinic belonging to UNRWA, the UN agency for [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=473.92s)]
*  Palestinian refugees, slaughtering 19 people, including 9 kids. Israel Katz, the Israeli [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=478.48s)]
*  defence minister, has announced that Israel will catch extensive territory that will be added to [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=484.8s)]
*  the state of Israel's security areas. In other words, Israel is openly committing to annexing [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=488.72s)]
*  more and more of Gaza, a wanted and illegal act, again, not reported as such in the western media. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=493.68s)]
*  All of this is in the service of the plan, I mean, I call it a plan, this genocidal plan, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=499.2s)]
*  announced in the Financial Times to drive the surviving population of Gaza, already a tiny [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=505.44s)]
*  strip of land, no bigger than East London, into an even tinier swath of it, all with the intent of [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=509.84s)]
*  removing the population from Gaza altogether, as Netanyahu has made very clear. Indeed, Israel has [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=515.28s)]
*  imposed a total siege on Gaza now for over a month. Nothing is allowed to get in. And at the same [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=521.4399999999999s)]
*  time, they have systematically destroyed agriculture, livestock, food production. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=525.68s)]
*  Yesterday, the World Food Programme announced that all 25 of its bakeries have now closed in Gaza [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=529.76s)]
*  because of a lack of fuel and flour. Hot meals, they say, are continuing, but supplies will last [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=534.4s)]
*  two weeks maximum, and its last food parcels will be distributed in the next two days. What does [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=538.9599999999999s)]
*  that mean? It means Palestinians can't eat, and it means Palestinians are going to starve to death. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=543.1999999999999s)]
*  Deliberately starving an entire people is an unambiguous straightforward crime, yet where is [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=547.68s)]
*  the coverage reflecting this obvious fact? The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=552.48s)]
*  warrant against the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for this very crime. Why isn't that [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=557.12s)]
*  integrated into Western media coverage of what's currently going on as standard, just as Hamas-run [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=562.08s)]
*  health ministry has been a default addition to their style guide? As Israel's leaders commit [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=567.04s)]
*  these shameless crimes in full view of the world, one of the Western politicians in governments which [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=571.9200000000001s)]
*  continue to arm and facilitate these heinous atrocities. Let's listen to this from the Labour [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=576.16s)]
*  cabinet minister, Bridget Phillipson. Just get your take on that breaking news very quickly that [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=581.52s)]
*  we had before that package, that Israel's defence minister, Israel Katz, is saying his country's [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=585.04s)]
*  military operation in the Gaza Strip is expanding to capture large areas. What's your view on that? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=589.28s)]
*  I'm hearing this for the first time as you present that to me. I'd want to look carefully at exactly [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=595.92s)]
*  what is being said here. I think what we all want to see in the long term is, of course, an end [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=600.96s)]
*  to the conflict moving towards a two-state solution. And of course, we know we're in the position [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=606.64s)]
*  where there are many hostages that are still in captivity and alongside that, the need for [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=611.4399999999999s)]

*  crimes. And here's a really important point that needs emphasising. In British politics, the two-state [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=643.52s)]
*  solution exists solely as a crutch to get British ministers through an interview, so they don't have [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qXIW8Aucs&t=648.7199999999999s)]
