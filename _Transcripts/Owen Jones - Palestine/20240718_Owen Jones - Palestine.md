# Israel's Propaganda Campaign To Silence Critics - The Shocking Truth - w. Lee Fang
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [July 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1i0UbAyrpk)
*  Now, amidst the horror of the last few months, we've seen shifting attitudes, I would say,
*  in Western public opinion. People have seen too much to unsee, heard too much to unhear,
*  read too much to unread, and that has had a profound impact on Western public opinion.
*  But the Israeli state is not stupid. It is aware that it depends on Western states, not
*  least the United States, for arms, diplomatic support, aid, political support. And it has
*  deployed at state level an extensive attempt to, I suppose, contain the political consequences
*  of people being horrified at mass slaughter. Now, with that in mind, I'm really delighted
*  to be speaking to the brilliant journalist, Lee Fang, who is a great investigative journalist,
*  brilliant political journalist, who writes on a whole range of different subjects and has a
*  sub stack. Please do check out the sub stack. Do click on it and support it. And you can see
*  the kind of really kind of in-depth journalistic work that he's been doing on this and so many
*  other topics. So Lee, how are you doing? I'm doing great. Owen, it's really good to join you.
*  Thanks for having me. I just want to start with, so you did this actually a few months ago,
*  and it was actually published partly in the Guardian newspaper as well, the work that you did.
*  And this was concerning. I mean, this is Amitai Chikli, who's the liquid minister
*  who has been leading a targeted push to counter critics of Israel. Can you just explain,
*  what did you find basically? What was this about?
*  Well, we took a look at, I did this with a close friend of mine, co-author Jack Paulson. We took
*  a look at this government entity, this government agency, the Ministry of Diaspora Affairs,
*  led by Amitai Chikli. And it's basically the reboot of a very controversial public relations
*  effort. Now, the Israeli government has its own separate budget for public relations, for,
*  you know, they fly a lot of people in to the country to lobby them and show them the Israel
*  side of the story. They run television advertisements around the world. They do a lot of the traditional
*  PR that many governments that are in controversial kind of arrangements with the US, that's all
*  normal. That's a separate kind of category. What we took a look at is something special. It's
*  something that was launched back in 2017 that was positioned as a mass consciousness
*  raising effort that would kind of go in as a quote PR commando unit to go after and go on the offensive
*  against Israel's perceived political enemies to kind of attack efforts by activists to call for
*  boycotts and sanctions, that type of thing, to kind of create like online troll armies,
*  to criticize celebrities, to pass legislation that was favorable to Israel that would be a
*  little bit more nimble and covert. Now, this received a lot of coverage within Israel at the time,
*  a lot of pushback. Some of their efforts were incredibly successful, others perhaps not. Their
*  troll army didn't really come together. This piece looks at the history of this specialized
*  unit. It's gone through a lot of different reboots and names. It was originally Kela Schlomo or David
*  Sling. It was then renamed Concert Together for Israel. It's now under the name Voices for Israel.
*  And it was shut down twice and just a few weeks after October 7th, and this is what the piece
*  really explores, this controversial PR unit essentially was rebooted and flushed with Israeli
*  government money. And this unit is controversial in part because Israel has been very careful
*  consciously. This has been a debate within government ministers and within government leaders
*  about not registering under various lobbying laws in the countries that they operate,
*  and particularly the US, that when they want to kind of use this specialized government agency,
*  government funded group, to shape legislation and public opinion, they don't want to disclose,
*  they don't want to kind of follow the kind of basic transparency laws that many foreign lobbyists
*  and foreign governments have to abide by. So they co-mingle a lot of the government money
*  with private sector donations. They put it into various nonprofits and they funnel it
*  to allied groups, particularly in the UK and Europe. And we took a look only at the US,
*  but they also have a wing that looks at Europe. And in the weeks after October 7th,
*  with the protests at Ivy League universities, there was a demand to say, hey, you know, this is
*  so important for American political culture. This is where every major American politician
*  goes to school at Yale and Harvard and the other Ivy Leagues. This is where the mid-tier and lower
*  tier colleges look to. There's a mimicry in American culture that whatever the elite colleges adopt
*  culturally, politically, policy-wise, it flows downstream to the other colleges. This is what
*  is a taste-setter for American culture overall, that celebrities and Americans of all stripes
*  look towards these universities for guidance on how to act and behave on any major issue.
*  And this is really the discussion within government ministers in the Knesset. And they said, look,
*  we've got to push back, we've got to fight these students. How do we do it? So let's reboot
*  this, you know, Kela Shlomo or Concert Voices. They still use interchangeably all the different
*  various names for this entity. And, you know, we don't have a full picture of all the
*  ways that they've spent their money. But this series of reporting that I've been doing with Jack,
*  we look at government records, at some of the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament debate.
*  Some of these groups have uploaded videos on YouTube and social media, basically discussing
*  their accomplishments and how they're working with the Israeli government. And other, you know,
*  pieces of information that we've kind of assembled to paint as much of a picture as we can of what
*  they're doing. And, you know, one of the organizations that they have historically funded
*  with this Israeli group is, you know, they fund many different nonprofits in the U.S., many
*  Christian Zionist organizations, many advocacy groups. But one of the groups that they fund is
*  a think tank in New York called the Institute for the Study of Global Anti-Semitism Policy. That's a
*  mouthful. So it also goes by ISGAP. ISGAP, this was originally kind of a think tank at Yale
*  University. They were booted from Yale University because they were perceived as not academic at
*  all, as kind of a pro-Israel lobbying group, and it was not appropriate for it to be associated
*  with the university. So it was booted from the university for advocacy reasons. And now it's
*  basically claimed credit for that infamous hearing back in December with Claudine Gay,
*  the former president of Harvard and others, being accused of supporting anti-Semitism on their
*  college campuses or not doing enough to condemn and sanction pro-Palestinian protests. And, you
*  know, we don't have to go into the details of that, but one of the kind of interesting takeaways that
*  no one in the media covered at the time is that ISGAP, this group that's historically funded by
*  this controversial PR unit of the Israeli government, had given reports to the Republican
*  legislators. And many of the three of those Republican legislators actually cited ISGAP
*  just moments before that epic confrontation that went viral all over the world between
*  Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and Claudine Gay. And they had been working with the congressional
*  staff and, you know, they were at a kind of meeting with some of their supporters and donors.
*  And, you know, in one of the videos that we link in that piece, they took credit. They said, you
*  know, this was our work. You know, this is how we shape hearts and minds around this issue. So, you
*  know, that's just one of the many examples that we look through in the piece. And they've done a
*  stunningly successful job in kind of avoiding the public limelight. You know, a lot of these kind of
*  advocacy efforts, although I'm sure many different organizations in support of Israel would do so on
*  their own volition without any guidance from the Israeli government. But the role of a foreign
*  government in shaping these debates on college campuses, in legislatures, they're again trying
*  to pass legislation in kind of shaping the social media content moderation policies and the way we
*  talk about the war in Gaza and the Israeli state. There's been so little reporting about the role
*  of the Israeli government in kind of setting the contours of this whole discussion.
*  Have we seen exactly, sorry, ISGAT try to redefine, you know, push laws which
*  redefine anti-Semitism to include, well, it's this conflation, critiques of the state of
*  Israelist behavior. I mean, it looks at these other groups, Voices of Israel,
*  Cyberwell, which is this pro-Israel nominally anti-disinformation group led by former Israeli
*  military intelligence officials, which has became a trusted official, trusted partner to TikTok and
*  Metta. So what's going on there? What are they kind of trying to push and promote via that through
*  social media space? Well, you know, as I mentioned, you know, this has been going on since 2017.
*  This PR effort through, it's kind of covert PR effort through the Israeli government. It used
*  to be housed in this controversial mini agency within the Israeli government called the Ministry
*  of Strategic Affairs. It later morphed into the Ministry of Diaspora Affairs. And over the years,
*  you know, we've got kind of a list of the different staffers and Israeli intelligence
*  officials that have worked with these agencies. Well, back in 2022, the same leadership from the
*  Ministry of Strategic Affairs and the folks that helped run the first iterations of Voices for
*  Israel or Kelesh Lomo or, you know, however they want to call themselves these days,
*  they went off and formed this NGO Cyberwell that it basically portrays itself as one of the many
*  kind of constellation of anti-hate, anti-disinformation NGOs. And, you know, we've
*  seen over the last couple of years, many of the big social media platforms, you know, they get
*  criticism for the type of hate speech or, you know, controversial speech or disinformation or foreign
*  intervention on their platforms. And, you know, they don't have a good response to this. And
*  perhaps for financial reasons, perhaps for liability or political reasons, they end up
*  outsourcing a lot of the censorship work to these non-government organizations saying, you know,
*  hey, look, these members of civil society, they can do a better job than us. How would they do it
*  for us? You know, that's very fraught. That's something that I've written about a lot. You know,
*  there are many special interest groups that cast themselves as independent, non-government
*  agencies that are just concerned about hate and problematic speech. And they say, oh, you know,
*  TikTok, Meta, you know, you have issues. Let's help you remove bad content from your platform.
*  You know, it really kind of opens the door for all kinds of manipulation. You know, I've written
*  about this with the context of Ukraine and some of the issues around the pandemic. Well, Israel
*  is essentially doing the same thing. These former intelligence officers and former concert officials
*  form this group. And, you know, they're setting moderation policies. They're kind of sending
*  lists of tweets and TikToks that they want removed. And you look at the criteria that they're
*  using. Now, of course, there is a lot of hate on these platforms, but the type of criteria that
*  they're looking for is often narrowly the type of content that is seen as just critical to the IDF,
*  critical to Israel. They claim that anyone who disputes the claims that came out, you know,
*  in the weeks after October 7th that 40 babies were beheaded or put into ovens, these kind of
*  claims that were made by and echoed by Joe Biden and Israeli leadership, anyone who disputes this
*  and says, hey, there's no evidence. Multiple investigations have shown that this never happened.
*  You know, you've seen the reporting. I'm sure your listeners have seen the reporting as well.
*  They claim that this is a form of Holocaust denial, that anyone who disputes this claim
*  is engaging in anti-Semitism. And therefore, that type of content needs to be removed from
*  these platforms. Now, this is its own form of disinformation, but it's cast in this veneer of
*  fighting hate speech. I mean, it's very clever in what they're doing. It's not unique. There are
*  other special interest groups around the world that kind of mimic these strategies. But it seems
*  to be very effective because they've won this very privileged place as a trusted partner for
*  these platforms. And they're actively shaping the type of content that we're allowed to see
*  on the social media. I was really interested in the activities of this ministry. One of the
*  well, kind of thing which has kind of come out of this is hundreds of fake accounts posting pro-Israel
*  or for anti-Muslim content. I mean, I know it's whatever I've read, anything to do with Gaza,
*  Israel, you'll just get, I mean, it's just, it's not, it doesn't come across. I know people often
*  do this on social media. There's a problem. A certain type of person, whenever they criticize,
*  they just respond that these are bots. These are bots. And actually real people do actually just
*  disagree with you sometimes at that. So I don't want to lean too much into that. You often get
*  that people go, you're a bot. You're like, it's just like a person. But nonetheless, you can just
*  sometimes look at it and be like, it just looks like AI generated faces with just kind of odd,
*  obsessive patterns of social media usage. Yeah. I'm just interested in that the way, I mean,
*  I know the diaspora affairs minister denied involvement in that campaign, but it's such a
*  cheap way. This is, you kind of just spam like lawmakers and public officials and public figures
*  or journalists. It's not actually, it's actually, to do that as a very low investment and probably
*  does actually have an impact. So I just wonder what you thought about that. Yeah. I mean, look, this
*  is such an interesting debate because you're right. This is often kind of the big distraction. Anyone
*  who's dealing with tough criticism online will say it's a bot, but look, the New York Times was
*  able to identify that the, that legisl, democratic legislators, particularly black Democrats were
*  being targeted with this concerted campaign from the same sponsor of this PR unit that I'm
*  mentioning, the ministry of diaspora affairs. They hired this public relations firm to use
*  artificial intelligence to kind of deep fakes, to create fake images and artificial intelligence,
*  to kind of populate these fake accounts with authentic looking dialogue to pressure legislators
*  to support Israel to, they're kind of spreading some anti-Muslim hate. It's categorically the exact
*  type of foreign disinformation that we heard endlessly about from 2016 with Russian attempts
*  to influence the 2016 election. We had hearing after hearing on Capitol Hill, we had the leaders,
*  the platforms testifying under oath and endless media coverage over this credit to the New York
*  Times for reporting on this. But other than the New York Times and my story in the Guardian,
*  I've seen virtually zero coverage of the zero reaction from Capitol Hill. It seems to be a
*  little bit of a double standard. I mean, this is $2 million. Like this is far beyond what the Russians
*  even reportedly spent in 2016. This is in the course of a war. This is in the course of
*  congressional debate about what to do about providing additional military support to Israel.
*  You know, there's a big vote back in April on providing additional military support. This kind
*  of disinformation happened at a time when they were attempting to influence that vote. I mean,
*  this triggers a lot of lobbying disclosures. You know, it certainly should revive the same type
*  of discussion we've had about foreign influence. But, you know, like for a lot of these issues,
*  despite well-documented foreign attempts to influence public debate and public policy,
*  for whatever reason, there's not much scrutiny from the media or from legislators.
*  I think it's interesting because the Russia thing has gone too far, I would say. A certain type of
*  Democrat has used Russia as a crutch to explain any political phenomena that they don't like.
*  No, I don't desire anyone to exaggerate. I think there should be a consistent standard
*  applied across the board. That's what I mean. It's the hypocrisy of it. So you get on the one
*  hand a certain type of centrist often who will say, you know, Russia's done everything,
*  Russia's done this, that's why we lost in 2016, that's why Brexit happened. That's quite a common
*  thing in Britain. You know, Brexit happened, it was Russia. And then as soon as you start even
*  discussing the idea of Israeli interference, it's kind of, no, that's completely unacceptable. You
*  can't discuss this. It's incredible how similar our conversations are. They behave exactly the same.
*  I've seen the social media posts are uncannily similar. So I mean, it's just interesting,
*  this, you know, because you posted this really interesting piece of your blog. You've got in
*  touch with Cyberwell because they've been, you know, basically they were there, created to
*  supposedly help moderate social media and remove harmful content, but actually they're censoring
*  accurate and benign criticism of Israel. You reach out to them, they delete their bios and then they
*  block you. And they lied saying that you had never reached out for comment.
*  Yeah, we sent so many requests for comment, including, you know, really detailed list of
*  questions, you know, just basic journalism. They lied to the Guardian. They tried to kind of get
*  a correction on our piece. No correction was posted by the Guardian because we didn't get
*  anything wrong. We kind of were very rigorous in terms of the journalism methods that we used.
*  And yeah, they, right after we contacted them, they, you know, they used to have a bio page
*  noting that they were IDF intelligence officers on the staff and advisory board, including some of
*  the very high level intelligence officers, poof, gone after we request for comment. And rather than
*  simply responding to us in good faith, you know, I get blocked by them on Twitter. So I find it
*  funny. I mean, it's just, you know, this group is very savvy in terms of portraying itself as just
*  a bona fide anti-hate group. And again, I want to reiterate, there is a lot of terrible anti-Semitism
*  and anti-Jewish hate you see on these platforms. It is a problem with no easy solution. But what
*  they're doing here is conflating, it's almost like an intelligence operation in the sense that
*  they're conflating any criticism of the Israeli military, Israeli intelligence and government
*  policies with hatred for our people. And that's incredibly dangerous because, you know, any
*  American, any person should be able to criticize any government, including our own. That's part
*  of the protections with the first amendment. But what they're attempting to do, not just with the
*  social media monitoring and moderation, but with this push with their kind of coalition partners
*  to pass this new definition of anti-Semitism. You know, there was a big House vote two months ago.
*  They've passed kind of copycat bills in state legislatures and local government agencies
*  that codifies the IHRA, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition
*  of anti-Semitism that conflates criticism of the government of Israel with hatred of the Israeli
*  people. Basically saying that you can't, that's a form of illegal discrimination. Now, each of these
*  pieces of legislation are slightly different, but if you look at the pieces of legislation that they
*  helped pass in Georgia and Arizona, they've updated the hate crime statute, meaning that
*  certain forms of criticism of the state of Israel saying something like the state of Israel is
*  racist. You know, I can say that about the American government. I could say that about the
*  British government. But what they're saying is that if you say this about the Israeli government,
*  that could actually lead to increased prison time. This is kind of unprecedented what they're doing,
*  and it's dangerous too, because it's not, I don't think this serves the cause of anti-hate, of
*  seeing people as more human. We have a dehumanizing process in all the social media where
*  people are kind of stereotyping and smearing each other. We have this rising polarization
*  in hate in society. I don't think this solves it by shutting down any criticism of the state of Israel.
*  Well, it's deeply irresponsible because anti-Semitism, as you know, is a very serious
*  problem and evil. I think all the evidence shows it's rising. And what this conflation is doing is
*  making people stop believing in the reality of anti-Semitism. You get all too many people now who
*  just undermines faith and belief in the existence of anti-Semitism. I mean, just genuinely, just
*  finally, what impact do you think this... I mean, it's difficult to quantify, I guess, but what do
*  you think is... Because we can see with the polling, I mean, in Britain where, you know, from October,
*  the polling showed people opposed Israel's onslaught by a large margin, even by mid-October.
*  And the vast majority of Britons think Israel has committed war crimes, the vast majority of
*  Britons support an end to arms sales. Now, I know in the US, criticism of Israel has largely been
*  seen traditionally quite verboten. That has changed and polling suggested more Americans than not
*  think Israel's committed genocide. And actually, amongst Biden supporters, a very large majority of
*  people think Israel is committing genocide. So you've seen a very profound shift in public attitudes,
*  which is particularly concentrated amongst younger Americans who use social media. And I think
*  social media has played a big role. And the Biden administration has not exactly hidden the fact
*  they want to take action against TikTok because of that, because lots of younger Americans,
*  up to and including seeing Israeli soldiers posting their war crimes and support for war crimes on
*  social media. I think that's been one radicalizing impact. What do you think, though? Is this,
*  basically, do you think this is a futile, desperate attempt to kind of push back a tide,
*  which is just becoming too overwhelming? Or do you think it actually is having a pretty sizable
*  impact in stopping the dam from bursting, stigmatizing critique of the Israeli state,
*  given the gravity and the scale and the unapologetic intent
*  expressed by Israeli leaders, what we're seeing in Gaza? What do you think?
*  Well, it's a tough question. Here's what I know and here's what I don't know. What I know from
*  this reporting is that they have hit tangible goals. They passed legislation. I didn't even
*  get into it, but they're funding other kind of quasi-government agencies that are funding
*  traditionally apolitical Jewish student groups on campus to basically act as monitors, as groups
*  that are working in concert with these government agencies to spy on... I meant Swarovski, actually.
*  Sorry, I did mean Swarovski about that. I'm just saying, what we know in terms of like,
*  they're politicizing these Jewish student groups and asking them to monitor pro-Palestinian groups
*  and to lobby these university administrations to get them kicked off campus. And in some cases,
*  they're being successful. They're Students for Justice Palestine, some of these other
*  organizations that are being removed from college campuses. We do know that they are
*  successful in terms of shaping the content moderation policy. So people are seeing a lot of
*  really eye-opening first-person accounts from the war in Gaza, from both Palestinians and from,
*  as you mentioned, from IDF soldiers. I think that's actually some of the most impactful
*  social media because beyond the spin, beyond what the government ministry and their
*  spokespeople and embassy spokespeople say in our media every day on cable news,
*  you go and see what the IDF commanders on the ground are saying and it's diametrically opposite
*  in terms of what their motives and goals are in terms of ethnic cleansing or removing Palestinians
*  as a people from this territory. I think that's incredibly impactful. It's hard for me to measure
*  because I also know that there are big segments of TikTok social media that have been removed.
*  Like, what if they hadn't been successful in removing so much content from social media?
*  Would the public opinion be in a different place? It's impossible to say because we can't
*  rewind and play that different possibility. So it's true that the ground is shifting.
*  Israel consciously, and I mean Israel in terms of a lot of the government ministries,
*  the politicians who really study this, and much to Israel's credit, the reason we were able to
*  do a lot of this reporting is that they do have these open debates and they're connected. We were
*  just watching, transcribing, and translating these debates to better understand their strategy and
*  what they say is that they study what happened in South Africa with the apartheid regime there.
*  That's why they're so focused on the boycott divestment sanctions campaign because that was
*  part of the strategy by activists that helped shift the ground in South Africa. That's part of
*  why they're so obsessed with college campuses because they know it's effective. They see the
*  precedent. They know it's effective. The tip of the sphere in terms of changing South African policy
*  came from Columbia University. That actually led the nation back in the 80s.
*  That school led the nation in changing public opinion because they were some of the first big
*  encampments against South Africa. So they don't want to see this parallel. They're doing everything
*  they can to stop the Columbia University anti-apartheid protests against Israel.
*  Now so far in this sense it's been very different from South Africa. They passed these laws
*  restricting boycotts and sanctions. They've got the police to, and I wouldn't say it's just Israel,
*  there's a lot of democratic, organic activity that's pro-Israel that's not tied to the Israeli
*  government. But again it's multi-factor. But they've gotten the encampments cleared at Columbia.
*  So they're very conscious of this history and they're doing active measures to make sure that
*  history is not repeated. And in some cases they're incredibly successful despite what you're
*  mentioning in terms of this shifting public opinion and debate that's much more critical
*  about the role of the occupation, the role of these government policies, anger at the mass
*  slaughter of civilians. I don't know. It's hard for me to answer.
*  Well it's also the deterrence isn't it? I mean when you take various students' actions taken
*  against them then it has a deterrence effect. People look at that and they feel scared that
*  will happen to them. It deters other people to speak out. That's what they're doing isn't it?
*  They're trying to avoid critical mass basically. That you just allow these protests to grow
*  infected and whereas they go well actually look these people have consequences. I care about this
*  but I'm worried about the impact it will have on my life. I mean that's why there are so many
*  organizations that kind of dox students that try to make them unemployable, that kind of try to
*  intimidate them. I think that's having waning effect. I think a lot of people are like look
*  I kind of know if I engage in certain forms of non-violent humanistic protests I'm still going
*  to be smeared. I should say there are a lot of bad bad actors on the pro-Palestinian side that
*  have misbehaved but I don't think they define the whole the mass. I've gone to a lot of
*  these rallies. I've interviewed a lot of these activists. The average protestor here just wants
*  peace. They want a democratic society. I don't think they hate Israel. They hate these policies
*  but of course there is a fringe that is extreme and I think does promote a very dangerous
*  message. What Israel tries to do is say that everyone is part of that community that has that
*  kind of angry pro-Palestinian message. I don't think that's true. That's the attempt but
*  we'll see. I think there just needs to be a greater dialogue. As you said we're
*  boating to even talk about these things in the United States and it's unfortunately true
*  especially in the elite media. I'm very fortunate that The Guardian was our publishing partner in
*  some of this reporting but there just needs to be a lot more discussion. I agree and I think this is
*  why your work is so important. I think showing the mechanics of all this, how it works makes a big
*  impact. As that expression you don't want to know how sausages are made and the Israeli state
*  definitely does not want people to see how the sausages have been made. It's just showing the
*  mechanics of it and how this actually works, how it actually operates. I think it makes it much,
*  much less effective. It's really important. It's a very big democratic responsibility that I think
*  you've done with your journalism which is what journalism is at its best really. Pulling the
*  curtain, showing what's actually happening, challenging, often quite powerful and quite scary
*  figures and that's what this work is so brilliantly done. Do make sure you check out,
*  I've got the link in the description so do click on Lee's work. It is very courageous, important
*  work and I do think it is making a big contribution to shifting the tide on all of this. Leave your
*  comments, subscribe, press like as ever but Lee honestly thank you so much and thanks for your
*  great work. Oh and thanks for everything you do and this was such a nice conversation. Thanks for
*  having me on. Not at all, pleasure.
