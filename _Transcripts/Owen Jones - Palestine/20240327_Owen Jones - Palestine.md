# Israeli Spokesperson FIRED Eylon Levy's Downfall
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [March 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqVNWnn3qcI)
*  Well, so long and farewell, Elan Levy, the spokesperson of the Israeli state for several
*  months, during which that state has been waging a genocidal war against Gaza. Now, he's one of many
*  unfortunate British exports to the rest of the world, which we will be apologising for for a
*  very long time. To be fair, far from the first, certainly won't be the last. This officially
*  sanctioned apologist for some of the worst atrocities committed in the 21st century has
*  been unceremoniously sacked by the Israeli government, to which I say the absolute
*  ingratitude. As tens of thousands of Palestinians have been violently slaughtered, around 40% of
*  them children, as Gaza's civilian infrastructure has been razed to the ground, its healthcare system
*  violently wrecked, its people subjected to famine, Elan Levy was there just to find the unjustifiable,
*  spreading the notorious and endless deceit that these Israeli authorities have truly spun into an
*  art form. You make your name spinning for a state as it commits genocide, and this is the
*  thanks that you get. Now, this Londoner, educated at the not cheap private university college school
*  in Hampstead, was a former news anchor on Israeli news channels, but has been one of the more
*  recognisable faces of the Israeli state since it began wiping Gaza off the face of the earth
*  back in October. Now, it was originally announced he'd been suspended a week ago after the
*  around with the British government. Normally, this would be a case of, oh God, can't they both just
*  lose? But let's just go over what happened. Elan Levy spread Israeli lies, bluntly speaking,
*  about the drivers behind the growing famine in Gaza, which has been entirely manufactured,
*  of course, by the Israeli state. Our foreign secretary, Lord David Cameron, declared,
*  we continue to urge Israel to allow more trucks into Gaza as the fastest way to get aid to those
*  who need it. Now, Elan Levy responded on Twitter that it's factually incorrect that the flow of
*  aid hasn't increased, claiming Israel's crossings had excess capacity. If the UK wants more aid to
*  enter Gaza, it should send it in and Israel would make sure it gets it. Now, this annoyed the UK,
*  who presumably thought he was being impertinent. In any case, a subsequent letter from Lord David
*  Cameron to Tory MP Alicia Kearns, who heads the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, made clear
*  Israel was intentionally blocking aid, i.e. deliberately starving Gaza to death, contradicting,
*  for example, claims that the United Nations had requested the crucial Keram Shalom crossing be
*  closed on Saturday. David Cameron made clear that's down to Israel closing it on the Sabbath and then
*  detailed how the main blocks remain arbitrary denials by the Israeli government, lengthy clearing
*  procedures, multiple screenings, narrow opening windows in daylight hours with UK aid routinely
*  held up waiting for Israeli permission, with some UK-funded aid stuck at the border for just under
*  three weeks waiting for approval. Now, let's just listen to Alicia Kearns here.
*  But he responded to your claims. That was his choice. Did you feel that he overstepped?
*  Well, unfortunately, what he was saying was factually inaccurate. You know, he essentially
*  said to the UK, test us. Those are the exact words he used. He said, we can get another 100 trucks of
*  aid into Gaza every day if you send them to us. That is not true. He also said that the UN, as I
*  said earlier, had asked for crossings to be closed on Saturdays. That is also categorically untrue.
*  And I think it's really important when we are talking about people's lives that we are factually
*  accurate in the conversations we have. And that is why I challenged him repeatedly.
*  Factually inaccurate, she says. Well, I think that's pretty generous of Alicia Kearns, if she
*  doesn't mind me saying so. It seems very clear to me that Eil al-Evvi was spreading official Israeli
*  lies. How could he not know these claims were false? It's not simply a case of being incompetent
*  here. Why would he falsely believe the United Nations requested a crucial crossing was closed
*  on a Saturday, for example, when his own government was responsible? Now, the UK is, of course, a key
*  ally of Israel. So let's not give it too much credit here because it's not using its leverage
*  over Israel. Even though it knows full well Israel is deliberately starving Gaza to death.
*  But clearly it felt this spokesperson was embarrassing them. The crime of Eil al-Evvi
*  wasn't spreading deceit, but not spreading deceit well enough. Now, Eil al-Evvi has been at the
*  forefront of spinning narratives in support of Israeli crimes which have proved murderous.
*  He led the public smear campaign against UNRWA, Gaza's main humanitarian agency, which began in
*  earnest as soon as the ICJ issued its provisional orders, which include instructing Israel to ensure
*  access to humanitarian aid. That smear campaign led multiple donor countries, including the UK,
*  to suspend financial support for UNRWA, strangling the main humanitarian agency as catastrophe gripped
*  the people of Gaza. No substantial evidence has been provided to justify this claim,
*  belatedly leading donor nations like the European Union and Canada to restore funding. But alas,
*  too late, the damage is done. Now, Eil al-Evvi has the disgusting temerity to claim that UNRWA is a
*  Hamas front, which he repeatedly says. Notes, incidentally, that UNRWA submits a list of
*  employees every single year to Israel for vetting. We've seen the biggest killing of UN aid agencies,
*  aid agency workers in such a short space of time ever in the history of the United Nations.
*  What the sort of rhetoric used by Eil al-Evvi does is put a target on the backs of all of them.
*  Now, UNRWA has been barred by Israel from entering northern Gaza, where the situation is
*  apocalyptic. That itself is, of course, genocidal implications, because it means
*  contributing to the mass death, starvation of the Palestinian people. Now, Eil al-Evvi spread the
*  propaganda about Al-Shifa Hospital, Gaza's main hospital, which Israeli stated claim was the main
*  headquarters of what they described as the terrorist activities of Hamas, which was used to just fight
*  waging war in a hospital, slaughtering doctors and nurses and patients. They had to dig a mass grave
*  and then moving on to destroy the rest of Gaza's health care system by bombs, bullets, artillery,
*  you name it. Now, investigation by the Washington Post found Israel's claims about Al-Shifa Hospital
*  to be nonsense, but too late, because the tension moved on and the health care system was trashed,
*  a key plank of a genocidal onslaught. This is always a modus operandi of the Israeli state.
*  What they do is they say something, they make claims about a terrible atrocity that are false,
*  muddy the waters, cause confusion, wait for tension to move on, and then it's clear that
*  they were talking complete nonsense. Well, people aren't talking about it anymore. Now,
*  Eil al-Evvi's variously spread propaganda about Israel massacring Palestinians who were desperate
*  for food, claiming they were crushed in a stampede. Well, subsequently, of course, found these bodies,
*  medics who had to receive these bodies en masse. They all have bullet wounds, the vast majority of
*  bullet wounds. Some were crushed in a stampede after bullets were fired at them, so people fled
*  in panic, causing a stampede. But the vast majority were killed by bullets. Eil al-Evvi's
*  belief in collective guilt, which is a necessary precondition for genocide, was underlined by a
*  clip he posted, in which he and a guest argued Palestinians and Hamas were essentially one.
*  If you watch the clip, I mean, what conclusion can you draw from it? They were arguing
*  that it's West-splaining when it was said that Hamas and the Palestinian people was
*  distinct and Hamas didn't represent the Palestinians, and even Hamas's enemies,
*  Fatah, celebrated Hamas. Now, given he keeps calling for Hamas to be entirely exterminated
*  by military means, we can see the general issue here with the Israeli state, because when they
*  say, we don't target innocent, uninvolved civilians, well, they're not exactly being clear about what
*  they mean there, are they? Because how they define innocent, uninvolved civilians. It's very clear,
*  if you watch a lot of media coverage in Israel, they don't believe in innocent civilians, a lot of
*  them, which is why the speech at the beginning of all this by Isaac Herzog, the president of Israel,
*  not, I would note, a member of the right-wing Likud party, but hailing from the Labour Party in
*  Israel, was so instructive because he publicly declared, it's an entire nation out there that's
*  responsible. This rhetoric about civilians not aware, not involved, is absolutely not true.
*  Well, that's clearly the mentality of the Israeli state, which is why we've seen this level of
*  genocidal violence, because they believe in collective guilt. That's the problem. That's why
*  collective guilt leads to genocide. Now, let's just look at this segment from BBC Newsnight,
*  when Victoria Derbyshire, like most journalists, put this guy under pressure.
*  We have been pursuing them in full accordance of international law.
*  I want to, and that is disputed, I want to ask you about these comments made by Israeli politicians
*  since October the 7th, and hopefully we can bring up the quotes. Here we are, this is your president,
*  it's an entire nation out there that's responsible, he's referring to Gazans. Have a look at this.
*  The next one. We are now actually rolling out the Gaza knack bar. Knack bar, as people know, is a
*  term for catastrophe after the 1948 war, a war used by Palestinians about ethnic cleansing.
*  And we all have one common goal, erasing the Gaza Strip from the face of the earth.
*  Can you see why some people believe that you absolutely don't want Palestinians any longer
*  We think we have been very clear, both in word and in deed.
*  In those words?
*  Well, Mr Vetturi does not make decisions on security matters in Israel. We think we've been
*  very clear both in word and in deed that the people of Gaza are not our enemy. Our enemy is
*  the Hamas regime, and that is why we have gone further than any army in the history of the world
*  to try to get civilians out of harm's way. Now we just have the formal-
*  I'm going to bring you back to the words of those politicians if I may. We're now actually
*  rolling out the Gaza knack bar. Knack bar, the Palestinian term for ethnic cleansing.
*  Okay. Those are the words of a government minister in your government.
*  Talk about a little bit of historical context, what the Palestinians refer to as the knack bar.
*  I'm just asking you about those words.
*  No, so I want to talk about that word knack bar. When the Palestinians use the word knack bar,
*  they are referring to the consequences of the decision in 1948 to try to scuttle the
*  creation of a Jewish state under the UN General Assembly resolution. They declared war in 1948,
*  that war of annihilation did not go their way, and there were consequences as a result.
*  And how is that relevant to what your government minister has said now? Because what he is saying
*  is we want to get rid of these people.
*  No, we do not want to get rid of these people. We have been very clear in word and indeed as a
*  government and as the Prime Minister and the Defence Minister have said that we urge civilians to get
*  to safety in the safe zone. We've been urging them to go to the safe zone.
*  Now his description of the knack bar there is very instructive because three quarters of a
*  million or so Palestinians were driven from their homes in 1948. In fact, the vast majority
*  of those living in Gaza are the relatives, the descendants of those refugees. Some of them are
*  still surviving refugees from 1948 and 15,000 Palestinians at the time were violently slaughtered
*  in an orgy of horrifying violence. Neila Levy describes that actually as the consequences
*  Palestinians brought themselves. You just need to do a bit of two plus two there to understand what
*  he means therefore in the current context because what he's talking about is he's asked about what's
*  been said since 7th of October within Israeli ministers calling for a new knack bar.
*  And his response to that was well actually the knack bar is something the Palestinians
*  brought themselves as their own consequences of what they did. Well,
*  you can see what that means in this context given the 7th of October and the response to 7th of
*  October. Now finally, there was that question about what happened on 7th of October itself.
*  As I've said over and over again, Hamas and other armed groups committed terrible and
*  unjustifiable war crimes against Israeli civilians. There's absolutely no doubt about
*  that whatsoever. Now there were also a series of false claims made by the Israeli state as
*  outriders who frankly tended to focus on the false claims rather than the actual claims which are
*  committed. And they did that for a very straightforward reason given they were inevitably going to kill
*  far more innocent people than the Hamas and other armed groups did. They had to build a case that
*  their form of violence, Israel's violence was morally superior to Hamas' violence. Hence claims
*  like the heading babies, burning babies and so on. Or for example, the execution of a family after
*  they were slowly tortured to death in the most hideous way. Now these claims have been extensively
*  debunked not least actually by Israeli media which has often done a better job than Western media
*  outlets. And also note of course the recent Al Jazeera documentary which has gone into great
*  detail about those claims. What actually happened 7th of October and what didn't happen 7th of October.
*  But I would note that the now suspended Elon Levy is still spreading false claims. He quote
*  tweeted the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres and wrote, the world must not encourage the
*  Palestinians to look back at the gang rapes and baby burnings of 10-7 and think hey those atrocities
*  really pushed our national cause forward. But that is exactly what the UN Secretary General is doing.
*  TLDR, terrorism pays. TLDR for those who don't know what it means. It's too long to read.
*  Too long so he didn't read. It's supposed to refer to basically it's supposed to be like here's a
*  summary. Here's a kind of quick summary of what I'm saying. Now I stand by what I've said
*  repeatedly. That's very serious claims of sexual violence against Israeli women and Palestinian
*  women and children need to be taken seriously investigated. Multiple have been made. I would
*  note that the most famous piece of journalism on what he's describing published by the New York
*  Times has been a significant part debunked including by the paper itself which published
*  a quite extraordinary piece. This proving claims made about two women being raped at a kibbutz
*  because of new video evidence. It contradicted a detailed testimony from a military paramedic
*  which was so detailed it could not have been mistaken. I'm not going to go into detail because
*  it's actually really graphic and the point I'm making there is it's not possible for this to be
*  a case of trauma meaning because I think it is plausible you could have had in some cases
*  first responders who aren't necessarily got the right training looking at scenes of terrible
*  horror and jumping to conclusions when they're overwhelmed by emotion which aren't actually
*  supported by evidence. This was too detailed and graphic it just it has to be a lie. It's
*  contradicted by video evidence which is why New York Times has written a new piece about it.
*  Guests who introduced that military paramedic to media outlets a certain Elon Levy. Now obviously
*  there are claims about sexual violence which still need to be investigated and I'm not saying that no
*  sexual violence rape happened for example on 7th of October that does need to be investigated and
*  we know in all situations in which there are men with guns there's a long history I'm afraid
*  of sexual violence taking place. We also know there are multiple claims of Palestinian women and
*  children being raped and sexually abused. What I would note is this serious specific claim was false
*  and note whose fingerprints were all over that claim but his point about baby burnings is just a
*  lie. No one claims this now based on actual evidence. One Israeli baby was killed on the
*  7th of October. Now one baby being killed is clearly one maybe too many. It's horrible in
*  its own terms. That baby was killed by being shot through the door of a safe room. Now in contrast
*  14 000 Palestinian children plus some would suggest significantly more depending on how many
*  are buried under the rubble but at least many many hundreds of them babies have been burned to death
*  or slowly suffocated to death under rubble or burned and suffocated to death. So what's so perverse
*  is false claims about babies being burned to death by you know Levi and his ilk have been used
*  to justify a military onslaught which has burned multiple many babies to death. That really is the
*  world turned upside down and that's the point there of extreme claims which were used to justify
*  genocidal violence to make western audiences think well I'm very distressed about this horror now in
*  Gaza but then Aylan Levy's like remember what happened on 7th of October those babies were
*  burned to death. That was a function of what he was doing. Now there have been many like Aylan
*  Levy throughout history terrible crimes throughout history committed by states and they've always had
*  propagandist to lie to smear to deflect to cover up to gaslight to obfuscate to project. There's
*  nothing new about Aylan Levy. Well I will keep on noting that the genocide convention 1948 listed
*  five crimes two of which were on the one hand direct and public incitement to commit genocide
*  and another was complicity in genocide. Well I strongly believe that Israel is committing
*  genocide. I think the evidence is overwhelming based on the stated intent of Israeli leaders
*  and officials and of course what's happened on the ground and that therefore at the very least
*  Aylan Levy is guilty of complicity in genocide and he should be held to account. It is easy so
*  easy of course to scapegoat villains like Aylan Levy and we should not stop holding all those
*  responsible for this crime to account. Many many lives depend on us doing so. Please like and
