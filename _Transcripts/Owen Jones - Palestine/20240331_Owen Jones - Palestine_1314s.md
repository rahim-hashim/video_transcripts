# Israel Assault On Rafah Means "Annihilation": w/. Unicef's James Elder, Live From Gaza
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [March 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc)
*  Most of Gaza's population are now crammed into Rafa, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=0.0s)]
*  which is in the very south, just near the border with Egypt. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=3.48s)]
*  Obviously, the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=7.36s)]
*  is extremely difficult to put into words. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=9.96s)]
*  The fastest collapse in the nutritional status of a population [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=11.84s)]
*  in recorded history, famine looming particularly in the north. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=14.88s)]
*  But I'm really delighted to be joined by James Elder, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=18.68s)]
*  who's spokesperson for UNICEF, who I'm sure you're all very familiar with, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=20.8s)]
*  who is joining me live from Rafa in Gaza. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=24.44s)]
*  Hey, James, how are you doing, first of all? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=27.68s)]
*  G'day, yo, nice to connect, thanks. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=29.24s)]
*  Can you just explain the conditions that you're looking at? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  Because one of the things we always hear when people go into Gaza [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  is whatever we see on our timelines, on social media, elsewhere, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=36.64s)]
*  it's only really a fraction of... [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=41.6s)]
*  There's only so much that we can even possibly understand [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=43.56s)]
*  the actual horror of what's there. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=46.28s)]
*  So can you kind of explain the sorts of things you're seeing in Rafa? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, you're dead, right? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  Part of it is that when I look at destructions [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=52.4s)]
*  that I have not seen in my 20 years with the UN, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  when I just literally see home after home turned into rubble, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=58.28s)]
*  then you... And your frame of reference, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=62.2s)]
*  I can't see all of it everywhere you turn, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=64.76s)]
*  but then break that down a bit, oh, and of course, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=67.0s)]
*  that home is someone's home, and like everywhere in the world, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=69.28s)]
*  then I... By being here for enough time, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=72.0s)]
*  I get to talk to those families who've lost their home, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  one part of Gaza, who are like, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=77.12s)]
*  James, I spent my... This is my entire life's work, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=79.44s)]
*  and it's now in rubble. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=82.32000000000001s)]
*  I'm 50, 60 years old. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=84.4s)]
*  I don't have time to do this again. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=86.08000000000001s)]
*  So you look into that little cousin of their life, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=88.52000000000001s)]
*  or of course, the family members killed in that home. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=91.04s)]
*  So, yes, and then in the same way here in Rafa, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=94.16000000000001s)]
*  it's hard to capture... [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=96.76s)]
*  Sometimes I just look at a child's face and they're sunken, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  and I think, yeah, that's the mental health crisis [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=100.84s)]
*  we're dealing with here. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  That is five months of children going to bed [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=104.44000000000001s)]
*  and apart from that very brief seven-day pause, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=107.72s)]
*  not knowing if they'll wake up. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=110.60000000000001s)]
*  And it's not an exaggeration, no, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=112.0s)]
*  and it's really not because you lie in bed, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=113.64s)]
*  the bombardments are immense. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=116.08s)]
*  They were immense last night, they were immense all day today, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=117.47999999999999s)]
*  building shake, your tent, you know, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=120.0s)]
*  the wind pushes through your tent. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  They all know someone who's been killed. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  Many of these kids hide in hospitals where day after day, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=125.83999999999999s)]
*  oh, there's a new child with an amputation. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=128.79999999999998s)]
*  They're seeing it raw. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=131.4s)]
*  So I see these children, and Mas and Rafa is a city of children. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=133.2s)]
*  And then, of course, you think, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=137.32s)]
*  okay, what are they doing each day in terms of sanitation? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=138.48s)]
*  You know, there's 900 kids for a toilet. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=141.44s)]
*  Multiply that by four for a shower, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=144.84s)]
*  three and a half thousand children for a shower. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=146.48000000000002s)]
*  So an adolescent girl, so what you're seeing [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=149.36s)]
*  is this destruction of homes, this destruction of lives, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=152.04000000000002s)]
*  literally this insane number of children killed, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=155.52s)]
*  and you're seeing a denial of dignity in everyday sanitation. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=158.52s)]
*  And these are deliberate, which I think is a key point. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=161.28s)]
*  I mean, obviously, UNICEF children, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=166.8s)]
*  that's what you're focusing on, obviously. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  And half of Gaza's population are there, about the children. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=171.08s)]
*  And just some of the statistics we know, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  I mean, we don't, including those buried under the rubble, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=176.44s)]
*  we're talking 14,000 plus, perhaps, kids [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=178.60000000000002s)]
*  who've been killed since this horror began. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=180.96s)]
*  I mean, I've seen statistics, you know, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=183.8s)]
*  about 10 children a day being amputated off without anaesthetic. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=185.44s)]
*  So just, I mean, in terms of the sorts of, I mean, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=188.28s)]
*  the injuries that you're seeing with kids [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=190.68s)]
*  and kids who've lost their parents, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=192.84s)]
*  can you tell us a bit about that, perhaps? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=194.76000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I'm often asked, and it's a fair question, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=196.88s)]
*  you know, how this compares to other crises I've been in. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=200.32000000000002s)]
*  And honestly, I don't say this as a line. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=203.0s)]
*  A child is a child, okay? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=205.44s)]
*  And from Ukraine to Afghanistan to Ethiopia, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=207.08s)]
*  what strikes me here is everywhere I turn around [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=210.24s)]
*  is almost the normalisation of horror. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=214.32000000000002s)]
*  The idea that I can hear from a child [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=217.20000000000002s)]
*  that they've lost their entire family, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=219.68s)]
*  this wounded child, no surviving family. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=221.56s)]
*  That's no longer normal. It's just, you hear that. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=223.48000000000002s)]
*  I speak to a colleague and their entire family, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=225.8s)]
*  35 people have been killed, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=228.36s)]
*  and they would have died, but they were coming home late. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=229.76s)]
*  And so when I'm in hospitals, as I was two hours ago, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  oh, and I'm in the ICU. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=236.32s)]
*  Now, this hospital, if I'm talking about European hospital, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=238.52s)]
*  the biggest functioning hospital is still here in Raffa. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=240.64s)]
*  And that will be under immense threat if there's a military offensive. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=243.12s)]
*  There's 20,000 plus people hiding it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=246.28s)]
*  Now, the ICU for children is full, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=248.8s)]
*  and every time there was a little girl, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=251.16s)]
*  Salma means peace. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=252.8s)]
*  Every time I turn around, there is a child with the wounds of war, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=254.64s)]
*  and the wounds of war are many, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=257.92s)]
*  because when... I don't know if you can hear the explosions now. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=260.0s)]
*  You know, shrapnel is glass and so on. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=263.12s)]
*  That's a nightmare for a kid. The burns are horrendous. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=265.0s)]
*  I force myself, you're the one who coined this phrase, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=267.68s)]
*  you know, that we can't look away. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=270.64s)]
*  And I thought of that even in November, and I still do it. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  There's a smell and a sight. You want to look away. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=275.2s)]
*  But I don't think we should. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=278.48s)]
*  And sometimes you never know. You might capture a child's eye, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=279.8s)]
*  and you might get a glimmer of a smile in there. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=282.32s)]
*  And then there's the broken bones. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=285.48s)]
*  So, you know, I remember a little boy, Mohammed, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=287.03999999999996s)]
*  who was 10, 11, and there's not many good news stories here. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=289.84s)]
*  And I went in, he had bad burns, but he didn't have broken bones. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=295.52s)]
*  And just as I walked in, and he did this little... [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=298.52s)]
*  did a little thumbs up, unsolicited thumbs up, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=300.79999999999995s)]
*  and I could see the pain in doing that. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=303.03999999999996s)]
*  And I thought, wow, there's something about this boy, you know? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=305.44s)]
*  And then I spoke to the adult with him. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=307.88s)]
*  He showed me photos, and he'd won all these prizes, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=310.12s)]
*  school's smartest kid in the class. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=312.28s)]
*  And I saw pics, and I went, he's going to be OK. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=314.6s)]
*  It's a good news story. There's little Mohammed. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=317.04s)]
*  There's a spark to this boy. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=318.88s)]
*  And then I spoke to the adult, who I thought was his father, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=320.56s)]
*  and he explained that when Mohammed's house was bombed, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=323.16s)]
*  his entire family, his mum, his dad, his siblings, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=325.48s)]
*  his aunts, his uncles, his grandparents, everyone was killed. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=328.2s)]
*  Mohammed's the only one left. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=330.96s)]
*  That story I've heard... [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=333.12s)]
*  I never thought I'd hear that story in my life. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=335.28s)]
*  I hear that story time and again. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=336.8s)]
*  You know, today in the hospital, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=339.36s)]
*  I was talking to a little boy and a little girl, brother and sister. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=340.8s)]
*  So the boys lost his eye. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=343.08s)]
*  The girl, sweet little girl, Mariam, she's disfigured. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=344.64s)]
*  So she's so shy now because of what they've done to her face. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=347.84s)]
*  I'm talking to them, and just across the corridor, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=351.68s)]
*  right behind me is a mum who's had her leg amputated, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=353.8s)]
*  her son who's critically ill, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=356.76s)]
*  and the husband is downstairs, he's lost two limbs. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=358.28s)]
*  This is all in the last few days post the ceasefire decision. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=360.56s)]
*  I mean, just on that, you know, I've spoken to so many... [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=365.64s)]
*  I was speaking to a Palestinian in Rafah yesterday, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=368.88s)]
*  who lost his mother the other week. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=371.6s)]
*  He'd tell me about the collapse and their weight, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=373.68s)]
*  the horrors they've gone through, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=375.48s)]
*  and other relatives, those ones missing, presumed dead. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=377.24s)]
*  I find it very difficult to understand how, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=380.16s)]
*  you know, when I speak to Palestinians who've lost 21, 23 family members, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=382.64s)]
*  how you even begin to process that. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=385.24s)]
*  But with children, I just don't understand, in terms of the lot, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=386.8s)]
*  you know, how a child's... [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=390.36s)]
*  The lifelong consequences of the sorts of trauma, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=392.48s)]
*  which are beyond the imagination of most of them, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=395.56s)]
*  that psychological impact on them. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=397.36s)]
*  I mean, what's your thoughts on that? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=399.48s)]
*  That kind of lasting, irreversible trauma [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=400.88s)]
*  that so many children face in Gaza? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=403.23999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I've struggled to try and understand it. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=406.11999999999995s)]
*  So I've actually spoken to a child psychologist [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=409.15999999999997s)]
*  who explained we are in uncharted territory. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=410.88s)]
*  It's not an exaggeration to say that every single child here needs... [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=414.35999999999996s)]
*  I don't know if you can hear the explosions. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=417.91999999999996s)]
*  Every single child needs mental health support. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=419.23999999999995s)]
*  Because again, there's no exaggeration to say it. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=421.67999999999995s)]
*  We have not had for four months a child does not go to sleep at night [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=425.15999999999997s)]
*  with their parent and know they will wake up. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=427.96s)]
*  And when you're at night time and the bombardments are really intense, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=430.56s)]
*  I see the look in children's faces. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=433.08s)]
*  I see almost childhood being drained out of them. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=435.44s)]
*  And I wanted to understand where are we? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=438.32s)]
*  And child psychologists explained to me, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=439.88s)]
*  we are in uncharted territory. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=441.76s)]
*  It's no exaggeration that every single child here [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=443.84s)]
*  is going to need some sort of mental health support. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=446.71999999999997s)]
*  The bombardments don't stop. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=448.68s)]
*  Every night, there's no song a mum can sing to her child [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=450.76s)]
*  to drown out the sound of these bombs. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=455.28s)]
*  Or as you rightly say, the family members that have been killed, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=457.56s)]
*  the number of times just now again, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=460.32s)]
*  I talked to a little boy who was trying to go home [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=462.2s)]
*  to retrieve some macaroni and some food from the house. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=464.8s)]
*  A car was targeted. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=467.56s)]
*  He was badly injured. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=469.0s)]
*  Talking to me for 10 minutes and only after 10 minutes did he explain [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=470.08s)]
*  during that he was next to his uncle who was also killed. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=473.12s)]
*  Because there's so much horror that they are dealing with. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=476.8s)]
*  Right now, Gaza is not a place for children. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=480.2s)]
*  Like their recovery cannot possibly start now, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=483.36s)]
*  amid this war that is somehow deteriorating, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=487.28s)]
*  getting worse and of course, their coping capacities are getting worse. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=490.16s)]
*  So it's only when there's peace and then psychologists start [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=494.0s)]
*  to put it back together. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=498.64s)]
*  So it's not a place for kids. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=500.08s)]
*  But Gaza is full of children. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=501.68s)]
*  So we have to try and see what does this ultimately look like. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=503.92s)]
*  And I think what the world is missing, as any economist will tell you, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=506.96s)]
*  half the population being children, if you get that right, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=510.6s)]
*  you give them the right skills and education and job opportunities, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=515.08s)]
*  then it's a demographic dividend. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=519.1600000000001s)]
*  It's a boom. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=522.0s)]
*  It's the envy of an age in Europe. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=522.84s)]
*  If you get it wrong, and everything that is being done now is textbook wrong, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=525.24s)]
*  it's a demographic disaster. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=530.5200000000001s)]
*  And I wish people would see even beyond the now of what they're doing. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=532.08s)]
*  If people aren't able to act based on the principle of what's happened, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=536.12s)]
*  maybe they can understand the economic practice behind it. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=540.44s)]
*  I know you won't want to get into the politics of it, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=544.0400000000001s)]
*  but in terms of just aid and food, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=545.84s)]
*  David Cameron, the British Foreign Secretary, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=548.4s)]
*  I thought released a devastating letter [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=550.48s)]
*  disputing Israel's own official claims about aid and access to aid [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=552.4s)]
*  in terms of delays, in terms of processing, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=556.6800000000001s)]
*  closing the crossings on the Saturday, for Sabbath, that kind of thing. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=558.8000000000001s)]
*  A, just being stuck for weeks, not getting in. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=563.04s)]
*  And it was very damning because it suggested intentional blocks. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=565.5600000000001s)]
*  And medical aid for Palestinians have said [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=570.08s)]
*  this is the fastest decline in nutritional status of the population. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=571.64s)]
*  And just when it was, because I know in Ra'afet, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=574.5600000000001s)]
*  in the North, it's the worst. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=576.88s)]
*  But what's the sort of information, what are you seeing in terms of hunger [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=579.08s)]
*  and the situation in terms of famine that we're hearing being discussed at the moment? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=581.6s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. So the idea of imminent famine is the language. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=586.36s)]
*  And remembering that is used by the most respected body in the world [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=589.2s)]
*  that covers this. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=593.24s)]
*  When I've been to the North several times months ago, twice on this trip, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=594.36s)]
*  okay, it's difficult to get to the North, even though it's only 20, 30 miles away. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=598.44s)]
*  The number of checkpoints, it takes days for clearances. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=601.96s)]
*  You get turned back when we finally got there, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=604.68s)]
*  north of the final checkpoint through Gaza City and beyond. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=607.28s)]
*  Then you just got tens of thousands of people on the street, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=611.88s)]
*  men, women and children doing that universal sign of hunger. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=615.72s)]
*  As I say, it's forced desperation. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=619.88s)]
*  I don't like the idea that people paint them as somehow desperate [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=622.48s)]
*  through their own fault. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=625.52s)]
*  If aid was regularly getting there, as it should be, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=628.4399999999999s)]
*  humanitarian assistance on a daily basis, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=632.08s)]
*  then there'd be no desperation. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=634.5600000000001s)]
*  People would trust the idea that we're going to see flour. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=635.8000000000001s)]
*  But as it is, they don't see it for a week. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=638.36s)]
*  So we have a megaphone saying it's just medicines [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=640.24s)]
*  and people just wave us through. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=643.6s)]
*  But then I get to hospitals, which are full of malnourished children. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=646.2s)]
*  And when I say malnourished, I mean paper thin. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=650.7600000000001s)]
*  I mean their bodies starting to eat itself to survive. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=654.0400000000001s)]
*  I mean, the only sound I hear is mum saying to me, ceasefire, ceasefire. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=657.1600000000001s)]
*  It's amazing that this word captures them as well. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=661.28s)]
*  Mums are in tears because mums have done everything for four or five months [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=664.64s)]
*  to protect their children from the bombardment. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=668.52s)]
*  And now they're faced with starvation. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=671.32s)]
*  And I think now parents have really understood [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=673.24s)]
*  that the ability to protect their children has been taken away from them. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=675.92s)]
*  That ability now is in the hands of someone else, some other decision maker. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=678.96s)]
*  And so then we talk about the decisions of why there's such a lack of aid. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=683.08s)]
*  And it's a he said, she said, it shouldn't be. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=686.32s)]
*  You know, truth matters and numbers matter. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=688.52s)]
*  And maybe the most simple two simple numbers are in the last six months, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=691.04s)]
*  around 70 percent, 70 percent less than the normal amount has gone through. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=696.0s)]
*  So one third of the amount of aid and commercial supplies [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=700.32s)]
*  has reached the Gaza Strip as normally would. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=704.24s)]
*  One third. And the other one is just entry point. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=707.92s)]
*  So there are two crossings in the north. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=710.28s)]
*  One of them is 10 minutes away from those mothers [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=712.44s)]
*  or those people with hand to the mouth, 10 minutes away. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=715.68s)]
*  And we're not allowed to use it. It won't be open. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=718.52s)]
*  Now, this is how you turn this around. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=720.36s)]
*  It's manmade. It's preventable. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=723.2s)]
*  You want to be really optimistic because it's manmade. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=725.5600000000001s)]
*  It can be reversed. Open those, flood that area. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=727.72s)]
*  And you can actually reverse this catastrophic nutritional situation [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=730.6s)]
*  for children and for adults. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=734.76s)]
*  Because the other point often missing is that as well as far less aid [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=737.12s)]
*  coming in there before, homegrown food production has been devastated [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=740.36s)]
*  as an agriculture. So it's a double whammy. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=743.04s)]
*  Totally. And it's a great point. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=745.84s)]
*  And a lot of people miss it that, you know, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=747.2s)]
*  in the north in Jabalia, where it's horrendous desperation [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=750.24s)]
*  that these people have been put into. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=754.3199999999999s)]
*  It's so inhumane. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=756.64s)]
*  It was known for its... [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=760.0799999999999s)]
*  Sorry. It was known for its strawberries. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=761.9599999999999s)]
*  Really was. It was anyone who would talk about it, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=764.48s)]
*  no matter where you were from in the Gaza Strip or coming from Israel. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=766.68s)]
*  It was the strawberries there. Absolutely decimated. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=769.64s)]
*  And so, interestingly now, if you've got money and a lot of money, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=772.36s)]
*  there is some canned food for people to buy. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=777.24s)]
*  If you don't, and remembering a lot of people in the north, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=779.16s)]
*  they didn't leave because they couldn't, right? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=782.24s)]
*  Economically, they couldn't leave five months ago. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=784.16s)]
*  That's why a lot of them stayed. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=787.0s)]
*  They are now... There's a particular type of grass. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=788.8s)]
*  It's a wild grass that culturally, historically people have eaten. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=791.0s)]
*  And still there are some lemon plantations that haven't been destroyed. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=794.36s)]
*  So for most people, it's that grass with a bit of lemon. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=797.8s)]
*  Now, that's for mothers and newborns and pregnant women, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=800.92s)]
*  lack of clean water, the threats. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=806.32s)]
*  Every time you go to a hospital in terms of snipers and so on, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=808.5999999999999s)]
*  that's why we are now seeing this decline, as you said, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=812.3599999999999s)]
*  on this record decline into this imminent famine. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=817.68s)]
*  And the thing is, it gets worse by the day. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=822.92s)]
*  This is what's hard to explain. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=824.8s)]
*  Obviously, people's coping mechanism is collapsing. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=826.0799999999999s)]
*  For the first time, I'm seeing people's hope collapsing. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=829.68s)]
*  And I sit with young people the other day, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=832.3199999999999s)]
*  a whole heap of brilliant 20-somethings, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=835.28s)]
*  doctors, dentists, engineers. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=838.08s)]
*  None of them want to leave. None of them want to leave. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=840.08s)]
*  They've already left their homes. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=842.24s)]
*  Their homes have been destroyed. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=843.48s)]
*  Their homes are rubble. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=844.84s)]
*  None of them want to leave Gaza. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=846.12s)]
*  All of them want out of Gaza. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=848.0s)]
*  And then you turn this in, then you start seeing the brain drain [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=850.16s)]
*  for what's happening here. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=852.92s)]
*  So for the first time, and they asked me, do I see hope? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=854.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=858.2s)]
*  What to say? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=859.6s)]
*  And then we've sat with teenage girls [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=861.0s)]
*  who have explained that they lie in bed at night hoping a bomb hits them. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=863.3599999999999s)]
*  They are hoping to be killed, such as the torment, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=870.12s)]
*  such as the daily struggle for the most basics of sanitation and hygiene [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=873.04s)]
*  and having lost family members. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=877.4799999999999s)]
*  Again, normalizing the horrors. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=879.4399999999999s)]
*  I never thought I would hear these things. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=882.12s)]
*  And suddenly, they're not even uncommon statements. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=884.0799999999999s)]
*  It's just what people are enduring. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=887.8399999999999s)]
*  And as the world discusses a potential military offensive in Raqqa, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=890.4000000000001s)]
*  the conversations continue and people are aware of that. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=896.32s)]
*  So their hope rose dramatically on Monday after that Security Council decision. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=899.1600000000001s)]
*  And their hope has been drowned out by bombs ever since. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=905.5200000000001s)]
*  I'd say every day I get dozens of GoFundMe's from Palestinians in Gaza, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=908.96s)]
*  obviously desperate to raise money to flee. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=912.96s)]
*  So I can't even imagine just seeing that desperation up front. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=915.2800000000001s)]
*  In terms of just the level of destruction that, you know, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=918.6s)]
*  it's been said that from space, Gaza is now a different color and texture. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=921.84s)]
*  What's the kind of destruction you're seeing around? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=925.1600000000001s)]
*  I know the South has been horribly damaged, but not as much as the North. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=927.72s)]
*  But what kind of what are you seeing? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=930.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so Khan Yunus is the city right next to me in Raqqa. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=932.76s)]
*  So it still is the South. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=935.64s)]
*  I spent a lot of time in November, December, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=936.84s)]
*  because I would consistently go to NASA hospital. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=939.2s)]
*  I have not seen that level of devastation in my 20 years with the United Nations. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=942.4000000000001s)]
*  Complete annihilation. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=946.76s)]
*  OK, and your brain, I don't know, it goes to movies like World War Two films. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=948.44s)]
*  Yeah, street up street after street of three story, four story homes, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=953.9200000000001s)]
*  apartment blocks, offices leveled everywhere your eye can look. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=959.08s)]
*  I mean, I will send you footage of it everywhere. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=962.8000000000001s)]
*  Potentially, some people say worse than Gaza City. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=965.44s)]
*  And your viewers have probably seen the drones from there. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=967.72s)]
*  The same when I go to the north in Gaza City. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=970.12s)]
*  I'm with colleagues who are from there, who have grown up there, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=972.44s)]
*  who have never left there, who get lost now in Khan Yunus or Gaza City, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=974.88s)]
*  because there's no more landmarks. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=979.52s)]
*  They can't find their way around because the buildings they know are just gone. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=980.72s)]
*  So home after home, building after building. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=985.48s)]
*  Some are rubble and twisted metal. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=989.92s)]
*  Others are just dust as far as you can see. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=993.52s)]
*  And that's beyond the pale. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=996.4399999999999s)]
*  But beyond that is why I'm so terrified. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=999.08s)]
*  The idea that that military offensive is being spoken of, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1002.04s)]
*  promised to come to Rafa. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1005.12s)]
*  People have nowhere to go. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1007.64s)]
*  When you've got three and a half thousand people waiting to have a shower here, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1009.16s)]
*  there's nowhere to be moved to. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1013.0799999999999s)]
*  You can't move them to a pile of rubble. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1014.8s)]
*  And that's what is remaining, piles of rubble and the beach. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1016.88s)]
*  And just a couple of final things. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1020.8399999999999s)]
*  I mean, just as I said, I mean, because I just heard then we can hear the explosions. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1022.04s)]
*  I mean, do you ever just, is it possible to get used to that? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1026.68s)]
*  Or do you have this constant waves of terror when you just hear those explosions? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1029.72s)]
*  I mean, how does it become a normal? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1032.96s)]
*  Is it just always kind of heart beating? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1034.96s)]
*  Is that how it feels to be in somewhere like Gaza right now? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1037.76s)]
*  It's a great question. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1041.5200000000002s)]
*  I think in this moment, when I'm here back where we work, it becomes normal. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1042.44s)]
*  You see people kind of working. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1046.92s)]
*  Whenever I'm out at a hospital or in a community, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1048.68s)]
*  it never is because you see the response of children. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1051.4s)]
*  You see just that extra little bit of fear being reinforced. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1053.92s)]
*  And you see, you know, you see a moment of childhood, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1056.6s)]
*  another bit just being chopped away. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1059.9199999999998s)]
*  And then at night time, of course, when everyone feels a bit more vulnerable, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1061.96s)]
*  night time is difficult. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1066.72s)]
*  I've laid there at night and tried to sort of centre myself, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1067.9199999999998s)]
*  thinking of the kids out there hearing this again and again. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1071.44s)]
*  And you put your hands on your chest and just try to, you know, get warm. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1074.8799999999999s)]
*  It's cold and feel like I'm lying in a coffin. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1078.6s)]
*  And then think of all those children doing this night after night. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1081.9199999999998s)]
*  So, no, I don't think anyone... [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1085.28s)]
*  It's normal for anyone. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1087.36s)]
*  And the cumulative effect on it, on this Ikea, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1088.52s)]
*  beyond, of course, the cumulative effect of children killed every night, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1091.56s)]
*  is just devastating. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1095.0s)]
*  Before I ask the final question about in terms of a ceasefire [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1097.0s)]
*  and the proposed offensive of a marathon, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1100.24s)]
*  I mean, you mentioned the war zones that you've obviously... [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1101.84s)]
*  You mentioned Ukraine elsewhere. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1104.48s)]
*  How does this in general, just all, you know, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1105.8s)]
*  you mentioned the level of destruction beyond anything you've seen, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1108.16s)]
*  the suffering, how does this compare to what you've seen? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1110.64s)]
*  Because you've seen lots of horrors around the world. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1113.44s)]
*  Yeah, I think what's different here... [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1116.1200000000001s)]
*  So, I was recently... [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1117.5600000000002s)]
*  You know, as I say, I really mean it. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1119.6000000000001s)]
*  UNICEF means that a child is a child. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1121.44s)]
*  I was recently on the front lines in Ukraine [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1123.16s)]
*  and you're talking to these incredible women [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1125.3600000000001s)]
*  who are just so petrified of that next attack, right? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1127.5600000000002s)]
*  They're so petrified of occupation again. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1132.0800000000002s)]
*  Or I was in Sudan and there's four million children in space, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1134.6000000000001s)]
*  four million, it's astronomical. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1137.3200000000002s)]
*  What, at least for me, makes this place a little different [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1139.64s)]
*  to other places is the sheer... [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1143.04s)]
*  The sheer numbers of children killed, the sheer numbers of wounded. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1147.1599999999999s)]
*  As I... The injuries to children, how horrific they are. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1150.48s)]
*  Getting... When I get on a bus of children [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1154.08s)]
*  that have been taken three days, three days, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1155.76s)]
*  it's 20 miles from Schiffer Hospital, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1158.1599999999999s)]
*  three days because of checkpoints, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1160.28s)]
*  and the smell of burning flesh and of decaying flesh in there. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1161.8799999999999s)]
*  Everywhere I turn around in a hospital is another child, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1165.24s)]
*  another parent with a horrendous story, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1168.76s)]
*  another child with an amputation. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1170.72s)]
*  I've not seen that ubiquitous hell for kids. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1172.6399999999999s)]
*  And it's daily. I was in a hospital today [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1177.36s)]
*  and I'm looking in the ICU at children and realizing that... [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1179.48s)]
*  But, you know, that was... [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1183.0s)]
*  Hullard was there yesterday. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1184.9599999999998s)]
*  Well, Hullard's now dead. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1186.36s)]
*  Now that little girl, Arabic for Rose, I can't recall her name. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1187.7199999999998s)]
*  Now she's there. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1191.08s)]
*  That is something I've not seen before. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1193.12s)]
*  Just finally then, I mean, you mentioned, obviously, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1196.6799999999998s)]
*  the US Security Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1198.56s)]
*  which was Rose hopes there, and understandably, people, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1201.28s)]
*  just any hope at all, I can imagine, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1205.0s)]
*  is just a life raft for people at the moment. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1206.84s)]
*  Israel has said it will pursue an offensive against RAFA, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1209.0s)]
*  it's made clear it will do that. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1212.04s)]
*  Can you just spell out what that would actually mean, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1213.56s)]
*  bearing in mind, I think, 1.2 million or so Garzans [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1215.52s)]
*  are now trapped in RAFA. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1218.32s)]
*  What would an offensive against RAFA actually mean in practice? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1220.92s)]
*  A horrendous killing of children. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1225.48s)]
*  I'm sure there's... [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1228.52s)]
*  We don't know what is meant to happen to the population. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1229.72s)]
*  There's various ideas. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1232.48s)]
*  None has been floated. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1233.76s)]
*  People have already moved so many times, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1235.44s)]
*  they have nothing left to give. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1237.4s)]
*  But if you're moving them to a beach somewhere, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1239.44s)]
*  then you have to expect you'll now finally see [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1241.28s)]
*  that horrendous disease outbreak [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1243.48s)]
*  because you just don't have sanitation for people [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1245.64s)]
*  and they're already malnourished. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1247.76s)]
*  So you've got a perfect storm around a child's body [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1249.32s)]
*  being malnourished and with dirty water. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1251.52s)]
*  So that's if you move them. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1253.6s)]
*  Can you move that number of people? [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1254.88s)]
*  I don't think so. The people here, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1256.28s)]
*  there's elderly people. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1257.72s)]
*  I'm always struck by seeing people in their twilight years [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1259.0s)]
*  hobbling along, looking at their life around them, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1262.0800000000002s)]
*  that this is the end. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1264.4s)]
*  They can't leave, they won't leave. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1265.48s)]
*  So if you do what you did in Khanunus to RAFA, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1267.3600000000001s)]
*  then the world watches one of the great annihilations of a city [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1271.72s)]
*  and anyone who's left and unable to leave. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1275.88s)]
*  Horrific place to end it, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1280.76s)]
*  but sobering and desperately needed words, James. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1282.3600000000001s)]
*  You've been absolutely super-stylistically. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1284.88s)]
*  I can't imagine just the horror of what you've seen and witnessed, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1287.0s)]
*  but you spoke so eloquently and movingly. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1290.76s)]
*  These are words that have to be acted on [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1293.28s)]
*  because we're obviously seeing one of the great horrors of our time [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1294.76s)]
*  and you're bearing witness in a way that we're very fortunate to have you. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1297.96s)]
*  So do share this video for those watching or listening on the podcast. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1300.88s)]
*  Press like, get the word out, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1304.24s)]
*  make sure as many people hear James as possible. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1305.96s)]
*  But James, honestly, thanks so much for you [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1307.48s)]
*  and for your work and that of UNICEF. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1309.08s)]
*  Pleasure. Lovely to connect, mate. Thank you. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_olFrh1hUc&t=1311.4s)]
