# Holocaust Scholar Warns of Genocide Threat In Gaza
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [December 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8qGubNO_c0)
*  Hello, welcome. I'm delighted today to be joined by the brilliant Omar Batov,
*  who's the Samuel P. Saar Professor of Holocaust and Genocide Studies at Brown University,
*  a very accomplished scholar who's been writing a lot ever since,
*  on the horrors which have enveloped Gaza and Israel since the 7th of October.
*  Omar, hello, firstly, great to see you. How are you doing in these difficult times?
*  I just want to start by just the question of genocide, which is a live discussion when it comes to what's happening in Gaza.
*  I interviewed Razi Gal, who I know you know, who's an associate professor of genocide in Holocaust studies,
*  who thinks that this is a textbook genocide.
*  And I suppose the argument he makes is that it's rare for intent to be so openly stated,
*  rhetoric like quoting genocidal passages about Amalek in the Bible,
*  in which the Israelites are commanded to kill all men, women, children, babies, livestock.
*  You know, there are no innocents in Gaza, there are two million Nazis in the West Bank.
*  Just, you know, it's rare in these sorts of horrors for that kind of intent to be said.
*  It's normally covered up in other ways.
*  So I'm just interested what your thoughts are on that as another genocide scholar on the question of genocide.
*  So look, first, thanks for having me.
*  I wrote a few weeks ago already on my sense that there was a danger of genocide occurring in Gaza.
*  And I mentioned the fact that peculiarly, if you like, Israeli political and military leaders,
*  people with executive power had been making statements as of October 7th,
*  right at the beginning of this, that had that echoed genocidal intent.
*  We should wipe them out.
*  There are human animals.
*  We should flatten Gaza.
*  We should remove the population from Gaza and so forth.
*  And there was a kind of slippery slope between speaking about Hamas and speaking about Gazans in general.
*  Most Gazans are refugees, Palestinian refugees from 1948 and their descendants.
*  So that is, in truth, exceptional because often regimes carry out genocide while trying to present it as something else.
*  And here you had people with executive power making statements that could be interpreted as genocidal.
*  But that's not enough to establish that a genocide is going on.
*  You also need to see that it's happening on the ground.
*  So there has to be a link between statements and actions.
*  And in the case of Israeli military actions, my own thinking is that what we see right now is very likely war crimes
*  because of the great disproportionality between civilian and military or combatant losses.
*  We are talking about almost, it seems, 20,000 people have been killed.
*  And according to the idea of spokesperson himself, two out of three people killed are civilians.
*  He was sort of tapping himself on the shoulder when he said that.
*  But that means 10,000, 12,000 civilians killed, the majority of whom are women and children.
*  So there is evidence that there may be war crimes being carried out that may also indicate crimes against humanity,
*  extermination of large numbers of civilians.
*  In order for it to be genocide, you have to show that there is an intent in the operations to target specifically Palestinians as such.
*  That's part of the genocide definition.
*  Are they being targeted as Palestinians as such, not as excessive collateral damage?
*  And to my mind, what is most troubling right now, and that has developed since I last wrote about it,
*  is that about 1.8 million Palestinians out of 2.2 or 2.3 have been displaced.
*  They've been displaced, they've been concentrated in a very small territory.
*  The homes have largely been destroyed.
*  The Israeli army and government have not committed to allowing them back.
*  And they're now in conditions that are creating an ever-widening humanitarian disaster.
*  And there is great deal of talk in Israel about removing them entirely from Gaza, which would indicate that this is an operation of ethnic cleansing,
*  as one Israeli minister said.
*  This is Nakba 2023.
*  That is Nakba for the disaster of 1948, the expansion of 750,000 Palestinians in 1948.
*  Ethnic cleansing often deteriorates into genocide because people don't want to move.
*  And so in order to encourage them to move, you kill them.
*  And so we are, I think, right now at a point where ethnic cleansing seems to have been carried out and is ongoing.
*  And it may become genocidal.
*  I've been interested a lot in terms of the precedence in the wars of the Balkans in the 1990s.
*  And there's many, many differences in terms of dynamics, in terms of history.
*  But I am interested in the case of the Bosnian Serbs and the Bosnian Serb armies, I should say, to distinguish between civilians.
*  But the Serbs suffered genocide in World War II at the hands of the Ustasi, the Croatian collaborators,
*  who frankly the Nazis often got kind of shocked the Nazis with their sheer depravity.
*  And they exterminated Jews and Serbs.
*  And that became something of a pillar of modern Serb nationalism, which is we were exterminated in the past.
*  And therefore we have to, if we don't kill, we will be killed instead.
*  And that very much informed the approach of the Bosnian Serbs in the Bosnian War,
*  when they feared being basically submerged in what they regarded as an Islamist state.
*  And they suffered atrocities, Bosnian Serb civilians, terrible atrocities,
*  in the way that Israeli civilians also suffered terrible atrocities on the 7th of October.
*  I'm just wondering, do you think there's a parallel there?
*  Because none of that, we don't look at the history of the Bosnian Serbs in any way to justify
*  what they were found guilty of, which is genocide, specifically in Srebrenica in 1995.
*  So just is there parallels there between the Bosnian Serbs and Israel,
*  even though there are differences in history and dynamics?
*  Well, I mean, I think that there are parallels between that.
*  And I would say more generally, there's a parallel in the sense that
*  groups that engage in a great deal of violence against other groups often do that,
*  because they see themselves as victims.
*  And they see themselves very often as victims of those groups that they're killing.
*  And so this kind of cycle of victims becoming perpetrators, you can actually take it back to
*  the Germans, who saw themselves as the great victims of World War I and of the peace,
*  the unjust peace after World War I, and of the stab in the back by the socialists and the Jews
*  as they saw it.
*  And that was the main incentive then, or the main incentive,
*  then, or the main excuse by the Nazis to carry out mass crimes in World War II.
*  The Serbs are an interesting case, because Serbia is seen in the Israeli view as a country that
*  fought against the Nazis.
*  And Tito was seen as a great leader next to Stalin as having fought as partisans and sacrificed
*  huge numbers of people in World War II against the Nazis.
*  And so they were your enemy's enemy.
*  And in that sense, there was always a great deal of sympathy for Serbia.
*  And during the 1990s, during the wars in the former Yugoslavia,
*  Israeli sentiment was generally on the side of the Serbs.
*  So that is sort of one side of it.
*  I would say that in Israel, the main memory obviously is not that of the Serbs.
*  The main memory is the memory of the Holocaust.
*  And that has been evoked repeatedly since October 7.
*  Israeli state information propaganda tried to first talk about Hamas as being ISIS and say,
*  Hamas is ISIS.
*  It didn't, certainly for the Israeli public, it wasn't that effective.
*  And so now they're basically called the Nazis.
*  If you listen to Israeli TV, everybody's talking about Hamas Nazis.
*  And that triggers everything in Israeli society, fear, hate, and license to carry out unlimited
*  violence because the Nazis obviously are those who murdered the Jews in World War II.
*  And if you can identify Hamas, not only Hamas, all the Gazans, as the Israeli president said,
*  they're all guilty as Nazis, then whatever you do to them is legitimate.
*  And that's the main danger of using these kind of historical analogies.
*  I mean, on that, actually, I'd be interested to hear your thoughts.
*  Basically, I mean, did I get this wrong?
*  Basically, I mean, this was because I got a lot of critique from, I'd say,
*  some Jewish leftists, anti-Zionists for something I wrote a week after 7th of October.
*  And when various commentators were saying, certainly Jewish commentators in Britain were saying,
*  everyone's forgotten about 7th of October, now we're talking about Gaza, as though this was a
*  trick pulled by opponents of Gaza rather than we just responded to what was happening in Gaza.
*  But I said, last Saturday, Hamas engaged in the biggest mass murder of Jews, it's the Holocaust.
*  Jewish people everywhere are just unknowingly grieving and traumatized.
*  Those of us opposing them, assaulting Gaza, on belittling this, we just don't want more innocent
*  people to die. And I was trying to engage with people saying that, and the sense of trauma and
*  grief people felt, but many felt I'd made a big mistake there because I shouldn't have invoked
*  the question of the Holocaust, suggested that the attack was driven by anti-Semitism,
*  and that legitimized the idea that this was a war against Nazism.
*  So yeah, I guess that's self-critique. Is that a valid critique, basically?
*  Look, I mean, it's a really tricky issue, I must say. And I've been trying to
*  think about this as rationally and reasonably as I can as well. When people say that the Hamas
*  massacre of October 7th is the largest killing of Jews since the Holocaust, statistically it may be
*  true, although I think about 1,500 people are estimated to have been killed in Poland after
*  World War II in Polkrum. So it's not necessarily true. But the use of the word after the Holocaust
*  immediately evokes the memory of the Holocaust. And that memory of the Holocaust, as I said before,
*  can be abused. It can be used to give you license. Now, one has to add that there are
*  people who are critical of Israeli policies, and I'm certainly one of them, who avoid talking about
*  Hamas. They start off right after the Hamas massacre and go directly into the Israeli attack on Gaza.
*  Now, Gaza was under siege by Israel. The entire phenomenon of Hamas is a product of Israeli
*  occupation policies, 56 years of occupation since 1967. So yes, there is a larger context,
*  but you cannot avoid speaking about the Hamas attack and the huge effect that it had on Israel.
*  I'm constantly in touch with friends in Israel, and they are shattered by what happened. I mean,
*  this had an effect on my own family. There's hardly anyone who was not affected by what happened
*  on October 7th. And the sense of insecurity and fear in Israel, quite apart from the fact that
*  the government is so totally incompetent at the moment. And so if you want to understand what is
*  going on and how both Palestinians and Israelis see what is happening, you cannot simply start
*  right after the Hamas attack. You have to include that in the discussion. And that reminds me,
*  to some extent, of 1948, because Jewish Israelis like talking about the war of 1948 as the war of
*  independence. And yes, there was some collateral damage that the Palestinians fled, and that was
*  not such a bad thing from the point of view of Israelis. And Palestinians like talking about
*  1948 as only the Nakba, as if there was no war. And my parents fought in that war, and large
*  numbers of their friends were killed in that war. So it was experienced by Jews there, who then became
*  Israeli Jews when the state was established, as a very traumatic war. You have to include both these
*  together, both in order to understand why people do what they do, and more importantly, to understand
*  where do you go forward. You cannot go forward without understanding the way the other side
*  thinks. If you only see it through your own prison, you are imprisoned in that, and you can
*  never move forward. And that's basically the bane of both sides at the moment.
*  I mean, just to kind of link to that, the question of antisemitism, which is ingrained in European,
*  well, not just European culture, but just, you know, 2000 years ingrained in European culture,
*  you know, which we had expulsions, blood libel pogroms, culminating, of course, in the
*  attempt to exterminate the entire Jewish population of Europe within living memory,
*  which is, I think, important to always emphasize. And at the same time, there is an attempt to
*  deliberately stigmatize any form of solidarity with the Palestinians as antisemitism. And I'm
*  just wondering how we, the best way, in the kind of empathetic way I think you're talking about here,
*  how we disentangle that. We take antisemitism very seriously, and we should always take antisemitism
*  extremely seriously, whilst demarcating from these claims of antisemitism, which are not
*  grounded in fact and actually have a obvious purpose.
*  Look, I mean, I can think about that personally. I mean, the reason that I was born in Israel
*  was that my mother and her family left Eastern Europe, then Poland, now Ukraine in 1935.
*  Everybody else who stayed there, my entire family, was murdered. And so from that point of view,
*  I had my mother and her parents stay there. I would not have been here. So the sort of, at the core
*  of what the state of Israel is, is a sense that in the 1930s, in the 1940s, there was no safe haven
*  to Jews. Nobody wanted to take them in. It's not just that the Nazis wanted to kill them. The Nazis
*  actually wanted to displace them. They wanted to hand them over to somebody else, but nobody wanted
*  them. And so they were killed. And so there is a kind of existential sense about the importance of
*  their being an Israeli state. But that does not give that state license to oppress and occupy
*  and kill people. The same thing is with Palestinians. Palestinians have a right
*  to self-determination, a right to their own country, a right to their own dignity and justice.
*  That does not give them license to massacre Jews. So one massacre does not justify another. The
*  massacre of the Nazis does not give Jews the right to massacre Palestinians. And oppression
*  of Palestinians, which should be resisted by Palestinians, does not give Palestinians the
*  right to carry out such massacres as Hamas did. We have to understand that what you have now
*  in Israel, in Palestine, are two national movements. You have 7 million Palestinians,
*  you have 7 million Jews living between the Jordan and the sea. They can either find a way to share
*  that space or they would keep killing each other, which they're doing at larger and larger numbers.
*  Every time there's a round of violence, it's more violent. The cost in blood is greater.
*  And so to me, we have to understand the past. We have to understand where people are coming from,
*  but we have to also look forward. And yes, there is a rise in antisemitism around the world.
*  Antisemitism is a pernicious sentiment that dates to antiquity. Unfortunately, Israel that was
*  created in large part as a response to antisemitism is these days one of the main triggers of
*  antisemitism around the world. It legitimates people who have anti-Jewish sentiments because
*  of its own policies against Palestinians. And had there been, and if there is, a settlement
*  between the two groups, antisemitism will not go away, but I actually think that it will be diminished.
*  I saw actually just linked to that, and I forget her name, so I'll sum up something along the lines
*  she wrote. She was a dissident, leftist Israeli, and she said that Zionists had to contend with
*  the fact that Israel had not made Jews more safe. Do you think that's true? Since the war,
*  you made the point actually in the 30s, your family wouldn't have survived if they hadn't
*  have emigrated to what was then the British mandate of Palestine. But in terms of since 1948,
*  do you think that is true? Look, I think numerically, you could say that right now,
*  Israel is not a particularly safe place for Jews. There are Jews in America, Jews in France, Jews
*  in Germany who say that they feel threatened. But in terms of numbers of Jews actually dying
*  from violent actions, yes, I think it's numerically true. But I would add that the whole idea of
*  Zionism was not simply to create a Jewish state where Jews would be safe, but to create a Jewish
*  state where all the authorities would be Jewish. That is where the government would be Jewish,
*  the army, the police, a place where pogroms could not occur, which are actions carried out against
*  minorities by mobs or by governments. Now, you can have all of that and yet elect the wrong leaders,
*  have the wrong policy. And if you do that, think about Britain in World War I. It went to a war
*  where an entire generation was decimated. Was that an argument against Britain being an independent
*  state? No, it was an argument against having foolish policies. And so I think that the question
*  is not whether a Jewish state is safe for Jews, but whether a Jewish government in a Jewish state
*  conducts the right policies or not. And over a long stretch of time, Israel's had really bad
*  governments, not least the last 20 years under Netanyahu has been the worst leader Israel's ever
*  had. And I would argue fundamentally anti-Zionist leader who has completely
*  undermined what the original ideal of Zionism was. Zipi Otavelli is the Israeli ambassador to
*  Britain, not what I would describe as a polished media performer, unlike her predecessor, Mark
*  Regev, who is an extremely slick media performer, I would say, but she is quite a crude performer,
*  if I'm honest. And she says something which was, you know, in an interview with Sky News in which
*  she was asked about the prospects of a two-state solution and she said, absolutely not. And in
*  some ways, that's not really a shock because actually, Benjamin Netanyahu, etc. have made that
*  clear over and over again. But it's just, you know, some people made the point that where Sky News
*  had failed there was to say, well, what does that actually mean in practical terms? Because
*  what does that mean for the Palestinians who live between the river and the sea? Because in practice,
*  does that mean what, never-ending apartheid, ethnic cleansing? I mean, that is just interesting
*  because in practice, you know, we hear a lot of the moral panic about from the river to the sea,
*  Palestine will be free, but a state is being built from the river to the sea. So what do you
*  think about the actual logical implication of that Israeli policy? What that means, given there is
*  two and a half million or two, there were 2.2 million people in Gaza, it's going to be less
*  than that, unfortunately, by the end of this, and around three million Palestinians in the West Bank
*  and obviously within Israeli society, there's around two million Palestinian citizens. So what's
*  your thoughts on what that actually means? So first of all, from the river to the sea is not
*  an original Palestinian slogan. If you look at the nationality law that was passed in Israel only a
*  few years ago, it basically claims that the whole Eretz Yisrael, all of the land of Israel, is the
*  national home of the Jews. And if you think about the sort of origins of this term, it goes back to
*  Zionist revisionism, you know, which had a song that went, the river has two banks and this bank
*  belongs to us and the other one too. So they're actually thinking also about trans-Jordanist
*  being part of the greater Israel. So that slogan means who is saying it and what do they intend?
*  What's the meaning of what they use? Now, yes, in terms of what you're saying, if there is no
*  a two-state solution, what are the alternatives, right? One alternative is there would be a
*  binational state and there was talk about that in the 1930s, it disappeared after 1948. What is a
*  binational state? There would be equal numbers of Jews and Palestinians, they'd have the same rights,
*  it would be a state of all its citizens, as was said during the Oslo Accord was the kind of main
*  slogan. Now, most Jews don't want that and most Palestinians don't want that because Jews want
*  a right of self-determination and a right of return. And Palestinians want the right of
*  self-determination and a right of return. And in order to do that, you need two states. If you
*  don't have a binational state and you don't have two states, what you have is apartheid. And that
*  is a regime that exists right now in the West Bank. You have two groups of people living under
*  two different systems of law. You have between 500,000, 750,000 Jews, Jewish settlers and three
*  million Palestinians. They live under a different law and the law for Palestinians gives them hardly
*  any rights because it's military law. So how do you square this circle? I would
*  say that, you know, Netanyahu in the past actually talked about two states. He was forced to do it
*  under American pressure. He's now relented. Basically, it would mean pushing Palestinians
*  out. This is, I think, what is underlying what's going on in Gaza now and what is going on now
*  under the radar in the West Bank. The people on his right, the Smotrich and Ben-Gviz in his
*  cabinet, are Jewish supremacists. They are people who want to have the whole territory.
*  Gaza very much included, possibly parts of Lebanon as well, with Jewish settlers and with as few
*  Palestinians as possible. I think there is another way to think about it. I think one can create two
*  states, but that would have to be in a confederation. It would have to be two states that would be along
*  the 1967 borders, but where you would make a distinction between citizenship and residence
*  and where people could be citizens of one state and reside in another as long as they respect
*  its laws and regulations. That would prevent the kind of civil war that would break out if Israel
*  tried to remove the settlers, if it had a government that was willing to do so, and it would enable
*  Palestinians who would come back with the right of return to a Palestinian state also in limited
*  numbers to go and live where their ancestors had lived in towns that are now in the state of Israel
*  as residents rather than as citizens voting for their own parliament. In that sense, it would be,
*  I know it sounds as a pipe dream now, but it would be like a French person. Now the Brits can't do
*  that anymore, but a French person going to live in Berlin or a German going to live in Paris,
*  you would retain your citizenship, but you would be allowed to reside in the nearby country.
*  I mean just in terms of, I guess, how plausible that ends up being. Mark Rega, who I mentioned
*  now, obviously he's a spokesperson for the Israeli government who does the media tour,
*  and making the case for, well, a slick case for the slaughter currently taking place in Gaza,
*  but the point I thought he made quite a revealing comment in an interview last week in which
*  following the current Israeli ambassador Zipi Hotevelli saying there'd be no two-state solution,
*  and he was pressed on that, and he said, well actually Yitzhak Rabin, who signed the former
*  Israeli prime minister, he signed the Oslo Accords, himself said that Palestine would always have
*  an entity less than a state, to make the point, and I thought it was interesting because there's a myth
*  often propagated that the Palestinians have had lots of opportunities to have a state which they've
*  turned down and they've basically brought their own fate upon themselves, but that was quite
*  revealing, and it just made me think, well how plausible is it ever to have even, you know,
*  because no people would ever really, there's not really a precedent for any people on earth accepting
*  an entity less than a state. It basically looks like a bantustan in South Africa.
*  So what do you think in terms of how this changes? Because a lot of Israeli opinion has just
*  hardened quite dramatically. It's not like South Africa and the apartheid where public opinion
*  globally shifted, and that made white South Africans actually often very, very reluctantly
*  having to come to the conclusions that apartheid was not going to last, but there's no incentive
*  for that, and therefore Israeli society just hardens and hardens and hardens,
*  because, you know, and that therefore the idea of any viable Palestinian state of any description
*  just seems impossible. Look, first of all, I think there's some room for analogy with South Africa,
*  but there's also a huge difference, because as I said, Palestinians want a state of their own,
*  and Jews want a state of their own, and both groups have an absolute right to have that state. If you
*  read the Palestinian Declaration of Independence and the Israeli Declaration of Independence,
*  they're very similar, and they claim historical rights for self-determination. So you have to
*  start from that. A lot of Jewish Israelis think really about Palestinians in a kind of colonial
*  terminology. They think of them as being the natives, and how do we deal with these natives
*  who are, you know, primitive and violent, and maybe we can use them for labor and so forth,
*  but by and large it would be good if they just went away. Is there room for an independent,
*  fully sovereign Palestinian state? There has to be. It has to happen, and it can happen, I think,
*  in fact, through a federative system. Most Israelis think about sharing the space in terms of
*  there being barbed wire and minefields between one and another. They talk, and this is not only
*  Netanyahu, this goes back indeed truly to labor governments talking about separation,
*  afradah. This was the whole concept. Let's separate between them. We, they want to have their own
*  space, let them go there, we'll build a wall, we'll build a fence. These walls and fences don't work.
*  We saw that on October 7th, and I think much of the Israeli public can now move in one direction
*  or another. There are people in Israel now who are promoting Israel become like Sparta, become even
*  more militaristic, live on its sword, know that this is its fate. There are people who have said
*  that since before 1948. That's one sort of brand of Zionism, and that would be a miserable state.
*  It would be a poor state. It would be a state that nobody would want to have anything to do with.
*  The other option is to say, well, we have now realized finally we have to change the
*  political paradigm. The political paradigm that we had was how do we manage this conflict with the
*  Palestinians? We don't want to solve it. We don't need to solve it because we're too strong. They
*  can't do anything to us. They can lob a few rockets at us, but beyond that, we can control it. And then
*  came October 7th, and with all the sort of heinous aspects of that, it has similarities with what
*  happened in 1973 when Egypt and Syria attacked Israel. And Israel thought after 67, hey, we don't
*  have to worry about the Arabs. Look, we beat them in six days. And only after October 73, in which
*  I was a soldier and quite a number of my classmates were killed, needlessly, only after that,
*  Israel said, okay, you know what? We'll give Egypt back the Sinai Peninsula and have peace with Egypt,
*  which is the most important diplomatic event that happened to Israel since 1948 because Egypt is the
*  largest, most powerful Arab country. Now the same thing happened. It became clear Israel cannot
*  manage the conflict. It can either carry out ethnic cleansing and genocide of the Palestinians,
*  which I hope it will not be able to do, or it has to find a political solution that would give
*  justice and dignity to both groups and safety. I think fundamentally both peoples want it. They
*  have terrible leaders. Palestinians have terrible leaders, both the PA and Hamas, which is not really
*  a partner for negotiations. And Israel has been electing Netanyahu now for decades,
*  a man who has proven himself, he was Mr. Security, has proven himself to be completely incompetent
*  and was in charge of the largest disaster in Israeli history since the founding of the state.
*  And just very finally on that, what's your, I guess, not best case scenario, your kind of most
*  likely scenario do you think in terms of what happens next, given the rhetoric of the Israeli
*  states, given the horror before in Gaza, it's interesting the head of the UN aid mission
*  in the Financial Times today pointed out that most people die in these situations, not from violence,
*  because we see the death toll in terms of violence, but hunger, the collapse of the health system.
*  I mean, what do you think is likely to happen? Do you think it ends up,
*  as things stand, with Gaza ethnically cleansed, just rendered inhospitable for sustainable human
*  life, and then Israel hopes that maybe it falls off the radar and you have a gradual mass exodus
*  of the survivors to other Arab countries? Look, it's possible that that would happen.
*  But I have to say, we have to keep in mind the Israeli army is a modern army with one of the most
*  powerful air forces in the world, with vast numbers of tanks and artillery. It's mobilized
*  well over a quarter, a third of a million soldiers, and it's been fighting for weeks in Gaza,
*  and it is still probably killed about 20% of Hamas militants, and does not seem to have
*  undermined the control of Hamas over the territory that it still is ruling. It's not been a successful
*  military operation at all by any account, and I don't think it can last much longer. I think
*  Israel is running out of time, and we have to remember Israel is heavily dependent on the
*  United States, obviously politically, you know, vetoing the Security Council, but also because
*  it's receiving huge amounts of munitions for tanks, for artillery, and of course rockets.
*  The patience in the United States is running out. It also has to do with Biden, you know,
*  who is going to be the next president of the United States. What Biden is doing right now
*  is not so good for his re-election. So I think that Israel is reaching the limits of its power,
*  and I'm hoping that at the end of this there will be a political earthquake in Israel. Netanyahu is
*  very, very unpopular in Israel now. I think he would get probably 13% of the vote right now.
*  Whether a new leadership is created in Israel that will rethink this entire undertaking,
