# US Aid Drops KILLS Palestinians
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [March 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yodd5Hb6WUY)
*  This is just so revolting, so infuriating and such a damning indictment.
*  Now the US in particular and its allies have been trumpeting the fact that it is now dropping
*  air dropping aid on Gaza. They know that famine stalks the land, particularly hitting hundreds
*  of thousands of people in the north. They know that the public in the west are increasingly aware
*  that Palestinian children are starving to death in Gaza and they know that understandably people
*  who aren't sociopaths are getting angry about it. They also know that people are increasingly aware
*  that it is Israel starving Gaza to death, the very same Israel which is only able to get away with
*  mass murder because of the patronage of the United States of America. So rather than forcing Israel
*  to stop starving Gaza to death, the US administration has come up with what they think is an ingenious
*  PR stunt to air drop aid onto Gaza. Now as it was, this was insulting, in their first round of air
*  drops they dropped 38,000 meals. That was enough to feed. Guess what percentage of Gaza? Around 1.72%
*  of the entire population for a single meal for one single day. It's the equivalent of one
*  aid truck. Pathetic. But then today it was announced that five Palestinians were killed
*  and ten injured when they were hit by a pallet of aid parachuted into Gaza. It happened near a coastal
*  refugee camp, somewhere particularly devastated by Israel's onslaught, after the parachute failed to
*  deploy properly and then hit a group of men, teenagers and little kids. Now one of those
*  victims reportedly killed was a little Palestinian boy called Mohannad Hossam Mokdad.
*  This is exactly what aid agencies are worried about. They said that air drops were inadequate,
*  inaccurate and dangerous. We are talking after all about one of the most densely populated
*  populations on earth, dropping aid in a completely untargeted way. Those doing so must have known
*  there was a high risk of this happening. Now what's so offensive is you first get US bombs
*  dropped on Gaza, killing Palestinians, and when they drop a tiny number, proportionately speaking
*  of aid pallets for PR purposes, that also kills Palestinians. They are killing Palestinians from
*  the air with bombs and air drops for PR purposes. Now the parachutes also repeatedly fall into the
*  ocean, leading to desperately hungry children in particular to risk their lives as they swim and
*  try and get the aid. There's other reports of other boxes breaking mid-air and scattering
*  their contents like projectiles onto these desperately starving human beings. Now the
*  other point is it's not just, the point about this is it's not targeted at people based on need,
*  it's a total lottery as to whether you're near an air drop or not. Now Palestinians also, like anyone
*  regarded as absolutely humiliating to be forced to run after scraps of aid dropped from the air.
*  On top of all this, the US has now offered another solution, supposedly, which is building a temporary
*  pier on the coast of Gaza in the Mediterranean Sea to help deliver humanitarian aid. Note there
*  isn't an airport in Gaza, why? Because the Israelis banned it, they also banned Gaza from
*  having an airport. One of many reasons Gaza was, legally speaking, under Israeli occupation
*  before this horror, current horror, began. Now the US also issued a joint statement with the
*  European Commission, Cyprus, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom to get a maritime corridor
*  through to support humanitarian assistance. All sounds great doesn't it? Go yes, whoo whoo whoo,
*  looking after civilians. No. As doctors went out border saying their statement, the US plan for a
*  temporary pit in Gaza to increase the flow of humanitarian aid is a glaring distraction from
*  the real problem, Israel's indiscriminate and disproportionate military campaign and punishing
*  siege. The food, water and medical supplies so desperately needed by people in Gaza are sitting
*  just across the border. Israel needs to facilitate rather than block the flow of supplies. This is
*  not a logistics problem, it's a political problem. They say rather than look to the US military to
*  build a workaround, the US should insist on immediate humanitarian access using the roads
*  and entry points that already exist. Now as Channel 4 News's international editor Lindsay
*  Hilton puts it, building a seaport for aid into Gaza City will take months during which many more
*  children will die of malnutrition but if Israel opened the Erez crossing and cleared the road,
*  aid could be sent in by truck now and save lives immediately. So why isn't the US insisting on that?
*  Good question. Another point, Israel is obstructing aid in many ways which I'll come on to but
*  that includes Israel using their security vetting to hold that aid up and they'll once again have
*  inspectors in the Cypriot port where the aid will come from. So they'll just do the same thing again,
*  block the aid coming into this new stupid idea of a seaport. Now there's another key point,
*  the aid will come to the coast, then what? Then what? What happens then? It's not like the large
*  majority of Gaza's population are concentrated by the coast, they're not. How's it going to get
*  distributed? Who's going to do that? Now in the worst affected area, northern Gaza, there was almost
*  no aid agency presence because Israel has kept everybody out. Bear in mind they say they've
*  completely defeated Hamas in northern Gaza so that is just completely under Israeli occupation
*  and that's where they're starving to death in particular. Now any suggestions for who could
*  distribute this aid? I know, I've got an idea. How about the main humanitarian agency in Gaza,
*  UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees? Oh bad luck, Israel's led a bad faith smear
*  campaign against it in an attempt to destroy it which the US made itself voluntarily complicit
*  with along with many other western governments like the United Kingdom to financially throttle
*  UNRWA by withdrawing funding based on unevidence nonsense claims which even on their own terms,
*  the claim that 0.04% of UNRWA workers were involved in 7th October is not a reason to
*  collectively punish the entire Palestinian population by helping to starve them to death.
*  Now the likes of the US also suspended funding to it, only belatedly reversing that decision.
*  Gaza is a war zone, much of it is rubble, its roads have been destroyed all over the place,
*  there's Israeli snipers killing lots of people, there's also lots of bombs being dropped, there's
*  also lots of desperate starving civilians. How do you get the trucks and drivers into all that
*  without ceasefire, without a means of security to protect the drivers and trucks? Last week when
*  aid trucks were finally allowed into northern Gaza for the first time in a month, Israeli soldiers
*  massacred desperately starving Palestinians, then lied about it. Now the facts of the situation have
*  been set out in a new report by Refugees International based on interviews with dozens
*  of government officials, humanitarian workers, NGO staff, and that report says Israel is consistently
*  and groundlessly impeding aid operations within Gaza, blocking legitimate relief operations and
*  resisting implementing measures that would genuinely enhance the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza.
*  It adds,
*  our research makes clear that conditions inside of Gaza are apocalyptic. They say after five months
*  of war, Palestinians are struggling to find adequate food, water, shelter and basic medicine,
*  famine level hunger is already widespread and worsening. They say Israeli authorities have
*  erected unnecessary hurdles, complicated logistical processes and an unpredictable vetting system,
*  rendering the inspection regime overwhelmingly burdensome while there's a bureaucracy and
*  inspection limiting working hours. Now despite Israel's claims, and they really are, let's be
*  fair to them, absolute experts in bullshit, UN data finds the average number of trucks delivered
*  in Gaza in February fell by 50% compared with the previous month. The RAFA crossing into Egypt,
*  note, that's mainly the whole point of that, it's for commercial deliveries. The capacity isn't
*  there to process the massive aid that Gaza now needs. Now furthermore, when the World Food Program
*  tried for the first time in two weeks to bring food aid into northern Gaza,
*  that a convoy 14 lorries, which is woefully unsubstantial, not substantial, it was turned
*  away by the Israeli defence forces and then looted by the inevitably desperate civilians who are
*  starving to death. Now what Israel has done is limit land entry points for aid, to impose an
*  intentionally cumbersome bureaucratic system that holds everything up, stops things which are
*  supposedly double use, which is all sorts of basic things that Gaza needs, waged war on the main
*  humanitarian agency, as well as targeted the police force there who previously protected the
*  aid missions, which they must have known. You've also had, frankly, disgusting, twisted Israeli
*  protesters blocking aid using roadblocks from, for example, Kerem Shalon crossing, they even set up
*  a giant bouncy castle there to turn an attempt to starve the people of Gaza into a fun family day
*  out. You can't make this shit, this disturbing shit up. It is a horror film. The same Israeli
*  police who refused to sort those murderous protesters out happily used water cannon against
*  peace protesters in Tel Aviv. Now those police also blockaded a humanitarian aid convoy,
*  organised by Standing Together, an Israeli peace movement which brings together Jewish
*  and Palestinian citizens of Israel. It's very straightforward, you don't need to be a conspiracy
*  theorist here, you just literally need to read back what Israeli government ministers said.
*  Two days after the 7th October atrocities, Yov Galan, Israel's defence minister, declared,
*  and I must quote, I have ordered a complete siege on the Gaza Strip. There will be no electricity,
*  no food, no fuel, everything is closed. He added we are fighting human animals and we're acting
*  accordingly. There's nothing really more to say, is there? Israel's stuck by its word, they have
*  abided by this genocidal statement, which was quite correctly submitted by South Africa,
*  as evidence in its case against Israel for genocide at the International Court of Justice,
*  submitted, I would know, because it is an obviously genocidal statement.
*  Now you get some Israeli stooges claiming, oh it's Hamas, they're stealing the aid. What are you
*  even saying here? After five months of a regional military superpower smashing an area the size of
*  East London to tiny little pieces with the overwhelming support of the United States,
*  what are you saying? Israel has lost the war and Hamas is still in charge? The fact is,
*  under international law, as the occupying power, Israel is legally responsible for the
*  welfare of the civilian population. The International Court of Justice issued provisional measures
*  ordering Israel to ensure humanitarian aid could be accessed in order to prevent genocide.
*  It's abundantly clear that Israel is deliberately starving the people of Gaza to death. In order to
*  put into practice the multiple genocidal statements made by Israeli ministers and army officers who
*  have made it clear on multiple occasions that they want the Palestinian population to either leave
*  or die. And it's clear by the way that whatever happens, we're not going to get humanitarian aid
*  in any way properly distributed and the needs of a display desperate population met until the
*  bombs stop falling and the bullets stop being fired. As I keep saying, one of the great crimes
*  of our age, a crime which Western allies of Israel are all complicit in, the blood is all over them as
*  well. Their hands. And it's not going to be washed off. And I'm just going to have to be honest,
*  a lot more Palestinians are going to die. They're going to die. They're going to suffer hideous,
*  painful, tortured and often lonely deaths. In keeping with the proportions up to this moment,
*  nearly 40% of those who will continue to die, they're going to be children, teenagers,
*  toddlers, babies. They're already being burned alive. In some cases, slowly crushed to death
*  and a rubble. They're being shot repeatedly, including directly in the head, like the children
*  aged five to eight received by a US doctor in Gaza recently. And they're going to starve.
*  They're going to starve to death. Many children are already starving to death. People are wasting
*  away. Israel knows this. Its Western allies know this. But those allies refuse to put any
*  meaningful pressure on Israel with some occasional public hand-wringing, which Israel quite rationally
*  knows it can ignore. It has already got away with some of the worst atrocities of the 21st century.
*  They have shown again, the evil which humans can be capable of inflicting on others. What we are
*  seeing here is mass murder. It is genocide. All of it, the responsibility of Israel and the
*  governments which stand behind them. I can't let them get away with it. Please like and subscribe.
