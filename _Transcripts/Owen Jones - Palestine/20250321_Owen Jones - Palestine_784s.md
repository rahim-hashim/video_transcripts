# This Massive Israel Lie DESTROYED... By Israeli Newspaper
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw)
*  Let me just read this headline to you. It's a headline from the Israeli newspaper, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=0.0s)]
*  Haaretz. It's the editorial, that's the official line or position of the newspaper. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=4.64s)]
*  And it reads as follows. Israel, not Hamas, is derailing the Gaza [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=9.36s)]
*  ceasefire and preventing the hostages' return. Now this article begins with the following paragraph. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu paid the asking price for Itamir Ben-Gavir's return to the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=19.76s)]
*  government in advance. Not out of his own pocket, of course, but with the blood of the 59 hostages [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=24.16s)]
*  whose fate could be sealed by the resumption of the war, which has already sealed the fate of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=29.68s)]
*  hundreds of Palestinians, including women and children. Now Itamir Ben-Gavir, of course, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=34.48s)]
*  is the far-right extremist national security minister in the governing coalition. Although [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=40.0s)]
*  it's difficult to know how that label, far-right extremist, distinguishes him from other members [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=44.8s)]
*  of that governing coalition. What we suppose to call Benjamin Netanyahu, a wanted man by the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=49.44s)]
*  International Criminal Court, with an arrest warrant for war crimes and crimes against humanity. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=54.56s)]
*  What do we call him, center-right? Clearly this is a government of racist genocidal extremists. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=60.32s)]
*  Nonetheless, Ben-Gavir is even more committed, certainly openly committed, to the genocidal [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=65.68s)]
*  obliteration of the Palestinian people, not just in Gaza, but beyond. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=70.80000000000001s)]
*  Now as this editorial goes on to say, according to the statement released by Netanyahu's office, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=75.6s)]
*  the decision to strike Gaza was made with defence minister Israel Katz after Hamas's repeated [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=80.88s)]
*  refusal to release our hostages as well as its rejection of all the proposals it has received [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=86.08s)]
*  from US presidential envoy Steve Witkoff and from the mediators. And it goes on, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  Haaretz the Say, but it must be said loudly and clearly that this is a lie. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=98.24s)]
*  It was Israel, not Hamas, that violated the agreement. On its 16th day, the parties were [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  supposed to begin discussing the second phase, which was supposed to end with the release of [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=107.6s)]
*  all the remaining hostages. Israel refused. Now this is such an important point to make, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=111.83999999999999s)]
*  the point being of course the truth, the facts. Throughout Israel's genocide against the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=118.16s)]
*  Palestinian people, Western media coverage has been overwhelmingly dire, and so it remains in [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=123.91999999999999s)]
*  the case of what's happened with this so-called ceasefire. Media outlets in the West failed to [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=129.76s)]
*  inform the Western public about how Israel has systematically and grievously violated the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=135.6s)]
*  so-called ceasefire when it was in place, that involved killing around 150 Palestinians when the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=140.56s)]
*  so-called ceasefire was in place, to violating promises on humanitarian aid which culminated [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  in a total siege on anything and everything entering Gaza from the beginning of this month. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=152.32s)]
*  These Western media outlets then failed to inform the Western public that it was Israel which [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  objectively destroyed the ceasefire. Instead, they centred Israel's deceitful claims and treated [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=161.68s)]
*  them as though they were credible. This is a classic example of that quote, if someone says [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=166.24s)]
*  it's raining and another person says it's dry, it's not your job to quote them both. Your job [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=170.72s)]
*  is to look out the fucking window and find out which is true. So to continue with Haaretz, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=175.84s)]
*  Israel also broke its promise to withdraw from the Philadelphia corridor between the 42nd and 50th [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=181.52s)]
*  day of the ceasefire. Moreover, Israel announced that it was halting the entry of humanitarian aid [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  into Gaza and closing the border crossings. That decision, like the Energy Minister's decision to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=190.8s)]
*  halt the limited amount of electricity Israel provides to Gaza, explicitly violates Israel's [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  commitment in the agreement that aid will continue entering as long as talks on the second stage are [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=200.4s)]
*  ongoing. It goes on to say, all the proposals that Hamas received from Witkoff stem from Israel's [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=204.96s)]
*  refusal to uphold its part of the deal. Consequently, the attempt to portray Hamas's [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=211.68s)]
*  rejection of Witkoff's proposals as a reason to resume the fighting is nothing but a dishonest [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=217.36s)]
*  manipulation. Now again, let's be clear here. A state committing every war crime and crime against [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=222.88000000000002s)]
*  humanity under the sun is going to lie. A lie all the time. Lie relentlessly. Indeed, it's an objective [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=228.96s)]
*  fact that the Israeli state lies and lies and lies and lies, provably so, not least about the atrocity [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=234.32000000000002s)]
*  which it commits. But Western media outlets continue to treat Israel as a quote unquote [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=239.28000000000003s)]
*  democratic state whose public statement should be treated as credible. They defer to what Israel says [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=244.48s)]
*  as though we can take that seriously. That is not an honour extended to, for example, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=252.16s)]
*  the Russian authorities, and rightly so. In doing so, Western media outlets make themselves [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=258.56s)]
*  not just complicit in Israeli lies, they become part of Israel's propaganda machine. We have to rely, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=264.08s)]
*  in this case, on an Israeli newspaper, which I might add operates on a military censorship [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=269.59999999999997s)]
*  to spell out basic facts which almost no Western media outlet will do. This is ridiculous. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=273.76s)]
*  Now as Harret says, Israel, not Hamas, is the one preventing the deal's implementation [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=281.52s)]
*  and the hostages' return. Now here's another source I'm going to bring up. Now to say [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=287.12s)]
*  I've had a falling out with my local Labour MP Emily Thornby is quite the understatement. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=291.44s)]
*  She's someone I used to get on with well, someone I respected despite our disagreements, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=295.2s)]
*  and then she went and spoiled it all by saying something stupid like legitimising war crimes and [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=298.88s)]
*  national television. At the beginning of the genocide, in an effort to ingratiate herself [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=303.52s)]
*  with Keir Starmer, the Labour leader who publicly declared Israel had a right to cut off the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=307.2s)]
*  essentials of life to the people of Gaza, Emily Thornby refused to condemn such a legal siege [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=311.35999999999996s)]
*  as a violation of international law, instead responding to repeated questionings from the [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=316.4s)]
*  interviewer at the time about whether this constituted a violation of law by stating that [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=321.12s)]
*  Israel had an absolute right to defend itself. Well, this grubby little episode didn't actually [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  work out very well for her because after Starmer became Prime Minister, she was beaten off the [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=332.4s)]
*  front bench. Now, last week she finally expressed her outrage at Israel, not because of their [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=336.71999999999997s)]
*  hideous war crimes, but because one of their unhinged ministers had allegedly secretly filmed [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=340.88s)]
*  her and fellow British MPs, so what really angered her about Israel wasn't all those murdered [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=345.91999999999996s)]
*  children but being personally slighted. Anyway, useful context, the disclaimers aside, let's listen [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=351.84s)]
*  to what she had to say on Sky News. Emily, firstly, what are your thoughts on the interview and what [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=356.64s)]
*  is happening in Gaza? So, I think that what the ambassador was failing to acknowledge is that the [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=361.6s)]
*  deal that was agreed was one that many people in the international community, including President [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=371.84000000000003s)]
*  Biden, felt had been, was ready to go last summer and first of all, there were grave doubts as to [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=376.16s)]
*  why it had taken so long for it to be implemented in January, it could have happened much earlier, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=382.56s)]
*  Biden said that and the rest of the community feel the same, and it happens in phases. And as [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=387.2s)]
*  you were trying to say, phase one is almost like the easy bit, you release hostages and we will [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=391.59999999999997s)]
*  release prisoners and there will be a ceasefire and then we move to phase two and phase two is [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=399.68s)]
*  Israeli withdrawal but still more hostages and more prisoners being released and also negotiations [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=403.68s)]
*  beginning for what will be the long-term future for Gaza. Now, what happened was that we got to [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=409.59999999999997s)]
*  the first of March and the Israelis unilaterally, as far as I can see, said we're not going into [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=414.08s)]
*  phase two, we want to just stay on phase one, we want to just keep having more hostages and [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=419.12s)]
*  releasing prisoners, we're not prepared to talk about moving out of Gaza nor are we prepared to [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=422.71999999999997s)]
*  talk about a future for Gaza. And the reason for that is because Netanyahu is clinging onto power [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=426.71999999999997s)]
*  by his fingernails, he has to pass a budget at the end of March and he has to pass that budget in [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=432.47999999999996s)]
*  order to continue the government that he's in charge of and if he isn't in charge of the [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=437.2s)]
*  government in Israel, he personally gets into a great deal of trouble, there are court cases [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=441.12s)]
*  swirling around him, there are inquiries and everything else, so what he wants to do is he [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=446.16s)]
*  wants to extend that period as long as he can and so that he can keep in power, he then begins the [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=449.44s)]
*  bombing, I'm sorry to be quite as brutal as this but I really can't see any other explanation for [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=455.52s)]
*  this, he begins the bombing, Ben-Gavir who's pulled out of his government comes back into [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=459.04s)]
*  the government again, so helping to shore up the government, helping to get his budget through [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=463.28000000000003s)]
*  and in the meantime, 300 plus Palestinians are killed and the war aims are not clear as to what [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=467.28s)]
*  it is that they're doing, who is it that they're going after, they say they're still going after [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=474.23999999999995s)]
*  Hamas after all this time but how is it if they're going after Hamas in a way which is proportionate [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=477.59999999999997s)]
*  that we get so many civilians that are killed and that is the problem and that is the problem the [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=482.32s)]
*  Israeli ambassador has when it comes to answering this. Well I think there's a lot in that, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=486.32s)]
*  I do think it's important to centre the fact that Israel does have a clear coherent plan and that's [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=490.88s)]
*  to rid itself of the Palestinian people. At its core, the Israeli state wants the Palestinian [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=496.4s)]
*  people to no longer exist, there's a bare minimum not to live in Gaza or the West Bank and not to [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=500.64s)]
*  have a Palestinian identity, I mean the very existence of a Palestinian identity they regard [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=506.47999999999996s)]
*  as an existential menace. Now Israel works backwards from that position and it considers [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=511.12s)]
*  at any given time what is politically, militarily and diplomatically possible. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=518.0799999999999s)]
*  Now whilst Joe Biden directly facilitated an armed Israel's genocide, Donald Trump has clearly [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=523.36s)]
*  further expanded what Israel believes it can get away with. That's not to say Netanyahu's own [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=528.8000000000001s)]
*  political and personal considerations aren't part of the calculations, they clearly are. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=534.24s)]
*  Now finally, Barak Ravid, who was a former IDF intelligence officer, now journalist says [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=538.08s)]
*  the ceasefire did not in quotes collapse, it was collapsed by the Israeli government. The Israeli [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=543.04s)]
*  government never intended to fully implement the ceasefire agreement signed two months ago, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=548.24s)]
*  it violated one of its key provisions, reneged on it and tried to force an alternative arrangement [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=551.6s)]
*  on Hamas. Look, I told you this all the time, I mean I did say this when the ceasefire was signed, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=557.28s)]
*  I said it's clear Israel has briefed, they're just going to look for any opportunity to destroy it [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=561.52s)]
*  and continue the genocide, I said that over and over again, I did videos about it. Now the point [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=566.48s)]
*  is Israel is deliberately destroying the ceasefire, not Hamas, and committing grievous atrocities as it [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=570.16s)]
*  does. All of these sources are correct, that's just the facts of the matter, and the vast majority [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=576.64s)]
*  of the western media are not treating this as an objective fact, and in doing so, they're not doing [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=584.0s)]
*  their job, they're doing the opposite, they are deceiving their readers and their viewers. Well, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=589.1999999999999s)]
*  as Israel unleashes hell, the human cost this week has been hideous. In southern Gaza, one hospital [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=595.52s)]
*  alone, the European hospital, has taken in 65 people killed since yesterday. Now bear in mind [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=605.12s)]
*  the remaining hospitals have been severely damaged, many of them medics killed, maimed, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=610.5600000000001s)]
*  detained, disappeared by the Israeli army. These hospitals are derived of medicine, technology, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=614.32s)]
*  energy, you name it. It's estimated that around 600 Palestinians, as I read these words, have been [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=619.44s)]
*  killed since Israel resumed its outright violence this week, at least 200 of them children. Dr Marwan [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=625.2s)]
*  Al Hamas, the director of field hospitals at the Ministry of Health, reports that the Israeli [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=633.68s)]

*  in Gaza. Being bombed and killed and the hunger is killing us, also the cold is hitting our bodies, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=648.2399999999999s)]
*  and the sleepy world is watching. No one cares about us in Gaza. Please [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=658.4s)]
*  care more and more and don't stop talking about us in Gaza. Thank you. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=667.84s)]
*  Well, many of us do care, of course. We care so much, but we have to be louder. We have to be [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=677.52s)]
*  more effective. We have to challenge the complicity, not just of our own governments, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=683.68s)]
*  but of the Western media in this genocide. The lies, the gaslighting, the whitewashing, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=687.68s)]
*  the emissions, the deference to Israeli claims and narratives, the erasure of the Palestinian [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=691.4399999999999s)]
*  experience. We could go on, because all of that has proven fundamental to the ability of Israel [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=696.0799999999999s)]
*  to continue committing this genocide. What I've stated here is the truth. The fact the truth [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=703.4399999999999s)]
*  is what gets you badged as an extremist, gets you treated as controversial. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=711.2800000000001s)]
*  Stating the truth is courageous in some way, that is indicative of the world turned on its head. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=718.72s)]
*  Unless we turn the world back to its right position, or the position it should be in, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=728.08s)]
*  then the world will burn. We are seeing here the endless legitimacy of the most extreme depravity [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=734.8s)]
*  that humanity is capable of. That depravity, if normalized, will consume us all. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu6Pn3kRIJw&t=743.4399999999999s)]
