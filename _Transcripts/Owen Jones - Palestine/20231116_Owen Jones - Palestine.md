Video Description: Last night I went on Piers Morgan's show to debate Israel's mass slaughter in Gaza.

Piers has previously said that Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine constitutes genocide. If that's true - then why doesn't the same apply to Gaza?

# Me vs. Piers Morgan on Israel's Gaza massacre - on Western hypocrisy and genocide.
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [November 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CeHOvH3gQ4)
*  Hello! So last night I appeared on Piers Morgan's show to discuss Israel's continuing murderous assault on Gaza.
*  They have been asking me for a while to come on. I very rudely ignored them.
*  Basically, if I'm honest, I'm aware that I'm something of a culture war prop amongst some of Piers's audience.
*  And the last thing I want to do is anything which turns Israel's mass slaughter in Gaza into some sort of culture war.
*  It is too important than that. It's a matter of life and death on a truly horrendous mass scale.
*  Now, the reason I eventually said yes is because, to be honest, whatever feelings you or I might have about Piers, things he said and done,
*  I have been impressed by the platforming of unequivocally pro-Palestinian voices on his show,
*  including, of course, Palestinians themselves who need to be heard from the most right now.
*  Now, you may consider this a damning indictment of the rest of the media, not unreasonably,
*  but his platform, I think, has helped the cause of the Palestinian people.
*  And it's been a net benefit. That's my own view. He's a tough interviewer.
*  We're both maybe reasonably accused of liking the sounds of our own voices.
*  But anyway, you can see the whole thing on his Piers Morgan and Censor channel.
*  But here's a couple of clips. Firstly, Piers has referred to Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine as genocide.
*  So I wanted to talk about this and the question of consistency.
*  What's happened here is babies right now are gasping for breath and suffocating.
*  We've had several nurses and patients shot dead. In fact, this whole hospital
*  has been described by medical staff as a mortuary. But you don't know.
*  Just quickly, when a hospital becomes a mass grave, when dozens of decomposing bodies
*  have to be buried in a mass grave in a hospital, we're talking... What you said,
*  can I just quote something you said about Piers? Sure.
*  And I think this was very wise. You said in March 2022, I'm seeing a genocide of
*  monster killing women and babies in maternity hospitals as you sit back and let them do it.
*  Why was it so disgraceful? But you were right. You were right to be a hermit.
*  Well, here's the difference. Why, when you see this hospital, is there not the same fury?
*  Let me explain. Because the two are, in my opinion, morally very different.
*  In one case, Vladimir Putin's illegal invasion of Ukraine, he was committing war crimes,
*  having illegally invaded a sovereign democratic country. Here, it was Israel that was invaded
*  by a vast number of terrorists who murdered over 1,500 innocent men, women, children.
*  They kidnapped 240 people, including babies, children, Holocaust survivors.
*  So my point is, morally, there is a massive difference. Hold on. Morally,
*  it's a massive difference. Now, the question of the hospital... Wait a second. The question
*  of the hospitals is this to me. They have so far produced some evidence of Hamas operating inside
*  the hospital. For me, so far, as a journalist trying to be fair and impartial, I don't think,
*  as you've heard me say to Mark Regev, I don't think I've seen enough evidence here, which says to me
*  this was a sprawling Hamas command center. But there is a moral difference between what Putin's
*  doing in Ukraine and what Israel's doing to defend itself against Hamas. Isn't there? Hold on. Isn't
*  there? No, sorry. This is the difference, OK, if you want to talk about that or trying to separate
*  them. For a Ukrainian ordinary civilian being killed or for an ordinary Palestinian child being
*  killed, none of them did anything wrong. We agree on that, don't we? We absolutely agree on that.
*  Now, when you repeatedly denounced Putin for his genocidal behavior in Ukraine, do you stand by that?
*  Do you think that's a genocide? Well, it doesn't matter what the basis for what the operation...
*  Of course it does! No, no. No, it does. No, no, No! In terms of what actually is happening,
*  we can talk about the you've seen massacre of a thousand... Kids, no, let's talk about genocide.
*  Let's talk about genocide. Let me tell you the difference between genocide. Let me come back and
*  tell him from what I'm doing. Hamas, from his charter onwards and from what the spokesman said
*  last week is dedicated to the eradication of Israel and killing as
*  many Jews as it can possibly kill. That is the purest definition of
*  genocide intent that you will ever see. And they executed it on October
*  7th as best they could. Now, what Israel is doing in response, and
*  they've been very firm about this, and the international courts will rule...
*  These are very long questions. They're not. I'm answering a point and
*  I'm putting one to you. In my estimation, they are qualitatively
*  different. What Hamas is doing publicly is genocide. What Israel is
*  doing is not genocide. There's a difference between Israel and Hamas
*  have engaged in genocide or murderous rhetoric. I'll give you an
*  example. Is it uncensored or not? Let me quote what the Israeli
*  authorities have said. Benjamin Netanyahu, when he quoted Amalek,
*  the scriptures, what does Amalek say? He quotes Amalek when they
*  attacked the Israelites. And what God told the Israelites to do was to
*  destroy every kill, every man, woman, child and livestock. If, I would
*  put it to you, an Islamist leader was quoting a similarly genocidal
*  passage from the Koran, you would not hesitate... Can I respond? No,
*  no, we haven't... You have a lot. I'm going to respond just quickly.
*  Israeli officials said that Gaza will end up being a city of tents with
*  no building standing. They are attacking for damage, not for
*  accuracy. The agricultural minister, he said we are rolling out a new
*  NACPA. A NACPA is the mass expulsion of 700,000 Palestinians in 1948.
*  This is why hundreds of genocide scholars, people who are actually,
*  unlike you and I, experts in the field of genocide studies, fear that a
*  genocide is taking place. The difference between Israel and Hamas is
*  that they do not have the capacity to wipe out Israel. Israel is wiping
*  Gaza off the map. I really do think this is an important point here
*  about consistency and hypocrisy. Piers thinks what's happening in Ukraine
*  is genocide, but not Gaza. How does that make sense? So we spoke about
*  it some more. Israel could, if they wanted to, kill everyone in Gaza.
*  They decided not to do that. Genocide is where you want to kill
*  everyone. Sorry, sorry. Your definition of genocide, because in Ukraine,
*  it's not the same as in the last Ukraine. That simply not happened.
*  Nor has he stated his intention to do so, nor as brutal... Sorry, Vladimir
*  Putin, to be clear, absolutely, by illegally invading a sovereign
*  country and indiscriminately bombing anything in front of him, is waging
*  a sort of genocide. Wow. Indiscriminate bombing, Gaza, more than two
*  Hiroshima bombs have been dropped on East London in the space of five
*  weeks. I'm going to have to put this to you. 15,000 people have now been
*  killed now by the Israelis, estimate, in Gaza. One in every 200 people in
*  Gaza have now been killed. If you were to adjust the population in Ukraine,
*  that would be 300,000 Ukrainian civilians. 300,000, there's been a
*  terrible death toll. It's estimated by the UN, 10,000 civilians have been
*  killed since February last year. In the space of five weeks, a country
*  with a much, much smaller population has had a much higher death toll,
*  higher officially than that in Ukraine. How can it be... I'm going to
*  answer. How can it be that you call that genocide, but when you have
*  nearly half the entire civilian death toll of the Bosnian War in a
*  country which is twice the size in terms of population, why isn't that
*  genocide? I've just answered your question by saying if Israel wanted to
*  commit genocide, they would simply... So would Russia. They would nuke
*  Ukraine. Russia wants to take over Ukraine. Yes. And they want to take
*  over Gaza. And it will kill any number of Ukrainians, men, women and
*  children in that process. The death rate in Gaza is much, much higher.
*  Hang on. The only reason it hasn't is that actually Ukraine has a large
*  military supported by countries like the United States and is putting up
*  a hell of a fight. Russia has nuclear weapons. Russia... By the way, Ukraine
*  gave theirs up. Russia has an armed force. Let me ask you... No, you've
*  got to accept this. Hang on. No, no. I'm going to accept anything. A far
*  bigger death rate in Ukraine. I've explained why. You haven't explained
*  why. Yes, I have. Israel have made it clear... You didn't hear me. Israel
*  have made it clear that they intend to occupy Gaza permanently. Yeah, which
*  they should not be allowed to do. What did the Israeli ministry leak
*  intelligence... Sorry, it's my interview of you, not your
*  interview of me. Just an error on my own part there. I misspoke. I meant
*  to say that pre-war Bosnia had twice the population of
*  pre-war Gaza. It's actually, I'm afraid, worse than what I actually said.
*  Forty thousand Bosnian civilians died during the three-year Bosnian
*  war. And I have to say that war in the 90s when I was obviously very young, hung
*  over, current events, is really one of the great horrors of our time. Now, that
*  death toll actually includes several thousand Bosnian Serb civilians. The most apt comparison
*  there in this case would be with Israeli civilians. So the proportion of
*  civilians killed in Gaza after five and a half weeks is conceivably about half
*  the proportion of civilians killed in Bosnia after three years. And bear in mind
*  the US and Israeli private estimates suggest it's actually considerably
*  higher. We don't know how many have been killed in Gaza. It's now impossible to
*  know what the death toll is. On Putin, what Piers said isn't accurate. Putin's
*  own view of Ukrainians is that they are basically, along with Belarusians,
*  Russians in denial and therefore should be part of a greater Russia under Moscow's
*  domination, of course. Israel's view of Palestinians is obviously not that they
*  are Israelis in denial. Israel's leaders are very clear, many of them certainly,
*  that they would simply prefer Palestinians not to be there. They don't consider them
*  a people, certainly not a land they have decided belongs to a greater Israel. Now,
*  yes, in the way that senior Israeli politicians have repeatedly claimed, there
*  was no such thing as the Palestinian people. Putin has claimed that the idea of
*  a Ukrainian nation is a fiction. He blames the Bolsheviks basically for
*  inventing Ukraine. It's just an absurdity. Now, you could argue that murderously
*  Russianising Ukrainians is genocidal. The point is we have an Israeli state which
*  uses genocidal rhetoric, as I went into, which is slaughtering a much higher rate
*  of civilians than we saw in Bosnia than we've seen in Ukraine. And although, and
*  it's important to say this, I quoted UN statistics on Ukraine, they are likely to
*  underplay significantly the number of civilians killed in Ukraine. But 300,000
*  Ukrainian civilians have not been killed in this hideous war Putin has launched.
*  Nobody has made any such claim. It's also significantly higher than Syria. It's
*  estimated around 300,000 Syrian civilians have been killed since 2011, which is
*  the equivalent of 30,000 Palestinian civilians in Gaza. So again, about half the
*  proportion of Palestinian civilians have been killed in five and a half weeks as
*  Syrian civilians in a 12 year war. I know this is macabre, making these sorts of
*  comparisons, but we do need to understand the sheer horror, the scale of what's
*  actually happening in Gaza right now. Now, we also know there are open plans to
*  ethnically cleanse Gaza amongst senior politicians in Israel to seize its land.
*  And in the West Bank, we're seeing huge numbers of illegal settlements, of course,
*  ethnic cleansing, murderously so, and an open desire from senior Israeli
*  politicians to annex the lot, thereby permanently scrubbing the Palestinian
*  people and nation out of existence. So there we go. Again, the question, why is it
*  genocide in Ukraine, but not genocide in Palestine? The life of a Ukrainian and
*  Palestinian should not be considered any different. Anyway, I'd love your thoughts.

*  video to get the message out. Please like and subscribe as ever. Keep the show on
*  the road on patreon.com forward slash orange over 84. We have a lot of content on

*  hear. I'll speak to you soon.
