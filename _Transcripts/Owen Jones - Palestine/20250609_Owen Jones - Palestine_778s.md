# Israel KIDNAPS Aid Ship With Greta Thunberg And Courageous Activists
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw)
*  A state which regards Greta Thunberg and other peace activists as mortal threats because they're [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=0.0s)]
*  trying to help the people who are being deliberately starved to death is a state which is, in the end, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=5.36s)]
*  going to lose. The Israeli military has stormed and Haidat, the Madeline, is a UK-flagged [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=11.6s)]
*  humanitarian ship which was carrying aid for the starved, maimed, homeless, displaced, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=17.52s)]
*  traumatised, bereaved people of Gaza. They kidnapped the crew in international waters, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  defying international law as is Israel's want. The Madeline was a ship launched by the Freedom [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=27.44s)]
*  Flotilla Coalition that was launched itself in 2010 because as we'll discuss Gaza has been [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=33.68s)]
*  besieged for a very long time. The 12-strong crew included former activists from Brazil, France, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=38.56s)]
*  Turkey, Spain, the Netherlands. Two of those detained are journalists, one is a French-Palestinian [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=46.56s)]
*  member of the European Parliament. All of the crew recorded videos in anticipation of their arrest, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=51.040000000000006s)]
*  let's hear what Greta Thunberg had to say. Now we know it had been intercepted by Israeli vessels [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=56.24s)]
*  and quadcopter drones. These quadcopters, it should be noted, have slaughtered so many [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=84.48s)]
*  Palestinian civilians, including children. Their communications were jammed to begin with. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=89.12s)]
*  Right now they're jamming our comms. They're saying random stuff just to jam our communication. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=95.2s)]
*  They are doing this so that we cannot get help. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=105.2s)]
*  Here was the moment when the boat came under attack from Israeli forces, which was obviously [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=109.92s)]
*  a very stressful moment for the crew. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=114.24s)]
*  They say that they want to intercept us in a very calm way, but this is not what's happening. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=144.24s)]
*  There is another war crime about to happen. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  We will keep you updated. Please put pressure on the governments. Tell them that we are here [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=154.88s)]
*  because they are aiding and abetting this genocide. They are upholding a legal blockade. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=161.12s)]
*  They're using starvation as a weapon of war. This cannot go on. We cannot live in a future like this. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=168.32000000000002s)]
*  You need to do everything in your power. Use your bodies, use your voices. Amplify the voice [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=174.72s)]
*  of Palestinians and do tell them that we are here because they're not doing their jobs. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=180.88s)]
*  We can hear Francesca Albanese, the UN Special Rapporteur for the Palestinian Territories, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=187.12s)]
*  who witnessed what was happening because she was online communicating with the crew. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=190.88s)]
*  Quite shocking because I've been on the phone with the captain for on and off for [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=195.52s)]
*  over the period of two hours. I was talking to them to try to just to check how they were doing [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=203.36s)]
*  when five speed boats encircled the boat. This is when the alarm was given. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=210.56s)]
*  They asked me to be on call and to record everything because of course everything [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=219.68s)]
*  could go wrong. Then things seemed to be quiet until two quadcopters reached the boat. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=224.24s)]
*  In the beginning the team thought that they were drones, simple drones. Then when they identified [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=232.32s)]
*  that they were quadcopters, so the machines that can shoot and kill, they went undercover. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=238.32s)]
*  They didn't move since. After about 30 minutes, I received another call. They had been intercepted. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=244.88s)]
*  The soldiers were getting on the boat. I heard the crew being ordered to stay calm, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=252.23999999999998s)]
*  just to keep their hands up. I was talking to the captain when the line was cut. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=260.56s)]
*  I think they are now being, the Madeline has been taken and they were probably being [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=268.32s)]
*  taken to Ashdod. Israel has said it will deport them but after it has made them watch a video of [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=275.2s)]
*  atrocities committed by Hamas on 7 October. The idea seems to be there that making them watch a [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=280.08s)]
*  snuff video will convince them that Palestinians should actually be exterminated after all. Look, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=284.72s)]
*  I watched that video. I watched the idea video of the atrocities of 7 October. The contents of which, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=289.36s)]
*  by the way, are largely in the public domain. As you probably have noticed, it didn't stop me [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=294.48s)]
*  from being a passionate opponent of Israel committing every single war crime under the sun. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=299.36s)]
*  Israel seems to think that this is the only time the state has unleashed a genocide using [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=304.16s)]
*  atrocities committed by an armed group drawn for the ethnic group which is then suffering the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=309.52000000000004s)]
*  genocide. The Rwandan genocide and Srebrenica are two genocides in my lifetime which were justified [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=314.71999999999997s)]
*  using war crimes committed by the other. Perhaps they think that humane people watch war crimes and [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=321.68s)]
*  think, do you know what? This makes me want to commit far more extreme, far more lethal, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=326.88s)]
*  far more devastating war crimes than those atrocities I've just watched. But you see, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=330.88s)]
*  that isn't how humane people behave as Israel will discover. Now, the Israeli foreign ministry issued [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=334.56s)]
*  a statement, and well, they have quite some fun. They describe this as a selfie yacht of the [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=340.56s)]
*  celebrities. Well, Israel knows all about selfies given the propensity of its soldiers to take [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=345.2s)]
*  laughing, smiling, joking selfies as they commit war crimes and joke around with the pilfered [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=349.92s)]
*  belongings of Palestinians they've murdered or maimed or displaced or some of the combination [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=354.08s)]
*  of that from women's underwear to children's toys. They then made claims to the foreign ministry [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=358.8s)]
*  about Israel delivering aid to the people of Palestine, which I'll just put up a book. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=364.88s)]
*  A key point though is Israel has mocked this crew for having on board minimal aid and say, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=369.12s)]
*  this is all a stunt. Well, yes, it is a stunt, what of it? The point of the exercise was to draw [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=374.71999999999997s)]
*  attention to Israel's mass deliberate starvation of its entire people, facilitated by Western [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=379.12s)]
*  government and aided and abetted by Western media outlets who systematically failed to tell [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=384.0s)]
*  the Western public the truth about what has been done in their name. That's why it falls to activists [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=389.84s)]
*  like this crew to raise the alarm, to force a conversation, a discussion about one of the [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=396.0s)]
*  great crimes of our age happening right this moment. Now Israel's Western allies could break [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=403.28s)]
*  this siege at any point. They could have broken the siege at any point, parking the fact that if [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=409.36s)]
*  Western arms sales to Israel were stopped and Israel was sanctioned, this genocide would immediately [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=412.64s)]
*  end. But you know what, if Britain, Germany, France and so on sent hundreds of ships carrying [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=416.96s)]
*  aid, what would Israel have done? What would they do? Even Israel is not insane enough to go to war [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=421.44s)]
*  with several European nations. It is insane, don't get me wrong, but not that insane. We should [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=425.84s)]
*  note, however, that this crew could have suffered a worse fate. Israeli security sources briefed [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=430.23999999999995s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's favourite television station in Israel that they [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=434.56s)]
*  could be eliminated and in 2010, the Israeli military stormed another aid fortiller and killed [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=440.4s)]
*  10 activists in the process. The truth is that Israel is starving the Palestinian people, a grave [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=445.44s)]
*  war crime on purpose and it's lying about it. I've just written about this in my Guardian column, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=450.64s)]
*  Israel has been besieging Gaza for a very long time. The gradual closure of suffocation of Gaza [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=455.84s)]
*  began as long ago as 1991. In 2006, Israel imposed what became the longest blockade on earth of our [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=460.08s)]
*  age, with an advisor to the then Israeli Prime Minister Ehudet Al-Maq declaring the idea is to [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=466.32s)]
*  put the Palestinians on the diet, but not to make them die of hunger. Six years later, the Israeli [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=471.2s)]
*  newspaper Haaretz published a leaked official document in which officials had calculated the [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=476.15999999999997s)]
*  minimum number of calories for a human not to starve, the idea being to make the Palestinian [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=480.48s)]
*  population suffer, but not to all die and thus incur global outrage. A year before the 7th of [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=484.56s)]
*  October, which is obviously, you know, not when this all began as Israel has sought to pretend, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=490.48s)]
*  the World Food Program warned of a dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, noting around [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=496.96s)]
*  half of its trapped people were severely food insecure. In the last 20 months, Israel imposed [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=501.2s)]
*  a deliberately lethal siege which the West could have ended at any time. There was the constant [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=507.6s)]
*  broadcasting of genocide intent, of the intent to starve its people. I mean, the Israeli General [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=512.32s)]
*  Ghassan Ali, who had headed the wing of the Israeli military, charged supposedly with humanitarian [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=517.84s)]
*  affairs, he declared on the 10th of October that the citizens of Gaza had collected guilt and that [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=523.44s)]
*  human beasts are dealt with accordingly. Israel has imposed a total blockade in Gaza, no electricity, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=529.0400000000001s)]
*  no water, just damage. You wanted hell, you will get hell. That was in a tweet, that video, which [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=533.7600000000001s)]
*  was addressed to Hamas and the residents of Gaza. So there's no, you know, that was just one statement [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=538.08s)]
*  which did not even try to hide the explicit unapologetic commitment to perpetrating this [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=544.0s)]
*  grave war crime against the civilian population. It better have got any coverage in the Western media, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=549.44s)]
*  as those statements barely did and continue to not do. Because the Western media has lied by [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=555.2800000000001s)]
*  omission. I mean, it's spread in Israel, it's full stop, but it has lied by omission on a grand scale. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=560.48s)]
*  Lying by omission is lying and it has deceived the Western public as to what a Western ally has been [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=567.1199999999999s)]
*  doing, facilitated by Western governments. The media then treated the subsequent hunger and [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=571.68s)]
*  famine as if it was like some natural disaster. That's why it forced these activists to educate [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=576.2399999999999s)]
*  people. Well over a year ago, the then British Foreign Secretary David Cameron wrote a letter [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=580.56s)]
*  explaining ways in which Israel was deliberately blocking aid, such as excessively screening [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=586.16s)]
*  requirements, arbitrary denials of aid, not opening more land routes, not opening land routes [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=589.84s)]
*  for long enough, leaving British aid, languishing at the border for weeks. The British government [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=595.84s)]
*  didn't take any action. Last April, two US government departments concluded Israel was [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=599.9200000000001s)]
*  deliberately blocking humanitarian aid from getting to Gaza. That legally required the US to cease [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=603.9200000000001s)]
*  providing weapons. They didn't do that. They broke their own laws. Again, none of that got any coverage [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=608.8000000000001s)]
*  in the Western media. What Israel has done in the last 20 months, as per the 1948 Genocide Convention, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=613.6s)]
*  has been deliberately inflicted on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=618.56s)]
*  its physical destruction in whole or in part. It's killed over 450 aid workers, obviously crucial [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=622.64s)]
*  in providing aid, systematically killed security officers who were charged with protecting the aid, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=628.7199999999999s)]
*  destroyed infrastructure needed to carry aid, blocked fuel and water needed to cook food, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=634.0799999999999s)]
*  destroyed almost all agricultural land, destroyed almost all cropland, destroyed almost all plant [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=640.8s)]
*  life, killed almost all of Gaza's cattle and poultry, virtually ended milk production, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=645.36s)]
*  criminalized UNRWA, the main humanitarian agency. It has cooperated with criminal gangs linked to [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=650.48s)]
*  ISIS, as Israeli politicians themselves are saying, who it has deliberately allowed to steal aid, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=656.4s)]
*  the little aid getting in. It imposed a total blockade on Gaza on the 2nd of March. It then [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=662.4s)]
*  set up a shadowy front called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, or Wellion, which the finance minister, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=666.8000000000001s)]
*  Bezelal Smotrich, said would allow the entry of the minimum necessary so the world does not stop us [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=672.48s)]
*  and accuse us of war crimes. If you're wondering what stop us means, Smotrich openly declares [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=676.24s)]
*  Gaza, Israel will remove all Palestinians from Gaza. The Foundation offers way too little and [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=680.16s)]
*  mostly unusable aid, and it set up aid points in the south to force people in the north to flee there [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=685.6s)]
*  because it's trying to force them into the south so they'll be put in concentration camps, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=690.72s)]
*  where they'll either be forced to choose between death or fleeing Gaza. It then repeatedly massacred [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgbMnxkkunw&t=695.52s)]
