# Defeated MPs Act Like Gaza Genocide's Real Victims
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [July 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eTZs_B3ouI)
*  Just who are the real victims of Israel's genocide against the Palestinian people?
*  Now, many of you might think that's an easy one to answer. It's the Palestinian people. After all,
*  tens of thousands have been slaughtered, many of them children, the survivors forcibly displaced,
*  many of them maimed, starved, deprived of the essentials of life, their homes destroyed,
*  living in an apocalyptic wasteland, grieving for their loved ones,
*  wondering every moment if it will be their turn to be killed.
*  Of course, on every day, it is that moment for many of them to be killed.
*  Well, it turns out not. Those aren't the real victims. The real victims, it turns out,
*  are in fact, Labour politicians who lost their seat in the general election last week,
*  partly because of voters angry about Israel's genocide in Gaza. Yeah, that's right. They're
*  the ones who are really suffering right now. They're the ones we should have in our thoughts.
*  Let's start with our first victim. Please do get your violins out for
*  Fangum Debener. She was a shadow cabinet minister, Labour. She lost her seat in Bristol,
*  central to the Green Party's co-leader, Carla Denier. When I say she lost her seat,
*  it was a safe Labour seat. And the Green candidate, Carla Denier, won 56.6% of the vote,
*  or over 24,000 votes, compared to 32.6% for Debener and her just over 14,000 votes,
*  meaning a majority of over 10,000 for the Greens. A decisive, massive swing by the Greens.
*  Let's just have a little listen to Fangum Debener. It's easy to craft a narrative that goes,
*  your MP didn't vote for a ceasefire if your own party hasn't said we voted twice for a ceasefire
*  and publicly. And yeah, of course, it wasn't that we hid it, but we did not craft a narrative,
*  in my view, or if we did, I didn't see it. And other colleagues suffered terribly, worse than me.
*  Let's just start with that, shall we? Debener claims the problem here is that the Greens were
*  allowed to get away with saying she hadn't voted for a ceasefire, because, and then she blames the
*  fact that Labour didn't come out and say otherwise, the big problem, she says, was Labour didn't craft
*  a narrative. Let's just start with this part about the narrative. Labour did craft a narrative.
*  Well, she said that isn't true. Labour had a narrative. In October last year, Keir Starmer
*  publicly declared that Israel had the right to cut off water and energy. He defended and refused
*  to condemn that war crime of seed not once, but in other interviews that day too, a fact which
*  is conveniently memory hold. He sent shadow cabinet ministers on television afterwards who
*  refused to condemn such a grave, grave war crime, including his then shadow attorney general, my MP,
*  Emily Thorberry, who not only refused to condemn that war crime, but repeatedly refused to denounce
*  it on the grounds that Israel had an absolute right to self-defence. David Lammy, shadow foreign
*  secretary, another lawyer, refused to condemn the mass forcible displacement of the Palestinian
*  population in Gaza as a war crime. Now, instead of apologised for what he had said, and which we can
*  hear because he said it, Starmer let all that stand until two weeks later because there was
*  clearly mounting anger in certain Labour supporting constituencies. And he didn't apologise then either,
*  but simply tried to gaslight us into believing he had never believed Israel had the right to commit
*  the war crime of cutting off water, energy and other essentials of life when we could all again
*  hear what he had said. For months, Labour continued to back this genocide of rampage,
*  refused to condemn it, refused to condemn a single war crime and still to this day,
*  refuses to condemn Israel for war crimes, but it has no problem whatsoever, correctly,
*  for condemning the Russian state for war crimes in Ukraine. It hasn't waited there for an official
*  legal judgment in a court. Putin hasn't been tried. We know he's committing war crimes,
*  the same applies there. They won't apply that same standard. Despite multiple statements of
*  genocidal intent by Israeli leaders and officials from day one, despite on a daily basis overwhelming
*  evidence of hideous war crimes and war crimes against humanity, they supported that on the
*  basis of self-defence. When predominantly Muslim Labour councillors resigned en masse, a party
*  official briefed the press that Labour was, and I'm quoting, shaking off the fleas. Shadow ministers
*  who supported a ceasefire were forced to resign or sacked. Two Labour MPs were suspended, one for
*  saying Israel was committing genocide on the day the International Court of Justice put Israel on
*  trial for alleged genocide, the other for calling for Israelis and Palestinians to live together in
*  perfect harmony between the river and the sea. When the British government cut funding to UNRWA,
*  the UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees, Gaza's main humanitarian agency, on the basis of Israeli
*  lies which have collapsed under actual scrutiny, Labour came out and legitimised that decision,
*  and that decision alone has cost god knows how many lives. In November last year, despite being
*  absolutely crystal clear that Israel was committing some of the worst crimes of the 21st century,
*  Labour abstained on a ceasefire and was publicly backing Israel's so-called right to defence,
*  which we have seen, have we not, how that has been put into practice every single day since the 7th
*  of October. What did Thangam Debenhare do? She abstained in line with what the Labour leadership
*  expected. She had a choice there, she could have resigned, but she did not resign. Whatever my
*  disagreements were there, the shadow minister Jess Phillips, also with similar politics to Thangam
*  Debenhare, she did resign. Now, given she only just kept her seat in this election, she hung on to
*  that seat, I think that was driven by career self-preservation, but whatever, it was the
*  right decision. That underlines Thangam Debenhare had a choice, she chose not to act on it. Now,
*  Thangam Debenhare thought this was about having the wrong narrative, and that it just needs to be
*  explained differently. She could have done so. I approached her for an interview, and this is what
*  happened. Hey, thank you, just did a quick video about the elections going around and so just
*  wondering how's it going? How's the campaign going? We're just about to go out campsite. Oh, I know,
*  but we just want to ask a couple of questions if that's all right. I was just wondering,
*  on Gaza, it keeps coming up at the moment, do you think arms sale embargo, because at the moment
*  it's easy to say that you don't mind you actually interrupting. Do you want to drop us an email?
*  I will set something up for a proper chat. I would know many of the sorts of people who watch my
*  videos, the sorts of people who live in Bristol and are sympathetic to the Green Party and indeed
*  voted for the Green Party. She could have spoke directly to them, she chose not to. After this,
*  the journalist Helen Lewis, who like quite a lot of my colleagues has quite the personal grudge,
*  not least because my colleagues believe that me criticising the industry in which I work is an
*  act of violence, wrote during the campaign, Owen Jones turned up here during the campaign to demand
*  Debener answers questions on Gaza, which is apparently part of this constituency on its
*  new boundaries. Really just goes to show really doesn't it what I'm working with here in this
*  particular industry. This shows an absolute abject lack of interest in the humanity of
*  Palestinians. Would Helen Lewis have said this? If I'd interrogated a reform candidate about Ukraine,
*  she'd have gone, oh Ukraine, does he think that's part of the constituency? No, she would not. And
*  if she did, she had by the way, could have been career ending, I would say. She would have been
*  publicly vilified by across the British media for saying anything like that. But she knew she could
*  say that about Gaza, didn't she? She knew she could get away with that and that would have no
*  consequences for whatsoever. But I was right, wasn't I? I was also right. By Debener's own admission,
*  Gaza did matter to a lot of voters in Bristol, even if their disillusionment with Labour goes
*  deeper than Gaza. Helen Lewis subsequently compared me to far right extremists in the US
*  because I dared to try and ask a publicly accountable would-be government minister about
*  genocide. Again, that's what I'm working with. Let's listen a bit more to Thangin, shall we?
*  I think the party does need to look at the playbook, not just of the Greens, but of reform
*  and the independents, because they all use the same playbook. They didn't always use the same
*  script, although sometimes it was overlapping. But it's a danger if you get in the habit as a
*  campaigning political party of saying things that are actually not true but sound good. I actually
*  did vote for a ceasefire, not once but twice. And our motion, our amendment to the motion in February,
*  that got through unanimously for various, all sorts of reasons, but it did. One of them being
*  we knew how to handle parliaments. Now, that wasn't what the Green Party sent out. And it was
*  difficult because I kind of knew from November that I was going to lose the seat because I thought
*  this is what they'll use and if my party doesn't communicate what we've done, what we're saying,
*  then obviously voters don't know it. They don't follow every tiny twist and turn of politics.
*  They're not all on Twitter. And by the time people have got a belief in their heads and you're on the
*  doorstep saying, no, I voted for it twice, they don't believe you anymore. So to be blunt,
*  your opponents lied and your party failed to tackle the lies.
*  It's more subtle. On the leaflets that they put out, they didn't say that I'd voted against the
*  ceasefire but people interpreted that from them saying she failed to vote for a ceasefire motion.
*  True, I failed to vote for one because it didn't mention the hostages. So she tries to suggest that
*  the Greens lied here. They did not lie. They correctly said she failed to vote for the
*  ceasefire motion. It took Labour four months to publicly back a ceasefire. That includes
*  Thangin De Panair, again, Shadi cabinet minister, or was. So Labour waited for tens of thousands of
*  Palestinians to be sorted, many of them kids. It's not just kids, by the way, that matter.
*  Obviously, it's particularly distressing and sickening, but women and men who were innocent
*  as well. But it took tens of thousands of people who were killed. And that's only the most extreme
*  manifestation of the consequences of this horror until Labour finally changed official tack on one
*  of the worst crimes of our age. But it gets worse. Well, actually, force this wasn't a moral position,
*  wasn't from morality. It was a growing backlash, which as we can see, went on to deprive them of
*  seats. And the Scottish National Party put down a motion which held Israel to account for collective
*  punishment as well as calling for an immediate ceasefire. Now, Starmes did brief journalists
*  that he hated the inclusion of collective punishment in that motion. Understandably,
*  because it would mean then consequences for Israel beyond hand-wringing, which Israel just ignores,
*  it would mean having to take actual concrete action, like ending arms sales, like imposing
*  sanctions. Labour then briefed that they'd blackmailed the Speaker of the House of Commons,
*  a former Labour MP, that if he didn't trash that SMP motion so there could be a watered down
*  Labour version stripping away collective punishment, he would lose his job. That's what Thangin means
*  about understanding parliament. And then Labour drove through a motion which didn't tangibly
*  differ from the Conservative position or indeed the Biden administration's position.
*  It was so milquetoast and platitudinous, that's why it passed unanimously in the House of Commons.
*  Didn't mean anything, it had no teeth. It was done simply to placate
*  huge growing anger over this monstrous crime. Now, Thangin de Menaire has the audacity to suggest
*  if only voters had been on Twitter more, they'd be more informed about Labour's real position.
*  I think if we had a detailed study we'd find actually regular users of Twitter are far more
*  critical of Labour over Gaza, largely because they're witnessing atrocities that most of the
*  media is not even actually showing. The fact is what the Green Party said was entirely accurate,
*  and frankly de Menaire deserves all the condemnation she has got for failing to take a stand against,
*  and I really must emphasise this point, mass murder. Let's listen more.
*  It's easy to craft a narrative that goes your MP didn't vote for a ceasefire,
*  your own party hasn't said we voted twice for a ceasefire and publicly,
*  and other colleagues suffered terribly, worse than me.
*  Goodness grief, goodness grief. Other colleagues suffered terribly more.
*  Suffered. This is a discussion about the political consequences of the mass slaughter of innocent
*  people, and she's talking about MPs being victims. Look, let's be clear, so there's not an attempt to
*  distort what I'm saying here. There was never any excuse for threatening an MP. No one should
*  ever do that, whatever the circumstances. It is however abundantly clear that these MPs are
*  conflating scrutiny and yes, fierce, passionate criticism. We are of course discussing genocide
*  here. That's been conflated with threats and would be violence. That's the problem. Indeed listen on.
*  You know, some of what I had to put up with was that there was a billboard,
*  a huge one, 10 metres away from my house at Two Days to Poll, and your MP didn't vote for a ceasefire,
*  still want to vote Labour or something like that with blood dripping off it, which was horrible.
*  When we were driving past and I had my mum in the car I had to go look a squirrel,
*  and bless her, she did actually look, so she never saw the billboard. But
*  feeling protective of my staff, my volunteers, and my parents, my family, that was very hard.
*  I'm sorry but actually that's nauseating. If you're a senior figure in a political party
*  whose leader backed war crimes, whatever he then said, which has consistently up to this very moment
*  not once condemned Israel for one single war crime, which has still not ended arms sales,
*  let alone called for that in opposition, which repeatedly defended Israel's military onslaught,
*  despite the hideous consequences, and which has monstered and defamed and purged opponents
*  of that genocide, if you're a senior figure in that political party with that record,
*  during the mass slaughter of innocent people, which in concrete terms, let me just be clear here,
*  I'm sorry to say this involves children being slowly cooked to death under rubble,
*  and newborn babies having their tiny little limbs amputated with that anaesthetic, then you're
*  going to have to accept some voters are going to get pretty angry. How do you think history is going
*  to record this, this sort of pity me party, given what we're witnessing in Gaza? That billboard may
*  well have personally been very distressing for you, Vangem, Debener, but not as distressing as
*  the actual atrocities being committed by the Israeli state with Western support against innocent
*  people every single day in Gaza, which your constituents have seen, all too many of them,
*  and they can't unsee what they've seen, knowing you have failed to take a stand when you had the
*  chance. And that is one reason, one reason, not the only reason, but one reason why you have lost,
*  legitimately lost your seat. Let's listen to this. The lack of a strong narrative had consequences.
*  I actually felt in many ways the party gave me good support, but there's a certain level of
*  collateral damage, which I felt was inevitable from November. And then again, in February,
*  when the green prosperity plan got cancelled, you know, that, that was very hard.
*  I feel like I'm losing my mind here. Park thought she's insulting her own voters, basically suggesting
*  the real reason there was hostility over Gaza is they've not been, voters subjected to enough spin
*  from the Labour Party or the right spin, rather than simply being a case of voters rationally
*  assessing Labour's morally despicable position on Gaza. Park called that. She used the word
*  collateral damage to describe herself. That's the term she just used to describe herself.
*  Let's be clear, being voted out democratically by her own electship because they lost confidence in
*  her, that's what happened to her, collateral damage. That's a term normally used by the
*  likes of the Israeli state when they just slaughtered a load of innocent people.
*  Is she doing this on purpose? Just listen to this last bit.
*  And just finally, you said you were going into parliament today to hand in your path.
*  What's that going to be like? That was going to be horrible.
*  Yeah, it's going to be horrible. Listening to this, you'd think this is
*  somebody who suffered a terrible personal bereavement talking through their awful personal tragedy.
*  The real victim here of Israel's genocide or rampage apparently is this Labour MP because she
*  lost an election. The interviewer makes no effort to engage with the actual grievances
*  of the electorate, looking with terrible amounts of sympathy for this horror which poor Thangam
*  Debinay has gone through. No attempt to discuss whether these grievances are legitimate. I've
*  gone through them in the video. She could have interrogated Thangam Debinay about the positions
*  of the Labour Party, which clearly voters have objected to. They weren't duped or lied. Maybe
*  she thinks they were the voters. She could still park that and in the name of impartiality, at
*  least present them. Britain is a country where the media and politicians treat people objecting
*  to migrants and refugees. That's a legitimate concern, but ordinary voters objecting to
*  how politicians respond to genocide, that doesn't count as a legitimate concern clearly.
*  In this case, it's like poor old Thangam Debinay has just suffered a terrible personal downfall.
*  Let's just listen to another example, shall we? Jonathan Ashworth,
*  an our former Labour shadow minister and MP for Leicester South, who lost his seat
*  democratically to the independent candidate, Shokat Adam.
*  Pretty brutal circumstances. Sorry, I have to just stop there. What is it about these people
*  where they keep using violent imagery to describe being voted out democratically by voters who
*  didn't want them anymore when relating that specifically to the political consequences
*  of a genocide or military onslaught which involves actual brutal circumstances?
*  The campaigning, the anger that voters threw at you may have been upsetting,
*  but talking about brutal circumstances when you're literally talking about anger over...
*  Have you seen what's been happening in Gaza, Jonathan Ashworth?
*  I mean, if what you went through is brutal, what the hell is that? Let's carry on.
*  I've never known a campaign of such vitriol, such bullying, such intimidation. I've never
*  seen a member of parliament, Shokat Adam Patel, get elected on the basis of a foul and obnoxious
*  lie that I was responsible for genocide, that I had the blood of Ghazan children on my hands.
*  This was his campaign. I had his supporters bullying and intimidating myself and my key
*  supporters in the streets. And he refuses to get out of it. He's actually gone to ground
*  and he's refusing to answer any questions on this. It's very disrespectful to the people of Leicester
*  South. Foul, obnoxious lies, he puts it. Let's be clear. The objection of these campaigners was
*  that the Labour leadership legitimised a genocide onslaught and specifically that it monstered and
*  tried to silence its actual opponents. And those campaigners are absolutely right. That's what
*  happened. That's just, that's the facts. I've gone through some of the reasons why, and I would note
*  that it meant the British government of the day did not come under any meaningful pressure from
*  Labour to change tack, which given public opinion from the start, opposed Israel's genocide onslaught.
*  That's what the polling shows. Believed overwhelmingly Israel was committing horrific war crimes.
*  Turns out that the electorate have eyes and ears and opposed continued arms sales to Israel. That
*  pressure would undoubtedly have delivered results. But the opposition instead rallied behind the
*  government, allowing them to continue backing Israel and ensuring Israel had carte blanche from
*  Britain to carry on with this genocide rampage. Let's carry on.
*  He's won. I think he's already letting down the people of Leicester South and he won't be able to
*  deliver change. The improvements in Leicester South to our national health service, to the cost of
*  living, to our schools will be because of a Labour government, not an impotent, independent opposition MP.
*  It's just, I mean, so disrespectful suggesting the only MPs that actually matter are government
*  ministers. He says these MPs are impotent. Really, Jonathan, really. Well, we'll see about that,
*  because the fact MPs like you have been defeated over Gaza is far more likely to shift Labour in a
*  different direction on Gaza than clearly anything you've done, which is why you've lost your seat,
*  buddy boy. And I would say, sorry, with all due respect, because you've just become chief executive
*  of a think tank called Labour Together, you're the impotent guy now. You thought you were going to be
*  a government minister. Well, you're not. You've had to settle for chief executive of Labour Together
*  and you think other people are impotent. Congratulations on your new job, by the way. Let's carry on.
*  A campaign was organised nationally by a national organisation called The Muslim Vote, whose campaign
*  was clear on their website. Punish MPs. That's the words they used. The word was punish, was it? Punish
*  MPs. It wasn't we want to effect change on a set of policy issues, like many of the policy issues
*  I've fought on, whether that's calling for a ceasefire, calling for Palestinian statehood,
*  calling for student finance arrangements for Muslim young people in our constituency.
*  Punish MPs is what the national The Muslim Vote organisation talked about. The way he
*  emphasises the Muslim vote, as though that makes it sinister, grim stuff, organisations which
*  mobilise different demographics, particularly those underrepresented in politics and are
*  treated with contempt in our politics, is literally a fundamental part of our democracy. LGBTQ people
*  have always done this, women have done this, black people have done this, and quite rightly so. And
*  then he quotes punish to make it sound sinister. What the Muslim vote said was, and I quote,
*  we're working so that MPs who didn't vote for a ceasefire are punished. Well again, Jonathan
*  Ashworth, you failed to vote for a ceasefire in November and only belatedly voted for a ceasefire
*  four months on after tens of thousands were butchered and only specifically voted for a
*  motion which stripped away any accountability for Israel collective punishment. By punish,
*  we can hear that in context and what the Muslim vote were aiming to do,
*  because they came out and endorsed certain candidates. What they mean is, vote those
*  MPs out of the ballot box. Quite rightly so. That's why you lost. Correctly so. Now, he defends
*  his position by saying, well, he called for a ceasefire. I've covered that. And that he'd
*  called for a Palestinian statehood. I mean, when Jonathan, when's that? Labour's official position
*  is some undetermined time in the future. Spain, ruled by Labour's sister party, has already come
*  out and recognised Palestine with immediate effect, joining, I would note, most countries on
*  earth. What you're discussing here is a meaningless platitude which your constituents quite correctly
*  have seen through. Let's carry on. I was chased down the street, shouted at and screamed at for
*  40, 45 minutes until I had to seek refuge literally in a vicarage. And they waited for me outside the
*  vicarage. And even when I came out of the vicarage, they were shouting at me with megaphones.
*  Do you condemn Netanyahu? Yes or no? See, I am not going to have these guys. I'm just a simple question.
*  Do you condemn Netanyahu? I'm not going to have these guys. No one's bullying you. It's a simple
*  question. We're asking you why you abstain for the vote. You have to vote for a ceasefire. It's a
*  simple question. No one's bullying you. If you can't answer the question, say it. We're not going to have the
*  people intimidate us. No one's intimidating you. Leaflets going around accusing me of being genocide
*  John. Anonymous leaflets all in the name of the successful candidate who won't be able to do
*  anything. Who will stand exposed and impotent, not able to affect change. Accusing me of genocide,
*  throwing blood in my hands. The vitriol is like something I have never seen even though I've
*  called for a ceasefire. Even though I've called for Palestinian statehood. Well, I'd love to know
*  what the circumstances are here of being chased into a vicarage. People criticizing you over your
*  stance, campaigning in the streets. You were an elected politician where they're criticizing you
*  on one of the great crimes of our age. And I've seen footage of you being asked by constituents.
*  You didn't like it, but they were not threatening you. You might not like it. You might find it
*  upsetting. You might find it embarrassing, but it's not threatening, which I think you can see
*  there by laughing about it. Now, I keep seeing this line about a candidate who replaced him being
*  impotent. I don't know what this obsession with impotence is. I honestly think he's going to
*  achieve a lot more than you have, Jonathan, by piling pressure on the governing party to shift
*  in Gaza. Now, Jonathan doesn't like being denounced over genocide. I've gone through his
*  meaningless platitudes. If you're a leading figure in a political party, now the government, which
*  has taken the morally depraved position it has over Gaza, then some of your voters are going to
*  get upset about it. And yes, in some cases that means voting you out. That doesn't mean any voter
*  has the right to threaten you. You haven't presented any evidence I know that they have.
*  If they have, you need to go to the police and you need to present that evidence to the police.
*  That is a police matter. The problem is here is you just don't get it. You're not showing any
*  contrition. These interviews are so revealing about how these politicians think, aren't they?
*  Not just their utter entitlement, which they've not even bothered to suppress, but their lack of
*  humanity. If I were them having been democratically elected, sorry, if I were them having been
*  democratically unelected, democratically defeated out the ballot box, which they blame in large
*  part on people's anger on Gaza, I would say this. I'd go, but look, of course, I understand the
*  utter fury and horror of my constituents. Tens of thousands of our fellow humans after all have been
*  butchered in the most hideous circumstances. Many of them little children. They've been slaughtered,
*  maimed, starved, their homeland reduced to rubble. Of course, I understand the horror and the anger
*  of this. These are hideous, hideous crimes. And I understand why people are angry because the
*  British government has backed Israel to the hill and provides arms to Israel. And I regret the
*  failure of my party to offer political and moral leadership. And I would never ever, ever in any way
*  present myself as the victim. I lost the confidence of my voters and I want to regain their trust.
*  And I understand how a mass of life and death on such a mass scale has caused the stress.
*  I've learned from that and I'll continue to listen about how we as a party must act on that
*  entirely legitimate anger and fury and distress. That's what they should have done. That's what
*  they should be doing. That's what they should be saying. But they didn't do that, did they? Instead,
*  they're being interviewed as though they're the victims. Tiny violins, total contempt for those
*  who campaigned on the basis of opposing Israel's murderous onslaught from the start. A position,
*  which I must say was vindicated in the worst possible way. And I would note those of us who
*  took that position have been repeatedly monstered and I would just add constantly subjected to
*  threats of violence and death threats. Alas, that does not qualify, does it, in this particular
*  debate? Now again, LBC's Andrew Ma there, not even trying to engage with the voters thing.
*  Just listening to poor old Jonathan Ashworth as though he's the victim. If a left-wing Labour
*  MP got voted out by voters objecting, for example, to immigration, do you think they'd be treated as
*  a victim like this? No, they'd be interrogated. They'd be put on the dock, figuratively. But the
*  media class in this country have solidarity with the political class because they fundamentally all
*  have taken a morally repugnant position in Gaza and they all feel contempt about being scrutinised
*  over it. They're not treating voters' anger over this as legitimate because they think that
*  these are the wrong voters and this is the wrong issue. Well, what we're seeing here is hubris.
*  Our politicians and our media outlets have clearly failed to draw the right lessons from last week
*  and instead are having the most undignified public pity party. History's going to be damning,
*  by the way. And the political consequences of their contempt has been felt already,
*  but it will only continue. And I just want to add this as a warning. It's very clear that a lot of
*  these Labour MPs regard scrutiny as violence. Actual threats of violence do need to be dealt
*  with. There is never an excuse for violent threats or death threats. MP security does need to be
*  protected. But what is clearly happening is a conflation with passionate and intense scrutiny
*  of assault, which is crucial in a democracy, not least when we're talking about mass murder.
*  And my fear is these people are going to drive through legislation which acts on that conflation.
*  And restricts the ability of the public to scrutinise politicians on matters quite literally
*  of life and death. Something for us all to bear in mind. Please like and subscribe. Do
*  leave your comments. There's a long one, but we had a lot to talk about. Love to hear your thoughts.
