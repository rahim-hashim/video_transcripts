# London Police SHUT Down Pro-Palestinian Carol Service Organised By Jews, Christians and Muslims
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [December 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs)
*  Please indulge this thought experiment. Imagine a group of mostly older women, as well as little [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=0.0s)]
*  children who were Christian, Jewish, Muslim, led by a priest, came together in Russia, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  outside the Kremlin, to sing Christmas carols and read poems in support of peace, to oppose the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=11.52s)]
*  slaughter of innocent people. And then the Russian police moved in to threaten them all with arrest. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=16.8s)]
*  What would you think? How would our media report it? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=24.0s)]
*  Well, I can tell you, it'd be presented as damning evidence of what an oppressive police state [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=28.16s)]
*  Vladimir Putin runs. But this happened here, in Britain, in London, at an interfaith event [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=32.08s)]
*  in Parliament Square, compared by a vicar, in which carols were sung and poems were read out [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=39.68s)]
*  to oppose the slaughter of the Palestinian people in a genocide, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=46.08s)]
*  armed and facilitated by own government. Here's some footage of the event. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=50.56s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=58.0s)]
*  Excuse me, you're insulting God now, you're insulting Jesus. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=74.72s)]
*  So that you may live deep within your heart. May God bless you with anger as injustice, oppression [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=87.92s)]
*  and exploitation of all people, so that you may work for justice and freedom. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=100.32s)]
*  May God bless you with tears of shame for going through suffering, from pain, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=107.92s)]
*  tension, starvation and shame. So that you may reach out your hand to comfort them [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=114.16s)]
*  and to turn their pain into joy. May God bless you with enough foolishness [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=122.16s)]
*  to believe that you can make a difference in this world. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=130.0s)]
*  The protest was organised by a range of organisations, like branches of the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  Palestine Solidarity Campaign, which of course has been the driving force for the Palestinian [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=137.44s)]
*  calls here in Britain. Jewish voice for labour, Christians for Palestine, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=142.56s)]
*  Queers for Palestine and so on. Now I was honoured to talk to Helen Burnett, who is a Church of [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=146.32s)]
*  England priest, she compared the event, and Diana Neslin, a veteran activist for Jews for Justice, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=151.44s)]
*  who was part of the event as well. So this was an interfaith event, obviously in support of the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=158.4s)]
*  movement for... So this was an interfaith event, and it was an interfaith event which was drawing [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=164.56s)]
*  attention to the genocide being suffered by the Palestinian people at the hands of the Israeli [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=170.08s)]
*  state, not just Muslim Palestinians, but of course, Christian Palestinians. And this brought together [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=174.08s)]
*  Muslims, Christians and Jewish people, non-believers, obviously using the festive time as a very [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=179.52s)]
*  important hook. Now I think the way the police responded is informative about how those who are [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=187.44s)]
*  active for Palestinian justice are treated, but also the general state of civil liberties in this [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=197.68s)]
*  country, I would say. I just want to start with you, actually, Helen. I mean, you're a [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=201.52s)]
*  Eurovican, the diocese of Southwark, you've been active in movements for justice, I know, for a [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  long time. Can you just tell us a bit more about what this event was all about? The event was [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=212.0s)]
*  really about bringing the carols out onto the streets. There are carol services happening across [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=217.60000000000002s)]
*  London at this time of year in nice, cosy, sanctified places, and they are peddling [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=220.96s)]
*  something of a myth to people who want to just swallow hook, line and sink of the idea of [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=227.76000000000002s)]
*  baby Jesus, Meek and Mild, and have their little shot of Christianity and then go back to shopping. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=232.08s)]
*  So for me, the disconnect between the words of the carols and what is actually happening on the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=237.76000000000002s)]
*  ground in Palestine right now is like a massive wound in my ministry at the moment. So the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=243.84s)]
*  opportunity to sing in an interfaith context with my Muslim and Jewish siblings with words that [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=249.84s)]
*  reflect the actual facts on the ground for Palestinian Christians, Muslims and Jews, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=256.96s)]
*  and also reown the words from some of the mythologising that has gone on because Jesus [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=263.28000000000003s)]
*  was a Palestinian Jew born in a to occupied territory. So it felt like a golden opportunity [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=269.36s)]
*  to sing words that are profoundly moving to very familiar tunes and there's a sort of dissonance [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=276.72s)]
*  between the tunes that are so familiar to us and then the words coming across that are less [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=284.16s)]
*  familiar because they've been rewritten to amplify the story of the genocide and the apartheid in [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=290.0s)]
*  Palestine right now. I mean, Diana, you're a veteran activist with Jews for Justice for Palestinians. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=296.56s)]
*  Why was this important for you, this event? What was it all about for you? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=302.72s)]
*  It's very important for Jews to recognise that obviously some Jews celebrate Christmas, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=306.24s)]
*  others don't, but it's important for all of us to recognise what is happening and what is being done [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=314.0s)]
*  in Israel, in Palestine and what is being done by Jews at this time. And we have to reflect the fact [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=322.88000000000005s)]
*  that we disapprove strongly of what is going on and most of the words that were written for the [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=332.4s)]
*  carols were written by Jewish people, Jewish people who feel a sense of shock, a sense of horror, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=341.04s)]
*  a sense of shame and for some of us rage. I can't describe the feelings that those of us have [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=348.32s)]
*  who are watching what is going on and feeling helpless. So this is one way of reflecting [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=357.76000000000005s)]
*  our views, our feelings at a very difficult time. Very courageous and it's obviously been inspiring [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=365.84000000000003s)]
*  throughout on both sides of the Atlantic how many of course Jewish activists has been in the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=373.76s)]
*  movement for Palestinian liberation. What happened there with the police? Helen, do you want to explain [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=378.64000000000004s)]
*  or Diana, whoever wants to go first? I think I was at the centre of things because I was sort of [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=383.76s)]
*  comparing the event. So I was close to the Christ in a rubble that we have created, of course referring [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=388.32s)]
*  to Muntza Isaac's nativity scene in his church. He's a pastor in Bethlehem just so everyone knows [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=394.71999999999997s)]
*  who Muntza Isaac is. Yeah, so we were using this iconic image that he had a year ago, so we'd [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=403.44s)]
*  recreated that with the crypt from my church and a baby and so on. I was at the centre, so I was [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=409.2s)]
*  within a group of sort of six, seven deep, but I was very aware as we began after probably the first [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=414.32s)]
*  carol of a very heavy police presence. So the police beginning to edge towards us and then starting to [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=422.32s)]
*  see police officers addressing carol singers, talking to them and I became increasingly aware [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=429.28s)]
*  that actually they were beginning to threaten to arrest people. So then we had decisions to make [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=436.4s)]
*  because we brought people together into a safe space. We wanted actually to create a sacred space [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=442.96s)]
*  where there could be a real sense of the sacred of all people there and the voices of all people [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=448.23999999999995s)]
*  being heard. But there was this sense and then the vans pulled up and then a whole contingent [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=454.56s)]
*  of the police turned up on the pavement and lined up and I started to get a real sense that [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=459.91999999999996s)]
*  they were very intentional about their disruption and interruption of what we were doing. Diana may [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=465.68s)]
*  have more to add to that. Yeah, what happened was they came and told us we would be arrested [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=472.71999999999997s)]
*  and we asked what for and they said for protesting and we said we were singing carols and they said [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=482.88s)]
*  well you've got Palestinian flags and we said well Jesus was a Palestinian and was born in [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=490.32s)]
*  Bethlehem. Then they said that we couldn't understand why we would be arrested and what [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=496.88s)]
*  we had done wrong and they said there was this section 14 which is part of the Police and Criminal [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=508.15999999999997s)]
*  Act of 2000. Section 14 they can disperse what they call a standing protest and although we tried to [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=519.52s)]
*  reason with them that this was not a protest, this was a carol singing, they were absolutely [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=530.0s)]
*  committed to what they were doing which was really quite difficult for us to understand. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=539.52s)]
*  We had a speech that Helen was going to give, a blessing, everything was disrupted, it was a [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=547.52s)]
*  wonderful inspirational experience and yet suddenly it felt violent and destructive and abusive and [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=556.24s)]
*  harassing and that's what I told the police in my complaint letter because it felt as if what we [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=565.92s)]
*  were doing was good and what they were trying to do was make us bad and criminal, almost criminal. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=575.92s)]
*  Interesting that you should mention the blessing Diana because as I was trying to get the final [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=585.36s)]
*  blessing we decided to draw it to a close because of this threat of the rest and didn't want to make [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=589.5999999999999s)]
*  people vulnerable. As I started the blessing I know that I had four nuns present who were saying to [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=594.64s)]
*  the police you can't possibly stop this, a blessing is happening. So it was a real [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=601.28s)]
*  extraordinary kind of collision of police power and worship of a type. I mean I have to say just [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=605.76s)]
*  you know taking a step back, I mean anyone who's seen the video footage, just to be you know, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=614.88s)]
*  don't take this the wrong way, not the most threatening image I've ever seen in my entire [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=620.56s)]
*  life. I mean literally just a group of you know often many older women in particular standing [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=625.12s)]
*  around singing carols, what possible justification in the minds of the police could there be to use [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=631.76s)]
*  police powers to threaten to arrest people? What possible violent disruption could possibly be [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=639.68s)]
*  imagined from a carol service for peace? It's I mean how just I mean that's what's astonishing [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=646.96s)]
*  here isn't it, it's just surreal and what you'd expect at its import dictation. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=654.08s)]
*  It's something that you have found in police states, it's something you find in authoritarian [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=661.12s)]
*  states, it's not something you expect in this country and they were not only, I have to say [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=667.04s)]
*  I'm disabled, I have crutches and there were children, little children there, with mothers [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=673.36s)]
*  who were frightened and who will grow up feeling that the police are not their friends. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=681.36s)]
*  You know so that's good to have a little education early I feel but yeah carry on. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=689.44s)]
*  But yeah it was I cannot think and in fact when they wrote back to me following my complaint, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=699.12s)]
*  so just explain that you complained to the police and then they got back. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=709.76s)]
*  Yes I sent them a letter of complaint and I got a very quick response, extremely quick, they didn't [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=714.3199999999999s)]
*  even interview any witnesses, I've given a couple of names as witnesses and they said they couldn't [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=721.36s)]
*  find any reason for their action but they gave me a few options, namely that we would be, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=730.48s)]
*  that there was a chance of noise and disruption and also of, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=743.6s)]
*  of, oh I'm sorry I've got something wrong, and also of disturbing other communities which [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=750.8s)]
*  I haven't got the exact words I can see. There are very particular powers in Parliament Square [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=765.1999999999999s)]
*  about noise aren't there since the new police crime and detention bill and they, I think they're [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=770.7199999999999s)]
*  very muddled that would be a generous, yeah I mean I've got the letter here, they're muddled [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=775.2s)]
*  about how they apply those so we weren't making a noise, the man who objected to the Iraq war [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=781.2s)]
*  from you know as a result of his encampment the rules changed around Parliament Square, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=786.08s)]
*  you could say it might have been that. I'm just, I've got, is it okay if I just read a bit because [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=791.0400000000001s)]
*  I've got your letter here, is it okay if I read a bit from it, because in it he says I would like [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=795.5200000000001s)]
*  to apologize on behalf of the Metropolitan Police for any upset or distressed cause due to the [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=799.9200000000001s)]
*  dispersal, I've checked, I've chatted to them to find out why dispersal was ordered so I could [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=803.52s)]
*  offer you an explanation, unfortunately I could not find anything relating to the incident, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=808.0799999999999s)]
*  and then it goes on there's several reasons as you said, a dispersal might be in place, one might be [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=812.0s)]
*  to do with public safety, if the crowds were getting too big or a traffic was being disrupted, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=815.76s)]
*  well that doesn't apply, I mean it was a modest size carol service I would say, traffic, you [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=819.84s)]
*  weren't standing in the middle of the road, another reason may have been the event may have been [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=826.48s)]
*  causing public community tensions, I mean that really is Orwellian, it's an interfaith event, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=829.92s)]
*  it's an event of Christians, Jewish people and Muslims, it's literally bringing communities [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=836.0s)]
*  together, what could be better for dealing with community tensions than a show of solidarity [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=842.88s)]
*  between the three Abrahamic faiths, the three religions of the Holy Land, I mean come on, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=848.4s)]
*  I mean it's just stupid isn't it, I'm not saying any of these reasons were the cause, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=854.56s)]
*  the reason they're not saying there's a reason for the cause is because they are nonsense, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=858.4s)]
*  but could it have been a possibility, well clearly not, so the Met clearly there, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=862.48s)]
*  they said we have no idea, they've then come up with two hypotheticals which are irrelevant, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=867.36s)]
*  completely and utterly irrelevant, and then it says I hope you have a positive experience [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=873.92s)]
*  should another event be organised, but of course you will now have, rationally as others will have, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=878.72s)]
*  the fear that any event however vanilla, however the least possible aggressive protest is an [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=883.84s)]
*  interfaith event with carols, will always have that fear that police could get involved, leading [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=898.72s)]
*  people to feel harassed and threatened, including little children, so it's not good enough is it, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=904.88s)]
*  that response is not good enough, they've said oh no idea, here's two reasons which aren't applicable. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=912.08s)]
*  I'm not sure whether in fact they got a bloody nose out of that, I'm not sure about that, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=919.9200000000001s)]
*  I'm not sure about whether other people complained, but I mean the look for the metropolitan police [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=927.76s)]
*  was very bad, and we also know that the section 14 dispersal orders, 98% of them [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=935.8399999999999s)]
*  are used by the metropolitan police, and the metropolitan police already has a problem in terms [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=947.36s)]
*  of the feelings of the local people, it has to regain confidence, and this is no way to regain [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=956.16s)]
*  confidence of the local population who already are extremely suspicious of the metropolitan. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=966.64s)]
*  Yeah and as you allude to, I mean a government report last year found that the metropolitan [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=973.52s)]
*  police are institutionally racist, institutionally sexist, institutionally homophobic, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=978.24s)]
*  and institutionally corrupt, so there's a threat to community relations, I don't think it comes from [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=983.12s)]
*  an interfaith event of Jewish, Christian and Muslim people for peace, singing carols, I think [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=987.52s)]
*  probably the metropolitan police have more answers in that respect. And just finally though, I mean [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=993.84s)]
*  well done for taking a stand, both of you, but also for being able to come forward and speak about [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=998.48s)]
*  this, I mean just you know, we don't want to obviously put people off, I mean it's more [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1004.0s)]
*  important to organise events like this in response. Yeah but I suppose what would your final message [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1008.96s)]
*  be just in terms of you know, your resolution to keep speaking out, Helen? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1016.72s)]
*  My resolution is to build on these interfaith connections because I think [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1024.64s)]
*  they're so powerful, they're clearly so powerful they're fighting the Met, so they must be doing [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1029.8400000000001s)]
*  something right, to be able to form those links and to be really visible about that, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1034.72s)]
*  to push back against the binary argument that this is an Arab-Jewish affair, this is about ordinary [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1041.76s)]
*  people from all faiths and none who are being slaughtered, and the more we can speak out against [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1049.6000000000001s)]
*  that, the more we can be seen to be unified, that is what's frightening, you know, that we are, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1055.68s)]
*  many they are, few syndrome applies to faith as well as many other areas of political activism. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1060.56s)]
*  And indeed the Christian community of Gaza which has been there for most of the time that [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1067.12s)]
*  Christianity has existed may not survive this. Absolutely, it's a tiny minority now. Exactly. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1071.6799999999998s)]
*  I've interviewed Ghazan Christians on this channel, you know, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1080.08s)]
*  whose relatives have been murdered, one of them their father and their little sister, both [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1084.16s)]
*  Palestinian Christians who were killed by Israel's genocide in Gaza. And actually these events give [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1090.08s)]
*  them so much hope, I mean that's one of the things I'm in touch with the Al Makror family, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1095.12s)]
*  with the Kaseer family in the Al Makror Valley, and when they know things like this are happening, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1098.72s)]
*  it's a tiny glimmer of hope for them. What about you, Diana? This must go on, our answer has to [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1103.76s)]
*  be we will not be intimidated, we will not allow them to challenge us and to say we have no place [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1113.4399999999998s)]
*  here. It is our place. We are the people speaking for humanity, we are the people speaking for [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1121.04s)]
*  truth, for justice, for equality and for self-determination. We will not be intimidated, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1128.32s)]
*  we will not be corralled into some little place that silences us. For many of us Jews who have [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1136.32s)]
*  chosen to stand against oppression, silence has always been the option that Zionists use. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1145.4399999999998s)]
*  Now it feels as if the Metropolitan Police is using that as well. But what we need to do is [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1153.9199999999998s)]
*  to show that our unity is an answer to that. Our unity is the way we fight back, our unity is the [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1162.64s)]
*  way we show the world what is best and what is good and what is right. At a time when we're seeing [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1171.2800000000002s)]
*  evil every single day on our phones, on our televisions, and we need to stand up and we [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1178.8000000000002s)]
*  need to stand strong and that is our message. All of us, all of us together will be, and one day [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1187.76s)]
*  please, I mean this is our message, this is our message for New Year, this is our message for [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1196.72s)]
*  Christmas and it's our message for Hanukkah which happens at the same time and which is happening [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1201.28s)]
*  at the same space. So that is what we need to say. Amen. Amen to that, I was going to say amen to [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1208.16s)]
*  that. A very powerful galvanizing message for the New Year. I feel galvanized by that, galvanized to [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1215.2s)]
*  do more as we all should do to use everything we have in our power, every platform we have to speak [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1220.0800000000002s)]
*  out against one of the most obscene crimes of our age, directly facilitated and armed by our [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1226.0s)]
*  governments and indeed as we speak the people of Palestine, as many will be celebrating across the [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1232.88s)]
*  West are starving, being slaughtered in the apocalyptic ruins of Gaza whilst others are [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1239.2s)]
*  suffering pogroms in the West Bank. So let's remember that we have a privilege to speak out here [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1246.64s)]
*  when so many are being butchered and ignored by media outlets which are complicit in this [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1255.76s)]
*  genocide. Thank you so much for both of your courage, your determination, your wisdom, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1261.76s)]
*  and your resolution. Everyone watching this video please share it, get their words out, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1266.32s)]
*  leave comments, press like, that's good for the algorithm therefore more people will listen. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1270.1599999999999s)]
*  Please be galvanized, the lesson here is not of course to be intimidated, it's to be more [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1273.6799999999998s)]
*  determined to speak out so let's do that in the New Year. Thanks so much to both of you. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1278.8s)]
*  Thank you for hosting us. Thank you. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gGowhg5LJs&t=1284.3999999999999s)]
