# Israel Seeks Palestine's "ERASURE": UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [August 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE)
*  Now, it's been over 10 months of Israel's genocidal onslaught against Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=0.0s)]
*  We don't know how many have been slaughtered. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=4.4s)]
*  We know based on looking at previous [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  some mass violence that in these situations, it's indirect deaths [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=11.0s)]
*  which end up killing the most. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  But we know that this is one of the great crimes of our age. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=17.16s)]
*  And one of the voices of [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=19.92s)]
*  clarity, more clarity, but also just the facts about what's actually happening, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=23.68s)]
*  what's being committed, perpetrated against the Palestinian people, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=28.08s)]
*  has been Francesca Albanese, the UN special reporter on the Occupied [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=31.68s)]
*  Palestinian Territories. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=34.839999999999996s)]
*  And, you know, I have to say [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=36.12s)]
*  and it is important to say this, I think, and obviously, you know, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=39.96s)]
*  there's a broader context of the Palestinian journalists being slaughtered [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=43.12s)]
*  and the biggest slaughter of journalists in modern, in any recorded conflict. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=47.12s)]
*  But I just want to say that Francesca has taken a huge amount [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=52.68s)]
*  of attack onslaught from the pro-Israeli lobby, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=57.04s)]
*  from the United States government even. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  I mean, a really vicious onslaught. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=64.52s)]
*  And but you've never stopped doing your job. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  You've never stopped speaking out. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=70.64s)]
*  Your research has been invaluable for all of us. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=71.96s)]
*  So Francesca, it's a big honor to have you and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=74.64s)]
*  I hope you're doing as OK as possible in the horror that we've seen in the last few months. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=78.64s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=83.84s)]
*  Always a pleasure to come back. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=85.2s)]
*  What I'm going to do, actually, is I'm going to start by quoting [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=87.80000000000001s)]
*  Omar Bartoff, who is an Israeli-American [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=90.36000000000001s)]
*  professor of genocide studies, is a specialist in the history of genocide. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=94.08000000000001s)]
*  And now it is quite interesting. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=98.16000000000001s)]
*  He wrote this on The Guardian and he said that his view had changed [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=100.2s)]
*  because he quotes himself back in November last year, in which he said, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=103.16000000000001s)]
*  as a historian of genocide, I believe there's no proof that genocide is now taking place in Gaza, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=105.76s)]
*  although it's very likely that war crimes and even crimes against humanity are happening. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=110.04s)]
*  And and he says, we know from history, it's crucial to warn of the potential [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=114.0s)]
*  genocide before it occurs rather than belatedly condemn it after it's taken place. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=117.16s)]
*  I still think we have that time. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=120.44s)]
*  He now says, I no longer believe that. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=122.72s)]
*  And he said it's no longer possible for him to deny that Israel was engaged [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=124.96s)]
*  in systematic war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocidal activity. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=128.56s)]
*  And he said it based on his visits to Israel. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=134.2s)]
*  That is very clear that is the ultimate goal of this entire undertaking [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=137.48s)]
*  from the very beginning, has been to make the entire Gaza Strip [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=140.72s)]
*  uninhabitable and to debilitate its population to such a degree [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=144.44s)]
*  that it would either die out or seek all possible options to flee the territory. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=147.76s)]
*  Which reminds me of what the general Giora Ireland, who is an advisor, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=152.28s)]
*  a former, well, he's the advisor to, you know, Gallant. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=156.64s)]
*  He said at the beginning that the options would be to stay and starve or to leave. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=159.36s)]
*  I mean, do you think like basically that's what we're dealing with, isn't it? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=166.64s)]
*  Is that Israel has the Israeli state's view is the very existence of the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=170.08s)]
*  Palestinian people, particularly in Gaza, is a problem and they work backwards from that. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=173.96s)]
*  What do you think? Is that what we're looking at here? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=179.0s)]
*  Yes, I think it's a very interesting starting point to the one you offer [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=182.76000000000002s)]
*  quote by Professor Bartow and inspires me. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=188.88000000000002s)]
*  It leads me to three observations. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=194.12s)]
*  The first is that I it's very difficult. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=198.12s)]
*  From an Israeli perspective and from people who take [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=204.36s)]
*  the Holocaust, the Nazi Holocaust, which has been primarily primarily [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=209.76000000000002s)]
*  the Holocaust of the Jews, but also the Holocaust of anyone who not conform [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=214.4s)]
*  to the Aryan race. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=220.44000000000003s)]
*  We shall not forget what was the end game of the of the Nazi and Nazi fascism. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=223.24s)]
*  But it's been very difficult for people who had that parameter [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=231.32s)]
*  to assess what is a genocide, to recognize what Israel has been saying [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=235.36s)]
*  and doing through its leaders and its forces, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=241.68s)]
*  aerial forces and forces on the ground since the very first weeks. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=246.36s)]
*  I mean, it's not a case that having [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=250.4s)]
*  a macro perspective as others have done, like Professor Rossi has allowed [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=254.12s)]
*  to to connect the dots between the present, the past and the future. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=260.6s)]
*  Like the idea of having a state of Israel, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=266.44s)]
*  Palestinians free, a Palestinian free Israel, a heritage Israel. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=272.12s)]
*  And this has been so it's I understand the difficulty. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=277.44s)]
*  The second is that. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=282.36s)]
*  No matter, no matter what Israel does and says, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=286.04s)]
*  and it has been the rule for decades and it's proven now, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=291.6s)]
*  no matter how what Israel does and says, it still enjoys impunity [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=297.76s)]
*  at international level. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=304.52s)]
*  And the thing is that even when it's held accountable at [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=306.88s)]
*  rhetorically, let's say, what people see is war crimes [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=312.6s)]
*  and crimes against humanity at best. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=318.08s)]
*  And I'm not saying that this is not the case, but genocide is another crime. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=320.6s)]
*  Genocide is when there is the intent to destroy a group [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=325.96s)]
*  as such in whole or in part. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=331.08s)]
*  And it's undeniable that this is the intent, not only because it's been set [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=334.88s)]
*  over and over, we will turn Gaza back to the Middle Age. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=339.68s)]
*  We will. It's said it's in Palestinians are a responsible nation. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=343.36s)]
*  There are no innocent Palestinians and it has translated into practices. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=348.8s)]
*  So those practices have to be read conjunctively, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=353.92s)]
*  like each attack, each assault, each bomb, all the bombs and all the acts. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=358.15999999999997s)]
*  The dehumanization and the killing and the torturing, the tormenting, the starving. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=364.24s)]
*  You cannot really track us separately because the victims is one [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=371.12s)]
*  and one only is the Palestinians. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=375.08s)]
*  So my feeling is and it will be proven in probably some time from now when [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=377.28000000000003s)]
*  because there is a cultural time to understand our own mistakes. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=383.84000000000003s)]
*  The intent behind this genocide has been so overwhelming, so massive [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=388.44000000000005s)]
*  that it's difficult to take a step back and see it in its entirety. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=396.52000000000004s)]
*  And I'm glad to see many Israelis, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=400.52000000000004s)]
*  not as many as needed, but many intellectuals coming forward [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=405.88000000000005s)]
*  and admitting what is happening. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=409.96000000000004s)]
*  And Professor Bartoff is not the first. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=412.92s)]
*  Again, I've mentioned that there are Seagal, but also [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=416.28s)]
*  another illustrious genocide scholar as Professor Ramos Goldberg [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=420.2s)]
*  has said, this is nothing but genocide. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=425.32s)]
*  It's genocide. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=428.88s)]
*  And still the European and Western leaders, US continue to shelter [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=429.92s)]
*  from accountability. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=434.68s)]
*  I mean, just that point about intent and you mentioned Rassigal [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=437.4s)]
*  and he said very early on that it's very rare to be for intent [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=439.88s)]
*  to be so explicitly stated. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=443.52s)]
*  Actually, historically, what normally happens is there's an attempt [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=445.04s)]
*  by genocidal state to hide what they're doing to cover it up. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=448.48s)]
*  You have to end up going through top secret documents. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=452.6s)]
*  And I just think as an example, I mean, the industry in which I work, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=455.12s)]
*  the Western media, and it didn't just fail to frame its coverage [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=457.6s)]
*  around intent, which you think it would have done if it done its job. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=462.16s)]
*  This is what Israeli because the best predictor of what Israel was going to do [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=465.44s)]
*  is just what its leaders said they were going to do. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=468.88s)]
*  And but many of those statements weren't even reported. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=471.08000000000004s)]
*  I just want to give you one example. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=474.2s)]
*  This was the ninth of October, 2023. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=475.92s)]
*  This is Major General Ghassan Ali and he was the Israeli Army [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=479.24s)]
*  coordinator of government activities in the territories. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=484.08s)]
*  One of the senior army generals. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=486.96s)]
*  And he said. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=489.32s)]
*  On the ninth of October, Hamas became ISIS and the citizens of Gaza [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=491.28s)]
*  are celebrating instead of being horrified. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=495.52s)]
*  Human animals are dealt with accordingly. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=497.68s)]
*  Israel has imposed a total blockade on Gaza, no electricity, no water, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=500.0s)]
*  just damage. You wanted hell. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=503.36s)]
*  You will get hell. There's no pretence there. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=505.68s)]
*  He's talking about the civilian population. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=508.0s)]
*  He calls the civilian population human animals and he makes clear [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=509.68s)]
*  that they will suffer collective punishment. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=512.36s)]
*  It seems kind of mad that we're still that we even have to have [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=514.44s)]
*  a discussion about this. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=517.8000000000001s)]
*  And yet it remains a kind of controversial view within the Western media [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=519.04s)]
*  when you could just quote, just literally quotes, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=523.24s)]
*  which most Western media outlets didn't even bother to report on [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=527.52s)]
*  from the very beginning. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=531.4s)]
*  And I partially agree in the sense there is a lot that I've seen, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=534.16s)]
*  I've seen and I've I've read like the translations of what Israeli soldiers [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=542.32s)]
*  have done and said on the ground for me. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=548.72s)]
*  Oh, and this has been the most one of the most painful experiences [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=552.6800000000001s)]
*  because you see these relatively young soldiers behaving like, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=558.0s)]
*  sorry, like monsters. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=564.2s)]
*  And then I realized that what I've said through and through, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=565.88s)]
*  there is no possibility that there is such a dehumanization [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=570.9200000000001s)]
*  and brutalization imposed on someone like the Palestinians that leaves [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=575.88s)]
*  the brutalizer intact in his or her humanity. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=582.16s)]
*  And again, this is this is the corruption of apartheid [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=588.08s)]
*  and the corruption of impunity, which goes both both way. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=594.04s)]
*  And it has scarred Israeli society from its younger generations, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=599.36s)]
*  from its roots. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=604.6800000000001s)]
*  And this is something that the state of Israel also needs to account [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=605.52s)]
*  for. But I I do believe that there has been [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=610.64s)]
*  not just a misunderstanding or a lack of negligence in reporting. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=617.04s)]
*  It just it has been business as usual, because eventually it was dying. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=626.04s)]
*  We're Palestinians in high numbers and they have been [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=633.0s)]
*  they have been leveled out, ironed out in their [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=636.52s)]
*  mass killing, mass murdering, mass [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=642.4s)]
*  torturing, I mean, they've been forgotten as as human beings. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=646.52s)]
*  So it's not just something that Israeli leaders have proposed [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=650.8s)]
*  and Israeli soldiers have enacted an Israeli society at large as tolerated. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=656.04s)]
*  This is something that Western societies or rather [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=661.52s)]
*  then society, Western policymakers and media have tolerated and even condoned. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=666.12s)]
*  Do you think one of the challenges that we've had is, I mean, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=675.08s)]
*  the coverage is obviously so dire on every front, but it's almost, you know, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=677.92s)]
*  in in the coverage you get occasionally, for example, the attack on the school, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=681.68s)]
*  the Israeli attack on the school in which huge numbers of Palestinians were killed. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=686.6s)]
*  And you always get the Israeli states [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=690.88s)]
*  modus operandi in their circumstances is lie, deflect, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=694.04s)]
*  muddy the waters, gaslight, turn things upside down. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=698.2s)]
*  And I hope that people just move on and it gets lost in the fog of war. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=701.52s)]
*  Who's to know what, you know, leave it thinking, oh, I don't know. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=705.68s)]
*  So murky. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=708.64s)]
*  Hidden Draft Amp is a really good example. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=709.72s)]
*  That six year old Palestinian girl who's killed alongside her family. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=711.28s)]
*  When she tried, you know, you could hear us [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=716.16s)]
*  ringing the Palestine red crescent begging for [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=718.56s)]
*  and begging for someone to come and save after her family had been killed. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=721.9599999999999s)]
*  And forensic architecture, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=726.8s)]
*  academics at Goldsmiths and so on, they did detailed work on it [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=730.0799999999999s)]
*  and found it's just not credible that it was an accident, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=733.8s)]
*  that they must have seen the people in the car. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=736.52s)]
*  They were right up close to them in daylight and they shot so many bullets. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=738.68s)]
*  The point I'm making is the problem is we get stuck a bit [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=742.0s)]
*  because you end up getting these high profile cases which make it. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=744.56s)]
*  And then they're not joined together because they end up [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=748.7199999999999s)]
*  being contested and, you know, and [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=751.44s)]
*  Israel kind of manages to often just have them labeled [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=756.12s)]
*  kind of murky incident in the fog of war rather than this is just [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=761.1600000000001s)]
*  a genocidal onslaught on a daily basis, which might have particularly [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=765.32s)]
*  deadly incidents, but has to be seen systemically. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=768.32s)]
*  I mean, do you think that's part of the problem? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=771.48s)]
*  That's what we're up against with this kind of the kind of coverage [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=772.5200000000001s)]
*  and the way that Israel manages to manipulate a very willing [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=775.0s)]
*  and media very willing to be manipulated. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=779.36s)]
*  Again, I do think I do think that there is a level of [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=781.44s)]
*  manipulation of the information, the way it's fed to [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=791.7600000000001s)]
*  to the largest public, I would say beyond, beyond both in Israel [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=799.6s)]
*  and beyond Israel. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=804.5600000000001s)]
*  But there is also a quite disturbing predisposition [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=806.0400000000001s)]
*  of Western media to to give a platform, an unchecked platform [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=810.12s)]
*  to these voices. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=818.0400000000001s)]
*  And it's interesting that one that on the occasions you have [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=819.5200000000001s)]
*  a critical journalist, interviewer asking questions [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=824.4000000000001s)]
*  which are totally legitimate and and make that that [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=831.0s)]
*  layer of pretends follow crack. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=835.56s)]
*  Then the journalist is punished. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=840.16s)]
*  Then the journalist is accused of being biased. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=841.76s)]
*  Or again, we have seen and I don't keep track of it because it's not my job. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=845.52s)]
*  But I've heard of many journalists who have lost their jobs, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=850.56s)]
*  who have been reprimanded, who have been thrown under the bus [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=854.8399999999999s)]
*  seen for doing their jobs. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=859.4799999999999s)]
*  And this is and this is the Palestinianization of of our reality. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=861.6800000000001s)]
*  This is what the Palestinians have endured through and through [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=867.96s)]
*  since the since ever under Israeli control and and and beyond. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=871.28s)]
*  Now, Owen, there is always an interesting case to study [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=878.12s)]
*  of how media behave, how journalists, our [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=883.36s)]
*  TV and radio behave in the context of a genocide. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=887.8000000000001s)]
*  It's just matter. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=892.28s)]
*  And so it makes for an interesting PhD study or investigative report. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=893.28s)]
*  What has been what has been reported? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=899.04s)]
*  What has come from the sorry, let me formulate [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=902.44s)]
*  what has what has been reported and what has been documented in the [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=906.9200000000001s)]
*  cases of Rwanda or former Yugoslavia [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=912.28s)]
*  through the work of the ICDY and ACDR, respectively. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=916.44s)]
*  An unprecedented case of [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=920.44s)]
*  of complicity [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=924.84s)]
*  should be studied in the case of how Western media has behaved vis a vis [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=928.96s)]
*  this this genocide, because it's inconceivable. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=935.2s)]
*  We are I mean, as as foreign countries, as Western countries, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=937.6s)]
*  the media should be totally untouched and unbiased. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=942.8000000000001s)]
*  And look at it, what happens in Palestine objectively. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=947.04s)]
*  And no, instead, many have decided again, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=950.8399999999999s)]
*  decide blindly with what Israel what what Israel says and does. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=955.4399999999999s)]
*  Based on your research over the last few months, what all the kind of [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=963.1999999999999s)]
*  what do you think kind of some of the kind of really big key [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=966.8s)]
*  fundamental points that just haven't maybe a lot of people, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=970.0799999999999s)]
*  even people have been engaged with the horror of what's been inflicted [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=975.04s)]
*  on Gaza and people of Gaza and beyond, because we'll talk more broadly [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=978.12s)]
*  about Palestine as well. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=980.9599999999999s)]
*  What are the kind of really key fundamental points [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=982.4399999999999s)]
*  which you think just right now need to be understood [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=984.7199999999999s)]
*  based on the huge amounts of research you've been doing over the last few months? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=987.28s)]
*  Yeah, three things come to my mind. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=991.0s)]
*  The first is, again, that, as you say, under the fog of war, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=993.88s)]
*  it seems that many, many crucial details and connectors get lost. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=998.5999999999999s)]
*  And the fact that what happens in Gaza, first of all, is not accidental. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1004.08s)]
*  It's I mean, a war crime might be an unintended consequence of war. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1009.84s)]
*  But what the destruction inflicted upon Gaza in terms of individuals, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1014.96s)]
*  collectives, families, specific groups like journalists or UN [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1019.3199999999999s)]
*  staffers and what has happened to Gaza as an infrastructure [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1025.28s)]
*  and social fabric reveals something else. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1031.1599999999999s)]
*  It cannot be dismissed as an accidental consequence, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1034.4399999999998s)]
*  as unintended consequence of war. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1038.36s)]
*  No, it's not. It's not. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1040.7199999999998s)]
*  And this is why it's very important that we link the dots. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1042.28s)]
*  We link the crimes, we link the various conducts and we consider them [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1045.7199999999998s)]
*  in their totality, because the intent is very explicit [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1050.08s)]
*  and can be read clearly by connecting these dots. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1054.36s)]
*  The second element is that this is not an assault on Gaza only. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1058.16s)]
*  It's an assault on Palestine and the Palestinians. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1063.1200000000001s)]
*  And this can be clearly seen by what's happening in West Bank, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1067.16s)]
*  where the violence against Palestinians has accelerated [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1071.96s)]
*  at the hand of the government, of government officials, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1075.64s)]
*  is the Israeli army and armed settlers. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1079.72s)]
*  Oh, and every day in the past weeks and months, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1083.8799999999999s)]
*  I've received or I've read reports of attacks on defenceless communities. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1088.3999999999999s)]
*  And it's circulating. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1094.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, certain videos have become viral. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1096.9199999999998s)]
*  Have you seen any step taken by Israel to either investigate [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1098.9199999999998s)]
*  or prosecute any of these alleged criminals or any Western states [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1103.7199999999998s)]
*  or any other states for what it means, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1108.6399999999999s)]
*  intervening to stop this? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1111.8s)]
*  So not only atrocities have been committed against the Palestinians in Gaza, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1113.6s)]
*  but they have been [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1118.56s)]
*  spiraling in the West Bank as well. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1121.52s)]
*  And the third element is that there is an obligation [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1123.6399999999999s)]
*  on international community on each and every member states to prevent genocide. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1128.56s)]
*  And that's been put on notice on January 26th, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1133.28s)]
*  when the International Criminal Court [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1137.92s)]
*  didn't pronounce itself on the merits, but pronounced itself by ordering [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1140.92s)]
*  on the plausibility that the genocide is being committed [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1145.0800000000002s)]
*  by ordering the first set of provisional measures [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1148.44s)]
*  and then a second one in March and then a third one in May. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1151.8000000000002s)]
*  And not I mean, not only these provisional measures [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1154.8400000000001s)]
*  have been neglected by Israel, but by the national community at large, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1157.2800000000002s)]
*  which had an obligation to do everything in their power to stop this genocide. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1161.3600000000001s)]
*  Even if they didn't recognize that it had already been committed, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1168.7600000000002s)]
*  as it was my take in March, acts of genocide had already been committed [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1172.92s)]
*  because I looked at it in the merits. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1177.24s)]
*  And and again, this [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1179.2800000000002s)]
*  laxism, this in in can we say laxism? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1183.5200000000002s)]
*  No, this this when you when you don't. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1187.48s)]
*  OK, let me use another word. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1192.16s)]
*  This disregard for international law in its basic tenets, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1193.92s)]
*  it's such a blow in the face and in the stomach of the international system, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1201.24s)]
*  which is premised upon the universal respect of those basic tenets. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1206.3200000000002s)]
*  I mean, international humanitarian law is not the most protective [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1211.4s)]
*  legal framework is just to save humanity from a dissenting to the abyss. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1216.6000000000001s)]
*  And this is what if we do not intervene at this stage or [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1222.6399999999999s)]
*  I mean, this is this is also the critical, critical [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1227.84s)]
*  erosion of the international system. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1232.36s)]
*  I mean, do you see do you see? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1236.24s)]
*  I mean, in the last few months, I mean, you know, I know it's hard. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1237.72s)]
*  You're there. You're making just speaking the truth and being demonized. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1241.76s)]
*  Attacks. This is and you mentioned other journalists. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1245.8s)]
*  This is one of the only topics on earth where you can quite [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1248.0s)]
*  literally just be fired for telling the truth. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1251.16s)]
*  But, you know, we have seen in these last few months, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1254.4s)]
*  the International Court of Justice case and the provision orders that you mentioned. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1258.88s)]
*  We have seen the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1262.3600000000001s)]
*  Court issue requests for arrest warrants for crimes against humanity and war crimes [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1265.64s)]
*  with the very strong possibility of further charges. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1270.24s)]
*  And it's believed that recently the attempts by Israel [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1273.64s)]
*  to arrest a few soldiers, given the mass rape and torture [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1278.2s)]
*  that's been going on for months or huge amounts of evidence that they did that [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1282.8799999999999s)]
*  because they're scared of these extra charges being added [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1285.6s)]
*  unless they are they do some performative action. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1289.1599999999999s)]
*  Western public opinion has shifted very dramatically in Britain. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1293.24s)]
*  Polling shows a large majority support the arrest of Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1298.04s)]
*  Believe war crimes have been committed, oppose arms sales. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1301.84s)]
*  And even in the US, where criticizing Israel was verboten, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1305.04s)]
*  there's been a shift. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1308.6399999999999s)]
*  More Americans than not think genocide is taking place. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1309.48s)]
*  So does that do you look at that and think despite the attempts by the US [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1312.28s)]
*  and the British and other administrations to undermine international law, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1316.32s)]
*  that actually that has been a very, very profound shift happening. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1319.44s)]
*  And that I mean, does that has that give you grounds for optimism? [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1323.68s)]
*  Or do you think this is actually permanently just destabilized [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1327.52s)]
*  the international order because of such a blatant disregard for international law? [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1329.84s)]
*  I do believe that the US [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1335.28s)]
*  accompanied or followed by the UK, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1339.6s)]
*  more or less actively, or France or Germany or Italy [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1343.96s)]
*  are contributing to that blow at the heart of the international system. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1349.3999999999999s)]
*  They seem to not even realize [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1354.3999999999999s)]
*  the damage they are doing to the universality of international law. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1358.04s)]
*  And many people are so disillusioned about international law [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1362.56s)]
*  and they say it serves nothing. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1365.6799999999998s)]
*  At the same time, I would again, it's not because my mission in life [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1368.3999999999999s)]
*  is to is to save international law, but because I do believe in a system [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1372.28s)]
*  that is there to preserve peace and security. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1376.8s)]
*  And with it, all of us without resorting to violence. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1379.6s)]
*  I do think that international law is still very valuable [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1384.0s)]
*  because it allows us to see and distinguish [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1387.32s)]
*  what's wrong from what's not. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1391.5600000000002s)]
*  And to know what is to be done [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1394.8400000000001s)]
*  to address each wrong doings. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1398.52s)]
*  This is something that I mean, I'm glad to see paradoxically [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1400.5600000000002s)]
*  that our modern societies and especially the young generations are so imbued [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1404.16s)]
*  of the profound meaning of international law. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1409.04s)]
*  And they demand actively to see what Michael Link calls the sibling of political [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1411.5600000000002s)]
*  sorry, of international law with international resolve aligned. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1417.8s)]
*  And this is what gives me hope. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1423.64s)]
*  And at the same time, we see that much more is needed [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1426.76s)]
*  in terms of mobilization, strategy and action [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1433.04s)]
*  in order to stop this monstrosity like apartheid. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1438.76s)]
*  And whatever whatever Israel has morphed into [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1443.76s)]
*  is not going to see an end. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1449.2s)]
*  And we are not going to see an end to Israel's crimes and illegality [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1453.8s)]
*  until and unless the let's say it's financial and economic [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1459.12s)]
*  underpinnings are affected. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1466.28s)]
*  And this is something that all of us have the power to to affect [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1468.12s)]
*  through the unionists and trade unions and an individual. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1472.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, there is there's been the BDS movement [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1478.76s)]
*  taking such a huge, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1482.8s)]
*  a huge load at such a such a huge effort [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1485.7199999999998s)]
*  to expose the need to advance legality, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1490.1599999999999s)]
*  international law in the occupied Palestinian territory. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1494.12s)]
*  And you don't need to adhere to the fullest to BDS [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1497.08s)]
*  and scholars, culture, agenda. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1501.4s)]
*  But at the same time, this is one they propose one [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1503.44s)]
*  set of critical steps in order to contribute [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1508.0800000000002s)]
*  and as individuals who oppose what their governments are sanctioning. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1512.44s)]
*  I'm interested in just your thoughts on the recent revelations. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1518.48s)]
*  I mean, they've been talking about for months, but it's the time. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1522.92s)]
*  And for example, where the systematic rape and torture of Palestinian detainees [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1525.48s)]
*  we know previously, I mean, save the children before 7th of October [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1531.24s)]
*  did detailed reports about child detainees being physically and sexually abused. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1534.76s)]
*  But I mean, the numbers who are held without charge, the kind of, you know, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1541.24s)]
*  that the I mean, it's hideous to talk about, but the gang raping of, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1546.92s)]
*  for example, a Palestinian detainee and then riots in support of rape. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1550.92s)]
*  I mean, I guess you had discussions on Israeli television [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1555.2s)]
*  about whether or not one should support raping detainees with the position in favour offered. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1559.0s)]
*  It's just that level of dehumanisation, that level of just mold degradation [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1566.96s)]
*  is quite striking when looked at. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1570.44s)]
*  But what's your thoughts on just what this tells us, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1571.84s)]
*  what this kind of the recent revelations and the responses? [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1574.0s)]
*  I wish I could say that I'm shocked, but I told you, I commented on it before. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1579.4s)]
*  While I was preparing my anatomy of genocide, one of the most sickening part [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1586.9199999999998s)]
*  has been to examine the bid and discuss in order to see how credible, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1594.7199999999998s)]
*  how authentic they were the statements and the actions by Israeli soldiers [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1601.36s)]
*  who have bombed entire neighbourhoods, mosques, churches, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1610.0s)]
*  universities who have profaned the intimacy of Palestinian homes and Palestinian bodies, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1615.92s)]
*  male and female and old and young and children. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1623.2s)]
*  And how disconnected from humanity can one be in order not to feel [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1628.2s)]
*  just pity for a defenceless human being completely at the mercy of a gang [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1637.96s)]
*  who's fully in full armour, etc. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1647.24s)]
*  And I've seen this over and over. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1651.68s)]
*  So when the various, and I've been investigating cases of abusive conduct, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1653.68s)]
*  mistreatment, even torture myself since January, February. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1660.28s)]
*  And I was eventually relieved to see, because it's also a matter of capacity, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1666.0800000000002s)]
*  UNHCR, sorry, UNHCR and then Bezalem joining the voices of Palestinian [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1672.0800000000002s)]
*  and other Israeli human rights organisations who had documented cases of mistreatment [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1683.16s)]
*  up to the point that we know today that there is what Bezalem calls [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1689.64s)]
*  a network of torture centres in Israel. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1694.3600000000001s)]
*  How did I receive it? [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1700.6000000000001s)]
*  For me, it's a confirmation of what I had discussed. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1701.8000000000002s)]
*  I think that we had, you interviewed me when I had my first report on detention, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1704.96s)]
*  arbitrary deprivation of liberty in the occupied Palestinian territory, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1712.5600000000002s)]
*  which was widespread and systemic before October 7. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1718.2800000000002s)]
*  And so the matrix to torment the Palestinians was there. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1722.28s)]
*  And then it has been full revenge against them. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1726.52s)]
*  These amounted, such practices amounted to crimes relevant under the Rome statute [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1730.04s)]
*  before October 7. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1735.16s)]
*  So I'm shocked that the prosecutor has not already looked into it, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1737.0s)]
*  as he has not already looked into settlements as a war crime [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1742.1200000000001s)]
*  and forced displacement as a crime against humanity. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1747.72s)]
*  This is something that has been ongoing. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1750.32s)]
*  And again, the delay of this investigation is pathetic. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1752.36s)]
*  So I do hope that there will be cases taken up at domestic level in the UK, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1756.3999999999999s)]
*  in other European countries and everywhere there is a functioning and healthy [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1763.8s)]
*  justice system because universal jurisdiction is there, sorry, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1768.1599999999999s)]
*  universal jurisdiction is there primarily to resolve those cases. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1772.6s)]
*  But one last thing is, as I was speaking, there is a document, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1777.08s)]
*  a short documentary that has been produced by Zeteo that depicts exactly [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1781.48s)]
*  what I said, that gives voices to the Israelis who have, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1788.08s)]
*  to the Israeli soldiers and other Israelis who have partaken in this [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1793.28s)]
*  assault on Gaza. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1797.3999999999999s)]
*  And it's so clear how Palestinians are dehumanized in their minds. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1798.56s)]
*  And the moment you dehumanize someone, you reduce them to a thing. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1803.8s)]
*  And you can do to it whatever you like in order to establish the balance [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1808.52s)]
*  of justice, what you believe is justice inside you. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1815.96s)]
*  It's so disturbed and deranged. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1818.56s)]
*  Just a couple of other things. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1822.36s)]
*  One was the West Bank. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1823.52s)]
*  And I mean, it's obviously been a hideous onslaught against the Palestinian people [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1825.68s)]
*  in the West Bank before. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1831.3999999999999s)]
*  Last year, before October 7th, 240 Palestinians were killed in the West [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1834.16s)]
*  Bank, 40 of them children. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1837.28s)]
*  But since then, there has been a dramatic escalation. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1839.56s)]
*  What does that tell us in terms of the overall Israeli strategy? [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1842.76s)]
*  So, obviously, whether it be settlers having impunity, whether it be [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1845.8s)]
*  the Israeli security services, people being driven from their homes, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1849.6000000000001s)]
*  how this fits into a long-term Israeli plan as regards Palestine? [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1852.68s)]
*  Erasure. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1859.84s)]
*  Erasure of Palestine from the maps, from books, from people's brain, [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1863.36s)]
*  from collective memory, from the UN, from arts, from everywhere. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1870.6799999999998s)]
*  This is unfortunately, this is not an opinion. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1878.76s)]
*  It's grounded on what I've seen for over a decade of study, not just [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1883.88s)]
*  observation or work as a professional, not study. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1892.52s)]
*  This is what steadily Israel has been doing, removing Palestine from Palestine, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1896.24s)]
*  from the space, the heart and the mind of the current present of our life. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1903.28s)]
*  And the Palestinians have been in the middle. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1914.12s)]
*  So what does it mean in practice? [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1916.12s)]
*  Israel, in the state of Israel and Israelis, in order to realize the [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1917.56s)]
*  greater Israel cannot cope with the Palestinians. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1924.0s)]
*  Smotrik in 2007 articulated with a clarity that I think it's almost [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1929.0s)]
*  shocking for its honesty. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1934.2s)]
*  And he said, look, we want to realize, I mean, this is our land. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1939.44s)]
*  And it is, the Palestinians have three choices. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1944.64s)]
*  They stay, no, either they leave or they stay dominated by us, subjugated by us, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1949.0400000000002s)]
*  or they will have to face us and they can die. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1956.92s)]
*  And so there is no way that the Palestinians can live in this space, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1962.4s)]
*  let alone us as equal. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1967.2s)]
*  So this is the end game. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1969.52s)]
*  And I understand that until the 7th of October, for many Israelis, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1971.5600000000002s)]
*  this was not even an option. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1976.4s)]
*  I mean, they wanted the end of the occupation somewhat in a very fluid fashion. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1977.8000000000002s)]
*  They wanted the end of occupation, but then they didn't have clear enough what [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1983.0s)]
*  occupation meant both legally and also psychologically for the Palestinians [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1988.92s)]
*  who have been occupied their stories and their lives and for generations [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=1997.64s)]
*  since even before the existence of the state of Israel. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2003.84s)]
*  I mean, this is something that we need to acknowledge. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2006.92s)]
*  We need to accept. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2009.28s)]
*  But since the 7th of October, things have changed. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2011.8s)]
*  And there has been like a tsunami of just a spirit of revenge against the Palestinians. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2015.44s)]
*  That has blinded many, including moderate individuals, commentators. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2023.8799999999999s)]
*  I've seen and heard and read something I could have never believed, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2034.12s)]
*  like in just one month before October 7. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2040.32s)]
*  I guess just kind of, I mean, in terms of just finally just where this is heading, [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2047.48s)]
*  basically, I guess what I mean, just looping back to Omar Bartos' article in The Guardian, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2051.36s)]
*  where he talks, I mean, I often describe it as genocidal mania. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2060.04s)]
*  And there is a degree of fanaticism. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2065.2s)]
*  And he also, Omar Bartos, talks about a numbness which is become pervasive, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2068.0s)]
*  including people who regard themselves as left of center or progressive. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2072.4s)]
*  And they kind of basically consciously are blocking their hearts. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2077.0s)]
*  They're basically, he said, we won't, you know, they openly admit we're not going to allow any space [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2080.28s)]
*  in our heart for the suffering of the Palestinian people, even though we know it's happening. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2088.04s)]
*  And sometimes I've seen this on Twitter, you know, this kind of, well, you've got to realize [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2092.12s)]
*  on Israeli TV, they're not showing all these atrocities. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2096.32s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, they've got the Internet. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2098.84s)]
*  You know, I mean, I mean, you know, and I see examples like these two twins, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2100.6800000000003s)]
*  these little twin babies who were killed by an Israeli attack. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2105.48s)]
*  And their father went to go and get their birth certificates. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2109.92s)]
*  And by the time he had returned, those two little babies had been killed along with his wife. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2114.32s)]
*  And then he had to go and get their death certificates. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2120.84s)]
*  And on an Israeli telegram. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2123.4s)]
*  And I know you can just say, look, these are, you know, how representative is it? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2126.52s)]
*  But they were posting it and just rejoicing, using emojis of like the most popular emoji was [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2129.76s)]
*  that a champagne bottle being uncorked. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2137.56s)]
*  You just look at that, I think, what the... [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2140.76s)]
*  You know, because very few people in any society are sociopaths. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2143.2000000000003s)]
*  It's a very small fraction. That's not what this is. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2146.32s)]
*  It's a kind of mass hysteria and genocidal hysteria and a kind of... [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2149.2s)]
*  And also just a passivity and numbness. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2155.24s)]
*  And I guess what disturbs me is there's nothing to stop that. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2158.0s)]
*  If this was an enemy of the West, the West would have denounced this state for having committed [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2162.04s)]
*  some of the worst crimes of our age a very long time ago. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2167.44s)]
*  There'd be a lot of people arguing for a military intervention months ago, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2171.12s)]
*  the same people are cheering it on. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2175.12s)]
*  But they're pushing an open door. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2177.08s)]
*  There's nothing to stop. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2178.56s)]
*  So it can just keep bubbling over and it's kind of... [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2179.88s)]
*  And that's what disturbs me is kind of there's no... [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2182.36s)]
*  You know, we've got the ICC and the ICJ, but then the attempts by the US and others to [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2185.16s)]
*  undermine them. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2190.2799999999997s)]
*  So I guess that is that what makes us somewhat unique, that it's open intent. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2191.44s)]
*  And it's, you know, the population, apart from brave exceptions, and they are very brave, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2196.6s)]
*  that it's become quite a radicalized population. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2201.36s)]
*  And there's very little block, very little push back on that, which means it just can [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2204.96s)]
*  continue with the dynamic of its own, I guess. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2209.8s)]
*  Let me start by saying that I remember when soon after I presented my report about what [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2213.04s)]
*  had happened between October and March to a group of senior diplomats, I noticed there [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2222.88s)]
*  were... They really listened to me intently and pay attention to every word and every [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2234.8399999999997s)]
*  coma I had said. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2242.72s)]
*  And they engaged. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2243.9199999999996s)]
*  They were really worried by what I had reported. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2244.9199999999996s)]
*  But there was one thing that really annoyed a number of them. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2247.16s)]
*  And it was... [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2252.08s)]
*  I was told that to say there is something that we find very disturbing in the way you [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2252.7599999999998s)]
*  portray your findings. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2258.44s)]
*  You say that many segments of the Israeli society are supporting this call for genocide. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2260.52s)]
*  And this is something unacceptable for us. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2271.36s)]
*  And I've been... [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2274.92s)]
*  I've sort of... [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2277.2s)]
*  I've returned to that moment many times in the past months. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2279.24s)]
*  Every time I've seen people cheering for the death, the starvation, the lack of food, [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2284.28s)]
*  the lack of water, the lack of hygiene, the news of spreading of diseases in Israel. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2291.2000000000003s)]
*  And I said, oh, my God, this mandate really feels like Cassandra, you know, the Greek [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2302.88s)]
*  myth of telling the truth, telling the facts and no one wanting to believe it. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2312.28s)]
*  This is a curse. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2321.0400000000004s)]
*  And this is why I feel that this mandate sometimes is a curse. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2322.0800000000004s)]
*  Because I've seen it happening. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2329.0400000000004s)]
*  And again, it's about if we had the capacity to link the dots, as I said, at the macro [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2331.1200000000003s)]
*  What's happening today with the clear... [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2338.0s)]
*  with the vision of many in Israel that the only possibility for the Jews to live safe [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2340.88s)]
*  is to have a state on their own, for their own, without the Palestinians, henceforth [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2346.96s)]
*  displacement or worse. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2353.32s)]
*  And what has been happening since the very foundation of the state of Israel and before, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2355.8s)]
*  the Palestinians have always been seen as a threat because they were indigenous to the [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2361.84s)]
*  land. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2366.68s)]
*  And again, this was not inhabited land. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2367.68s)]
*  And the Jews who have come gradually from Europe, first as migrants, then as refugees, [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2372.3199999999997s)]
*  were part of a process that couldn't be defined otherwise than colonial. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2381.72s)]
*  Again, I know that for many this is an insult, but taking the land, it's not that they arrived [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2387.52s)]
*  as they wanted just to migrate to Palestine and be Palestinians. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2394.96s)]
*  They wanted to migrate and have the land for them only and push out the Palestinians. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2399.28s)]
*  And this is what they have done. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2404.4s)]
*  So seeing this in line, as if we were able to connect the dots and then understanding [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2405.8s)]
*  how Israel as a state had to justify it to themselves. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2413.28s)]
*  So not only there was the truth that Jews had been persecuted for centuries, and this [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2419.24s)]
*  is something that surely, surely has shaped their being, their collective, their sense [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2425.7599999999998s)]
*  of being part of a collective, their DNA as a people, but also there has been a continuous [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2431.86s)]
*  mostrification, Nazification in the words of Israeli scholars of the Palestinians in [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2438.52s)]
*  order to justify the kind of violations that have been subjected to at the ends of the [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2445.28s)]
*  Israelis. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2454.32s)]
*  They have been dehumanized for decades in the eyes of the Israelis. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2455.32s)]
*  And on October 7, there was a realization of the worst nightmare that had been projected [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2461.84s)]
*  over and over. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2468.1200000000003s)]
*  If the Palestinians are left free out of the cage, they will kill us all. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2469.1200000000003s)]
*  And then many Israelis have said, oh my God, so that is true. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2474.0s)]
*  The Palestinians are really animals. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2477.92s)]
*  You see the moment they are left free, because we don't know how brutalized, dehumanized, [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2480.32s)]
*  how violated and tormented they've been. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2487.36s)]
*  Let's not think of that. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2490.0s)]
*  Yeah, if they had the chance, they would kill us all. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2492.2s)]
*  And this has further fed the next step of dehumanization. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2495.84s)]
*  So they need to be killed. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2500.2s)]
*  They can be tortured because, you know, if we don't do this to them, they will do this [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2502.0s)]
*  to us. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2506.32s)]
*  This is the reality I see. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2507.32s)]
*  And it's so deranged again. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2509.6s)]
*  And just finally on that, I know you're traveling today as well, so I don't want to take all [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2511.28s)]
*  your time, but I just came back from Serbia. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2515.64s)]
*  And I guess a couple of parallels in that the Serb people were hideously, I mean, they [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2518.2s)]
*  in World War II, which shapes a lot of Serb, modern Serb nationalism of being the victims [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2527.32s)]
*  of the whole of the genocide, the Croatian Ustasi. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2533.04s)]
*  And that was offered, that was used, that sense of doing the, you know, the, if we look [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2537.0800000000004s)]
*  at Srebrenica, look what the Bosnian Serb armies did in Bosnia, that history was used [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2543.48s)]
*  to justify it on the basis of if we don't kill them, they will kill us instead. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2548.88s)]
*  And it reminds me as well of Rwanda in 1990 when the Rwandan Patriotic Fund invaded from [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2554.04s)]
*  Uganda and that was the Tutsi minority. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2559.12s)]
*  And they committed terrible atrocities when they invaded. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2562.52s)]
*  And it's just a fact they committed murder, rape, documented in 1990. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2564.36s)]
*  And Hutu extremists then said that they're going to commit genocide against the Hutus. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2569.2799999999997s)]
*  And that whipped up this kind of existential threat presented of the Tutsi minority. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2574.4s)]
*  They will kill us unless we kill them. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2580.36s)]
*  So actually it's quite, I mean, it's not unique, is it? [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2583.72s)]
*  There was so many other examples where genocide is often perpetrated when there are firstly [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2587.48s)]
*  atrocities not just being committed by one side, but where there's what you build up [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2591.9199999999996s)]
*  is an existential threat where an entire people become an existential threat and people will [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2597.24s)]
*  go, well, unless we do this to them, they're going to do this to us. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2603.56s)]
*  And that's what happened in Rwanda. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2606.56s)]
*  And you can see that happen in Bosnia as well. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2607.56s)]
*  So there is quite a clear overlap. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2609.08s)]
*  I'm just put lastly on that. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2610.52s)]
*  I interviewed a Russian dissident, Russian dissident in Belgrade in Serbia. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2611.52s)]
*  And he said after the Srebrenica ruling, it kills fury, fury in Serbia. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2617.88s)]
*  And on the biggest tower in Belgrade, they put this neon sign saying, we are not a genocidal [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2622.88s)]
*  people. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2629.4s)]
*  You know, there was this kind of defiance. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2630.4s)]
*  It just reminded me a bit anyway. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2631.46s)]
*  But there were these echoes, aren't there? [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2632.92s)]
*  Yes, I agree with you that there is this portrayal of the other as a genocidal threat or as a [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2636.92s)]
*  security threat in every genocide. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2644.44s)]
*  Look, astonishingly, even during Nazi fascists, Jewish people, even children were projected [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2647.4s)]
*  as a security threat. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2660.2000000000003s)]
*  And this is, in my view, a completely understood or fogged element of the story. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2662.64s)]
*  People are so annoyed by the attempt to understand the reality in Palestine by also looking at [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2672.6s)]
*  what has happened in the mind of the Nazis and in the mind of average Germans. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2681.08s)]
*  Because I think people are still immature and unable to comprehend and to hold the consequences [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2690.36s)]
*  that that bringing two tragedies so close together could reveal. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2700.1200000000003s)]
*  And still, I think that it's unnecessary. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2706.52s)]
*  Again, genocide, it's a process. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2710.7200000000003s)]
*  It's not an act. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2716.04s)]
*  And it has a collective dimension. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2718.16s)]
*  I think that, well, and if we had the privilege to live long enough, we would listen to the [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2725.3999999999996s)]
*  discussion we are having today as clairvoyants, because people would come to terms with it [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2737.24s)]
*  and they would come to terms with the correctness of this analysis. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2744.72s)]
*  This genocide could and should have been prevented. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2751.56s)]
*  And these would have meant honoring the victims of other genocides in Rwanda, in Bosnia, in [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2756.08s)]
*  Armenia, in Europe in order to respond to that moral call, which is never again. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2764.56s)]
*  And now we even have a legal framework supposed to serve that purpose. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2774.44s)]
*  And yeah, it's still not working. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2780.6400000000003s)]
*  But in the course of your work, you've been attacked repeatedly. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2784.28s)]
*  You've been attacked by the literal US administration. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2786.92s)]
*  They've attacked you. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2790.1200000000003s)]
*  You've been attacked by obviously the Israeli state. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2791.1200000000003s)]
*  You've been attacked by various pro-Israel journalists, commentators, public figures. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2793.36s)]
*  I mean, I just want your kind of response, I guess, to those attacks. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2801.08s)]
*  How difficult that's made your work, your general, you know, I do think it imposes a [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2804.2799999999997s)]
*  risk to people's safety. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2809.08s)]
*  Just tell me a bit about the impact on your kind of response to these attacks. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2810.52s)]
*  Thanks for asking this question. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2818.44s)]
*  Look, I'll be very honest. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2820.2s)]
*  I'm someone who values individuals equally. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2822.7599999999998s)]
*  Doesn't matter who they are, if they are prime ministers or ambassadors or workers, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2827.32s)]
*  as long as they know, they know what they are talking about. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2837.0s)]
*  So there is a huge mass of bots attacking me on social media, which I simply disregard. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2841.0s)]
*  Once I've said, dogs barking at an airplane. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2849.32s)]
*  Then, of course, there have been many attacks against me, but the outpour of support and [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2853.3199999999997s)]
*  admiration and love is so, again, overwhelming that frankly, I feel fine. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2862.36s)]
*  Because again, I know that what I'm pointing my finger at, but I also want to tell you [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2870.36s)]
*  something, because this is really my identity as a Southern Italian and Southern Italian [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2877.08s)]
*  lawyers. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2882.44s)]
*  There are many things that define who we are as individuals and professionals, but not [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2882.84s)]
*  only I'm someone who was raised with a very clear realization of what the Holocaust had [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2887.96s)]
*  been, and I've never seen it, I mean, the way I was educated, not just in my family, [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2898.36s)]
*  but in the society I grew up and in the school I grew up. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2903.08s)]
*  In the schooling system I grew up. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2906.44s)]
*  I was educated to what Italians had done to other Italians. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2909.32s)]
*  So at something very, very personal and the never again is so profound in me. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2915.8s)]
*  And this is one of the tenets of who I am as a person, because it's very part of my [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2921.64s)]
*  upbringing. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2926.68s)]
*  And then there is something else. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2927.64s)]
*  As a Southern Italian, I'm used to recognize the criminality of a system who not only [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2929.96s)]
*  commits crimes and I'm system not one individual or one organization or one entity, a multitude [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2939.0s)]
*  of all this, who not only commit crimes, but act to intimidate silence and even kill anyone [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2947.16s)]
*  who stands against them. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2956.68s)]
*  I mean, to a Southern Italian, I've had book talks, book launches and talks about Palestine [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2959.3999999999996s)]
*  in Sicily, and many people have commented, have come close to me after this, I say, what [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2965.96s)]
*  you describe is a mafia system. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2972.3599999999997s)]
*  It's so clear to me. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2975.0s)]
*  And this is why I know that this system is to be opposed by humanity, meaning I feel [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2976.2799999999997s)]
*  part of something that is bigger than me. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2984.04s)]
*  Yes, of course, I'm worried about my life and that of my family, but my life is no more [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2986.28s)]
*  worse than those who are dying in Gaza and not even more of what the Israelis are going [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=2991.6400000000003s)]
*  through. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=3000.52s)]
*  And as part of the system, I need to stand on the side of justice. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=3001.0s)]
*  It's been such an honor. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=3005.0800000000004s)]
*  We really do. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=3007.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean, I hope you know this because you obviously get you've had so many attacks on [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=3008.0400000000004s)]
*  you, including from the US government. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=3012.6800000000003s)]
*  I mean, you know, given their complicity in one of the worst crimes of our age, I'm not [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=3015.08s)]
*  sure they have any moral high ground from which to present themselves, but that's obviously [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=3023.08s)]
*  they've attacked you. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=3027.88s)]
*  They've, you know, and let's just be honest, the level of demonization of anyone who's [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=3028.6s)]
*  spoken out against this crime, it imposes risks on people's safety. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=3035.16s)]
*  I think it's worth just putting that out. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=3042.04s)]
*  But you've been an incredible voice throughout this incredible resource for all of us. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=3043.4s)]
*  Your work's been instrumental in being in so many of those flu-descending journalists [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=3049.0s)]
*  and analysts to getting across to the public exactly what's happening. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=3054.6s)]
*  And also telling the future, very important at times like this, because so many will say, [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=3059.8s)]
*  I did not know at the time, they'll say that. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=3065.0s)]
*  And, you know, the silent who will claim as well they spoke out when they didn't. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=3067.1600000000003s)]
*  And what your work does is help destroy that. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=3071.7200000000003s)]
*  People knew. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=3075.0s)]
*  If you wanted to know what was happening, and this is very important to say to the future, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=3075.88s)]
*  you could find out immediately. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=3080.84s)]
*  This is not hidden. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=3083.4s)]
*  There were no excuses. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=3084.28s)]
*  This is happening in plain sight. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=3085.5600000000004s)]
*  And your work has so thoroughly documented some of these terrible, terrible crimes. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=3089.1600000000003s)]
*  You've always done so with incredible moral clarity. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=3092.84s)]
*  So I want to thank you so, so much. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=3096.36s)]
*  And for everyone watching, please leave your comments, like, subscribe, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7g67r-4iE&t=3097.88s)]
