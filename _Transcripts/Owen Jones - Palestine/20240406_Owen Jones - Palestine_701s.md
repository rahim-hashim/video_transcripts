# UK Government "BREAKING LAW" On Israel: Judges and Lawyers In Revolt - w/. Raju Bhatt
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw)
*  Now, the evidence that Israel is committing war crimes, crimes against humanity is overwhelming. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=0.0s)]
*  We've all seen the videos, we've all seen the footage, we've all heard the testimonies, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=4.72s)]
*  what many of us have, certainly. The fact we even have to have this discussion, many people feel, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=8.08s)]
*  essentially gaslighting. But we do have to have this discussion. There is, of course, the ongoing [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  case brought by South Africa and the International Court of Justice alleging genocide, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=18.64s)]
*  which the ICJ ruled was a plausible case, and South Africa is now successful in terms of putting [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=22.64s)]
*  Israel on trial for genocide. That process takes years, but provisional orders have been issued, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=28.0s)]
*  which Israel is clearly refusing not only to implement, but doing the exact opposite. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=32.88s)]
*  But the legal case matters because it has implications, it has consequences. And with [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=38.08s)]
*  that in mind, there's a crucial letter which has now been signed by hundreds and hundreds of [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=42.56s)]
*  judges and lawyers, academics, retired senior judges, including four former Supreme Court [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  justices, including, for example, the former President, Lady Hale, many people remember her [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=54.96s)]
*  from the Brexit saga and her brooch. I'm sure that's all come flooding back. With that in mind, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=59.04s)]
*  I'm really delighted to be joined by the solicitor, Rajiv Aat, how are you doing? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=63.28s)]
*  Good afternoon. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=67.2s)]
*  Hi. Can you just sum up what the letter is saying? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=68.48s)]
*  The focus of the letter is on the failure of the UK government to comply and meet its obligations [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=73.28s)]
*  under international humanitarian law when faced with the growing evidence of genocide. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=80.32s)]
*  The obligations on the UK government under the Genocide Convention require it to ensure that it [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=87.91999999999999s)]
*  is not only not complicit in genocide elsewhere, but to prevent genocide. And that means in [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=96.0s)]
*  practical terms, some very, very simple steps that the UK government is obliged to take. It's [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=106.24s)]
*  incumbent upon the UK government to take these steps according to our view. First, obviously, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=113.52s)]
*  it has to take effective measures to ensure that there is a ceasefire, not just a temporary one, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=121.19999999999999s)]
*  but a permanent ceasefire. Secondly, it has to ensure, take whatever measures it can to ensure [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=128.08s)]
*  that there is access to the means of existence and medical assistance that the population in Gaza so [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  urgently require. Thirdly, the UK government is obliged to impose sanctions on the officials of [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=145.04000000000002s)]
*  the Israeli government, including those at the highest levels who have made statements indicating [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=154.8s)]
*  genocidal intent. Fourthly, the UK government is required to take steps to impose sanctions [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=161.12s)]
*  in the form of suspending the current weapon sales and armaments to Israel. That is [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=171.12s)]
*  an important part of the obligations on the UK. And finally, it has to ensure that the treaties [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=179.44s)]
*  underway, the arrangements concerning trade that are underway between the UK and Israel [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=187.84s)]
*  are suspended and reviewed. Again, to ensure that the UK government is not assisting, aiding, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=195.28s)]
*  or abetting the genocide that is unfolding in Gaza before our eyes. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  So really crucial points there, because a lot of people would have presumed, because if, for example, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=211.68s)]
*  it's clear based on legal advice given to the government that international humanitarian law [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=218.72s)]
*  has been breached by Israel, then that means suspending arms sales and also intelligence, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=222.16000000000003s)]
*  swapping intelligence. What you're clear there is actually it goes a lot further because of the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=227.60000000000002s)]
*  genocide convention. And we have to remember, Owen, that when we talk about the UK government's [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=231.92s)]
*  obligations, we are talking about our own obligations. All of us are at risk of being [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=238.32s)]
*  complicit with this atrocity that's unfolding if we don't call on the UK government to do what's [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  required here. I mean, just on that, on the 1948 Genocide Convention, and it lists [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=253.92s)]
*  five offences as well, including incitement. It's not just genocide, but public incitement to [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=261.44s)]
*  genocide, which, by the way, has been translated into Israeli law, still theoretically carries the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=268.8s)]
*  death penalty in Israel, incidentally, but also complicity. I mean, is there the issue here that, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=273.92s)]
*  because obviously there was an obligation on states as well to prevent genocide in other states, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=279.2s)]
*  but also that Britain is actually complicit? Britain is, the British government is itself [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=289.04s)]
*  passing a criminal threshold. Is that possible? Certainly there is a very real risk here that if [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=295.76000000000005s)]
*  the UK government does not take steps to the kind of steps that our letter urges it to, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=302.88000000000005s)]
*  that it makes itself complicit in the genocide and therefore susceptible to the sanctions that [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=310.96s)]
*  would otherwise be deserved by the Israeli government. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=319.44s)]
*  So, I mean, in terms of just in terms of how big a deal this is, how rare is it for a letter of [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=324.24s)]
*  this many lawyers, judges, all the rest of it to be put together on something so grave, because what [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=332.4s)]
*  we're talking about here, genocide, for a long time, look, for those of us who have opposed this [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=336.8s)]
*  horror from the beginning, we were treated like fringe lunatics. But the point I would make is, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=342.96000000000004s)]
*  what I've tried to say, particularly in the past few days, is there's been a shift against Israel, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=349.36s)]
*  largely because some Westerners got killed, was that you only had to listen to Israeli officials [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=353.92s)]
*  and leaders from the beginning. So I'm just wondering about that in terms of actually there's [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=358.24s)]
*  not really been any excuse because Israeli leaders and officials said overtly genocidal things on [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=362.48s)]
*  the start and you only, you just had to listen to them. So is there a sense amongst the legal [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=366.72s)]
*  community that this is actually just a real slam dunk case? Is that what the, is that how the breadth [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=371.92s)]
*  of people signing up to this? Because the government might just go, well, you're just a bunch of lefties [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=377.28000000000003s)]
*  like me. I think the letter reflects the growing concern both inside and outside the legal profession [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=381.6s)]
*  at the evidence that is unfolding before our eyes. The debts of the Western aid workers [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=390.72s)]
*  may have caught the headlines in the Western media in a way in which the debts of the hundreds of [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=398.56s)]
*  other aid workers, health workers, and civilians in there, as we know, tens of thousands, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=404.88s)]
*  haven't caught, but this letter is unique, unprecedented perhaps in the way in which it has [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=413.68s)]
*  brought together figures from all across the legal profession, at all levels of the legal profession, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=423.68s)]
*  to the highest levels. And I think that reflects what the growing perception, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=434.08s)]
*  the growing view, the growing anger, if I may say so, within our population at large. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=442.88s)]
*  On that, I'm just interested, look, you know, Israeli impunity has been very strong for a very [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=451.76s)]
*  long time and do you think you can see it being challenged in a way which is actually quite [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=456.24s)]
*  unprecedented? In South Africa's case itself shows the global South asserting itself in that impunity [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=459.44s)]
*  being challenged. And, you know, hypothetically, if we ended up one day, 10 years, 20 years from now, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=465.12s)]
*  30 years from now, whatever, with some sort of war crimes tribunal, do you think this could end [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=470.24s)]
*  up, your letter, being used as evidence of you would serve notice, you were told at the time [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=474.72s)]
*  by expert legal opinion what was happening and you chose to ignore it? Do you think it [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=480.96000000000004s)]
*  could have that kind of weight in future, you know, kind of criminal investigations if they [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=485.04s)]
*  ever happened, for example? It would certainly be a part of the serial ways in which the UK government [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=490.0s)]
*  has been put on notice. Let's just remember the provisional orders made by the International [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=500.96s)]
*  Court of Justice in January put the UK and all governments on notice of the plausible risk of [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=507.84s)]
*  genocide. The UN and its agencies have been talking about the imminent risk of famine, not [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=515.44s)]
*  natural famine, but a man-made famine caused by Israeli policies in Gaza. We have seen [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=525.5200000000001s)]
*  the, even the Security Council of the United Nations pass a resolution on this. And I think all of that [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=539.4399999999999s)]
*  reflects the growing ways in which the UK government and other governments are now on notice, that they [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=548.08s)]
*  are not, they cannot afford to allow themselves to be seen to be complicit any longer. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=557.6s)]
*  Just finally then, what's your hope in terms of what this letter could end up achieving? How big, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=563.8399999999999s)]
*  you know, it's a kind of, it lays down a marker, obviously, but is your hope that this will have [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=569.1999999999999s)]
*  an impact in, you know, the centres of power where they go, we've got a load of loads of big [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=574.16s)]
*  lawyers here, this is actually more serious than we thought. We actually need to be very careful [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=579.8399999999999s)]
*  about what we do from here on in. Do you think it could have a material impact in that sense? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=585.3599999999999s)]
*  It should certainly serve to concentrate minds in Downing Street and elsewhere in the government. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=590.8000000000001s)]
*  I would hope and expect that that will result in the kind of very simple but very profound actions [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=597.2800000000001s)]
*  that the letter urges on the government. Well, it's a crucial letter and I have to say, again, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=607.12s)]
*  you know, I say this a lot, but history can be a damning judge if we're going to go down the kind [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=614.08s)]
*  of legal kind of metaphors, I suppose, but it will record who stood up and said something and [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=618.32s)]
*  who remained silent. And what you and your colleagues have done is obviously speak, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=625.0400000000001s)]
*  use a platform in order to, using your legal knowledge, your legal expertise, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=631.0400000000001s)]
*  so it's not just people like myself trying to offer as best I can a platform to experts like [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=636.72s)]
*  yourself, but often, you know, making a moral case and talk about the facts on the ground, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=641.12s)]
*  but the point is you've used your weight, your legal weight, in order to make a very strong legal [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=646.08s)]
*  argument, which is a matter of life and death on a mass scale. And history, I think, will record [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=652.4s)]
*  that letter as a very important moment in this horror. It's the least we could have done in the [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=657.2s)]
*  circumstances. Well, it's an important step and I really do think it adds to the body of overwhelming [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=663.44s)]
*  evidence. There was no excuse. You knew. You were told not just once, not just twice, you were told [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=670.64s)]
*  over and over again, and you chose to ignore it, and therefore you need to be held accountable. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=676.8s)]
*  And that's what this letter is so key in doing. So thank you so much. I will include the link to it [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=680.88s)]
*  in the description so people can have a look through. It's a detailed 17-page document, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=686.24s)]
*  I believe, and a very, very impressive and ever-growing array of people behind it. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=689.52s)]
*  So do share this video, press like, subscribe, leave your comments, love to hear your thoughts, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=694.24s)]
*  but Rajee, thank you so, so much. Thank you, Eilidh. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqhXHOaHkHw&t=697.68s)]
