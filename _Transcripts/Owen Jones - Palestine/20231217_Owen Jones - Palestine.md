# Why Israel Can't Win War Expert Prof. Paul Roger's Devastating Interview
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [December 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ML1Vc3B-y2w)
*  Hello, I am particularly delighted to be joined today by Paul Rogers, who many of you will know,
*  an Emeritus Professor of Peace Studies at Bradford University, one of the pre-eminent experts,
*  I would say globally on issues to do with conflicts. Many of you may have seen the videos
*  I've done with him on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but it would be a miss not to talk to
*  you, Paul, given your expertise on the horror which is currently enveloping Gaza. Over the last
*  the last two months or so. Firstly, yeah, I suppose this is something which I think is under
*  discussed. By the way, great to see you. Sorry, hello. That was a breach of etiquette. Lovely to
*  see you, Paul. I suppose partly, I mean, what are your thoughts on this in terms of what Hamas's
*  strategy was on the 7th of October? Because Hamas wouldn't have done this and the other armed groups,
*  of course, but principally Hamas, unless they must have known what the response would be,
*  and therefore in a sense, perhaps they had a script and that script is now being followed.
*  I'm interested in what you think about that and I don't know if you have thought maybe actually
*  Hamas didn't expect to have, you know, they had a maybe that what happened and the atrocities that
*  obviously you were committing to 7th of October, what went on beyond what they themselves had
*  predicted. I don't know what you think about that in terms of what Hamas planned and whether or not
*  Israel is essentially going doing what Hamas intended them to do. I'd liken it a little bit
*  to what happened after 2001, after 9 11, because then when 9 11 happened in the first 24 36 hours
*  right across the western world there was massive support for the United States. I think it was the
*  one of the French dailies actually had its banner headline the following day, we were all Americans
*  now, that dissipated fairly quickly when it was clear the United States was going to go
*  into a major war and if you turn the whole thing around I think Al-Qaeda and to some extent the
*  Taliban but Al-Qaeda in particular were inciting the United States to attack them and I think the
*  reason for that was the Mujahideen back in the 1980s had in the view of people like bin Laden
*  seen off the Soviet Union, a superpower which then came apart at the seams and I think they
*  thought that if they could drag the United States into Afghanistan in a major way you know divisions
*  of troops in the rest they would do the same to the US. They failed in the latter one originally
*  because the Americans used special forces, carpet bombing and support from the Northern Alliance war
*  lords to get rid of the Taliban very quickly but they came back and 20 years later of course
*  in a sense they won and Al-Qaeda is still there in different countries including a lot of groups
*  associated with it in North and Central Africa so and I think in a sense that was partly the way
*  that Hamas saw it. They had a specific reason for doing it around about now because they were
*  concerned that as Israel was getting these diplomatic agreements with Gulf states Bahrain
*  for start but possibly Saudi Arabia then a sense the Palestinian cause would be sidelined even more
*  it become a sort of an abstraction almost so I think that was one reason certainly. They seem
*  to have been planning this operation for at least a year maybe two years and there've been lots of
*  trial runs which the Israelis have not actually picked up on. I think Hamas therefore was actually
*  doing this a deliberate thing to get retaliation. They expected strong retaliation from Israel
*  and they expect to basically to grind Israel down or at least move public opinion worldwide
*  in their favor so I think that's where they were coming from. The actual events of the 7th of
*  October were extraordinary and I think they found it actually easier than they expected. They broke
*  through the barrier, the apparently impenetrable barrier, in 15 to 20 different places in the
*  space of maybe a couple of hours and they poured the best out of 2,000 of their younger men into
*  Israel some of whom behaved absolutely appallingly. The Israelis tried to respond fairly quickly but
*  it took them more than 24 hours to actually get right back into many parts of that southwest part
*  of Israel. One example of what Hamas was able to do it sent a small group I think just on three
*  motorbikes, four or five people on three motorbikes deep into southern Israel and in fact attacked a
*  small but key command point which actually looked after the whole of the fence. That command post
*  was not actually near the fence it was several kilometers inland and essentially they were able
*  to kill the people responsible for that and it meant that the connections between the fence all
*  the way around Gaza and the rest of the Israeli armed forces was cut in the sense in the telecommunication
*  sense. So they had a lot of planning done but in really in answer to your question I think they
*  wanted and expected major retaliation. Now whether the extent of the Israeli retaliation which has
*  been absolutely vast and crippling was what they expected I do not know but what is clear now
*  that after more than two months we're fairly well into the third month of the war. After that time
*  the war is actually going even slower for the Israelis than we were led to believe. I mean
*  the events of last week here are central here and I think we need to recognize this. Through to about
*  Monday of last week the IDF, the Israeli Defense Forces were saying repeatedly that the war is
*  going our way, we've taken control of more or less most of northern Gaza, Hamas has been dealt with
*  and we're going to move on in spite of the huge human costs and the current
*  the whole movement of Palestinians into different parts of Gaza. Then you have this extraordinary
*  event in which you have basically a very carefully planned triple ambush. What they did first the
*  Hamas paramilitaries was to attack a small but quite significant Israeli unit part of the key
*  a key brigade of theirs and that actually happened almost sort of unexpectedly
*  but as the people who were killed and injured in that the injured people were going to be rescued
*  by others the other group that was rescuing them was itself ambushed and then a third group was
*  ambushed as well. Now the overall result of this we're not quite sure but we know that a senior
*  Israeli officer a colonel level officer battalion commander was killed, three majors were also killed
*  and a number of other officers and one or two conscripts about 10 people. Now that for the
*  Israeli Defense Forces to lose in one incident when these were the elite people these were I
*  think the Galani brigade which is probably the leading infantry brigade in the Israeli Defense
*  Forces and that showed I think unequivocally that in fact Hamas is still far more entrenched in Gaza
*  than you would expect and the other point of course is that we still have after what is it
*  more than two months of the war the hostages unaccounted for. Israel simply does not know
*  where they are and so I think when you get that picture that may indicate that in fact
*  for Gaza for the Hamas in Gaza this is not going as badly as people would be led to believe and
*  we're certainly getting that now in that the Israelis are saying pretty openly this is going
*  to go on through the rest of December into January into February and the real problem for them is
*  whether they're going to be able to do that with the way in which world opinion is really tiding
*  very strongly against them and you're seeing this whole range of demonstrations repeatedly
*  in the United States of course as well as Britain where the demonstrations that are happening every
*  day around the country are not diminishing in size of anything they're increasing so I know
*  a long answer to what you say so I think Hamas did see this largely coming this is a planned
*  operation and they had many young people who were expecting to die that's the crucial thing almost an
*  eschatological development implication of this is if you have young people who are paramilitaries
*  you can call them terrorists if you want it's a term that I avoid using but essentially if they
*  aren't determined to die for a cause then that is extremely difficult to handle as people found with
*  al-qaeda isis and others just in terms of I mean because the last more obviously about in terms of
*  the military campaign on the ground but since I've not spoken to you since this all began I'm just
*  wondering quickly on your thoughts about on 7th of October it's not just the astonishing actually
*  real failure on the part of of Mossad which is one of the world's most sophisticated security
*  agencies security services and who have extensive spy network I would imagine throughout Gaza but
*  the the failure to defend those southern communities I'm just wondering would you just
*  is that a lot to do with the fact the IDF are basically in the West Bank many of them protecting
*  those illegal settlements do you think that had a lot to do with it
*  No I think it's actually a lot worse than that from an idea perspective just going back historically
*  I mean the IDF grew out of the very early Israeli fighters back in 1947-48
*  they of course were hugely affected never forget this hugely affected by the scars of the Holocaust
*  which was an immediate thing there you know six million Jews had been killed in three or four years
*  and before that in the 1930s they've been extremely difficult position even my 1946-1948
*  1946-1947 Jews were a minority in what was still called Palestine then and they were not in fact
*  in a majority until after the Nakba and after many of the Palestinians had been some basic
*  basically booted out but really from that position on when there being conflicts between the Israelis
*  and the Palestinians then you have what is is generally known as what's it called the the
*  here doctrine coming in and this has its origins back in what was it 1982 the here is a district
*  south of south of Beirut and when the Israelis were trying to sort out parts of Beirut they
*  basically found it extremely difficult in and around Beirut they laid siege to the city
*  probably the best part of 10 000 people were killed in the 1982 war but if you then fast forward to
*  2006 when the Israelis were trying to do something about the rockets which Hesbala was fighting and
*  Hesbala had its origins back in that early 1980s when they were trying to basically respond to
*  those which were getting very serious they went into essentially southern Lebanon both with ground
*  troops including Galani brigade and with very heavy air power the Galani brigade suffered then
*  but in the air power this was when the Israelis used this tactic of massive civilian damage huge
*  economic structure damage that anybody connected with even the vegas way with Hesbala and indeed
*  the state as a whole so you had really this feeling from 2006 onwards that however the
*  difficulties the Israelis knew how to handle it and when you know within a year or two
*  to take control of Gaza then you have repeated efforts by the Israelis to maintain
*  the control there and you had what four wars before the current one and in those wars the biggest
*  probably was in well probably 2007-8 but also 2014 operation protective edge I think was called
*  again the Israelis found it extremely tricky to do it in a ground invasion once again it was the
*  Galani brigade which suffered most in that case but they used massive force and in those four
*  wars together the Israelis had lost about I think 300-350 of their personnel they killed 5,000
*  Palestinians and what it produced of course was new generations of very angry young men who were
*  willing to join Hamas now I know there's a bit of a long way to answer it I think in recent times
*  the Israelis basically came to the conclusion that they got it sorted that in fact you know
*  Israel could live live in peace and security in terms of its own outlook and I think this is
*  probably heightened by the way in which Israel moved notably to the right in the 1980s 1990s
*  rather this is because of a wave of immigrant Russia and the rest which was then allowable in
*  a sense that those were all people who were desperate to ensure their own security having
*  come to Israel quite late in the day that Israel as a whole became a country which I think is best
*  described as a country which is impregnable in its insecurity it has to feel impregnable but is also
*  fundamentally insecure because of where it is and that is something which I think is almost
*  inescapable but up until just 10 or 12 weeks ago the Israelis were confident that they are on top
*  of things and I think essentially there was a degree of well hubris if not arrogance that you
*  know nobody would come after them that you know if Hamas did this they knew exactly what they would
*  suffer from you know the Dahir doctrine would would kick in there would be massive well massive
*  destruction which would extend to civilians and they were wrong Hamas had actually been able to
*  do this in a way which was completely unexpected but you did again look at it you know we thought
*  that or people thought that the Taliban and al-haidah had been dealt with within 10 weeks
*  back in 2001 and in 2003 the statue of Saddam Hussein came down three weeks into the Gaza
*  into the Iraq war and the assumption was yes it was it was a conflict and so I think it was really
*  letting the guard down in a way which is disastrous and it also explains part of the
*  reasons for this incredible action that the Israelis are now taking. In terms of what happens
*  on the ground now in fact this is put by a former student of yours to me actually I said on Patreon
*  that was interviewing you and Afia says I stood in the porches and completed my first year
*  dissertation on the rise of Hamas and the occupied territories following the Al-Zor Accord
*  and they were asking if you know can Hamas be eradicated militarily and express skepticism and
*  if not why is this not being challenged more and I suppose if we look because you mentioned
*  Afghanistan and you know I interviewed for example Anand Gopal who's an expert on Afghanistan who
*  pointed out to me that the Taliban essentially evaporated in 2001 and were rebuilt because of
*  the counterinsurgency program led by the US who basically won lots of recruits to the Taliban
*  because of the horrors unleashed partly by the coalition forces but I suppose I mean the
*  counter argument to that is well Afghanistan is a graveyard of foreign invaders and it has been
*  it was for the British in the 19th century obviously was for the Soviets and it proved again
*  for the American-led coalition who all suffered defeat but that's the geography of Afghanistan
*  helps but Gaza is a tiny strip the size of East London yes there are tunnels but those tunnels
*  can be destroyed so is it possible that they could achieve those ends in a way that you couldn't in
*  Afghanistan essentially because of the geography of Afghanistan which is what has always helped
*  repel foreign invaders I think it's almost impossible for the Israeli defense forces to destroy
*  Hamas probably totally because even if they were able to claim they destroyed it then another
*  movement would rise because the basic problem is well bluntly the suppression of Palestinians in
*  Gaza and indeed the West Bank which we're forgetting about so yes it I think the Israelis particularly
*  Israeli defense forces think they can do it but I think you've got to tease that apart a bit because
*  you've got three different things interacting to view something of a perfect storm the one is and
*  we must never forget 7th of October was an utter shock to the Israelis it almost like the whole
*  carpet being pulled from under them what they thought was a secure state turned out not to be
*  and this does go back in part to the Holocaust you know okay there's virtually no Holocaust
*  survivors now but in so many Israeli families there's direct connections so we should never
*  underestimate that but there are two other very big factors one is that the Israeli government
*  under Netanyahu is really seriously far right more than that it's not just far right but it's
*  currently only able to stay in power because you have to I think many people would have used the
*  term extreme movements the smalls the groups I mean you've got the groups which are religious
*  fundamentalists very clearly and I think they in a sense are very powerful I mean I think
*  particularly you get somebody like I suppose um um who is basically one of the cabinet members
*  you got it my bank veer who really is in charge of security within the West Bank he is not so much
*  on the religious side but you also have um sort of what you might call the super Zionists uh
*  turbo Zionism is a term which some people are starting to use because you have people who
*  utterly believe um that Israel must be a pure uh Jewish state and nothing more and one has to
*  remember that in fact if you take the Likud party you look at its statement of aims it's almost its
*  charter the first part of that charter says that Israel is a sovereign country which stretches from
*  the river to the sea and that must be under complete Israeli sovereignty from that perspective
*  Israel is already a single state and this is why you know the idea of a sort of two-state solution
*  with liquid in power is frankly pretty nonsensical so you've got you've got the government which
*  absolutely believes in that and I think also of course you have the issue of um Netanyahu
*  determined to survive if you put all those together then we have a situation which I say
*  is akin to um really a perfect storm one thing to add though people therefore assume that the
*  Israeli people as a whole are all in favor of what's going on at present and that Hamas can be
*  destroyed not everybody feels that way I mean there's some very brave people what's it the
*  the women wage peace in Israel and Palestine the movement of women from Israeli and Palestinian
*  ranks who've basically been trying to work together even now I mean one of the ordinary
*  extraordinary ironies was I think it was on the third or fourth of October this year there's a
*  gathering of several thousand people from across the divide who are actually working together women
*  working together and some of the other areas were was it mehsharon meh um salamith at salon
*  and that anyway there is one particular town in Israel which is intentionally a Jewish and
*  Palestinian town and that succeeded for many years so there are other groups but I think
*  ultimately at the present the Israelis will stand for what Netanyahu and his group is doing that
*  will probably collapse if this war goes on very much longer but it is still currently strong
*  put it all together and this explains what the Israelis are doing and how far they're actually
*  going which is frankly appalling as we all know just in terms of other precedents just because
*  Iraq is something you've you've written on so extensively and when and by the way I should
*  just say it's very important you did mention the Israeli peace activists who are so courageous and
*  brave I've interviewed many of them uh and do people should check out the interview done with
*  atalia ben abba who's a refusenik who was sent to prison for refusing to serve in the occupation
*  ariel bernstein who's a soldier who uh formed an IDF soldier who's part of breaking the silence
*  who bring together conscience projectors incredibly brave people and standing together who
*  I've also interviewed at length who bring together Palestinian citizens of Israel and Jewish citizens
*  anyway um just in terms of presidency right so when I was interviewed by uh uh pierce morgan
*  lucky me um he tried to make a argument based on um the counterinsurgency program against
*  isis in iraq which I've known the Israeli authorities keep talking about as well
*  the point I did make to him is he was missing out history which was after the invasion of iraq you
*  had the counterinsurgency program against al qaeda who themselves partly came out of the the iraqi
*  army was shut down you had all these dispossessed men with lots of guns and they you know you had
*  the massacres in cities like phalujah by the u.s soldiers and that became an insurgency with al
*  qaeda and then the suppression of al qaeda helped breed another and helped rise the rise of isis
*  which was even more extreme than al qaeda but I'm just interested in what your thoughts about
*  the counterinsurgency in iraq uh in the sunny populations and and when people say well isis
*  was suppressed by a counterinsurgency program what do you think about those power laws
*  there is some truth in it I mean if you take the period between 2004 and 2007 or eight then yes
*  that was when the americans basically gave up what they were trying to do with traditional
*  counterinsurgency often using troops who weren't prepared well prepared or trained for it then they
*  moved in by using a really special forces on a substantial scale uh and in fact there were
*  the four different units there was task force north west east and black and these really
*  divided different parts of baghdad and the wider areas into zones which were extremely well
*  armed and well resourced as it happened one of those four groups was from the sas it was I think
*  the saber battalion of the sas and they were basically the way these worked was if they got
*  any kind of intelligence that there was a particular compound somewhere in which there were
*  basically the the insurgents present then they would do a night raid helicopter raid using you
*  know night vision and the rest and pounce and kill and hopefully capture some of them the ones who
*  were captured would be subject to I think it's politely called robust physical intelligence and
*  if they got further information from them there might be other raids staged in the same hours of
*  darkness that same night now there was something like I think it was up to a hundred of these raids
*  going on virtually every month and this in fact it did lead apart from anything else in a slightly
*  different way to the death of zakawi who was the key person in the development of al-sidra in iraq
*  but it did actually suppress the insurgency to an extent in fact by 2008 it was one of the things
*  which allowed um obama to say that you know the iraq war was now a bad war and the united states
*  should withdraw whereas he still believes that afghanistan was quote to good wear war because
*  it's in more complete connections with 9 11 but as far as iraq was concerned you therefore had
*  this situation which it seemed to have worked but by 2011 12 you already had the beginnings of the
*  next phase and as you said isis was developing you had that absolutely shocking area or a shock
*  to the system in what was and i think it was may june 2014 where they took mosul and basically
*  declared that there's this new halifate stretching across northern part of iraq through to the northern
*  part of syria and this of course was the a caliphate with about six million people in it
*  which for a year or so ran almost as a um as a composite state and they were creating
*  halifate a historical entity but of course it was also hugely violent you had the particularly the
*  killing of the yezidis and others and in 2014 15 uh essentially obama started to bring in
*  uh this major operation which turned into a full-scale war which was run through
*  the trump era with quite a recent past now through to 2018 and in that war uh there was virtually no
*  use whatsoever special forces in fact this is entirely an air war i mean that's um websites
*  air wars chronicled this extremely well i'm going from memory here so one has to be careful if i
*  remember rightly something like 30 000 targets were attacked with like something like a hundred
*  thousand mostly precision guided weapons primarily by the american air force but with the french the
*  british and others also pretty heavily involved now we don't have the figures for how many
*  casualties there were air wars certainly believed and i think the iraq body count people were doing
*  work on this that there were some thousands of civilians killed but certainly the american head
*  of the american special operations command actually put down that he reckoned about 60 000
*  isis supporters as he called them were killed in those four years and mozal of course was
*  eventually retaken although it was the central mozal the old village the old city center was
*  virtually destroyed so you actually had what appeared to work then but since then what has
*  happened well we have isis linked and a high to linked groups right across the sahel area of
*  africa you know from moritanian in the west right through to chatton nigeria and the rest
*  right through in fact down as far as mozambique you have these action and they're basically
*  developing their ideas and the tactics drawn from people who are right on the margins you're still
*  seeing these groups active in iraq and syria the americans are still doing pretty regular air raids
*  in syria quite frequent and you still get disturbances and unrest in ahistan so this has
*  not gone away it's not being covered in the way that it was in the western media but it's still
*  happening and if you read the military journals you see that so once again even despite the
*  apparent success of there it's a short-term thing at most which is why i would go back to the
*  the idea that in fact what is happening in gaza is going to be a success for the israelis
*  it's very much if you if you basically quote tessitus you know we made a desert and called it
*  peace and they're going to be peace breaking down in other ways i'm afraid i mean in terms of israel's
*  campaign military campaign in terms of its brutality and also stated intent and i for example
*  um interviewed razi gal who is an israeli american academic and he's a scholar in
*  genocide and holocaust studies and he said it was very rare for intent to be so overtly stated i
*  keep saying these in interviews people probably hear me hear me repeat this a lot but i think
*  it's a critical point and in that you know when you get the prime minister quoting amelek in the
*  bible to you know remember what amelek did in the bible the israelites attacked by the nation of
*  amelek and god orders them to kill all men women and children and whether it be saying there were
*  no innocents in in gaza human animals uh to the two million nazis in the west bank which is
*  virtually the entire palestin population um you know just language which is is so genocidal
*  um and that seems rare to me in in conflicts if i look at the bulkins i don't recall you know the
*  likes of slobberdom and loss which denied their intents you didn't generally get that kind of
*  language you got attempts to cover up what was happening so i'm just wondering in terms of stated
*  intent but also how what what precedent is there for the level of actual brutality it's estimated
*  now about one percent of gaza's population or more has been killed in about two and a half months
*  i mean what precedents are there for that both intent stated in conflict and also actual death
*  destruction injury that kind of thing i think what we're seeing is really pretty rare um i think
*  it's actually one of the israeli papers harats in fact uh published a report which is down i'm not
*  sure who did it whether it's done in israel or the united states which was saying that the the
*  intensity of the air war in uh in gaza uh was essentially unprecedented i'm not absolutely
*  sure about that because when you look into detail for what the americans the french and the brits
*  and others did in and around mozol in a relatively short period was pretty grim as well i mean the
*  old city of mozol was almost razed to the ground uh people compared it to stalingrad so there may
*  be other examples and i'm what has to say that of course on the other side so to speak um the way in
*  which um uh haida and isis have gone on with their insurgencies has been truly brutal repeatedly
*  there is i think a difference here in that and it comes back to a point i was trying to make earlier
*  i'm not around i mean i i can't answer your question directly i'm sort of going around it
*  to try and throw light on it i think if you look back at i come time and time again to the utter
*  shock for the israelis particularly the israelis right and particularly the israeli defense forces
*  um to essentially suffer what they suffered it was such an utter shock that they were certainly
*  becoming insecure then go back to what they were saying uh back in say 2006 when you'd had the
*  the whole developments in lebanon very similar phraseology was being used i haven't got it in
*  front of me now but in fact the general at the time uh gazet gazet eisenkot um really talked about
*  this idea of a doctrine in which you published published you you punished far more people
*  um than were actually involved and many of those would be civilians now eisenkot is not on the
*  far right politically uh but is very uh sort of pushy and tough in the military sense he ended
*  up as the israeli chief of staff and then he retired in 2019 and he bought back about six or
*  eight weeks ago into the war cabinet so it's a very small war cabinet he's one of them so essentially
*  this is really right at the heart of it and as far as the idf now determined to regain its
*  possession uh its position as the guardians of judaism within israel then it really is
*  insistent that this is correct to do but as you say when you're getting this kind of terminology
*  used um by senior people to say you know almost the day after the whole business of the human
*  animals now to some extent you say well that's the utter shock of what would happen but it's
*  persisted uh and this is where i think we are i think frankly we're getting into very dangerous
*  territory and this is probably why you know there's a real change in attitude within the
*  white house i think some of them are sensitive enough to see what's going on you always have
*  to remember that the united states could more or less pull the plug on this war within days israel
*  is so dependent on on the resupply of weapons i mean the way these things work is israel will
*  have been very well equipped and very well resourced at the start it would have very big
*  reserves of equipment very big reserves of bombs and the rest but as those are being used up it may
*  still have some reserves but it has to replace those reserves and this is where the americans
*  come in with the many different flights into israel and in fact raf akrotiri just across the
*  water in cyprus acting as something of a local hub which involves with british planes british c
*  17s and of course far more on the american side as well so i think it's you're coming back to
*  um an insistence that essentially this whole problem of well basically the palestinians must
*  be dealt with once and for all and because you have within the israeli government uh some real
*  extreme elements you know as extremely you'll see almost anywhere uh utter fundamentalists
*  then we're in a very difficult position that does not in any way diminish the methods that
*  hamas is being used which are appalling but on the other hand the misery that we're seeing
*  day by day you know thousands upon thousands of children just actually dying or being traumatized
*  probably a thousand infants dying um it is unparalleled in many ways partly because we
*  are seeing it with our own eyes and although most of this stuff can get into the british
*  mainstream media you see it on aljazeera in the other channels on english language channels so
*  this is why i think we're dealing with something which is very different and potentially very
*  dangerous just a couple of other things i mean just in terms of the claims of guests of israel
*  on the ground hamas is falling apart i would note they've done and supposedly these videos of
*  supposedly hamas fighters surrendering which have been extensively challenged and including for
*  example journalists aljazeera and elsewhere people identifying actually those supposedly hamas
*  fighters a lot of them are just they're just civilians they're including doctors doctors
*  bakers journalists and and it seems that you know what they're doing is handing over guns that kind
*  of thing that they've been stepped that it's all been staged it's not really happening in order to
*  obviously send a message i guess that hamas but also to domestic audiences in israel that
*  look you're falling apart you might as well give up now surrender and this basic psychological
*  warfare breaking the geneva convention in the process because of course you cannot parade
*  prisoners in front of cameras that goes against the geneva conventions as you know but just so
*  everyone knows um so i'm just wondering what do you think is actually in terms of how intact hamas
*  is as a fighting force and of course the other point is you know it whatever people you know
*  there's the fighting force but people keep making this point you can't defeat an idea
*  and hamas you could destroy the entire leadership of hamas and either some another leadership
*  emerges or something else replaces it but i'm just interested what you think about the military
*  facts on the grounds as regards israeli claims it's difficult to piece it frankly because you're
*  getting so varied information coming um i would agree with you that what the idf is putting out
*  has to be pretty high levels of propaganda because it has to convince people that it's
*  winning in what is a protracted war so the one moment it's saying you know we're on top and
*  and essentially hamas is defeated and then it's saying well this war is going to go on until
*  february or longer now the rate of destruction will be not very much left of garrison that's
*  the case and what will happen to the 2.3 million garzons we just don't know but i think well this
*  is basically sort of going out on a limb i think in fact the war is not going anything like as well
*  for the israelis as they're leading us to believe and i think they're trying to do this and i say we
*  started off this discussion with the report two weeks ago of that uh extraordinary um well
*  basically i mean it was a kind of ambush but it's very heavily worked out precisely worked out
*  but this is in part of garzons which the israelis said they're now fully controlled
*  and it wasn't just a sort of a small group of soldiers caught out and killed these were elite
*  troops some of the best in the israeli army i think that is a real strong indicator that in
*  hamas has a long way to go now it's absolutely possible that hamas might suddenly collapse
*  but at the very least what you will be left with is probably tens of thousands of more young people
*  young men mainly but in terms of war fighting but young people on the garzons side and also more
*  and more on the west bank who will support the likes of hamas or a replacement in spite of all
*  that is also done wrong so i don't see any way in which israel can come out of this in the longer
*  term without many more insecurity problems unless the near impossible happens it starts to realize
*  you're going to have to actually deal with with the palestinians on a human rights basis there's
*  no sign of that at the moment at the moment but that may come in due course it's possible that
*  if this war could come to a relatively early end it might prompt sufficient people including
*  foreign politicians to say you've got to start dealing seriously with this it is in my personal
*  view one of the most important things that can do people can do now is actually talk about this
*  and indeed i think the way in which people are taken to the street is astonishing far more than
*  the mainstream media is reporting but that is certainly happening i've experienced where i live
*  myself but just finally in terms of legacy i mean you kind of partly answered part of my question
*  answers of what this means for israel log term it's on its own term security so i mean its argument
*  would be this is to make israel more more secure but i guess in terms of the world order and which
*  you know i think it's not just actually a self-image of western elites there's a self-image
*  often which a lot of western populations have been encouraged to buy into and which is not shared by
*  much of the world to put it blunt much of the world already had a very cynical and you know
*  view of western power iraq obviously brought that into sharp relief but you know israel and palestine
*  more generally um but i have to say this a lot of the world look at this just to be blunt look at
*  this and go you are taking the piss frankly in terms of western power that these you know the the
*  level of atrocity and widespread destruction the outright repudiation of even the most basic norms
*  of law of war of warfare about how warfare is supposed to be conducted according to the
*  geneva conventions which emerged from the rubble of world war i mean it's just so flagrant and
*  unsubtle combined with the rhetoric of the israeli government which is so how you know genocidal as
*  and i don't use that flippantly i'm just deferring to what genocide scholars say um it's not
*  hyperbolic um i just wonder what you think that legacy will be i mean in terms of maybe
*  radicalization uh in terms of just the authority the moral position of the moral authority of of
*  western power and the long-term decline of western power that's a lot to put in a question i accept
*  but i just wondered your general thoughts about that in terms of legacy i think that relates much
*  more to wider security issues and i put it this way um i have a term which i use to describe this
*  attitude in which you basically suppress major threats and that is a very crude one it's called
*  lidism you keep the lid on things rather than actually looking at the underlying reasons why
*  people are revolting are angry and this can apply to many different things i think that's a worldwide
*  trend so in some ways i think um what the israeli defense forces are doing in gaza is an example of
*  extreme lidism basically you're really trying to prevent any kind of dissent uh by any means
*  necessary to ensure your own security uh that is a phenomenon which i think we're seeing in
*  different contexts and it's going to get much greater across the world uh as we come to the
*  you know the the real conflict in the longer term is a security paradigm which is rooted in
*  military defense uh coming up against a world which is both desperately marginalized because
*  of the failure on the union on the neoliberal side and also of course with climate breakdown coming
*  in you've got a constrained world uh which is environmentally constrained which is divided
*  and which elite communities in the widen sense including many of ourselves are centrally all
*  about maintaining security and that in one way i'm afraid to say i think gaza is an extreme example
*  of a particular attitude uh which we're seeing in different parts of the world the attitude to you
*  know the fact that desperate people trying to get across the english channel are invaders yeah it's
*  it's outrageous and this i think is a risk so if as we see the destruction in gaza for what it is
*  um then that's really a much wider warning that doesn't help at all to anybody supporting the
*  palestinians but i think that's true now just add one other thing quickly which is i missed out
*  entirely at the start one of the things that people are surprised at is why is biden still
*  supporting israel so much yeah yeah it's not the jewish lobby it's the israel lobby and what one
*  has to remember is that many american jews probably proportionally more than in britain
*  are bitterly opposed to what the israeli government is doing what you're forgetting about the people
*  always forget about that other phenomenon christian zionism and christian zionism is that branch of
*  evangelical christianity which believes that god gave the land of israel to the jews to protect
*  until the final days and it goes back 120 130 years in fact probably 160 years to the 1820s
*  and essentially it is supported by far more people in the united states than the jewish probably i
*  mean there are seven million or so jews in the united states you're talking about 20 to 30 million
*  evangelical christians who basically take this view out of the 100 million plus evangelical
*  christians uh they tend to vote republican and they tend to vote more than the average
*  and we have a presidential election coming up in less than a year one has to factor that in
*  in terms of understanding where biden is coming from domestic u.s politics plays quite a role in
*  this i know apart from what we talk about is the point that people constantly miss
*  that is a really excellent point which i'm glad you made and actually what's so striking is the
*  number if you look at the united states obviously is a much bigger jewish population than here in
*  britain but some of the often the the new generation of the left that's emerged in the u.s many of the
*  leading figures are drawn from the jewish community historically of course the left has always been
*  disproportionately shaped by the contributions of jewish people which is partly which the anti-semites
*  of course in the early 20th century seized upon and talked about international jewish bolshevik
*  conspiracies the nazis etc that sharpened didn't it their hatred of jews the disproportionate
*  always contribution of jewish people to movements against oppression against injustice and and it's
*  really heartening in younger generation of jewish people i mean it's interesting
*  younger generations in america and elsewhere the most pro-palestinian ever but that does also
*  include of course that that next generation of of young jews so it's a very very important point
*  to make can i keep on this channel keep signal boosting the those jewish voices who will be
*  vindicated by history and as well those brave courageous fighters for justice in in in israel
*  as well paul that was that was brilliant stuff as ever people can see why um his expertise is so in
*  demand and and a a counterweight i would say to to uh the rather simplistic analysis you generally
*  get on known most mainstream media outlets uh paul and i always say this every time i speak to you
*  but uh you had a big impact on me when i was a teenager uh i studied you actually at my sixth
*  form in stockport so it's always an honor to uh but it's true uh always an honor i know it's
*  probably annoying to hear that but it's always an honor to speak to you partly because of that but
*  paul i really appreciate it thank you so much do like and share this video and and and uh subscribe
*  but paul thank you so much will do thank you very much and thank you for listening so long thanks
