# Israel's Atrocities Exposed By CNN - A Network Defined By Pro-Israeli Bias
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwHo3rzm8Zs)
*  From the beginning, I've made it clear that the overall coverage of the Western media
*  when it comes to Israel's genocidal onslaught against Gaza, with courageous and commendable
*  exceptions, has been a disgrace. From failing to accurately frame their coverage around Israel's
*  clearly repeatedly stated genocidal intent, as expressed through the numerous statements
*  of its leaders, to whitewashing and ignoring crimes, failing to challenge lies, failing to
*  address the complicity of Western states, treating Israeli spokespeople with deference, failing to
*  listen to Palestinian perspectives, we could go on. The scale of the crime though is such that it
*  is impossible to suppress all of the reality, and you do occasionally get genuinely important pieces
*  of journalism which offer us insight into this unfolding and unspeakable horror. And one is a
*  new piece of journalism from CNN which is notable, given a study earlier this year based on
*  anonymous briefings by CNN staff accused their own network of journalistic malpractice because
*  of its endemic pro-Israeli bias. Now, it's an article on the CNN website entitled,
*  Strap Down, Blindfolded, Held in Diapers, Israeli Whistleblowers Detail Abuse of Palestinians
*  in Shadowy Detention Center. It is a hideous read and exposes the barbaric mistreatment of
*  Palestinian detainees by the Israeli state. Now, we're discussing here detainees held at Styr
*  Taiman, a military base in the Negev Desert in Israel proper, and is based on, in large part,
*  on the testimonies of three Israeli whistleblowers who risked legal repercussions and reprisals
*  from Israeli extremists. Now, one says of the detainees,
*  we were told that they were not allowed to move, they should sit upright, they're not allowed to
*  talk, not allowed to peek under their blindfold. The detainees were almost always blindfolded,
*  there was a putrid smell always in the air because of neglected wounds left to rot.
*  Guards were instructed to scream, us gots, shut up, in Arabic, and told to pick out people
*  who were deemed problematic and punish them. They said, these whistleblowers, that doctors
*  sometimes amputated prisoners' limbs because of injuries sustained by constant handcuffing,
*  while medical procedures were sometimes performed by under-qualified medics. Detainees were placed
*  under extreme physical restraints, with wounded detainees strapped to their beds wearing diapers
*  and fed through straws. One whistleblower, who worked as a medic at the Facilities Field Hospital,
*  according to CNN, says they stripped them down of anything that resembles human beings.
*  They report another whistleblower who says the beatings were not done to gather intelligence,
*  they were done out of revenge for what they, the Palestinians, did on October 7th and punishment
*  for behaviour in the camp. Now responding to the CNN's request for comment, the Israeli military
*  deny all this. They say, oh, they insure proper conduct towards detainees,
*  allegations of misconduct by IDF soldiers is examined and dealt with accordingly. A load of
*  nonsense. I mean, we can see over and over again throughout this horror, these terrible atrocities
*  being committed and bragged about, I have to say, by IDF soldiers with no disciplinary action
*  taken against them. Now, as the article says, these testimonies cast more doubt on the Israeli
*  government's repeated assertions that it acts in accordance with accepted international practice
*  and law. So what happens, as the piece explains, is that in this so-called war, the Israeli military
*  are allowed to detain people there 45 days before they're transferred to the former prison system,
*  where over 9,000 detainees are held in conditions, human rights groups have said, have
*  drastically deteriorated since 7th of October. And I'll try to do more on that because, I mean,
*  we're looking there at horrors in that prison system. But I'll have something to talk about
*  here actually. 18 Palestinians have reportedly died in Israeli custody since all this began,
*  including the leading Gaza surgeon, Dr Adnan al-Bursh. Now let's just be blunt here, these
*  people aren't just dying in detention. I mean, I don't think you're stupid or naive. It's obvious
*  they're being killed either in deliberate specific incidents or because of the effects of sustained
*  mistreatment, torture. CNN also interviewed a dozen former Palestinian detainees who said they
*  couldn't work out where they'd been held because they were largely blindfolded and cut off from the
*  world. But what they said tallied with the accounts of whistleblowers. They spoke of being held in
*  desert conditions. So obviously unpleasant heat in the day, but then cold at night. One detainee,
*  Dr Mohammed Al-Ran, who headed the surgical unit in the Indonesian hospital in Gaza, bear in mind,
*  so many medics have been detained by the Israeli state as they've destroyed the medical system in
*  Gaza. He said he was stripped of his underwear, blindfolded his wrist, tied and dumped on the
*  back of a truck where near naked detainees were piled on top of one another. Israeli whistleblowers
*  in this piece also say that they appoint a so-called supervisor or swarish in Arabic,
*  their detainees were cleared of suspected looks to Hamas after interrogation. So that means they
*  keep people who can't be accused of being guilty of anything. Now the Israeli authorities again
*  deny that, but again, who are you going to believe here? In the case of Dr Mohammed Al-Ran, that meant
*  in his case, being kept there after being cleared for weeks. He was given what he describes as a
*  special privilege, his blindfold being removed, but that meant being forced to see others being
*  tortured and treated as animals. So that imposed a horror in its own right. Now prisoners who
*  committed offences like speaking to one another would be forced to keep their arms above their
*  heads for an hour. But if a detainee, a prisoner, hostage, if you want to call them that, if they
*  moved or spoke more than once, they'd be beaten, including to the point of their bones being broken.
*  It spoke about these routine searches where guards would unleash large dogs on sleeping detainees,
*  throw in sound grenades as treats barged in and the dogs then climbing all over them. Obviously a
*  completely terrifying experience. One whistleblower said he was forced to perform medical procedures
*  he wasn't qualified for. He said, just being there felt like being complicit in abuse.
*  We've seen in pictures of those detainees being released how emaciated and badly treated they've
*  been. Now again, the Israeli authorities deny this, but who do you believe? Authorities where
*  they track record of lying through their teeth or multiple Israeli whistleblowers which corroborate
*  the testimonies of countless Palestinian detainees. The point here is Israel is routinely
*  and flagrantly violating international law every single day in multiple ways and its Western
*  allies know it. Now as Omar Shakir, the Israeli Palestine Director at Human Rights Watch,
*  correctly puts it, what we know about Gaza is only the tip of an atrocity iceberg. We already know
*  before 7th October of hideous mistreatment of detainees. Important because this attempt to
*  start the clock on 7th October is a disgrace. It is a complete flagrant, shows flagrant
*  contempt for the truth in reality. Now specifically in the West Bank where huge numbers of Palestinians
*  are arrested and detained without charge including children. Save the children found in report before
*  the 7th October, months before 7th October, focusing on child detainees. Palestinian children,
*  we're talking about children here just to be clear, in the Israeli military detention system face
*  physical and emotional abuse with 4 out of 5, 86% of them being beaten, 69% strip searched,
*  nearly half, 42% injured at the point of arrest including gunshot wounds and broken bones.
*  Some report violence of a sexual nature, some are transferred to court or between detention
*  centers and small cages. Now they report, save the children, that 42% of them again before 7th
*  October detained by Israel were injured including gunshot wounds and broken bones, 65% arrested
*  during the night, 86% beaten, 70% threatened with harm, 60% hit with air sticks and guns,
*  some children reporting violence and abuse of a sexual nature. Children, remember that,
*  talking about children. Now we know in February that the UN reported sexual and physical violence
*  against Palestinian women and this is truly gruesome and I would note that these Palestinian
*  women have been erased completely, haven't they? How often is this discussed? At least two female
*  Palestinian detainees were reportedly raped, well according to the UN report, while others were
*  reportedly threatened with rape and sexual violence. They also noted that photos of female
*  detainees in degrading circumstances were reportedly taken by the Israeli army and uploaded
*  online. Furthermore, Palestinian women and girls have reportedly been arbitrarily executed in Gaza,
*  often together with family members including their children according to information received.
*  Hundreds of Palestinian women and girls have been reported, have been reportedly been subjected to
*  inhuman degrading treatment, denied menstruation pads, food and medicine and severely beaten.
*  On at least one occasion Palestinian women detained in Gaza were allegedly kept in a cage, in the rain
*  and cold without food. Now according to the NGO, Yoramed Human Rights Monitor, Palestinian prisoners
*  and detainees from the Gaza Strip who are being held by the Israeli army are being subjected to
*  pre-meditated murder and arbitrary execution outside of the purview of the law and judiciary.
*  They add that the Israeli army continues to commit the crime of forced disappearance of
*  prisoners and detainees from the Gaza Strip by withholding lists of their names and information
*  about their whereabouts. Sounds a lot like hostage taking to me. Now there's a report compiled by
*  UNRWA, that's the United Nations Agency for Palestinian Refugees, the main humanitarian agency
*  in Gaza which Israel has waged a vicious war against. Back in March it was estimated by them
*  that more than 4,000 men, women and children have been rounded up in Gaza since it began.
*  Now when we talk about children, we're talking about kids as young as six, six years old detained
*  in these conditions, as well as elderly Palestinians with chronic conditions like Alzheimer's.
*  Placed in makeshift military barracks housing 100 to 122 people each, where they could be held for
*  weeks at a time. The report says methods of ill treatment reported included physical beatings,
*  forced stress positions for extended periods of time, threats of harm to detainees and their
*  families, attacks by dogs, insults to personal dignity and humiliation such as being made to act
*  like animals or getting urinated on, use of loud music and noises, deprivation of water, food,
*  sleep and toilets, denial of the right to practice their religion, to pray and prolonged use of
*  tightly locked handcuffs causing open rooms and friction injuries. Women detainees reported being
*  groped by blindfolded and some male prisoners said they were beaten in their genitals. According to
*  the UNRWA report, another detainee reported being made to sit on an electrical probe causing burns
*  to his anus, the scars which could still be seen weeks later. He indicated that another detainee
*  had also suffered the same treatment and died as a result of his infected wounds. Again, denied by
*  these Israeli authorities, who do you believe here, with their track record of deception,
*  so many testimonies. The fact is, these aren't lies, clearly are they? What we're hearing here
*  is the tip of an iceberg. It's just not at all clear, we're just not at all clear about the vast
*  reality of the horrors because, you know, they've overseen the biggest killing of journalists in
*  recorded history, they're blocking foreign journalists from getting in. It's just very
*  difficult to know in terms of obviously get information from, well, those who were detained
*  and those who have been killed. We just don't know the full scale of this horror but we know enough,
*  we know enough for there to be no excuse. We know that terrible, terrible atrocities
*  are being committed. Now, let's just be clear here, when Hamas took civilians' hostages on
*  the 7th of October, that wasn't an intolerable war crime. We need to be clear, morally consistent
*  about this. All try to be morally consistent, you know, moral clarity, very important. I wouldn't
*  know that the horrors imposed on Palestinian detainees as evidence throughout all of these
*  pieces of evidence are much, much worse than the evidence we currently have about Israeli hostages,
*  a point previously put to me in an interview I had to say by the courageous Israeli journalist
*  Gideon Levy. In fact, some of the evidence suggests that the main horror, that again,
*  not to belittle again, the horror in its own right of being held hostage, that is a horror,
*  not going to belittle that, but the biggest fear was of Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip,
*  which has clearly killed a significant number of Israeli hostages, it must be said, and we know
*  anyway that Israel has killed far more of its own hostages than it's rescued by military means.
*  And we should regard these Palestinian detainees as hostages. Clearly, I mean, look, we're talking
*  about kids as young as six here. Now, when discussing the horrors unleashed by the Israeli
*  state with the full complicity of the Western governments, it is often a no to no. Where do
*  we start? Where do we end? Here is one horror, one particular horror, but here's a prediction.
*  The Israeli state, subjecting so many to terrible mistreatment and torture, will simply radicalise
*  many of them if they survive, but as well as radicalising their loved ones, as well as
*  radicalising those who learn of what Israel has done. But Israel has become so overwhelmed by this
*  racist and genocidal mania that I can't even grasp this desperately obvious point as it subjects the
*  Palestinian people to this unforgivable horror. Well, we will continue as best we can, certainly
*  on this channel, to discuss the horrors being unleashed by the Israeli state and to give a
*  platform as best we can to the experiences, the lived experiences of the Palestinian people in
*  all the great atrocities of our age. Please like and subscribe, do leave a comment, I always read
