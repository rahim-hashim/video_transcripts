# '$50m CONDOMS For GAZA: US Pushes DERANGED Lie
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso)
*  $50 million in US taxpayers money for condoms in Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=0.0s)]
*  Now, this is a lie, an absurd and deranged lie, which has been spread by the new US press secretary. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=5.12s)]
*  Let's just take a listen. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=11.44s)]
*  Doge and OMB also found that there was about to be $50 million taxpayer dollars that went out the door [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=12.48s)]
*  to fund condoms in Gaza. That is a preposterous waste of taxpayer money. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  Now, as we know, Israel's cheerleaders lie and lie and lie again, and Donald Trump's allies lie and lie [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=22.88s)]
*  again, so we can expect the new US administration to take already endemic deceit to whole new levels, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=29.44s)]
*  and so it has proven. But there are many lessons here which are worth exploring, which I will. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=35.68s)]
*  Doge is of course the Department of Government Efficiency, I don't think I'm even pronouncing [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=41.04s)]
*  it right, good, which is led by the richest man on earth, the billionaire Elon Musk, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=45.6s)]
*  who definitely did not do too full on Nazi sleuths in front of the entire world. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=50.96s)]
*  The claim about $50 million worth of condoms to Gaza predictably was seized upon by right-wing [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=56.24s)]
*  pundits like Jesse Waters on Fox News, who claimed that these were being used as booby-trapped condoms. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=62.4s)]
*  Are they worried about safe sex? Because you know what they're doing with the condoms? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=69.92s)]
*  They're making condom bombs. That's right. Hamas floats these things up with bomb-making [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=74.16s)]
*  materials and then kaboom, booby-trapped condoms. Look it up, it's a dual-use technology. Thank [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=80.72s)]
*  God they got rid of that. What are the facts here? Well, as the Guardian report this morning, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=87.44s)]
*  the US Agency for International Development did a comprehensive report last September, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=92.72s)]
*  which found in the previous year that the US spent about $60.8 million globally on contraceptive [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=98.8s)]
*  and condom shipments. No condoms went to any part of the Middle East. There was just one small [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=106.96s)]
*  shipment of oral and injectable contraceptives sent to Jordan worth about $46,000 or less. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=112.96s)]
*  In fact, only $7 million worth of condoms were distributed globally by USAID, and 89% of family [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  planning funds went to Africa. It's also pointed out that Trump's administration spent millions [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=128.95999999999998s)]
*  sending contraceptives across the globe. Now, I mean, this whole thing is just so crazy and [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=135.92s)]
*  ridiculous, isn't it? It's just where to begin, where to begin. There was a useful lesson though [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=142.48s)]
*  into the plight of Gaza itself, because as the brilliant Palestinian analyst Mohamed Shahada [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=147.44s)]
*  points out, Israel bans condoms, full stop, for being able to enter Gaza in the first place. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  And guess what he notes are also banned. Crutches for disabled people, seeded fruit, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=159.44s)]
*  oxygen cylinders, water filtration systems, sleeping bags, cancer treatment, maternity kits. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  Before the 7th of October, Gaza was already under siege. In fact, the longest siege of our time. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=174.88000000000002s)]
*  After 7th of October, the likes of Yoav Galant, then Defense Secretary, declared that the civilian [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=181.68s)]
*  population of Gaza were human animals, and they would have the basics of life cut off. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=187.04s)]
*  The Israeli state made good on that promise, as well as doing all it could to stop the means of [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=192.32s)]
*  existence from getting in and making it as difficult as possible for aid that did get in to be distributed [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=197.6s)]
*  to those who needed it. Israel did all it could to destroy agriculture and local food production. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=203.28s)]
*  So aid banned from getting in, and the ability of Gaza to sustain life within destroyed as well. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=210.88000000000002s)]
*  The idea that 50 million dollars worth of condoms were ever going to get to Gaza is a lie, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=218.8s)]
*  and a deranged, unhinged lie at that. Why lie about something like this? It does make me think of [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=225.28s)]
*  Steve Bannon, of course the former key strategist of Donald Trump, who once told the writer Michael [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=230.8s)]
*  Lewis in 2018, the Democrats don't matter. The real opposition is the media, and the way to deal [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=236.72s)]
*  with them is to flood the zone with shit. The author Jonathan Rauch cited this quote when he said, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=244.4s)]
*  this is not about persuasion, this is about disorientation. And some might go on the back [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=252.32s)]
*  of that, by even responding to these lies, you're just allowing yourself to be distracted by shit. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=257.92s)]
*  Stay focused on the real issues. Well, other than a useful hock to emphasise how Gaza is [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=263.28s)]
*  being besieged, while I have your attention, okay sure. Let's use this moment for something else. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=269.03999999999996s)]
*  One year ago, a Palestinian family tried to flee Gaza City for safety as Israeli forces closed in. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=276.55999999999995s)]
*  In their car were four kids and two adults. Now almost all of them were slaughtered by the Israeli [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=286.88s)]
*  army as they tried to flee. One of the two survivors, 15 year old Leila, rang the Palestine [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=294.56s)]
*  Red Crescent, begging for help. You heard her shot to death while she was on the call. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=300.4s)]
*  All that remained, surrounded by the bloodied corpses of her family, was five year old little [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=305.44s)]
*  girl Hind Rajab, herself bleeding to death from her wounds. A terrified Hind then rang the Red [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=310.4s)]
*  Crescent, begging for help. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=318.32s)]
*  Where are you now? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=340.4s)]
*  In the car. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=342.4s)]
*  Inside the car, right? Not outside the car. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=344.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=348.4s)]
*  Stay in the car, I'm going to open the door and talk to you. I don't want to turn off the phone, okay? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=350.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=358.4s)]
*  The door is locked. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=360.4s)]
*  Where is the door? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=362.4s)]
*  Locked. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=364.4s)]
*  Two paramedics were sent to save her. Their movements were coordinated with the Israeli army. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=366.4s)]
*  As they arrived, the Israeli army blew them up. Almost nothing remained of their corpses. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=372.4s)]
*  Days later, the decomposing bodies of Hind and her family were found in that car. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=378.4s)]
*  Now crucially, an investigation by Forensic Architecture, a team of experts, who've been doing a huge amount of work, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=386.4s)]
*  looking at the actual facts of what's happened to Gaza, they revealed the truth. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=395.4s)]
*  That the tank was 13 to 23 meters away when it opened fire on that car. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=399.4s)]
*  A car full of four terrified little children and their two guardians. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=406.4s)]
*  That there were at least 335 bullet holes observable on the body of that car. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=412.4s)]
*  This was in broad daylight. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=419.4s)]
*  The idea that one of the most sophisticated militaries on earth did not know who was in that car before they opened fire on them is a nonsense. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=422.4s)]
*  A clear, obvious, insulting nonsense. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=435.4s)]
*  This family, this family amongst so many other families, this family was deliberately killed. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=439.4s)]
*  And this one hideous incident underlines the horror of Israel's genocidal onslaught against Gaza. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=445.4s)]
*  Now Israel's defenders, yes, they want us to be distracted with deranged nonsense. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=454.4s)]
*  Well, whatever lies they come up with, we'll use as an opportunity to tell the truth. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=459.4s)]
*  The full depraved truth about one of the great horrors of our age and the moral bankruptcy of its defenders. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=464.4s)]
*  One year on, we must never forget Hin Rajab. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=471.4s)]
*  She epitomizes what has happened to the people of Gaza. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=475.4s)]
*  A giggling, happy, smiley little five-year-old girl, just like any other five-year-old, who just wanted a happy life with so much ahead of her. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=480.4s)]
*  Butchered in the most horrifying circumstances deliberately by an Israeli military armed to the teeth by Western governments. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=492.4s)]
*  And I would note that investigation into Hin Rajab was barely covered at all in the entire Western media. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=502.4s)]
*  Why? And again, it's not a... [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=510.4s)]
*  It's not something we should indulge too often, let's put it that way. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=515.4s)]
*  That we should have to indulge the fact that Palestinian life is simply not treated as having any worth. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=520.4s)]
*  But of course, imagine. Imagine that had been an Israeli family. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=525.4s)]
*  And they'd been slaughtered in those circumstances by Palestinian militants. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=531.4s)]
*  And we had a five-year-old Israeli girl begging the hospital to come and help her, the paramedics to come and help her, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=535.4s)]
*  ringing the emergency services, and those paramedics were then slaughtered as they came to rescue her. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=542.4s)]
*  That would be seen as testament to the utter barbarism of those Palestinian militants. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=548.4s)]
*  But one year on, Hin Rajab, largely ignored by the Western media, by Western politicians, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=555.4s)]
*  and instead we are having to listen to unhinged nonsense and lies about condoms being sent to Gaza. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=563.4s)]
*  Well, the truth is the truth and we'll keep speaking the truth. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=573.4s)]
*  Please like and subscribe if you've thought your comments, which is good for the algorithm, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=577.4s)]
*  so more people listen to the truth rather than these lies to help us expand the operation at patreon.com [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=581.4s)]
*  So we can offer an alternative to this burning skip that is the Western media. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=587.4s)]
*  Listen to the podcast, I'll speak to you soon. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByKRymfiso&t=594.4s)]
