# Israel Declares: Ordinary Iranians “WILL PAY THE PRICE”
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04)
*  Israel is at war with the people of Iran. That's not an exaggeration. This isn't hyperbole. It's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=0.0s)]
*  not my spin on what Israel is doing. It's the literal official position of Israel. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=5.2s)]
*  As you'll know, Israel launched an unprovoked attack on Iran last week, justified on the basis [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  that Iran wasn't far away from getting a nuclear bomb, a claim that has literally been made now [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=14.16s)]
*  almost since the Iranian revolution itself in 1979. And at the very time when progress has [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=19.2s)]
*  been made with negotiations between Iran and the US on a nuclear deal, we'll discuss that [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  further. Indeed, we know as a fact that Israel itself actually does have nuclear weapons. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=29.84s)]
*  Iran doesn't have nuclear weapons. Nobody thinks or claims Israel now has any nuclear weapons. Iran [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=35.12s)]
*  is a signatory to the non-proliferation treaty. Israel is not. And Israel is a nuclear armed state [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=40.16s)]
*  which has not only committed genocide in Gaza, not only committed a massive pogrom in the West [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=45.84s)]
*  Bank, not only raised much of southern Lebanon to the ground, it's also invaded Syria. Its government [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=50.56s)]
*  ministers openly talk about creating a greater Israel which annexes parts of Lebanon and Syria. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=55.6s)]
*  It is clearly an aggressive expansionistic, militaristic, genocidal state with nuclear [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=61.44s)]
*  weapons. The term gaslighting doesn't even begin to cover this. Israel's onslaught is completely [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=67.04s)]
*  illegal. It violates the UN Charter, which prohibits any attack on the grounds of an alleged [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  future threat. That is not self-defence. At least 200 civilians have been killed in Iran [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=76.8s)]
*  during Israel's attack. We'll discuss some of those hideous details. Now some of the commentary [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=82.0s)]
*  has focused on how this is somehow for the good of the people of Iran. This could liberate them. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=86.08s)]
*  Well, let's just read this candid treat, shall we, from Israel Katz, the Defense Minister of Israel, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=91.04s)]
*  who says the following, the arrogant dictator from Tehran has become a cowardly murderer who fires [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=95.12s)]
*  targeted shots at the civilian home front in Israel. The front of these people. We'll talk about that. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=100.8s)]
*  To deter the IDF from continuing the attack that is collapsing its capabilities, the residents of [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=105.68s)]
*  Tehran will pay the price. And soon. No room for ambiguity here whatsoever. The Israeli Defense [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=110.48s)]
*  Minister has declared that the civilians of Iran's capital are targets. They will be killed and maimed [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=117.12s)]
*  by the Israeli military. In practice, that's obviously what that means. That is an open confession [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=121.76s)]
*  of war crimes. Once again, as in Gaza and in Lebanon, the Israeli state is not even trying to [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=126.80000000000001s)]
*  disguise its criminal intentions. If that's not enough for you, there is more. He said, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=131.52s)]
*  The fate of Tehran will be like the fate of Beirut. Israel, of course, has inflicted massive [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=136.4s)]
*  destruction in Beirut, slaughtered huge numbers of civilians in multiple attacks. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=140.23999999999998s)]
*  This refers to something called the Dahir Doctrine, named after an area in the southern suburb of [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=145.12s)]
*  Beirut where the Hezbollah militia was particularly powerful. Let me read what Paul Rogers, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=149.68s)]
*  emeritus professor of peace studies, wrote about this in 2023. This was the deliberate application [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=154.56s)]
*  of disproportionate force, such as the destruction of an entire village deemed to be the source of [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  rocket fire. One graphic description of the result was that around a thousand Lebanese [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=163.6s)]
*  civilians were killed, a third of them children. Towns and villages were reduced to rubble, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=167.44s)]
*  bridges, sewage, treatment plants, port facilities and electric power plants were crippled or [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=170.96s)]
*  destroyed. In other words, you deliberately inflict large scale destruction of civilian [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  infrastructure with the intention of hurting civilians as an intentional strategy in an attempt [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=179.12s)]
*  to turn civilians against the militia or administration in question. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=184.88s)]
*  Now, using violence against civilians in order to achieve political ends, we've got a name for that [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=191.6s)]
*  in the English language, it's called terrorism. Yet the term terrorism is politicised so it is [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  only applied to militants or regimes deemed hostile to Western interests so that Western violence, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=199.2s)]
*  even though it's much greater, is deemed legitimate and moral. Indeed, the Israeli regime [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=203.67999999999998s)]
*  is trying to depopulate the Iranian capital. Let's listen to this from Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=208.56s)]
*  the Israeli prime minister, who is subject to an arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=213.27999999999997s)]
*  Ignore his nonsense claims about not targeting the population. I mean, this is classic Israeli [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=218.48s)]
*  strategy. To their own people, when speaking in Hebrew, they openly declare as we've seen they're [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=245.28s)]
*  at war with civilians. Then when they appear on Western media outlets, they claim they have no [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=249.12s)]
*  quarrel with civilians, merely the regime. Western media outlets then ignore the public statements [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=252.72s)]
*  of criminal intent made to the Israeli population by Israeli leaders and officials, as though these [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=256.8s)]
*  statements are being issued in some sort of parallel universe. They then treat these Israeli [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=261.44s)]
*  statements, which are solely issued as propaganda for Western audiences, and to relieve pressure [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=266.96s)]
*  Israel's Western allied governments as Israel's actual position. In any case, what Netanyahu is [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=271.04s)]
*  saying here is Israel is seeking to drive out the civilian population of Tehran. Speaking of [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=275.68s)]
*  carbons, Israel is detonating carbons in Tehran. Just imagine Iran was detonating carbons in [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=279.76000000000005s)]
*  Tel Aviv or New York or London. Can you imagine it? It would be portrayed as absolutely obscene [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=297.20000000000005s)]
*  terrorism. Yet no outrage whatsoever when Israel does it. Yes, of course, Western power has always [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=300.8s)]
*  treated international law as something to opt in and out of as it sees fit, weaponizing it against [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=305.44s)]
*  its enemies when it so wishes. But the way any semblance of international order is being shredded [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=309.36s)]
*  will of course only lead to blood and chaos. Israel is killing nuclear scientists, some of them alongside [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=313.44s)]
*  their wives and their children. Let's hear this report from Al Jazeera. Start with the toll and [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=318.96000000000004s)]
*  the foreign ministry saying 70 women and children are among those killed by Israel. What sort of [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=324.56s)]
*  impact is that having on the Iranian mood? Extensive impact, I would say. We've seen a lot of [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=333.20000000000005s)]
*  actually civilian casualties as a result of this recent strikes. In one of the cases, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=342.48s)]
*  the IRBDSATV reported that at least 20 children were killed as a result of one of these [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=348.40000000000003s)]
*  strikes on one of the buildings. And also we were at the scene of one of an other building [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=354.56s)]
*  in which Iranian top nuclear scientist Dr. Taranchi was killed. And there we saw that not only his [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=361.44s)]
*  family, but a lot of other people, university professors, were killed. And time and again, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=367.28s)]
*  reports are coming out about the attacks on the civilian targets. And now we've got Israeli [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=373.28s)]
*  officials saying that they're sending messages of warning that people, ordinary people in the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=379.84s)]
*  capital are not going to be safe. And this indicates that this is initially said to be limited to [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=385.52s)]
*  nuclear sites or military facilities, but now it moves on towards a non-prestented dangerous [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=394.15999999999997s)]
*  level that draws the risk of further escalations, further casualties for civilians. But speaking of [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=401.28s)]
*  the latest development, as you mentioned last night, it was the head of public relations of [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=408.08s)]
*  health ministry coming out on his ex-account, putting the death toll on 224. But right now, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=413.68s)]
*  a few hours ago, we've got reports from Zanjan and Qom. In each of which we've got at least two [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=420.56s)]
*  people killed. So right now we can say at least 228 people have been killed. And with hundreds more [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=426.96s)]
*  being injured, it doesn't seem like a good situation for ordinary citizens. Aside from [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=435.6s)]
*  Israel's own official statements, if you want evidence that this is not about liberating the [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=441.6s)]
*  Iranian people, as some of Israel's jeeps are claiming, let's listen to our actual Iranian [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=445.28000000000003s)]
*  opponents of the Islamic Republic. Like the Iranian writer Saha Delijani, who posts on Instagram, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=449.28000000000003s)]
*  I was born in an Iranian prison. My parents were held in their jails. My uncles lie in their [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=455.76000000000005s)]
*  masquerades. Nothing you can tell me about the crimes of the Iranian regime that I haven't lived [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=459.84000000000003s)]
*  in blood and bone. That doesn't mean I want my people bombed, maimed, killed, or homes in ruins. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=463.52s)]
*  If your vision of liberation comes only through the destruction of innocent lives, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=467.91999999999996s)]
*  then it's not freedom you're after. As the analyst Artin Mioni, who was raised in Tehran, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=471.28s)]
*  puts it, in no universe is Netanyahu Iran's liberator. Many Iranians are disgruntled and [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=475.68s)]
*  dismayed with the Islamic Republic, but they stand united behind Iran in its sovereignty and [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=480.79999999999995s)]
*  territorial integrity. The Israeli government has severely miscalculated and misunderstood [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=485.2s)]
*  the Persian psyche. Iran experts Sinav Tuzi, senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=490.32s)]
*  agrees saying, 100% right now Iran is seeing a textbook rally around the flag effect, signs of [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=496.56s)]
*  national solidarity across its political and social spectrum, from secular to religious, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=501.44s)]
*  pro-democracy activists to prominent opposition leaders, a national spirit that echoes the 1980s. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=506.0s)]
*  Israel, meanwhile, has come under attack from Iran after Israel attacked Iran. Just be clear about [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=511.76s)]
*  this. This is from former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and it's classic gaslighting. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=518.24s)]
*  What a joke. Israel bombed the Iranian embassy last year and then assassinated Hamas leader Ismail [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=532.5600000000001s)]
*  Haniyeh in Tehran. The fact they didn't claim credit for it is besides the point. They did it [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=536.72s)]
*  and we all know it and they know it. Now around 13 civilians are reported killed in Israel by [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=540.88s)]
*  Iranian attacks and you know what? We can say, people can say, let's get the law out, rights of [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=545.52s)]
*  self-defence enshrined in international law. You can say that and indeed far fewer civilians have [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=550.96s)]
*  been killed than in Iran. But I oppose any attacks which kill civilians. And every state has a [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=555.28s)]
*  responsibility to do all it can to avoid killing civilians in all circumstances. Every human life [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=559.1999999999999s)]
*  is precious. Every person is a whole universe. I won this war which Israel started to end with peace [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=563.68s)]
*  based on negotiations and justice. That's because I'm not a fucking maniac. Yet the response from [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=569.76s)]
*  Israel's officials to crying the killing of civilians is frankly just something else. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=574.16s)]
*  Listen to this from the Israeli police spokesperson. This is the result of the latest barrage of rockets [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=577.92s)]
*  fired at our residential communities by Iran. It's continuing the pattern as we're seeing each and [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=583.04s)]
*  every one of these scenes are targeting residential communities, civilians in their homes. I don't know [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=588.56s)]
*  what else to say here other than fucking hell. I don't actually swear that often given the [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=595.04s)]
*  gravity of the situation of the last two years, but Jesus, honestly. The Israeli-British [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=599.76s)]
*  propagandist, Ilan Levy, former spokesperson for the war criminal Benjamin Netanyahu before he was [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=604.24s)]
*  sacked, is posting multiple tweets declaring, the Iranian regime is deliberately attacking Israeli [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=609.28s)]
*  civilians. Iran is deliberately targeting civilians with massive missile barrages. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=613.76s)]
*  Ayatollah Khamenei should think twice before continuing his indiscriminate ballistic missile [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=618.3199999999999s)]
*  attacks against Israeli civilians. The Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, says, last night Iran [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=622.72s)]
*  again unleashed a wave of missiles on Israel with one goal to kill children asleep in their beds, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=627.68s)]
*  grandparents, Holocaust survivors, a beautiful Muslim family in Tamra, Jews and Muslims, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=633.04s)]
*  Israelis and Palestinians, evil, pure and deliberate. We mourn brothers and sisters [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=637.3599999999999s)]
*  torn from us. Israel is fighting to eliminate a threat. Tehran is fighting to spread war, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=640.7199999999999s)]
*  hatred, chaos, terror, fanaticism. This is the ideology and the world must stand with [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=645.5999999999999s)]
*  Israel for the sake of humanity. Are they doing this in order to provoke? The whole world has [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=650.3199999999999s)]
*  watched as Israel has wiped Gaza from the face of the earth, destroyed most of its homes, most of [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=654.56s)]
*  its hospitals, most of its schools, most of its mosques, libraries, universities, agriculture, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=658.64s)]
*  livestock, everything is apocalyptic, as apocalyptic as it's possible to get pretty much. This grotesque, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=662.3199999999999s)]
*  these grotesque human beings, they were one day rot in prison cells, I've got no doubt about that, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=668.64s)]
*  but the goal, the fun of them is something else. And then there's this, a truly vile pro-Israel [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=673.1999999999999s)]
*  propagandist, Dr. Eli David, posts a video produced by Iran which claims that Israel is storing F-35 [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=677.5999999999999s)]
*  planes in residential towers. He says, Iran attacked a residential building complex in Tel Aviv, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=684.0s)]
*  after cheering the attack on civilians, they shifted narrative and released this video claiming [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=707.6s)]
*  that Israel stores F-35 planes in residential towers. It looks like those in charge of the [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=711.76s)]
*  propaganda are dead too. These are replicas of the sorts of videos Israel has repeatedly released, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=715.84s)]
*  for example, falsely claiming Hamas's headquarters were located under Al-Shifa hospital. That was [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=720.96s)]
*  then used to justify destroying the entire healthcare system of Gaza. As a brilliant [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=725.76s)]
*  academic Alonzo Gimendi writes, it's so baffling how they don't realise they are being mocked. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=730.56s)]
*  So [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=741.76s)]
*  rather than any imminent threat from Iran, Israel launched this war in order to destroy any chance [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=748.56s)]
*  of a negotiated settlement with the US. Progress was reported in talks. Let's listen to CNN and [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=752.48s)]
*  veteran journalist Christiane Amanpour being interviewed on the BBC. There was a moment of [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=758.16s)]
*  actual successful diplomacy which culminated in the JCPOA in 2015. In other words, the nuclear [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=762.96s)]
*  deal that was enshrined at the UN, Iran was declared totally in compliance of its responsibilities, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=769.12s)]
*  even though the West did not lift all the sanctions as it should have done. What happened then? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=775.52s)]
*  President Trump decided under pressure from Bibi Netanyahu, who has never wanted these deals ever, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=780.64s)]
*  he has always wanted to destroy Iran's capability, right? Under pressure from Netanyahu and then [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=786.32s)]
*  MBS, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, he pulled out thinking he could do a better deal. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=792.48s)]
*  He couldn't. He achieved nothing except Iran enriching to a higher degree. So Iran now has [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=797.52s)]
*  approximately 400 kilograms of enriched uranium to 60 percent. That is almost a breakout. It can [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=804.64s)]
*  easily go to 90 percent if it wants to, and that's eight bombs. So people are very concerned, but [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=813.1999999999999s)]
*  there were these talks going on, and my reporting suggests that far from they didn't want to go to [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=818.56s)]
*  a deal, Iran was really wanting to go to a new deal. And just before these attacks, I heard that [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=824.24s)]
*  the head of the negotiation and the delegation was feeling optimistic about this round of talks. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=831.12s)]
*  The Iranian delegation? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=838.32s)]
*  Yes, the Iranian delegation. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=839.28s)]
*  Meanwhile, the British government, which continues to arm and support Israel as it commits genocide [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=840.8s)]
*  in Gaza, has moved jets and all the military hardware to the Middle East. British Prime Minister [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=844.4s)]
*  Keir Starmer says, I will always make the right decision for the UK. We are moving assets to the [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=848.32s)]
*  region, including jets, and that is for contingency support in the region. The polling in [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=852.08s)]
*  Britain couldn't be clearer. Nineteen percent say the UK should back Israel. Five percent say Iran. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=856.88s)]
*  Seventy five percent say neither or unsure. Younger Britain's just eight percent say Israel. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=861.44s)]
*  Fifteen percent Iran. Seventy seven percent say neither or unsure. No appetite for involvement [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=866.64s)]
*  in Israel's latest criminal enterprise. One final thing. Western media outlets are openly saying this [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=871.6s)]
*  has stopped pressure on Israel over its genocide in Gaza. The slaughter in Gaza has reportedly [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=876.5600000000001s)]
*  escalated, not least with repeated massacres of desperately hungry Palestinians trying to get [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=880.56s)]
*  food. The headline of the Guardian is Strikes on Iran Ease Pressure on Israel to End Starvation [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=884.8s)]
*  in Gaza. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has declared she's spoken [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=889.92s)]
*  to Netanyahu saying Israel has the right to defend itself, that Iran is the main source of [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=895.52s)]
*  regional instability, and then what she calls the humanitarian situation in Gaza is added as some [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=899.92s)]
*  afterthought. We must not forget Gaza. The genocide has not ended, only escalated. What were [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=904.64s)]
*  witnessing here, I'm afraid, is the world being plunged into violent barbarism by the West. Those [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=910.32s)]
*  who smear opponents of obscene war crimes and mass murder as stooges of the Iranian regime, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=915.6s)]
*  as they smeared us as stooges of Saddam Hussein, Colonel Qadhafi and the Taliban in the previous [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=920.1600000000001s)]

*  we were vindicated in the worst possible way. Those people are cheerleaders of plunging the world [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=928.72s)]
*  into chaos and barbarism. A fight against these maniacs is existential. It's about the future of [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=933.84s)]
*  human civilisation as we know it. If they win, if we lose, there is no future. Not a future that's [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh9-UA3OT04&t=938.64s)]
