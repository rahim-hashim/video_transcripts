# "Peace Now": Israeli Whose Parents Were Killed On 7th October - Interview w/ Maoz Inon
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw)
*  Hello, I'm particularly delighted today to be joined by Matos Inon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=0.0s)]
*  He is an award-winning Israeli social entrepreneur. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=3.12s)]
*  He's also a peace activist. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=7.32s)]
*  But Matos speaks from a very particular vantage point because during the horrors [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=9.48s)]
*  of October 7th, both of his wonderful parents were killed. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=14.8s)]
*  But he's now speaking out for peace. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=21.04s)]

*  And it's a huge honor to be able to speak to you. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=35.12s)]
*  Yeah. So, Owen, really thanks for inviting me. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=38.8s)]
*  We've been following each other on social media for quite a few weeks or months, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=42.76s)]
*  but since October 7th. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=48.44s)]
*  And I think this, our dialogue on conversation so far contributed a lot to me [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=50.84s)]
*  and during your perspective and your voice. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=58.88s)]
*  And I'm thankful for you for letting me sharing my voice with you and with your audience. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=61.68s)]
*  So thanks. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=69.88s)]
*  Well, it's the least I can do, to be honest. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=70.72s)]
*  Firstly, if it's okay, could you tell me a bit about your parents? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=73.72s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=76.76s)]
*  My parents, Yaacoby and Bila, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=78.04s)]
*  they were both been born in a kibbutzim in the Negev, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=82.36s)]
*  not too far from Gaza, not too far from each other, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=87.2s)]
*  Kibbutz-Niram and Kibbutz-Ukama. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=90.0s)]
*  They're both parents, my grandparents immigrate to Palestine under the British mandatory, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=92.2s)]
*  as Zionist pioneers, founding those two kibbutzim, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=99.44s)]
*  where my parents got married, they moved to live in Niram. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=105.4s)]
*  My father kibbutz about a kilometer and a half, two kilometers from the Gaza border, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=109.44s)]
*  where they raised my three sisters, my brother and myself. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=115.36s)]
*  At the age of 14, we moved to Netiva Asara, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=119.24s)]
*  which is the closest Israeli community to the Gaza border on the north side. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=122.64s)]
*  My father was a farmer and agronomist consultant, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=128.72s)]
*  even though he was 78, he was working full time, traveling from north to south. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=133.76000000000002s)]
*  He was probably number one expert in Israel in terms of wheat, corn, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=139.08s)]
*  sunflower, watermelon, chickpeas and other crops. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=147.76000000000002s)]
*  He was very active, practicing Pilates, walking five kilometers a day. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  And my mom was an artist and also educator. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=159.92s)]
*  And she educated how to educate for kindergarten staff [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=166.56s)]
*  and a primary school teacher, education by art. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=177.68s)]
*  And she was very talented. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  And in the last 10, 12 years, she was painting mandala, like circus. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=183.95999999999998s)]
*  It was in circus. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=191.23999999999998s)]
*  And she was very active and painting a lot. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=192.92s)]
*  And she had a group of children, youth, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=197.0s)]
*  elder adults and elderly that came to study with her mandala. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=201.72s)]
*  And she was also very active, practicing yoga, swimming for an hour every day. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=208.16s)]
*  They were both loving and supporting parents for my sister, my brother and myself, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=214.23999999999998s)]
*  and very involved grandparents. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=220.39999999999998s)]
*  They had 11 grandchildren from the age of 19 till the age of one year. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=223.16s)]
*  Eight are living in Israel, three living in London with my brother. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=228.32s)]
*  And we miss them a lot. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=234.48s)]
*  We just miss them a lot. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=236.72s)]
*  And also, we said it was a huge trauma, obviously, for people in Israel and beyond. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=238.64000000000001s)]
*  But obviously, particularly a key trauma for yourself, losing two parents in those [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=244.20000000000002s)]
*  circumstances is something most people find hard to imagine. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=248.24s)]
*  And you get it's not hard. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=253.0s)]
*  I tell you now, after being through it, you cannot imagine it's something that is [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=255.16000000000003s)]
*  behind imagination. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=260.52s)]
*  You can't imagine anything like this happening to you or to anyone you know. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=263.08s)]
*  And after it, you cannot imagine or know how you will react. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=268.88s)]
*  You cannot be prepared. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=276.08s)]
*  You cannot be prepared to such a tragedy. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=277.96s)]
*  I mean, only tell us what you're comfortable with, but can you tell us how you found out [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=282.0s)]
*  and what your response was? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=286.03999999999996s)]
*  And yeah, I was I woke up in the room. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=290.0s)]
*  We are speaking from my bedroom in Benyamina, the house that I share with my wish to [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=294.96s)]
*  meet my wife and partner for the last 28 years and with our three children, the boys, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=300.64s)]
*  Liad and Dore, 18 and 16, and our daughter Eden. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=307.64s)]
*  Waking up Saturday morning, I saw the WhatsApp group in the family WhatsApp group that [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=311.52s)]
*  my dad sent that there are sirens, alarms, shooting missiles, and they lock the house [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=318.08000000000004s)]
*  and they are in the safe room. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=326.68s)]
*  And it was 730 when I saw it, crazy as it might sound, it's normal. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=330.52000000000004s)]
*  Every few months there is another clash between Israel and Gaza. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=336.48s)]
*  So I said, OK, it's another of those mornings. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=342.6s)]
*  So I went down to make coffee for my wife and for myself. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=346.84000000000003s)]
*  And while making coffee, I watch on the news that there are there is a Hamas invasion to [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=350.96000000000004s)]
*  the Israeli communities. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=357.48s)]
*  This is something that I know I don't remember and it's not normal. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=360.0s)]
*  So I called my dad at 740 and he told me exactly what he wrote on the WhatsApp group. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=363.52000000000004s)]
*  And I could hear my mom in the background. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=370.56s)]
*  So I told my dad, send my love to mom and my love to you and we'll be safe. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=372.8s)]
*  Stay safe. Let's talk again soon. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=379.56s)]
*  Keep watching the news. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=382.48s)]
*  And with the Hamas Toyota car trucks in the road and the wall is being fallen and Hamas [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=384.12s)]
*  entering the communities. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=394.52s)]
*  I called my dad again just five minutes after and 745. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=397.0s)]
*  But this time there was no answer. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=401.91999999999996s)]
*  So I called my sisters, my brother who lives in London. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=405.64s)]
*  We tried to reach them. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=408.79999999999995s)]
*  We hope that it's a electricity breakdown or cellular network that went down. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=410.56s)]
*  We tried to contact their neighbors and we said it's better that we'll be together. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=418.47999999999996s)]
*  So we group at my sister house, which is not far from Benyaminah, where I'm speaking from now. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=425.44s)]
*  And we group and we're on the phone with my brother in London all the time, still trying to [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=433.28s)]
*  reach everyone. And at about 530 in the afternoon, the security officer of the Tiva Sarah, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=439.52s)]
*  my parents community talked to my brother in law and he told us that he found my parents' house [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=449.32s)]
*  burnt to ashes with two bodies inside. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=457.32s)]
*  It's very, very difficult to know even what to say. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=462.68s)]
*  I mean, the horror that you and your family went through that day is something, as I said, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=465.48s)]
*  I think most people feel huge empathy and love and solidarity, but it's difficult to imagine [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=472.68s)]
*  what that was actually like for you. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=479.96s)]
*  And also with 18 other members of the community, brothers, families that were murdered, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=484.03999999999996s)]
*  and many of my primary school, high school friends that are still living in the area, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=493.48s)]
*  in Farazah, in Be'eri, that were also among the victims or their parents or their children [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=500.6s)]
*  or they were kidnapped. So it's not just a family personal or family trilogy, it's a [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=507.56s)]
*  community trilogy. So it was devastating. And we've decided we're going to start the [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=515.8000000000001s)]
*  Jewish way of mourning that for seven days you are mourning your dead. And again, my brother came [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=522.76s)]
*  Sunday morning, so we were the five brothers and sisters with the eight grown-up grandchildren, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=533.5600000000001s)]
*  thousands of friends, family of my parents, of us that came to pay their condolences. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=540.84s)]
*  It was very intensive, including survivors from those communities, including other [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=547.88s)]
*  friends that lost family members. On October the 7th, it was very, very intense. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=555.9599999999999s)]
*  And every morning we open in a gathering, just the children, and at the evening we're doing [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=563.8s)]
*  a gathering with the grandchildren. And I think it was the first or second morning that we said [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=571.0s)]
*  we want our trilogy to have a political message. It's not just about us, we must make a political [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=577.88s)]
*  message and create a political agenda from our trilogy. And the first message we wanted to [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=589.16s)]
*  share or to amplify is that we are not calling for revenge. We are not calling for revenge, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=596.44s)]
*  we are not seeking revenge, and we are calling for reconciliation. And from that we kept talking [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=609.8000000000001s)]
*  and talking and we have been agreeing on most of the messages we are sending as a family, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=618.84s)]
*  some not, but the general message of the non-family is that revenge is not the answer. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=628.6s)]
*  On that point you made about the R word, I suppose, revenge, there are many people [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=639.08s)]
*  listening or watching this who may be very passionately opposed to the horrors [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=644.84s)]
*  now currently taking place, but they might listen and think, you know what, if two of my parents [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=649.0s)]
*  were killed in that manner, I might seek revenge. We don't know all of us quite how we'd respond in [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=653.32s)]
*  those circumstances. And there were many people, of course, in Israel who didn't lose both their [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=658.9200000000001s)]
*  parents who did call for revenge. So I'm just wondering, what was it about you and other of [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=664.12s)]
*  your loved ones, what do you think it was that made you come to that different conclusion? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=671.48s)]
*  Because that, in the current atmosphere, is actually something which distinguishes you [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=675.96s)]
*  from many, many people who, as I've said, may have lost people, but many people who didn't [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=680.6800000000001s)]
*  even lose people or people maybe as close to them as losing two parents certainly. So how would you [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=684.52s)]
*  explain that? What was the reason for how you got to that point? It's starting with the way we were [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=691.0s)]
*  raised, that my parents educated us to judge each and every person by his action, not by his religion, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=698.52s)]
*  race, color, if he's rich or poor or his occupation. Judge anyone by his action. So this is something [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=707.72s)]
*  very, very fundamental in the way we are thinking. And also my father was a very realistic person. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=718.1999999999999s)]
*  So what will be the outcome of the revenge? So if we will revenge and we'll kill [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=725.96s)]
*  an innocent parent in Gaza, so their children would want to revenge in return. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=733.5600000000001s)]
*  So this cycle of revenge has been going on for over a century and we are calling to stop this [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=741.0s)]
*  cycle. We are calling to stop the bloodshed. We are calling to choose humanity and hope [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=748.52s)]
*  and not which side has more victims, which side started it, and which side is to blame. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=755.88s)]
*  And those messages and through talking between ourselves and between others, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=766.36s)]
*  we are making, I'm making this message more accurate as the days goes and the weeks pass [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=772.44s)]
*  and the months more and more accurate. And what I can tell you is that I'm not alone. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=780.36s)]
*  There are so many, so many Israelis and Palestinians that are calling to stop the revenge, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=788.6800000000001s)]
*  to stop the revenge, to stop the cycle that are calling for reconciliation. Some organization, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=796.36s)]
*  like combated for peace, like the family circle, like breaking the silence, has been doing it for [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=802.36s)]
*  decades. So it's not just something that I definitely not, I started or in October the 7th. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=809.24s)]
*  And those organizations are doing an amazing job in building trust and in building bridges [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=816.12s)]
*  and reconciliation. So the least we can do, and now I'm also involved, and unfortunately and [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=824.68s)]
*  tragedy, we can just support those individuals and organizations that are calling for reconciliation. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=835.3199999999999s)]
*  You know, I mean, in the last few weeks, I've been blown away by interviewing some of the [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=845.0799999999999s)]
*  Israelis who are talking about actually breaking the silence, former IDF soldier who fought in [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=851.0s)]
*  Gaza in 2014, IDF, Avra Fuznik, a brilliant young woman, but also standing together, which brings [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=854.92s)]
*  together, of course, Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel and so many, you know, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=862.68s)]
*  Betsalem, a human rights organization. I mean, what I'm wondering about, you know, sometimes [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=869.0s)]
*  this, you know, as you get older, you realize how cliches, what you think are cliches, why there's [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=873.24s)]
*  more wisdom sometimes than maybe you think. But you know, it's that cliche, if we're caught, we [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=878.6s)]
*  bleed the same way. But, you know, when we understand many of the horrors which are committed, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=882.9200000000001s)]
*  that what should be a basic way of looking at humanity breaks down, doesn't it? People stop [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=888.28s)]
*  seeing each other as human beings. They stop seeing. So many were killed, obviously, in [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=893.8000000000001s)]
*  September of October, and so many, many more have died. Oh, and I have a present. I have a present. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=897.8000000000001s)]
*  Oh, that made me a sushi for lunch. Oh, please. Yes. Oh, look at that. Delicious. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=902.6800000000001s)]
*  Hello. Hello, by the way. Very nice to meet you. Oh, sushi. I was actually going to have [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=910.2s)]
*  sushi myself. So obviously both sushi and fishnado. That looks particularly delicious, I have to say. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=916.44s)]
*  It is. Hopefully sustenance as well for the interview. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=923.96s)]
*  Hello, what's your daughter called, if you don't mind me asking? My daughter's name is Eden, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=930.6s)]
*  like the Garden of Eden. Oh, very nice. And you've got three, three children. Three, Liyad, Dor, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=935.88s)]
*  and Eden. And how old are they all? 18, 16, and 12. Oh, nice. I remember being good. Well, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=941.96s)]
*  I'm not going to ask, but I just remember being a somewhat grumpy teenager occasionally. But [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=949.32s)]
*  maybe you have a different approach in your family. I don't know. That point about humanity, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=955.88s)]
*  and I'm sure we'll get to this point at the end, the only way there'll be a lasting peace is an [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=964.36s)]
*  acceptance that this land belongs to both Jews and Palestinians and has to be shared. But [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=967.6400000000001s)]
*  just that point about seeing shared humanity, because that seems to have broken down. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=974.44s)]
*  We see now, as you say, I watched yesterday footage of a group of Palestinians [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=979.96s)]
*  walking, waving white flags in Gaza, and then a woman holding a child's hand, and then she [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=987.64s)]
*  was shot dead. And the child ran away. And I just looked at that and thought, something's broken [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=994.52s)]
*  there. So there's a humanity, hasn't it? That soldier wasn't looking at that person in the way [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1000.2s)]
*  that you look at fellow humans in Gaza. So I'm just wondering how important that is about that [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1006.12s)]
*  humanity, because that's clearly what your parents taught you. I can see that very clearly. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1013.6400000000001s)]
*  Okay. It's very tough and difficult and deep subject. It's not a question that you raised. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1018.44s)]
*  It's, but what brings hope to me is historical events, starting with Mount Sinai event. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1026.68s)]
*  The people of Israel just been fled from Egypt, and Moses is going up the mountain for 40 days, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1043.96s)]
*  and he's meeting God and he's receiving the Ten Commandments. While Moses is up on the mountain, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1057.48s)]
*  the people of Israel, the common people, but also the leadership, are building a calf of gold. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1064.28s)]
*  And also, it's just a few days after God spoke to them, to the people of Israel, and they are [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1071.8s)]
*  building a calf of gold. And they are dancing and worshiping this calf of gold. And this is where [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1077.56s)]
*  we are now. The people are dancing and worshiping the calf of war, of hate, of fear. And it's we, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1082.92s)]
*  just us, Owen and Maoz, and standing together, breaking the silence. There are many, many people [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1095.64s)]
*  that are on the mountain and receiving the Ten Modern Commandments of equality, of justice, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1101.96s)]
*  of security, of solidarity, of you shall not revenge, you shall respect your enemies. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1111.0s)]
*  And now we will need to embark on a shared exodus, a shared exodus of peace. And I think [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1119.16s)]
*  that if we'll be effective, we'll work together, and building coalition and allies for peace, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1133.96s)]
*  this exodus is not going to last 40 years. It will last, it will take us four to six years [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1141.08s)]
*  to reach a peace between the river to the sea. And I'm also, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1148.04s)]
*  as the Shiva, we were mourning, and the first day, when a visit from my, a survivor, from [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1157.64s)]
*  a neighbor of my parents, she came to the first day and the second day. And then on the third day, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1166.76s)]
*  she WhatsApp me, Maoz, it's everything that's happening is too overwhelming. I had to go, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1173.6399999999999s)]
*  to find a safe place to my body and soul. And I'm speaking to you from Berlin now. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1180.04s)]
*  So if a survivor from the Tiva Sarah can find shelter in Berlin, only eight years, 80 years [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1186.12s)]
*  after the Holocaust. So I'm sure we can find a way between Israelis and Palestinians [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1194.5200000000002s)]
*  to overcome, to overcome all the horror and the injustice and the misery we made to each other. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1200.92s)]
*  And if we were doing this talk, at the end of 1945, we can do it in Paris, we can do it in [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1215.32s)]
*  Brussels, in Berlin or in London. And we will speak that in 20 years, 40 years from now, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1224.6799999999998s)]
*  there will be a EU, European Union, that you will be able to cross. There will be no borders, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1231.9599999999998s)]
*  literally. There's going to be only one currency. So we, if people would listen to us, they say, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1239.56s)]
*  those two guys are crazy. They don't know what they're talking about. So it has been done before [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1247.3999999999999s)]
*  reconciliation between nation, between tribes, between people has been done before. And we need [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1254.9199999999998s)]
*  to start doing it now. Every minute that is passing and that the war is still on and the blood [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1262.12s)]
*  and innocent people still losing their life, it's too late. We must start it now. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1276.76s)]
*  I mean, on that, I'm just curious or interested and I'm desperately always looking for hope [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1284.36s)]
*  obviously in this particular nightmare. But in terms of, because you said there are these other [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1291.88s)]
*  voices and as I said, you mentioned breaking the silence for those who don't know that [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1297.8s)]
*  that's former Israeli soldiers who- Yeah, I know very good. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1301.56s)]
*  Not to you, so that's to explain to the audience. So you know, no, no, no, I'm not trying to lecture [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1306.28s)]
*  you on something you know far better than myself. No, no, no, it's just people listening might not, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1311.72s)]
*  they might not know about these organizations. So just for those listening, breaking the silence, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1317.72s)]
*  which you referred to is Israeli soldiers who fought, very courageous. I've interviewed [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1322.1200000000001s)]
*  Ariel Bernstein, who was one of them. But I'm just interested because, you know, like for example, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1328.76s)]
*  yes, I just, we see these clips on Israeli television and one was an Israeli minister, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1333.0s)]
*  the minister of heritage. He's a far right extremist. And he, you know, he was talking about [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1338.6000000000001s)]
*  how he joked about how they were renovating the homes of Gaza. And the presenters just [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1343.4s)]
*  laughed along hysterically, talking about obviously destroying, leveling homes and that was, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1351.4s)]
*  they were joking it was housing renovation. And it was just, you know, quite astonishing to watch [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1359.0s)]
*  the fact that not only would a minister, who's actually a minister say that, and that not be a [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1363.88s)]
*  scandal, but the TV presenters laugh along with it. So I'm just wondering just how many would like [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1367.3200000000002s)]
*  yourself when you speak out, is it hard? I mean, are you facing huge amounts of backlash, pressure, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1372.52s)]
*  anger, that kind of thing? So it's amazing. I will start with the Shiva. Okay, what gave me so much [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1378.44s)]
*  hope? First, for the last 20 years, I've been building bridges, building initiatives, partnership [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1390.04s)]
*  with Israel, with Palestinian, with Israeli ID, with Palestinian in the West Bank, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1396.6s)]
*  with Jordanian and with Egyptian. So I personally, I've been proving that it can be done. You can [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1404.04s)]
*  build partnership between Israelis and Palestinians, between Jews and Arabs. And the amount of [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1410.9199999999998s)]
*  condolence we received from October the 7th till now from Palestinians, from the Arab world, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1416.92s)]
*  from people who never met us, but also from our existing partner was overwhelming. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1426.92s)]
*  And we have done, because it's also for Palestinians within Israel, again, it's a [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1436.6000000000001s)]
*  different topic, but they are being oppressed and unable to speak freely or post freely. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1443.32s)]
*  If a Palestinian with Israeli ID will post that is crime for the children in Gaza, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1456.4399999999998s)]
*  he might be arrested. And they were also afraid to come to pay the condolence. They were afraid. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1462.84s)]
*  So we said we're going to do a wake ceremony in Nazareth, the largest Palestinian city within [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1470.76s)]
*  Israel, to my parents who were killed by the Hamas. Hundreds of Palestinians came, hundreds, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1477.64s)]
*  from many that we know, but some that we didn't, but just they care to come and pay their condolence. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1485.56s)]
*  And the amount of solidarity we received, so I feel I'm obliged to show the same solidarity [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1494.76s)]
*  with my Palestinian friends. And I've been talking and meeting many, many Palestinian activists [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1503.24s)]
*  in the last three months. And what Hamze Awawde, if you haven't spoken to him or followed him, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1510.12s)]
*  I highly recommend to everyone to do so. Hamze Awawde said, hope is something we need to create, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1519.48s)]
*  is something we need to work to make hope. It's not something that will come or will [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1528.44s)]
*  sleep in the, go to sleep and in the morning we'll have hope. So this was his first [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1535.72s)]
*  phrase that I keep using. And his second was that he's willing, he's forgiving for the past, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1541.16s)]
*  he is forgiving for the present, but he won't forgive for the future. If we won't make the [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1548.92s)]
*  future a better future for our children and for ourselves. So those two phrases are very [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1555.56s)]
*  encouraging and built a lot of hope in me. So this is, you know, I don't, I think I didn't answer [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1562.84s)]
*  your question, but it was very important to me. Just this is the way I'm thinking. We are making [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1570.44s)]
*  hope and we are willing to forgive for the past and the present. And I also, this you ask about [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1576.52s)]
*  the Israeli minister. Oh, it's dangerous. It's very dangerous. It's a catastrophe, but like I [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1583.32s)]
*  am willing to forgive those who killed my parents, I'm also willing to forgive the Israeli [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1593.24s)]
*  government. And this is much more difficult for me because I see them as accountable for what [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1599.24s)]
*  happened on October 7th. Hamas was doing what is expected from a terrorist organization to kill [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1605.16s)]
*  innocent people. This is the outcome when you have a terrorist organization. This is what they are [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1611.96s)]
*  doing since, I don't know, for many years or centuries. But the government and the state [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1618.52s)]
*  should protect its citizens. And when the state is not being able to deliver, then they are [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1626.0400000000002s)]
*  accountable. But I'm willing to forgive about the past, but I won't forgive about the future. And [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1632.52s)]
*  when governments in Europe, the US and others are supporting the Israeli government, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1640.76s)]
*  and it's mostly I'm talking about Germany and the US, they are our biggest allies, but unfortunately [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1651.4s)]
*  our biggest enemies. Because if we continue and this government will stay in power, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1659.8000000000002s)]
*  it will mean the end to the state of Israel as we know it. And the catastrophe for everyone, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1666.6000000000001s)]
*  Israelis and Palestinians, will just be in numbers or in a way that we cannot, this we cannot imagine. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1674.2s)]
*  And for the US to send us military aid or to veto a declaration in the Security Council, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1682.6s)]
*  it's something that is a strategy. It's a strategy that President Biden and the [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1693.1599999999999s)]
*  Councilor of Germany are supporting the government, the extremist ever government in Israel. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1703.56s)]
*  I suppose for you, I mean, it must feel quite, I don't even know what the words are, that I suppose [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1711.24s)]
*  the US government or the German government would be saying, we're doing this for people like you. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1716.2s)]
*  No, no, no, I'll say it's against people like me. I would tell them, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1720.84s)]
*  it's against people like me. I would tell them, with every dollar or euro you're investing in [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1729.4s)]
*  military aid, please invest two euro in peace initiatives, in shared society initiatives, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1736.36s)]
*  in shared classrooms, shared civil organization, in the civil society. Don't send us weapons. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1743.08s)]
*  Don't send us weapons. Don't send us bombs. And they could say to Israel, stop, stop the war. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1752.68s)]
*  And they can force us like they've done in other places, even if it's through sanctions or through [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1762.3600000000001s)]
*  other diplomatic tools, they could force a solution. And yes, Hamas need to be [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1769.48s)]
*  taken over power. It should be, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1782.1200000000001s)]
*  we should release the people in Gaza and in Israel from the Hamas. But Hamas is also an ideology [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1790.52s)]
*  and is also a political and military force. But we must, the only way to kill this ideology [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1798.1200000000001s)]
*  will be by hope, by a better future. Because if we won't give future to the Hamas, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1811.48s)]
*  its successor will be much more extreme. And this is what Israel has been doing all the time. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1817.48s)]
*  They have been weakening the Palestinian authority and then they are supporting Hamas. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1825.56s)]
*  So now they will weaken Hamas and they will support another extremist [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1832.2s)]
*  organization that will fight over power with Hamas. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1839.24s)]
*  It's striking, isn't it? Because it's under discussion. But Benjamin Netanyahu has made it [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1844.36s)]
*  clear, and Haaretz, the Israeli newspaper made this clear, that he had sought to divide the [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1848.84s)]
*  Palestinian national movement, bolster Hamas at the expense of, for example, Fatah. So you have a [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1857.0s)]
*  divided West Bank and Gaza and then you say, well, you have no partner in peace to negotiate with, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1865.08s)]
*  not Hamas. And then in the West Bank, they can't represent all Palestinians. So, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1870.1999999999998s)]
*  I mean, it's interesting, isn't it? That narrative of, I suppose, the relationship between Benjamin [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1875.48s)]
*  Netanyahu and Hamas is not often discussed. So the war is supporting and serving both of them. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1880.84s)]
*  Because as long as the war continues, Netanyahu, from the internal politics, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1889.4s)]
*  has an excuse to stay in power because you don't change the notion that you don't change [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1895.96s)]
*  prime minister during a war. And you investigate just after. But the war will continue forever, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1902.76s)]
*  if that will be the notion. And if you get support, finance and military support, from [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1909.5600000000002s)]
*  from countries like the US and Germany. So they are basically, and also you ask about, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1915.64s)]
*  how is it for me to, what's the reaction I get? So I must tell you, it's amazing. I get an amazing [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1925.24s)]
*  reaction if it's in the supermarket, if it's in the train, if it's every public event that I'm going. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1935.4s)]
*  Some people, many people just come and hug me and tell me, Maoz, we want to join you in your [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1943.32s)]
*  peace in Trapanúri. We want to join you. Where can we list? What should we do? We want to join [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1952.9199999999998s)]
*  you in making hope. This is the majority of the people I meet. Some would say, we admire you for [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1958.52s)]
*  your bravery in telling what you think and beliefs. But we think you are wrong. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1967.8799999999999s)]
*  So I don't, and those are the between those two reactions, those are the reaction I'm receiving. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1977.08s)]
*  And I've been approached also by many, if it's delegation from overseas, of youth groups, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1987.56s)]
*  of philanthropic groups, of diplomats, and also from people within Israel. If it's a [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=1994.12s)]
*  like a GAPI program, if it's like public events about activism, about the day after, tomorrow I [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2001.0s)]
*  will meet a community in Haifa, an educational community shared by Israelis and Arabs called [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2011.8799999999999s)]
*  Yad Be'yad, one of six communities in Israel, education system from infant to eighth grade. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2021.64s)]
*  So I'm just going to meet the community, sharing, basically doing the same talk we are doing here. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2028.76s)]
*  And what I'm going to tell them is that I came here, came to meet them because they are making [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2034.8400000000001s)]
*  hope. They are the evidence that Jews and Arabs can live together, live together in equality. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2041.0s)]
*  And I suppose that was my final question, really, which is because you said, I think it's a really [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2050.6s)]
*  wonderful way of putting actually, you can forgive the past and the present, but not the future. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2054.44s)]
*  And as I've said, this land belongs to Jews and Palestinians. And that acceptance is, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2060.7599999999998s)]
*  you know, neither was going anywhere has to be the basis for what happens next. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2070.8399999999997s)]
*  But many people will look at this and think that prospect is further away than ever. And obviously [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2075.8799999999997s)]
*  at the moment we hear, you know, loud calls to ethnically cleanse Gaza altogether, those who [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2081.56s)]
*  survive. So what hope, you know, why should those of us looking at the moment at unbelievable horror, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2086.2799999999997s)]
*  which is obviously very, you know, people can see this every day now and they think from the outside, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2094.68s)]
*  they think there's no hope here at all. You see, it seems hopeless. So what, you know, you [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2100.2s)]
*  encapsulate a possible different future, you do, but, you know, we need a lot more people like [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2105.48s)]
*  yourself, don't we? I mean, so I'm just wondering how, you know, what meaningful hope should we [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2111.3999999999996s)]
*  think that that prospect is one day realizable? I'm looking to it from the entrepreneur point of [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2115.24s)]
*  view. The bigger the crisis, the highest the potential and it can be a turning point in history [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2125.24s)]
*  that it can be a turning point of history. It's the first time that Israel lost in a battle. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2138.12s)]
*  The first time, okay, that lost in a battle. So it's the first time Israelis are also a victim. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2144.2s)]
*  This is why it's since the Holocaust. So this is why also the trauma in Israel is so big. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2151.56s)]
*  It's impossible or very difficult to describe how much the Israelis are in fear now, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2158.3599999999997s)]
*  exactly like the Palestinian. But now for the first time, Israeli also are in a great fear. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2165.24s)]
*  But we can make it to a turning point in history because first it's in the world attention. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2175.6400000000003s)]
*  What's the extreme occupation? Some would say me too, apartheid in the West Bank, the size [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2181.7200000000003s)]
*  over Gaza that has been going on for 15 years and they're suffering. What is understood [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2191.32s)]
*  and agreed now that the status quo is not sustainable. It would not continue this way. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2201.7200000000003s)]
*  We also agree the logical and realistic people that the Palestinian Israelis would [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2210.36s)]
*  continue to live between the sea and the river. Now, so if we take those two, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2220.28s)]
*  so now there is only one option that we live here in peace and with a diplomatic agreement. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2227.9599999999996s)]
*  And because people, the individual like Hamzeh Awawde and Aziz Abussara, an organization like [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2237.08s)]
*  we named before, we are working so hard and we are building hope, we are creating hope, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2246.12s)]
*  we are building it. And exactly why it's so important to me to speak to you. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2250.7599999999998s)]
*  With the international intervention and with your pressure and we'll need to work together [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2255.88s)]
*  to choose humanity, to put pressure of government, of opinion leaders and support the [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2263.6400000000003s)]
*  reconciliation and peace movement in Palestine and Israel. And we need your support and [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2274.2000000000003s)]
*  we need your support and amplifier to reach the governments, to reach all organizations and [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2280.2799999999997s)]
*  stakeholders. And it's possible. And again, if you look to history where it's been done before, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2288.7599999999998s)]
*  I already stated in the 73 wars, six years after peace between Israel and Egypt. 45 after the [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2298.52s)]
*  second world war and the Holocaust, the EU is now the way Europe has been [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2306.12s)]
*  arranged politically. So we've done it in the past. We can and we'll do it in the future. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2318.68s)]
*  And the future is in our hand. The future is in our hand and it's up to us. I will play with the [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2326.2s)]
*  cards that it was the new hand that was given to us on October the 7th. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2333.56s)]
*  Moaz, it's been such an honor and a privilege to be able to speak to you. I think everyone [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2340.7599999999998s)]
*  listening and watching this will be hugely inspired by what you said, not least given the [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2347.72s)]
*  horror, the huge trauma. And that does need to be said. It was something which again, most of us [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2352.2799999999997s)]
*  will find very hard to properly understand the gravity of what you suffered. But to hear that [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2359.96s)]
*  message of hope and of peace, I think is extremely courageous leadership on your part. I think history [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2364.28s)]
*  will be very kind to you to say the least. I think it's infectious what you're saying. And I think [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2373.32s)]
*  you have an infectious optimism about you, which I hope does spread to people because that's the [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2379.16s)]
*  only way we're going to get a lasting peace. But it's been a huge honor. So for those watching, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2385.56s)]
*  listening, do share this video. So important. The least we can do is elevate the voice of Moaz and [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2391.72s)]
*  make sure that message is heard loud and clear. Do like and subscribe. Moaz, it's been such an [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2397.16s)]
*  honor. So thank you so much for joining us today. Again, thank you again. And I would love and I [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2402.2799999999997s)]
*  need this continued dialogue starting between you and myself and many, many others and between [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2409.4s)]
*  your audience to Palestinian, Israeli peace activists. We need you and together we'll achieve [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2416.28s)]
*  peace. And it shouldn't take too long. And it shouldn't take too long. Amen. Peace. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbfdyTgnCw&t=2425.7200000000003s)]
