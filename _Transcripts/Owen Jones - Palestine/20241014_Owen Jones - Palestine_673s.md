# Sky News Causes OUTRAGE Over Gaza Coverage - They're Not Even Pretending
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U)
*  Israel's genocide against the Palestinian people has been facilitated from day one by the Western [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=0.0s)]
*  media. They legitimised Israel's genocide launch law. It raised the incessantly stated in public [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=6.48s)]
*  genocidal intent of Israeli leaders and officials, whitewashed Israeli atrocities [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=14.0s)]
*  on endless occasions refused to even cover atrocities committed by the Israeli state, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=18.48s)]
*  dehumanised Palestinians, failed to accurately represent the full horror of what's been unleashed [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=23.36s)]
*  by the Israeli state against Gaza and beyond, failed to interrogate the complicity of Western [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=29.44s)]
*  governments we really could go on. This latest horror underlines this outright racism and [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  complicity in genocide and we should have no hesitation in saying any of these things. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=40.72s)]
*  In the early hours of this morning, the Israeli state attacked a hospital in Deir el-Bala in the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  centre of Gaza. Here, many displaced Palestinians were sheltering in tents. The result? Multiple. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=50.72s)]
*  Palestinian civilians burned to death. The footage I have watched is as nightmarish as it is possible [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=59.12s)]
*  to get and will stay with me forever. It shows Palestinian civilians connected to intravenous [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=67.2s)]
*  drips in hospital beds burning to death. You see one writhing. One of them is clearly a child, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=74.0s)]
*  an injured child who was sleeping in their bed connected to an IV drip at what was supposed to [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  be a place of safety, a hospital. And then an Israeli missile explodes and they are burned to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=87.12s)]
*  death. You can see Palestinians who are unable to reach them, screaming, overwhelmed with [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=93.36s)]
*  unimaginable mental agony. A little thought experiment. If I had asked where Hezbollah [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=101.44s)]
*  rocket hit an Israeli hospital and there was footage of Israeli children attached to IV drips [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  being burned alive, what sort of media coverage do you think that would get? Be realistic. Be honest. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=112.64s)]
*  I think you know the answer. There was another atrocity that endless atrocities committed every [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=119.44s)]
*  single day by the Israeli state. In this case, a school full of displaced sleeping Palestinians [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  in Nazareth, central Gaza, hit by an Israeli attack with multiple women and children being amongst [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=130.0s)]
*  the at least 32 killed. But that hospital strike, for example, did not lead the news. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=135.12s)]
*  Let me just start with Sky News. Look at their website, their headline. Israel names teenage [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=141.68s)]
*  soldiers killed in Hezbollah drone strike as, and then inverted quotes, 23 die. That's an inverted [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=146.8s)]
*  quotes in Gaza school strike. Here you have the anti-Palestinian racism of the British media in [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  all its absurdity and moral depravity captured in a single headline. After a Hezbollah missile hit [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=161.04s)]
*  an Israeli military base, you get four 19 year old Israeli soldiers who were killed, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=168.4s)]
*  who were humanised by Sky News. An emphasis on characteristics to engender senses of [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=174.88s)]
*  sympathy, of grief. Teenage soldiers. The perpetrator, that is the force responsible [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=183.2s)]
*  for killing them, was named. By contrast, 23 Palestinian civilians are killed, many of them [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=190.4s)]
*  actual children. Their deaths put in scare quotes as if to sow doubt. Who they were not described, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=197.28s)]
*  the perpetrator Israel not named. Now let's see this clip from Sky News this morning. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=204.16s)]
*  And the four soldiers that have died have now been named. All of them were just 19 years old. They [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=208.96s)]
*  are Sergeant Omri Tamari, in addition to that Sergeant Yosef Hieb, Sergeant Yoav Agmon and Sergeant [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=216.0s)]
*  Alon Amite. As I said, all four of them just 19 years old. Incredible stuff. Sky News dedicates [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=226.16s)]
*  air time to these four Israeli soldiers with a profoundly mournful tone. They were just 19 years [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=235.6s)]
*  old, we were told twice. Do you remember Sky News doing this for any of the tens of thousands of [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=240.8s)]
*  Palestinian civilians? That is non-competence who have been slaughtered. Was there this attempt to [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=244.72s)]
*  humanise actual children who aren't engaged in armed conflict? Would Sky News do such a roll call [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=249.52s)]
*  for another army engaged in rampant war crimes? I mean they wouldn't do this for Hamas fighters, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=254.88s)]
*  would they? I mean even just saying that would provoke shock and outrage for some. But I'm not [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=259.12s)]
*  asking Sky News to do that. I'm aware of the war crimes committed by Hamas. So do explain to me [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=263.76s)]
*  what rules are being applied here. It gets worse, so much worse. Sky News employ so-called military [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=268.4s)]
*  analysts. Let's listen to this example from earlier this year. This happened at the border [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=274.24s)]
*  checkpoint. You can see a car going through and ramming some of the police that were actually [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=278.8s)]
*  manning that checkpoint. The video we're going to freeze shortly but the two people's a man and a [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=283.2s)]
*  woman in the car. Subsequently they were killed by the police but it looks like accidentally a [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  stray bullet found its way into the van ahead and that killed a three or four year old young lady. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=294.88s)]
*  So tragic events in the West Bank. So we have four 19 year old Israeli soldiers who were [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=300.08s)]
*  mournfully described as teenagers as just 19 years old. But in this case we have a military [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=304.64s)]
*  analyst paid for Sky News uncorrected describing a three year old Palestinian little girl [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=310.08s)]
*  being killed by the Israeli army as a young lady. And then he describes her death as follows. But [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=316.64s)]
*  it looks like accidentally a stray bullet found its way into the van ahead and that killed a three [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=324.96s)]
*  or four year old young lady. In the course of this last year there has been many attempts, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=331.44s)]
*  unhinged attempts, to turn the English language on its head and well here's a striking example. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=337.2s)]
*  We could go on. The top of the Sky News live page today was four teenage IDF soldiers killed [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=342.08s)]
*  as head splat attacks. They did another tweet. It reads, breaking the UK has announced sanctions [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=347.76s)]
*  against several Iranian senior military figures and organisations following Iran's multiple rocket [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=352.88s)]
*  attack on Israel on the 1st of October. You then see a scene of total destruction, silhouettes of [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=358.0s)]
*  people in front of the remnants of a building consumed with flames. What was that? It was the [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=363.44s)]
*  attack on the hospital by Israel, a Palestinian hospital. So they've used, they describe this [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=371.92s)]
*  attack on Israel by Iran and then you see the image as though that's Iran's attack on Israel [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=379.04s)]
*  when it's Israel's attack on Gaza. Sky News coverage continued to behave like this throughout the day. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=384.32s)]
*  A Hezbollah drone was able to evade air defences and strike a military base. At least 60 others [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=390.72s)]
*  were injured in the attack in Binyamina. Today those killed have been named. They were Sergeant [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=397.12s)]
*  Omri Tamari, Sergeant Yosef Hayib, Sergeant Yoav Agmon and Sergeant Eilon Amite. All 19 years old [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=404.47999999999996s)]
*  were killed in the drone attack. There isn't even the pretence here that Palestinian life has any [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=412.79999999999995s)]
*  meaningful value. The life of a Palestinian civilian is treated as having far less value [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=418.4s)]
*  than an Israeli soldier. That includes Palestinian children being bombed and burned alive in a [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=425.35999999999996s)]
*  hospital while attached to IV drips. I would also note that last week the United Nations released [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=433.2s)]
*  a detailed report which declared Israel had deliberately destroyed Gaza's healthcare system [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=438.64s)]
*  as part of a policy of extermination. If we had a functioning media the latest attack on the hospital [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=442.96s)]
*  would be reported by broadcasters and military outlets in that context. Clearly it's not just [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=448.64s)]
*  media complicity we need to talk about. Today David Lammy, British Foreign Secretary, announced [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=453.84s)]
*  Despite repeated warnings, the dangerous actions of Iran and its proxies are driving further [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=458.56s)]
*  escalation in the Middle East. Following its ballistic missile attack on Israel, we are holding [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=463.6s)]
*  Iran to account and exposing those who facilitated these acts. He then quote-tweets a post by the [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=468.16s)]
*  Foreign Office which in big yellow underlined capital states sanctioned, then also big bold [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=475.68s)]
*  Let us now look at the senior Iranian military figures and organisations. Now I am on team [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=483.2s)]
*  don't bomb people and I oppose all military escalations. What matters in what I say here [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=488.71999999999997s)]
*  is the different standards applied and the action that Britain is prepared to take when it so wishes. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=492.96s)]
*  It is a fact that the Iranian ballistic missile attack was aimed at Israeli military targets. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=498.47999999999996s)]
*  No serious analyst doubts that. It is a fact that that attack did not kill a single Israeli [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=504.0s)]
*  civilian. But in this case, Britain imposes sweeping sanctions on Iranian officials and [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=508.96s)]
*  organisations. On the other hand, Israel has wiped Gaza from the face of the earth and perpetrated [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=514.88s)]
*  hideous war crimes from the West Bank and now, indeed, Lebanon. It has slaughtered tens of [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=520.56s)]
*  thousands of innocent people, many of them children, including just last night in a hospital [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=525.4399999999999s)]
*  and a school. It has even killed British civilians, notably in the attack on the World [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=531.12s)]
*  Central Kitchen earlier this year. Three Brits killed. But there are no sweeping sanctions [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=536.0s)]
*  imposed on Israel. Britain has simply suspended 8% of its weapons to Israel and has frankly [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=541.44s)]
*  bent over backwards apologising for doing so, making clear it was essentially forced to against [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=546.8s)]
*  its will by legal advice while continuing, for example, to provide crucial components for F-35 [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=551.28s)]
*  jets, raining death and destruction on innocent civilians. We know Britain could impose sweeping [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=556.56s)]
*  sanctions against Israel for its grievous atrocities in the way it has against Iran [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=564.0s)]
*  it chooses not to. That is complicity in genocide. Right now, and I'll be doing much more work on [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=568.56s)]
*  that this week, the Israeli state is executing a plan to destroy northern Gaza with all food [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=574.8s)]
*  and essentials of life blocked from entry in a total siege. Nothing has entered since October [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=579.52s)]
*  began with demands that civilians leave but those remain treated as military targets to be [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=584.08s)]
*  targeted and killed. That is a grotesque war crime in full public view and I would note [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=588.56s)]
*  the vast majority of this exhausted, starving population are not going to move. Having endured [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=593.12s)]
*  so many forced displacements already with no safe passage there, civilians trying to flee the south [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=597.68s)]
*  have been repeatedly murdered. Clearly it's part of a plan to ethnically cleanse the population and [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=602.72s)]
*  annex Gaza. Look, every day, every day I feel burning rage about all this. I am painfully aware [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=606.96s)]
*  that I am a white guy from Stockport. The rage felt by so many of this. I'm going to be clear [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=611.6s)]
*  about this. We'll have brutal consequences felt for decades. This is the sowing and my word a [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=616.08s)]
*  bitter harvest will be reaped. I'm not saying that because I relish it. Death and destruction. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=621.28s)]
*  There are lots of prominent people who clearly relish that. I'm not one of them. I don't want [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=626.88s)]
*  any innocent people to be killed. It is those who have facilitated in full public view some of the [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=631.4399999999999s)]
*  worst crimes of our age who have made that inevitable over and over again. And as someone [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=637.28s)]
*  who has worked in the Western media for 13 years, there are no words in the English language that [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=642.64s)]
*  adequately convey what I think about that industry. It is an industry which made this genocide [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=647.12s)]
*  possible. Without media complicity, this genocide wouldn't have been possible. And the Western media [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=652.5600000000001s)]
*  has to be held to account for their role in one of the worst crimes of our age because otherwise [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=656.8s)]
*  these horrors will never ever end. Please like and subscribe, leave your thoughts in your comments. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFLgpYGFT_U&t=661.92s)]
