# EXPOSED Media Racism Taken Apart By Explosive Studies
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7MGt2djXk0)
*  Media racism against Palestinians. Now to anyone paying attention to Western media coverage since
*  this current horror began, describing it as racist should not be a controversial statement.
*  And that's before we even discuss how Palestinians have been discussed in the media over many decades
*  of ethnic cleansing, occupation, apartheid, theft of land, illegal colonisation of the land, mass
*  killings by the Israeli state, mass incarceration, torture and so on. Now I realise there has been a
*  deliberate attempt to stop us using the word racist over many years to claim that the word
*  has become devalued and thrown around like confetti. That is a nonsense and indeed we are
*  being told to treat accusations of racism as being more outrageous than actual racism itself.
*  But what we are talking about here is racism. Racism in the most precise possible use of the
*  word. Where the lives of some are treated as having inherently less worth because of their ethnicity.
*  Now I'm going to discuss a new study shortly about the US media but first I just want to update you
*  on a previous video I did on the BBC's racism. That's because I approached the BBC for comment
*  about it and the response, well you'll see, is quite something. Now a little recap. In the study
*  that I quoted, it tracks BBC coverage in the first two months or so after the horrors of 7th of
*  October. It found that despite there being far far more Palestinian deaths in that period and
*  obviously there's been far more since, that wasn't reflected in the BBC's coverage or anything like
*  it. Mentions of violent Palestinian deaths never received the attention of violent Israeli deaths
*  and then from week after week mentions of Palestinian violent deaths still have to keep competing
*  with mentions of Israeli violent deaths even though of course Israeli violent deaths were
*  overwhelmingly on one day during the atrocities and war crimes committed against Israeli civilians
*  which I've always noted and yet every single day brings a new mass slaughter of Palestinians.
*  So what that means is mentions per Palestinian death in BBC coverage are much much much lower
*  than mentions in BBC coverage per Israeli death. Now furthermore the study also found humanising
*  language like mother, granddaughter, grandfather, son and so on was used far less for Palestinian
*  deaths than Israeli deaths even though again there are far more mothers, daughters, grandfathers,
*  grandmothers, sons and so on being killed. Now they also found emotive language to describe
*  deaths like murder, massacre and slaughter were used repeatedly for Israeli deaths but almost never
*  for Palestinian deaths and that includes for example those Palestinians of the West Bank being
*  killed in ways entirely comparable to how Israelis were killed on the 7th of October.
*  As I say this is just straightforward racism, it really is. I mean how else to describe it. Now I
*  approached the BBC and they said the following, let me just read their statement. Throughout
*  reporting on the conflict the BBC has made clear the devastating human costs to civilians living
*  in Gaza and Israel. We will continue to give careful thought in how we do this. We welcome
*  scrutiny and reflect on all feedback. The BBC is one of the few news organisations to have journalists
*  inside Gaza and they provide an on-the-ground reporting at considerable personal risk including
*  first-hand testimony and descriptions of what is happening. Our coverage of the conflict across all
*  our platforms, TV and radio as well as online, has included stories of Palestinian victims and
*  testimony from civilians, doctors and aid workers. The algorithm does not provide insight into the
*  context of the usage of particular words either in relation to the attacks of 7th of October or
*  the Israeli offensive in Gaza. We do not think coverage can be assessed solely by counting
*  particularly words used and do not believe this analysis demonstrates bias. What kind of answer
*  is that? They haven't answered, which is what I asked them to do, why they have given far far
*  less attention proportionately speaking to Palestinian deaths than Israeli deaths. Key
*  fundamental point which they don't even bother to engage with and refuse to engage with. No one has
*  said they've not given any space to stories of Palestinian victims as well as testimony from
*  civilians, doctors and aid workers. I mean that would be completely unhinged if they hadn't.
*  What the study has shown here is they've given much less space proportionately as I keep saying
*  Palestinian deaths. And does stories of Palestinian victims include Palestinians who've lost loved
*  ones in Gaza being treated with contempt, subjected to far more aggressive questioning
*  from journalists than official Israeli representatives, hectic to denounce Hamas,
*  even though they've got nothing to do with Hamas. One infamous example happened on Newsnight, I'm
*  sure you've watched it, you know exactly what I'm talking about. Worth asking that question because
*  that's just another example of racism. It's not just me, this is just one facet of racism in the
*  coverage. Also the fact they hide behind Palestinian journalists risking their lives in Gaza to deflect
*  scrutiny of the BBC's racism is in my view actually pretty tawdry behaviour to say the least. They then
*  say the algorithm doesn't provide insight into the context of the use of certain words. What does that
*  mean? What are they talking about here? All they mean here is say when entire Palestinian bloodlines
*  are wiped off the face of the earth, whether all civilians, so for example the entire
*  families of a journalist or a doctor or an aid worker or when hospitals come into an Israeli
*  attack and medics and patients are killed en masse leading to the World Health Organization
*  to describe Al-Shifa Hospital as a death zone, they don't think massacre or massacred or slaughter
*  or slaughter are appropriate words but they do think those are appropriate words to describe
*  horrors on October 7th. Why? Why is that then? What's the thinking? Now they say they
*  don't think coverage can be assessed solely by counting particular words. No one said that,
*  obviously. I'm just answering things which aren't claimed. No one said it was a sole assessment.
*  It's just a pretty big indicator. Surely the BBC isn't saying the nature of coverage can't be
*  assessed at all by looking at certain words. Surely they think the nature of coverage can be
*  assessed at least in part by the use of certain words. Obviously. If they don't, why wouldn't they?
*  It doesn't make any sense. Clearly you have to look at how words are used to understand
*  the nature of coverage. I don't really think this needs really unpacking in this depth because it's
*  just so obvious. Finally they say that they do not believe this analysis demonstrates bias.
*  Now to quote Tim from The Office, oh you've won the argument doing that have you? Yeah of course,
*  that's won the argument. I mean, what? The BBC have investigated themselves and come back and said
*  we're not biased despite having far less relative coverage of Palestinian deaths,
*  using far less humanising language for Palestinian deaths and using far less emotive words to describe
*  Palestinian deaths. I'll leave it with you whether you're convinced by that. I would say it's just
*  preposterous. Now a new investigation by The Intercept has looked at US media outlets,
*  specifically the New York Times, Washington Post and Los Angeles Times. These are supposed to be
*  liberal publications of course. Now they conclude that these newspapers had paid little attention
*  to the unprecedented impacts of Israel's siege and bombing campaign on both children and journalists
*  in the Gaza Strip. Just like the BBC, the investigation found major newspapers in the US
*  disproportionately emphasised Israeli deaths, used emotive language to describe the killing of
*  Israelis but not Palestinians and offered lopsided coverage of anti-Semitic acts in the US while
*  largely ignoring anti-Muslim racism. What this was was an open source analysis looking at the first
*  six weeks of the conflict. So we're talking between the 7th of October and the 24th of November
*  so a slightly shorter time frame than the analysis of BBC coverage but not by a huge amount. They
*  looked at 1,000 articles from these newspapers in the US and they found that for every Israeli
*  death, Israelis are mentioned eight times or rate 16 times more per death than that of Palestinians.
*  The study also found that mentions of Palestinians actually decline as the death toll of Palestinians
*  increased. Like the BBC, extremely emotive terms were reserved almost exclusively for Israelis killed
*  by Palestinians rather than the other way around. So for example, slaughter, massacre and horrific.
*  The word slaughter was used by editors and reporters to describe the killing of Israelis
*  versus Palestinians 60 to 1. Massacre was used to describe the killings of Israelis versus Palestinians
*  152 to 1. Horrific was used to describe the killing of Israelis versus Palestinians 36 to 4. They
*  found only two headlines out of over 1,100 articles mentioned children, so relating to
*  gars in children. Despite Israel's war on Gaza being perhaps as they know, well I mean the
*  deadliest war for children in modern history, there's little mention of the word children despite
*  thousands and thousands of children suffering violent deaths at the hands of Israeli bombs
*  and bullets. There isn't even journalistic solidarity in this by the way. Despite there
*  being more journalists killed than in any other recorded conflict, there's little mention in
*  headlines of the word journalists or equivalents, terms reporters, photojournalists. In
*  some the main newspapers, concludes the Intercept study, rarely give the Palestinians humanizing
*  coverage. A previous study also found that on US cable news it was even worse by the middle of
*  November. Far far more mentions of Israelis compared to Palestinians. Indeed Israelis were
*  mentioned approaching 100,000 times, Palestinians just 20,000, five times or so less. This is racism,
*  it's very straightforward racism. It really is. What this does is warp public understanding of the
*  horror clearly. It reduces the scope for informed public outrage over the scale of mass slaughter,
*  meaning less pressure on Western governments arming and supporting the Israeli offensive.
*  Look clearly Palestinian deaths are treated as not having anywhere near the worth of an Israeli
*  death. Israeli deaths should be treated extremely seriously. We should grant obviously every Israeli
*  civilian the humanity that they've had, you know, they've suffered terrible violence and their
*  humanity is something that we should always center when we report on their deaths, as we should with
*  Palestinians. That hasn't happened. Now this racism allows one of the great atrocities of our age to
*  continue. Let's just end this with a report from Sky News in the UK because it really is quite
*  something. It's about Palestinian civilians being killed in the West Bank. Just have a listen.
*  This happened at the border checkpoint. You can see a car going through and ramming some of the police
*  that were actually manning that checkpoint. The video we're going to freeze shortly but
*  the two people's a man and a woman in the car and subsequently they were killed by the police but
*  it looks like accidentally a stray bullet found its way into the van ahead and that killed a three or
*  four year old young lady. So tragic events in the West Bank. What do you say? It's like a dark,
*  dark satire. A three or four year old is described as a young lady. Yeah, you see there's usually a
*  word we use in English language there. You might have heard of it. It's child. As for accidentally
*  a stray bullet found its way into the van. How is this possible? How is this coverage possible?
*  How are we all not up in outrage about this? All of us. They're taking the piss in a pretty disturbing
*  way I would say. Look there are some other superb mainstream journalists out there. Give them a
*  talking about Sky News actually. I'd note their cover spawner Alex Crawford is just dating facts
*  and getting absolutely dog piled by some of the worst people on earth but it's clear that overall
*  the Western media has dehumanized Palestinians, treated their deaths with contempt, walked
*  understanding about the reality of the current horror and therefore made it more possible for
*  Israel to get away with their crimes. That's why we all have a responsibility to use our platforms
*  to build alternatives however big or small our platform happens to be to get the truth out.
