# Israeli-American Scholar Exposes Gaza Genocide - w. Raz Segal
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [June 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqHoRP9u5Bk)
*  Now, many months ago, and I appreciate now we're seven months into the murderous onslaught,
*  of course, against Gaza by the Israeli state, backed by the US government, the British government
*  and other Western governments. I interviewed the brilliant Rasigal, who is associate professor of
*  Holocaust and genocide studies. And one of the reasons, as it's so important, is from the very
*  start, he said, we need to listen to what Israeli leaders and officials were saying. And that intent
*  was so rarely so openly spoken. And that's so important, because actually what Israeli leaders
*  and officials said from the start proved the most accurate roadmap to what they actually did. They
*  were not kidding, as it turned out. And yet there was a catastrophic failure deliberately, I would
*  say, to listen to what Israeli leaders actually said they were going to do. Now, given what's
*  happened with the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice, the other,
*  what's very important we need to talk about is about the question of impunity. Has impunity
*  now collapsed? Is that the end of Israeli impunity? There's other things I want to talk to you, and
*  Ras is the perfect person to speak to about all of this sort of stuff. So hello, how are you?
*  Hello, Owen. Thanks for having me again.
*  It's always an honour to have you, honestly. So glad we're talking again. So much has happened
*  in the worst possible way, let's be honest, in some ways. But obviously, we have moves in terms
*  of accountability. So something good to talk about as well in that sense, if we describe it in such
*  terms. I just want to talk to you about that point I just make. The reason, obviously, there's so many
*  reasons to be angry about everything that's happened, about what I regard as one of the
*  great crimes of our age. The reason I often feel as somebody who's worked in the mainstream
*  Western media for a very long time is intent. This question of intent is what you always said
*  from the start, is it's rare that people are so, that a state was so open about what is just open
*  genocidal language and intent. And there were so many statements from the very start about what
*  was planned, which were just, not only was there failure by the Western media to frame their
*  coverage around these statements. So you often basically had this as a war of self-defence with
*  a side debate about is it proportionate or not. We can agree to disagree. That's basically what
*  they did. I'll just give you one example. And I think because this for me just sums it up.
*  So on the 9th of October, the Israeli army coordinator of government activities in the
*  territory, that's Kogout for those who may have heard of it. Major General Ghassan Ali said,
*  Hamas became ISIS and the citizens of Gaza are celebrating instead of being horrified. Human
*  animals are dealt with accordingly. Israel has imposed a total blockade in Gaza. No electricity,
*  no water, no just damage. You wanted hell, you will get hell. Now the reason I bring that up
*  is that's not subtle. He's not messing around there. He's very clear. He's talking about the
*  civilian population. He's equating them to human animals. That's genocidal. He's making it clear
*  they are collectively guilty and that they will collectively suffer. Well, hell is the way he says
*  it, including a total cutting off of the essentials of life, which now form a very important part of
*  the request for an arrest warrant by the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court.
*  The reason that it's just, I'm just wondering, given you said from the beginning what was going
*  to happen, what do you say in terms of where we're at now? Because we're talking, I'll ask you about
*  the ICJ and the ICC, but now we have the prospect of accountability. This was quite obvious what was
*  going to happen from the beginning, I would posit. But you were one of the voices making this point,
*  but you got yelled at quite a lot, Letan, I would say. Yeah, I mean, you know, the whole idea,
*  certainly from my perspective as a scholar of the Jewish world and the Holocaust, but more broadly
*  also, the whole idea of studying genocide and working in Holocaust and genocide studies and for
*  those working in international law is not just to study genocide, you know, once it had happened,
*  right? But the idea of genocide prevention, right? And one of the ways that's why this crime that
*  is considered a crime of crime, quote unquote, right, has this element of intent so that we have
*  a clear indication, right, that genocide is unfolding or about to unfold or at the very
*  least that there's grave risk of genocide, right, which activates the convention. And therefore,
*  it was very clear, actually, I would argue, as you said from the very beginning, that we are seeing
*  expressions of, you know, clear genocidal intent, but also action, right, in the sense of the
*  imposition of the total siege that you mentioned, but then also the weaponization of international
*  humanitarian law with the safe areas and the safe routes. And we know today Israel actually bombed
*  Palestinians fleeing on routes that designated it safe and it actually used its most destructive
*  2,000 ton US-made bombs in the south after 13th of October where it directed Palestinians from
*  the north of Gaza to evacuate. So it basically used international humanitarian law here,
*  this evacuation orders from 13th of October until today in order to enhance the targeting
*  of Palestinians who were then also fleeing under the conditions of total siege. And we know that
*  this followed the 16-year-old siege on Gaza, so the longest siege in modern history. So in those
*  first few days of the total siege, Palestinians were already very much feeling the impact of the
*  cutting off of clean water, food, fuel, medical supplies, the targeting of hospitals immediately,
*  also exacerbated, of course, all of this. So we do have actually in the language of the convention,
*  the creating of conditions calculated to bring about the physical destruction of the group
*  in whole or in part. And this was all clear within the first week after 7th of October.
*  And then as you said, Israel proceeded to do what it said it will do. And that's why
*  now it's starving millions of Palestinians, there's famine conditions, of course, Gaza is destroyed.
*  I mean, we also have to remember Israel has killed so far 15,000 Palestinian children.
*  That's not an accident, right? And we know actually from past cases that are in front of
*  the ICJ now actually, that specific targeting of children points to genocidal intent, right? So
*  Israel did what it told us everyone that it's going to do. It was very clear in that first
*  week after 7th of October, and unfortunately, it's still very clear as well as continuing
*  its genocidal assault now in Rafah. And here we are. Of course, there are many things that
*  have happened. In addition, as you said, there's the ICJ and the three provisional orders in the
*  ICC arrest warrants now and other things that are going on. But we're still in the midst of
*  a genocidal assault on Gaza. Seven months in, it's really horrific that we're all witnessing this.
*  You know, horrific that we're all witnessing this, right? A complete and total failure of the
*  international legal system. And so we're very much in the moment where it's still incredibly
*  urgent, of course, to stop this genocidal assault. But before I ask you just because what I'm asking
*  you about impunity before I do, I mean, the reason I bring this up, it's not like this isn't about
*  setting scores, it's not like some sort of, you know, private school debating society. This is
*  about accountability, but also learning from what's happened. And I always feared from the start that
*  this attempt to revise history, oh, well, we didn't know this would all happen. You know,
*  obviously they went too far. We didn't think this would happen. And what's so striking is the fact
*  that, you know, because you sometimes hear this, there's basically this premature opposition that
*  people got opposed to what before they'd even launched a ground offensive. This keeps coming
*  up at the moment. I know, because the ground offensive didn't, I think it was about two weeks
*  in or more. But it was the facts. Firstly, obviously, you've got a huge bombing campaign
*  beginning almost immediately, but you also got this rhetoric from the start. And I just say this
*  because I think some of the people who backed it publicly are now trying to backtrack. But I would
*  just say it's quite obvious, wasn't it? They said they were going to have a massive siege.
*  And that's obviously a fundamental part of what the International Criminal Court's
*  chief prosecutor's request for a response is about. That's why I'm saying it. It's just,
*  it was obvious if we just listen. There's something to say about this, which is very important, is
*  that, you know, it's related to what you're asking. People, you know, have asked, why? Why do we
*  actually see in the Israeli case this kind of clear, explicit, and unshamed genocidal intent,
*  which is very rare, right? Why do we see it? Because Israelis are imagining collectively,
*  you know, the vast majority, unfortunately, that they are fighting a colonial war here,
*  right? A war against quote-unquote savages, barbarians, human animals, Nazis. You know,
*  the genocidal intent was also accompanied by various forms and mechanisms of dehumanization,
*  which should have made all the red lights flash, right? Because we know what this language means
*  from recent history, right? But this imagination about colonial warfare is very important to what
*  you're saying, because in the West, and also in the international legal system, which is a
*  Western-dominated system, it's still very much, you know, steeped in colonialism, right? And
*  um, this is also the origins of international law, because international law, right, originated to
*  regulate wars between quote-unquote civilized nations, not colonial warfare, where there
*  everything was permitted. That's why we're seeing this kind of genocidal intent, and that's why
*  people are trying, as you say, to kind of deny, right? Or, you know, blur, or say, you know,
*  we didn't know that this was going to happen, or the basic issue is that they really don't see
*  Palestinians as people, right, as equal people, deserving protection, you know, under the Genocide
*  Convention in this way, right? This is what we're seeing, and this is also very much related to
*  impunity in the international legal system, impunity to Israel, right? This is why it's so
*  important to now push this, that impunity to Israel is starting to crack, but it's very important to
*  push this forward, because the whole system, which is again based on a colonial mindset,
*  that really doesn't see Palestinians as equal, right, as deserving protection in the system,
*  needs to change, because it's actually, once we start to open it up, we see it's not only
*  Palestinians. We live in a world with more than 100 million forcibly displaced people and refugees,
*  right, discarded by the nation-state system, discarded by the international legal system,
*  right? So this has far wider implication, and that's why many people in the global south,
*  right, are rallying around the case of Gaza now, because they see clearly that this is an
*  opportunity to change a system that doesn't see them as well, right, as equal and deserving
*  protection. Israeli impunity, the impunity that the Israeli state has enjoyed, and that's what we
*  talked about a lot in the last interview we did. And we should note, by the way, that interview
*  caused a big splash, actually caused a big scandal involving Gary Lineko, for those who don't know,
*  is the biggest sports personality in Britain. He shared an excerpt of the video and then got
*  hounded and attacked and all the rest of it. But actually, it helped because it just meant more
*  people watched the interview, particularly the clip which went viral on Twitter. But about
*  Israeli impunity, that's what we spoke about partly. And since we spoke, and obviously very
*  recently now, we've had the International Criminal Court Chief Prosecutor requesting a response,
*  which if he said that a year ago, that the Prime Minister of Israel Netanyahu and his defense
*  minister were ever going to get a request for an arrest warrant, people think you're basically on
*  acid. And also the International Criminal Court of Justice is ruling, obviously, on ceasing military
*  offensive in Raft. What has it just collapsed now? Is that just the end of Israeli impunity?
*  No, I don't think it's, we're yet at that point. But Israeli impunity has cracked significantly.
*  It's important just for a minute to explain where this impunity comes from, right? Because
*  it's actually baked into the international system from the very beginning. So very, very briefly,
*  just to say when, and this is tied actually to the crime of genocide, because when the crime of
*  genocide is created in 1948, right? The immediate context, the background is the Holocaust. No one
*  used the word, of course, at that time, but the Nazi assault on the Jews, which was framed as unique,
*  as exceptional for various reasons, right? But the implication was that immediately a
*  hierarchy was created where Nazism and the Nazi assault on Jews was placed, and the hierarchy is
*  more terrible than genocide, actually. Now, when you think about the field that I'm part of, Holocaust
*  and Genocide Studies, this kind of hierarchy is embodied in the name of the field, Holocaust and
*  Genocide Studies, which is a very strange title, right? Because we all recognize that the Holocaust
*  was a case of genocide, so what is this Holocaust and genocide studies? This is the hierarchy,
*  right? That's from the very beginning. Now, this is very important because the Holocaust was framed
*  as more terrible than genocide. Israel, as the state of Holocaust survivors, where indeed many
*  Holocaust survivors tried to build their lives, was immediately then from 1948 placed on another
*  hierarchy, right? As more moral than any other country in the world. That's the origins, by the
*  way, of the common idea in Israel in the West that the Israeli army is the most moral in the world,
*  right? This kind of absurd idea. Now, this is very important because this means these
*  hierarchies, Holocaust and genocide, and Israel and other states and the Israeli army, is that
*  the idea that Israel could commit any crime under international law, not to mention genocide, became
*  basically unimaginable, unspeakable from the very beginning. That's why also there was immediately
*  a necessity to deny the Nakba. So Nakba denial also became actually a structural systemic element
*  in the international legal system, and this is all tied to the emergence of the crime of genocide,
*  right? So impunity from Israel from the very beginning. Now, because now, now what we're seeing
*  today was never supposed to happen. It's an accident of the system, right? It's happening
*  because Israelis imagine that they're fighting a colonial warfare, right? And because the intent is
*  so clear, we have actually clear indication of the crime of genocide. Now we have the charge of
*  genocide against Israel and the ICJ, and the ICJ in its three provisional orders has repeated the
*  fact that it is plausible that the rights of the Palestinians to be protected from genocide, right?
*  That it's plausible that this right is violated, meaning that it's plausible that the crime of
*  genocide is taking place, right? We have many, many scholars and experts in Holocaust and genocide
*  studies who have talked about the fact that either Israel's attack on Gaza is genocide or that
*  there's a grave risk of genocide. And because of this, because we're now witnessing an Israeli
*  assault on Gaza that is genocidal or plausibly genocidal, that's the reason that we have this
*  crack in the impunity of Israel, because it originates, right, with the crime of genocide
*  back in 1948. Now it's important to say that, you know, this is, again, there's incredible,
*  there is, of course, incredible pushback, right, to maintain the system as it is, right? Anyone who
*  just listened to US President Joe Biden's speech just now before our interview, right, no mention
*  of any Israeli crime whatsoever, of course not a genocide. The US, right, rejects the process in the
*  ICJ, the US, which is not a party to the Rome Statue, rejects the request for arrest warrants
*  by Chief Prosecutor Khan against Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel Defense
*  Minister Yoav Galan. And there are many people, of course, in the West who will do a lot to make
*  sure that this crack in the Israeli impunity will not widen. But it's very important that it will
*  widen, right, because again, the whole, if we think, if we understand how the international legal
*  system emerged with Israeli impunity and with Nakba denial, right, then this is, as I said,
*  an opportunity to change the system with important implications for Palestinians and for Israel-Palestine
*  in the future, but also much more than that. So yes, we are in the process, but we're not,
*  we're definitely still, we're not there. Impunity for Israel has not completely collapsed at all.
*  Before just asking just more about that in terms of the implications, I'm very interested, obviously,
*  talking about, as an associate professor, of Holocaust and genocide studies, but what strikes
*  me is there was an ignorance, a popular ignorance about the history of genocide.
*  And the Holocaust, I mean, look, you're the scholar here, is an outlier in that it's an industrialized
*  attempt to exterminate an entire people in a very short space of time, in defense of the civilian
*  population, which is why the Nazis then had to create these elaborate conspiracies of, well,
*  they're not defenses because there's the international Jewish Bolshevik conspiracy, and then they allied
*  Bolshevism with Jewish people, and that's why they then invent to kind of, there was a war of
*  self-defense. But the reason I bring this up is because the Holocaust is people's reference point
*  for genocide in popular understanding, but actually many genocides throughout history are in the
*  context of an armed conflict. So if you take Rwanda, where you have the Hutu extremists who
*  slaughter the Tutsis, but there was the Rwandan Patriotic Front, who ostensibly represented the
*  Tutsi minority, who did commit atrocities, which was then used by Hutu extremists to claim that
*  they were going to commit genocide against them, that if we don't kill them, they'll kill us first.
*  And the reason I bring this up, I'm just interested to your thoughts on, it strikes me that those who
*  refute the idea that there was genocide in Gaza do so because the understanding of genocide is,
*  generally speaking, the Holocaust, when actually in many other contexts it is actually a war in
*  which the atrocities committed by multiple sides. Do you see what I mean? Yeah, I mean, look,
*  in a way this discussion is not relevant at all, right, in the sense that genocide is what genocide
*  is defined in international law, in the UN Convention on Prevention and Punishment of
*  the Crime of Genocide. That's what genocide is. It doesn't have to look like the Holocaust, however
*  you understand the Holocaust. Now, it's also important to say that, of course, the Holocaust
*  was an unfolding process, right? You don't get immediately to mass murder in gas chambers,
*  right, which the Nazis really, the final solution of the Jewish question, right, this idea to murder
*  all Jews within German reach, right? The Nazis make that decision in the spring of 1942. That's
*  pretty, and in relation to the dynamics of the war, by the way, right, this is a very long and
*  complex history and we don't have time to get into it, but what's important to say is that it
*  evolves, it evolves from the idea of removing Jews from German, from constantly expanding German
*  territory, that is from what we would call today ethnic cleansing, right, and when ethnic cleansing
*  efforts fail in the context of the war, right, that's what creates the intensification and
*  escalation to the final solution to the German decision finally in the spring of 1942 to murder
*  all Jews within German reach. Now again, so it's important to mention this because
*  ethnic cleansing force population transfer is a different crime than genocide, but it could become
*  part of a genocide process or it could actually be an integral part of the genocidal assault as we
*  actually see in the case of Gaza, right, but again all this is actually beside the point in the sense
*  that what is genocide, right, it's what's defined as genocide in the convention. That makes perfect
*  sense because the reason that's just in people's, that's often been the counter-argument made by
*  those of you who are books. Yeah, what I would say to that is actually again what people imagine
*  that the Holocaust was is usually very far from what we know that the Holocaust was in research,
*  right, and how it evolved, right, it's a very complex history that actually does tell us a lot
*  of things also about what's going on in Gaza today. Again, if we just think about intent, right,
*  so we know what language that dehumanizes people means, right, we know it also a lot because of the
*  Nazis, right, not only because of the Nazis but also because of the Nazis. So there are actually
*  ways to relate what's going on in Gaza to Nazism and the Holocaust today, but again I would say
*  that what's important is how genocide is defined international law, right, in order to have this
*  discussion and that this is, you know, so this is a very important, it's not how someone imagines
*  the Holocaust, right, and many people when they think about the Holocaust today what they're
*  actually doing is imagining the Holocaust, right. In terms of the here and answers of what happens
*  next, because what we spoke about before was what you described as a Milosevic moment and obviously
*  Slobodan Milosevic, for those who I'm sure most people know who was talking about, he was the
*  former leader, the president of Serbia during the Yugoslav Wars and he ended up being, well there was
*  an attempt to put him on trial for the war crimes and the, including obviously Srebrenica which
*  officially was defined as genocide, for his involvement in the war crimes committed during
*  the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, he died, so that, he committed suicide, sorry yes, just so I remember,
*  yeah, so that never happened, but in my head, because I remember speaking about this and I
*  thought well Netanyahu Milosevic, very different relationship to Serbia compared to Israel, so this
*  will never happen. I'm just interested, what do you think will happen next? Could there be a
*  Milosevic moment, do you still think that? Well I mean, I said just before we start the interview
*  I mentioned Milosevic's moment for Netanyahu with the request for arrest points now and hopefully
*  we'll see these arrest warrants and actually as Chief Prosecutor Khan said, you know, the investigation
*  is ongoing and we might see more arrest warrants. I mean the key issue is that, you know,
*  you know, Netanyahu is not Milosevic and this will have far greater implications again for
*  the international system as such and this is what's important to understand because, you know,
*  Chief Prosecutor Khan is actually an integral part of the system that has maintained Israeli
*  impunity, right, until the 7th of October. So it tells us a lot when someone like this, right,
*  moves to request arrest warrants against Israel Prime Minister and Israel Defense Minister,
*  of course there are many, many others who should be targeted by the ICC investigation,
*  but it tells us a lot already when this is happening and why is it happening because
*  Chief Prosecutor Khan understands that the system itself now is under attack, right, because we have
*  this accident, Israeli genocidal assault, right, and now the issue is that it's clear that the US
*  government and its allies would actually like to do away with the international legal system, right.
*  I mean they're not part of the rogue statue. The whole system is really a hindrance to
*  American interests and American imperial violence around the world. I mean think about the
*  international arms trade, right, which ensures that there's continuous wars and conflict and mass
*  violence and genocide around the world. So doing away with the system, right, would be now that
*  it's exposed in this kind of way, this is an opportunity to do away with it and this is a
*  grave danger for the system. This is the reason that we see someone like Khan, who is committed,
*  I think, to the system, right, move to request these arrest warrants because he doesn't want
*  the system to collapse, right, and this is why, this is what I'm talking about now, that we have
*  an opportunity to create a significant change in the international legal system, right. I mean the
*  international legal system, like anything, it changes, right. It's not something that stands
*  still and that's why I think that these arrests, so Milosevic's moment would be very different
*  than Milosevic's, right. It would have far greater implications and because Netanyahu is under a lot
*  of pressure within Israel, as Milosevic's actually was also in the Serbian case, we have this
*  opportunity perhaps somehow, who knows, I mean it's all very unprecedented and fluid so it's difficult
*  to really say what might happen but we have this potential. It is important to say in this context
*  that when you look at the press conference of Chief Prosecutor Khan when he announced the request
*  for arrest warrants, he devoted towards the end, about a minute and a half or so, to the issue of
*  impunity, specifically, he emphasized this, right, and this is the reason that he emphasized it,
*  because he actually also recognizes that impunity, which was again a structural element of the
*  international legal system, that he was part of it, now has to change because otherwise the whole
*  system is under attack. It's very important to say that also he is doing everything he can
*  to kind of maintain what he can. So for example, the request so far refers only to the period after
*  7th of October. In this way it partakes in this complete blurring and distortion of the context
*  of the ongoing Nakba, the ongoing Israeli settler colonial violence that brought us to the 7th of
*  October, that brought us to Israel's attack on Gaza and there's many other shortcomings that we can
*  talk about and many people have talked about but still it's a very very important move in this
*  process of widening the crack of Israeli impunity today together of course with the
*  process in the in the ICJ and the three provisional orders so far that we've seen.
*  I mean given, for example, President Biden's response to the ICC chief prosecutor's request
*  for arrest warrants and also several US politicians including their menacing of the ICC,
*  is there a danger of, I mean I know all the western states did actually come out to defend,
*  for example, the ICC and the ICJ, but is there a danger of, you know, kind of contagion where
*  whenever we think about the international order and the way it's rigged in favour of the global
*  north and its allies, that will just cause further destabilisation of all the imploding system and
*  kind of, you know, whatever law exists and however problematic it might be, if Joe Biden is throwing
*  the ICC under a bus then this will, where does that lead us? Yeah, I mean I think that, you know,
*  yes there is the situation is, as I said, I think it's incredibly unprecedented
*  and I think it is very important to maintain the international legal system but make sure that it
*  changes very significantly as it should, right, because international law, which is far, far from
*  perfect, as I said, it emerges actually from the colonial world, from the idea of colonial violence,
*  right, but if it changes in this, you know, unprecedented moment, it's one of the tools that
*  we have and we, you know, we look at the world around us today, there's, you know, the rise of
*  right-wing populism, extreme right, fascism across the board, really, we definitely need an
*  international legal system but we need a different international legal system when we're in a moment
*  where this could happen, it requires, you know, much more effort, much more pressure and yes,
*  there is the danger, I mean that's, for me, it's very clear that for the US government and its allies,
*  no international system, legal system is better, yes, so this is an incredibly dangerous moment.
*  And since what happens next, because obviously we have the genocide launch in Gaza, we also have the
*  question of the West Bank, there are more Palestinians living in the West Bank than there are in
*  Gaza and we've, obviously, it shouldn't be below the, not on the people's radar, but it should be
*  said there's been horrific violence waged against Palestinians in the West Bank over the last few
*  months, hundreds have been killed by Israeli settlers, by Israeli security services, by the
*  security forces, as well as grotesque human rights abuses, people driven from their homes.
*  I'm just wondering what you think about, and it should be noted that the ICC was investigating
*  crimes against humanity and war crimes generally in the occupied territories, including in the West
*  Bank and it's revealed this week that the former head of Mossad was menacing the former chief
*  prosecutor, the predecessor of Karim Khan, including, essentially, threatening her and her
*  family over this, which I think, well, I'd be interested in your thoughts on that, but yeah,
*  but what do you think about what happens next, not just Gaza, but, you know, we're talking about the
*  Palestine, what should be known as the Palestinian state? Yeah, I mean, in terms of what we now know
*  about Israeli efforts, including the head of the Mossad himself, right, stalking and threatening
*  the former chief prosecutor of the ICC, this really tells us all we need to know about Israeli
*  impunity, about the sense of impunity, right, this kind of mafia behavior, right, that we can do
*  anything we want, however we want, anywhere we want, right, and this is also breaking down now,
*  right, this is an incredible, I mean, I think an incredible embarrassment, though who knows how
*  most Israelis feel this way about these kinds of things, if they feel that is indeed an embarrassment,
*  but yes, I mean, we are also part of the ways in which this moment is incredibly dangerous, as I
*  said, is that, I mean, genocide prevention in Gaza has failed, part of the, as I said, part of the
*  rationale of studying genocide and dealing with genocide is to prevent genocide, and
*  genocide prevention in Gaza has failed, we have to be clear about this, it's incredibly important
*  to stop the unfolding genocide now, but now there's the ongoing and intensifying Israeli
*  assault on the West Bank and East Jerusalem, but I would actually like to point out also that there's
*  nearly two million Israeli Palestinians, the Palestinian citizens of Israel, and they're
*  actually in an incredibly, I would argue, maybe even the most vulnerable situation, right,
*  especially when we think about the distribution of thousands of weapons by Israel's internal
*  security minister, the settler, Ben-Gveal, right, after 7th of October he's distributed thousands
*  of weapons in Israel, created these kind of civilian self-defense units, right, there's an
*  intense genocidal discourse in Israel today in politics and media and society, people talk openly
*  right about the murder of Palestinian children in Gaza and so on and so forth, this all means that
*  any kind of further deterioration in the situation, a regional conflict, a war with Hezbollah in the
*  north, an escalation of violence in the West Bank, right, places, Israeli Palestinian and the most
*  vulnerable population, they're actually considered by many Israelis as the enemy within, right,
*  which places them similar to, say, Armenians in the Ottoman Empire during World War I,
*  Tutsis in Rwanda during the Rwanda genocide, and in other cases, so this is, you know, when we
*  think about why it's important to continue talking about genocide, accountability, and thinking about
*  Gaza definitely, right, and stopping the Israeli unfolding attack on Gaza, but also looking at
*  prevention, and this also means, this also is one of the reasons that breaking down impunity,
*  the ICJ process, the ICC process, and then also intensifying, you know, all the BDS efforts
*  is very, very important, right, anything that, you know, furthers the aim of making sure that Israel
*  can't continue this assault will also then figure in actually preventing a possible, you know,
*  attack that could be horrendous on Israeli Palestinians, right, so that's another reason
*  that insisting on the framework of genocide now is incredibly important. Just finally on that,
*  because I think you mentioned boycott, divestment, sanctions, for those who don't know, the movement
*  very much modeled on the movement against South African apartheid. Now, I mean, I mean, I can never
*  get my head around just how irresponsible at a time when clearly anti-Semitism is clearly rising,
*  and we know anti-Semitism is a grave, grave evil, which within living memory, of course,
*  was responsible for the show in six million Jews being murdered in a very short space of time.
*  And, you know, the way anti-Semitism has been, I mean, Benjamin Netanyahu described Karen Kahn,
*  the chief prosecutor, as one of the great anti-Semites of our time, saying he will join
*  the German judges of the 1930s who, you know, sent, you know, laid the way for the Holocaust.
*  I mean, you know, yeah, I mean, it's not, I mean, I say that's laughable, but it's not funny.
*  It's not funny for lots of reasons, but it's not funny for a start because people just
*  will start hearing anti-Semitism and stop believing in it, which is incredibly dangerous.
*  I'm just interested in your thoughts about, because, you know, you're a scholar part of
*  the Holocaust, you know, you're an Israeli American associate professor, you know how
*  grave anti-Semitism is and how we have a discussion about that weaponization in that context.
*  Yeah, I mean, there's, of course, this is a very, you know, this has a history of more than two decades now.
*  Israeli, it's an Israeli project, right, of weaponizing anti-Semitism, you know, basically focusing
*  the discussion of anti-Semitism only on Israel. So any critique of the state of Israel becomes
*  anti-Semitism. All this, of course, is very much intensified as well.
*  After 7th of October, and of course, BDS efforts have been seen by Israel and its supporters
*  and also a lot in the US, right. And this is also through law, right, which is very dangerous
*  as anti-Semitism and nothing, of course, could be farther from the truth. It's exactly the opposite,
*  right, the struggle against violent states, right, in defense of a persecuted group, right,
*  in defense of a group that now faces extreme violence, even if not genocide. Okay, let's even,
*  let's put for a minute the question of genocide aside. People who face extreme violence by a
*  violent state, right, protecting them, struggling against a violent state, is actually very much
*  in line with the historical struggle of anti-Semitism against anti-Semitism, right, which was a struggle
*  to protect Jews, a group, from violent and discriminatory and exclusionary states, right.
*  So it's exactly the opposite, that weaponization of the discourse of anti-Semitism now basically
*  aims to protect a state, right, against any critique of its attack against a group,
*  which is a world turned upside down. It's really, I mean, as a Jew, as a scholar of the Jewish world,
*  a scholar of the Holocaust, and as a scholar of anti-Semitism, this is really horrific, right.
*  And the way that it's now becoming, you know, law in some cases, including here in the U.S. in
*  various ways, is incredibly dangerous. It's incredibly dangerous, of course, for Palestinians.
*  It's incredibly dangerous for Arabs, for Palestinians, for Muslims here in the U.S.,
*  but it's also incredibly dangerous for Jews, right, because it actually diverts attention,
*  right, from very real anti-Semitism that is actually rising recently across the West,
*  right. It diverts attention from that, right. It tells us, no, no, no, we're not looking at that.
*  We're going to look now only at protecting a violent state now, Israel, right, and therefore
*  it also places Jews in danger. And of course, right, the people who are usually engaged in this
*  weaponization, in many cases are themselves anti-Semites and whites supremacists, right,
*  which again places all these people, including Jews, right, in further danger. So this is really,
*  I mean, this is a horrific situation. There's also a whole struggle, you know, against this
*  weaponization, which is very difficult, but this is the, you know, this is part of the way that
*  all the way that we've been thinking about the Holocaust, the way that we've been thinking about
*  anti-Semitism in the last 20 years, from the perspective of states rather than from the
*  perspective of people attacked by states, which should be the legacy of the Holocaust, which should
*  be at the center, right, of Holocaust and genocide studies has now led us here. I'll just say one more
*  thing, that it is exactly if we look now at the voices of Palestinians, at the testimonies of
*  Palestinians from Gaza, from the West Bank, from East Jerusalem, from Israeli Palestinians, from
*  Palestinians around the world, their voices, their testimonies, their perspectives, their accounts
*  are incredibly, especially because of everything I said, are incredibly important to center them,
*  but they also now point to us for a different future, a different kind of Holocaust memory,
*  right, so if once it was the Jewish, it's still the Jewish victims and survivors of the Holocaust
*  who are very central in Holocaust and genocide studies and education and memory,
*  now we also have a potential, right, to think about in a different way than centering the
*  perspective of the state, right, and thinking about anti-Semitism and state violence and all these
*  things, but re-centering the perspective of the people who face state violence, we can do this
*  through the voices and perspectives and testimonies of Palestinians today, so this is also an incredibly
*  important point and points to potential for change, right, and then that again, we're not
*  there at all, right, but we're in the process, there is potential, but there's a long, long way ahead of us.
*  Brilliant stuff as ever, always full of, obviously, informed by your
*  astonishing scholarly work, but also your precision, your moral clarity, let's see,
*  if a British sports personality wishes to cause another mini scandal with our famous, the
*  intellectually curious British media, which always acts in good faith at all times, but I
*  think people can see why Gary Lineker, for a start, was so informed and educated by what you said, and
*  I know when I read through the comments on Twitter, on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, elsewhere, when I
*  posted what you had to say, it had a huge impact, I have to say, and a lot of people, you've educated
*  a huge number of people throughout this horror show, so your work's been so invaluable, so it's
*  always an honour to be able to speak to you, so do like, subscribe, leave your comments, please share
*  the video, make sure everyone hears from what Raz has to say, but Raz Higal, it's always a pleasure,
*  thanks for speaking to me. Thank you and for the opportunity, thank you.
