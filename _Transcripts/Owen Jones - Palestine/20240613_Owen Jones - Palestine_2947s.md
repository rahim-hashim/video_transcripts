# Israel's Strategic Defeat Explained - w. Dr. Alonso Gurmendi
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [June 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCQJ7Ok73q4)
*  Now, just before the International Court of Justice made its first ruling, its Provisional
*  Orders back in January, I spoke to my brilliant guest today, Dr Alonzo Gamendi, who is a superb
*  lecturer of international relations at King's College London, someone who threw out this
*  horror I've always looked to for his huge insight, obviously massive encyclopedic knowledge
*  of international law and just in terms of the sheer level of detail, knowledge, insight,
*  this is someone you really have to listen to, as those who will remember the discussion
*  we had back in January can attest to. So Alonzo, it's great to speak to you again. How are
*  you doing?
*  Thanks Owen, it's great to be here, it's great to be back.
*  I just want to start, I mean, when I spoke to you, it was interesting because where we
*  were at, I mean, it feels like a lifetime away, and that's five over, it was about five
*  months ago, just less than five months ago. And we were waiting on the International Court
*  of Justice's ruling. A lot has happened since, we've had the International Court of Justice
*  itself making provisional, subsequent provisional orders, but the most latest being to order
*  Israel to cease its military offensive in Ra'far. Well, I'll talk a bit about that because
*  that was pro-Israel people tried to spin that, but of course, as well, critically, the international
*  criminal courts chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, made requests for arrest warrants for Netanyahu
*  and his defence minister, Yov Galan, which was still waiting for those requests to be
*  accepted. I just want to say, I mean, in terms of what's happened since then, this strikes
*  me what people need to just be talking more about as Israel has suffered a calamitous
*  strategic defeat, notwithstanding the terrible ruin it's inflicted on Gaza and will continue
*  to inflict.
*  Yeah, look, I think if I compare where I was when we had our first conversation to now,
*  I wouldn't have dreamt of this scenario. I mean, just on, we're in June, like, this case
*  was supposed to last years and developments were supposed to be sparse through the months.
*  And we now have like so many requests for provisional measures and actual ceasefire
*  order. We have the ICC involved. And this has continued to be in the in the tip of the
*  tongue of everyone. I don't mean the war, I mean the law. It's not common for international
*  lawyers to be discussing international law on Twitter for eight months in a row about
*  the same topic over and over again. Moreover, with changing popular perceptions.
*  And I think I think that resonates a lot with what you were saying about this strategic
*  defeat, because, look, I'm a movie buff, and I really enjoy movies. And there's this quote
*  that I just keep having in my head. It's the from The Dark Knight, you know, the Batman
*  movie, where the Joker is talking to, you know, the two face and he says, like, do I
*  look like someone with a plan? I'm a dog chasing cars. I wouldn't know what to do if I ever
*  caught one. And it feels like that's what's happened. Like, Israel got what it
*  wanted. Like the wildest dreams of the Israeli hard right came true. They had the government
*  they needed. They had an enabling government in the United States. And they had free range
*  to do basically anything they wanted after October 7. And they did. I don't think anyone
*  would say that Israel self restrained in its response. And yet the result is that now
*  there's an ICC case, there's a ceasefire order. And perhaps most importantly, at least the
*  way I see it, the status quo has changed. I don't think anyone now would accept going
*  back to the status quo that we had before October 7, where every so often there are
*  Hamas rockets fired into Israel. There is some damage, but generally Israel is able
*  to intercept them. And then Israel goes into Gaza, kills hundreds or thousands of Palestinians.
*  And then that's it. Move on until the next time it happens and the show must go on. And
*  I think the big change that Israel has brought upon itself is that that show has stopped.
*  I don't think anyone would accept that scenario that like, quote unquote, mowing the lawn
*  scenario going forward anymore. So yeah, it is a very big strategic defeat. And I would
*  add that last time we talked, I remember emphasizing that people should not see the case as a,
*  you know, the end game of everything. The most important thing is winning this case
*  at the ICJ. I remember telling you there are other victories that we can achieve in terms
*  of Palestinian rights through this case that aren't related with do we win or do we lose
*  two, three, five years from now. And I think if I were to go back in time and tell Alonso
*  from like a few months ago, hey, this is where we are right now. I mean, I think he would
*  be very surprised. Let's just in terms of how things have changed. Let's start with
*  Palestinian statehood. So before the 7th of October, that had very much vanished from
*  much of the global radar. Many countries on earth had recognized and accepted Palestinian
*  statehood. But you had normalization taking place between Israel and various Arab states,
*  which much of the Palestinians, many Palestinians quite just fabulously thought would just
*  throw them under a bus. That would simply mean accepting that Palestinians would never
*  get national self-determination at all. You've got obviously the vice tightening in the West
*  Bank, cars under total siege. But now you've got a massive shift where you've got various
*  states like Spain, Ireland have come out in support. Israel is furious particularly about
*  Spain and has been waging a war, online war against the Spanish government. And even within
*  Britain, the British political elites have had to now start talking about Palestinian
*  statehood. Now, I mean, a lot of this is just hot air maybe. But what do you think about that?
*  What this in terms of where we've come in terms of just the acceptance of the right of Palestinian
*  national self-determination compared to where we were? Yeah. So I mean, I'm from Peru and I
*  remember the last time that we had like this massive amount of like recognitions of Palestinian
*  statehood, because people are talking a lot about the European states that recognize Palestine. But
*  there's a lot of Caribbean states that also recognize Palestine. And in this numbers game,
*  they count a lot as well. And I remember the last time that happened was in 2011 after like an
*  initiative from Uruguay and Brazil, where South America recognized Palestinian statehood. And that
*  was framed in terms of like, oh, yeah, this is Brazil under Lula, arguing basically that we are
*  no longer the US's backyard. What is the most annoying thorn you can trick the United States
*  with right now? Oh, Palestinian statehood. Okay, so let's do that. And so South America recognized
*  Palestinian statehood. And that was massive. But it was seen in a very small regional context. It
*  didn't really shift the conversation of Palestinian statehood in the centers of hegemonic power.
*  Which is where the difference lies now. In that, like, Ireland, Spain, Norway, are now recognizing
*  Palestinian statehood. And it's become sort of a talking point. It's become and not just, oh,
*  did you see that Brazil recognized Palestine? No, it's just like, what are the arguments for
*  Palestinian statehood? Why should they be why they should not be states are in the discourse. And
*  this is opening space for approaches to Palestinian statehood, like maybe mine that are not mainstream,
*  I think, even among people that do think Palestine is a state. Because the traditional
*  understanding of, oh, when is Palestine, since when is Palestine as a state is 1988, when the
*  PLO declared independence. And my position is different. I think that the mandate system as a
*  system that recognized former Ottoman regions as independent nations, like that's that's the quote
*  from the treaty, they're independent nations, subjected to the control of a mandatory in this
*  case, the United Kingdom. Those were states, they were just some sort of like protectorate state.
*  And so for me, at least, I mean, if Iraq had a king under its protectorate, it was the state,
*  it was just a state subjected to whose sovereignty was subjected to limitations. And I'm arguing,
*  I, my argument is Palestine was a state since the 1920s. And that's usually been a very
*  minoritarian position. And now it's getting an opening because, because it's, it's not just South
*  America recognizing Palestine, it's the debate about Palestinian statehood changing. Israel's
*  long been isolated in the global south. And it made a bet that that didn't really matter. Because
*  if you've got the global hegemon, the United States of America, and its key allies on side,
*  it's not the end of the world. Do you think that calculation has somewhat changed in the last few
*  months that we've seen Thursday growing more hostility from the global global south than ever?
*  And but the global south able to flex its muscles in a way it couldn't before. So I guess my point
*  is, has now animosity has the the the hostility towards the Israeli states project in the global
*  south? Does it now have consequences in a way didn't have consequences?
*  Yeah, well, I think with everything, you need to distinguish states from people. Because, I mean,
*  take, take my country, take Peru, for example, Peru right now, it'll probably go along, you know,
*  General Assembly votes, but it probably won't do anything too radical with regards to Israel, the
*  government would rather be happy with a country that can buy weapons from to oppress demonstrators
*  in Peru. And similarly, like with like other other governments in the region in Latin America, for
*  example, a million in Argentina, until recently Bolsonaro in Brazil. Those are governments that
*  would generally side with with Israel, and then they are voting with them. But I think it's
*  important to note that within the people in the global south, within people I talked to, I discussed
*  friends, you know, family, there is an increased awareness of what is going on to levels that before
*  now before this, you know, Israel's onslaught in Gaza, it was sort of like, again, that thing that
*  happens every once in a while, oh, yeah, the you know, the Israelis are attacking Gaza, what's new,
*  you know, now there's a lot more interest to go deeper. And so there already was a large community
*  of informed people in the global south that were already expressing solidarity with Palestinians
*  because of a shared history of decolonization and oppression, particularly in the Middle East,
*  particularly in like, Latin American left politics. But now, this is creating an impossible
*  situation where like, if this cause I mean, I'm quite astonished that there is an encampment in
*  the Catholic University in Lima, in favor of Palestinian rights and calling for a ceasefire.
*  That's quite astonishing. Catholic University in Lima doesn't buy weapons from Israel or anything
*  like that. But it is an expression of solidarity. So if you turn what is usually just this far away
*  conflict for states that like in Peru, for example, oh, we have a lot of deserts, let's buy
*  technology from the Israelis to make art desert, quote unquote, bloom. You know, if you turn that
*  from a very distant political discussion of just foreign policy into people are actually angry that
*  you are doing this, you create problems at the domestic level, that is a big change that that
*  hasn't happened before. And I don't see it yet necessarily in Peru to a big degree, but in many,
*  many other countries in the global south, outside of the Middle East, especially, it is becoming
*  untenable to just not have at least have a strong position on this.
*  Right.
*  So with the global south, I mean, we've seen obviously, South Africa victimizes that it took
*  Israel to court in the International Court of Justice. And I suppose that that itself showed
*  that the global south was more emboldened and able to flex its muscles in ways it couldn't
*  before. And I suppose with the global north, what's interesting now is government political
*  elites. Now, before when it came to Gaza, they were kind of very containable protest
*  movements, which involved marching, but I mean, they wouldn't even get any coverage. But now they
*  there was actually a much bigger mobilized constituency with a broad layer of public support
*  and sympathy, which didn't exist before, which they have to, they can't ignore. And also, there's
*  the possibility of, well, I think there's the lag between you get a big protest movement and younger
*  generations mobilizing. And then in the long term, you'll see them exercising more power and
*  government to do things like on arms to Israel. So I suppose the global south become more
*  emboldened and more hostile. And the global north as well, which Israel depends on, there's that
*  shift, isn't there, which now is increasingly in a panicking space, sorry, Israel, which is why you
*  can see it lashing out the Spanish government and engaging in kind of like alt-right trolling
*  against the Spanish government, for example.
*  Yeah, I think there's two levels, right? On the one hand, there's the global order changing, as in
*  before, before, and that is not related to Gaza, that's related to broader, broader processes that
*  play. But before, before like 10, 20 years ago, South Africa would not have been able to be
*  sufficiently independent in its foreign policy, even if the government wanted to just file a claim
*  like this, or Chile just joining a ICC referral against Israel. All of these things are possible
*  because the West, as the hegemon is, its power is waning and the world is becoming more
*  multipolar, which has its drawbacks, it's not necessarily super good, but like on this, at least,
*  it is allowing states to emerge as new powers, not necessarily as new hegemons that are going to
*  like bend the rules for their own political advantage, but like South Africa and like Brazil are
*  demonstrating as rule enforcers themselves, saying, we have been at the other end of the double
*  standard sword, and we're not going to let you anymore. And I think that's so valuable, that's so
*  new, that hasn't happened before. And then at the other level is what you were mentioning about the
*  construction of a student movement, a whole generation of young people that have built their
*  political identities on this crisis. Like, I remember my first protest. And I think everyone
*  remembers what they were doing, the things that they protested. And I mean, I grew up surrounded
*  by protests against authoritarianism and against the war in Iraq. That was my formation years.
*  And that shaped how I conceived my own anti-colonial and like democratic identity. And these
*  students that are in encampments around the world now are shaping their own ideas around the
*  conflict in Palestine. And so that is, strategically speaking, these are the students that are going to
*  define politics into the future. Europe is a pretty old place with old people. So the generational
*  change is going to come. And I know there's like, some people trying to make Gen Z, Gen Zionist or
*  something like that. It's not really going to happen. It is a very hard thing to sell to young
*  people of support, bombing people for eight months.
*  With the, I mean, let's talk about the International Court of Justice just quickly, because that's
*  obviously ongoing. And I'm just for those who are kind of genuinely curious what, because this is a
*  process which I think, you know, we've all tried to be clear from the start would take years to
*  adjudicate on. So where just, just where do you, where do you see the process now with the
*  International Court of Justice? What do you think is the important detail for people to know about
*  South Africa's case alleging genocide against the state of Israel at the ICJ and how that is
*  progressing?
*  Yeah, so my original approach to this, I mean, people can watch the first video was, I was scared
*  to be perceived as too negative. Because genocide as a concept in international law is so difficult
*  to prove. To the point where in our record, the only time that a court, the ICJ has said that
*  there's actually a genocide is Serbianich. As in not the wars in Yugoslavia, right, but that
*  specific act of killing 8000 people. And of course, Rwanda, but again, genocides that don't
*  follow the pattern of a systematic extermination with people giving speeches saying, let's kill
*  all the X group are very difficult to prove. And so when we first talked, I wanted your viewers to
*  be mindful of that. And Judge Nolte, the German judge, in his first individual opinion, sort of
*  said what I was expecting the courts to do, which is similar to what happened in Yugoslavia. It's
*  not that the entire thing is a genocide is that there might be a genocide here, or maybe this
*  person said something genocidal and wasn't punished. And so that's why I wanted people to
*  accept that there were other important victories along the way, not just winning the entire thing.
*  But since that conversation, I guess the main change has been this, what Francesca Albanese,
*  the Special Rapporteur of the UN for Palestine calls humanitarian camouflage, or trying to portray
*  the situation as one where humanitarian aid is being given. But in a context where you can't
*  really say that reasonably, because there is a huge famine that everyone is reporting, every
*  single humanitarian actor, every single international organization is reporting this
*  huge famine that just doesn't stop. And we see videos from Gaza of people. And so when you add
*  that structural component, that starvation component, in such a massive level, the argument
*  that no, no, we can isolate specific genocidal acts here and there starts to become weaker. And
*  you can see that in Judge Nolte's own decisions and his own appended individual opinions, where
*  he's still not quite there. He still says, oh, I don't think that there is a genocidal intent has
*  been proven, which he wouldn't. It's still too early to tell. We're not even in the merit space.
*  But I mean, the very fact that there is a ceasefire order, in other words, the way to protect the
*  right of Palestinian people, not to be the victims of a potential genocide, and I'm being as complicated
*  as possible when I say this, so I'm not accused of simplifying it. That itself says the only way to
*  prevent that is if the war stops and humanitarian aid goes in. That's incredible, because then you
*  add the structural component to it. And the idea that the physical destruction of individuals,
*  the specific killings with drones and missiles, that might very well be a genocide, but that is
*  more difficult to prove. The really difficult one for Israel to defend is the starvation campaign.
*  And they have done that. They did not need to do that, really. I mean, they should not have,
*  out of sheer basic human morality. But even if you want to be calculative and engage in this kind
*  of humanitarian camouflage, it's really difficult for me to argue against this claim. How can you
*  say that subjecting 2 million people to starvation is not genocidal?
*  Well, on that, just to move to the International Criminal Court Chief Prosecutor, Karim Khan's
*  request for arrest warrants against two, obviously Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli defence ministers,
*  as well as three Hamas leaders. Because in that, a lot of it focuses on starvation. But it doesn't,
*  it makes clear it hasn't, for example, got Hamas the evidence, for example, yet on the bombing
*  campaign, because it can't access Gaza. So I'm just interested firstly in terms of, well,
*  we don't know, do we, the timeframe in terms of when arrest warrants might be granted? I mean,
*  that could be weeks, months, I don't know what you think about that. But as well, the charges which
*  exist, there are war crimes, crimes against humanity. But what you think about whether they
*  could be expanded? For example, torture is notably absent. And I would say the evidence regarding
*  torture is unbelievably overwhelming. Horrific report in New York Times of Palestinian men being
*  raped with metal rods, including to death. I mean, that's just one example. There's just too much
*  other examples. I just wonder what you thought about that in terms of that, firstly, the timeframe,
*  but actually the ICC Chief Prosecutor's requests may expand those charges. What do you think about
*  the probability of expanding? Because I was interested when he went in that, if you read
*  what he said in the statement, talks about how the Israeli leadership had determined that the
*  Palestinian civilian population had been defined as a military threat to Israel. I mean, you look
*  at that and the crime extermination in that, it just, I don't know how you can't arrive at genocide
*  as a charge, but I don't know what your thoughts are. You know, I think it's quite likely that the
*  charges will be expanded. I think maybe that was one of the things that the people should have
*  reacted with more, give Karim Khan a little bit more credit because yes, he took too long, but the
*  fact that we have this request and that it was done, I mean, it was a very carefully crafted
*  request. It had this extra panel of experts to sort of like validate and justify his own claims,
*  fully aware that there are pressures, as we have seen, there are very strong political pressures
*  going on behind closed doors to prevent these things from happening. So he, being very aware
*  of that, he crafts these requests. Does the request public? The request did not need to be
*  public. Essentially with what he had and with what he could prove at this time without having access
*  to events in the ground. He cannot send teams to Gaza to investigate. So he's working,
*  evidentially speaking, he's working with interviews from people who have been in Gaza or people in
*  Gaza talking like hospital workers, doctors, survivors, humanitarian workers, but that is
*  difficult without access to evidence on the ground. So I think this request is the result of
*  what could be done given the circumstances, but just the fact that it was done is itself
*  quite remarkable, not just because of the history that, well, recently, I think it was the Guardian
*  and Harrods that revealed that the previous prosecutor had tried to move ahead with
*  investigations and essentially got threatened mafia style, not to, I mean,
*  reports that of course should be investigated probably by the ICC itself,
*  under its own statute for interfering with international justice. But if true, then they're
*  quite astounding. They show a machinery in place to prevent accountability. And we have had cases
*  like close calls, the Mavi Marmara case, for example, was going to be investigated by the ICC
*  and then wasn't. And in the past, not just with Israel, the situation in Afghanistan, for example,
*  is not really looking into US crimes. I mean, I don't know what happened there, of course,
*  but the legal reasons is like, oh, we cannot really focus on that. Right now, we're going to
*  focus on Taliban crimes. So that was very disappointing for the human rights community.
*  So the fact that this happened shows, well, I think it shows two things. It shows that
*  it was that impossible not to act. And two, it speaks well of the prosecutor who has had mishaps,
*  who hasn't fixed all the problems like with the Afghanistan situation. But the fact that he did
*  this, knowing full well that the ICC would probably be sanctioned, I mean, tip of the hat to him,
*  because that was a good thing to do. So yeah, I think given where we are at, I think this request
*  will definitely be expanded in the future. I mean, because if we look at this, it looks
*  like Israeli impunity is collapsing in terms of the increasingly assertive global south,
*  the political elites of the global north under growing pressure, the ICJ has been forced to act,
*  the ICC chief prosecutor has now decisively acted. But at the same time, if you look at
*  the Israeli state in terms of its starvation program, let's just call it what it is,
*  in Gaza has escalated. I mean, since the offensive on Ra'far, aid has collapsed again,
*  northern Gaza is in a catastrophic state. The fact that this week, the official Israeli Twitter
*  account tweeted out, we need to talk about the elephant in the room, many guards and civilians
*  participating in the horrific events of October 7th. It was also reported that guards and civilians
*  held Israeli hostages, kept in their homes, the world must condemn this in the strongest terms,
*  and then included an excerpt of an Israeli hostage who declared there were no innocent civilians there
*  and then made a big bold quote, had some account from Israel going, well, that's not Israel saying
*  that, that's a hostage saying it, they're just including what her lived experience, her truth,
*  well, it's like, oh, fuck off. They also included that. It's just, I'm sorry, you just listen to
*  this. You think we're stupid, don't you? These fanatics. You honestly think we're thick. But
*  the point there is, they put that out and they paid for it to be an ad. So they paid to promote
*  it across the world. They paid Elon, not Elon Levy, sorry, Elon Musk. Elon Levy is another,
*  someone else who should go to jail. No, Elon Musk to promote this. The point they're making is,
*  that's just striking evidence of genocidal intent. And it's just saying that
*  Israeli, that Gaza civilians all have collective guilt, therefore they're fair game. I mean,
*  I'm just saying they're not acting as though their impunity is collapsing. So what gives,
*  is it just the sheer level of genocidal mania is just a block on that?
*  I think there's just two things here. One is arguments are running out. And the other one is
*  that the old reliable arguments are being scrutinized in ways that they weren't before.
*  So look, honestly, international humanitarian law is premised on the idea that civilians need to be
*  protected. Civilians and non-combatants need to be protected. And yes, I mean, from a perspective
*  of like moral philosophy, there are theories that espouse like who gets claim to innocence.
*  And there are, you know, just war philosophers that would argue that like, it was not immoral to drop
*  an atomic bomb in Japan because Japanese people were in favor of their government. And these are
*  philosophical discussions that exist. But I think when you put them in black and white,
*  it just doesn't resonate with basic, you know, people, the way people think.
*  And what actually resonates is the idea of humanitarian law as in, and don't get me wrong,
*  humanitarian law has a lot of problems. We can talk about that. But at least from a simplified,
*  you know, international committee of the Red Cross version of humanitarianism, the main idea is
*  civilians should be protected. And this applies to like everything. It also applies to Israeli
*  civilians. Like part of the issue with this is that dehumanization, the idea of you attack
*  my civilians, therefore I will attack your civilians was the first thing that had to go
*  in when humanitarianism was invented. Like back in the 1800s, really the 1800s,
*  the way the ICRC, the Red Cross was created was this, Henry Dunand, this merchant was
*  traveling and all of a sudden he comes across a field where a battle had been fought. And he was
*  shocked by the fact that only the local soldiers were being treated. If you belong to the enemy,
*  you were not treated because you're the enemy. So who cares about you? That is the principle that
*  inspired the ICRC, the Red Cross and the entire humanitarian movement, that it doesn't matter if
*  you're the enemy. Once you are not a combatant, or if you're a civilian, you need to be protected.
*  This is what allows us to condemn October 7th. And it is shocking to me how in the face of these
*  legal arguments no longer working, like you cannot make a legal argument for why actually you can
*  dress up as doctors and invade a hospital. Then the arguments start becoming quite bracingly
*  terroristic. As in this is the kind of things that terrorist groups say. There are no innocent
*  civilians. That's letter to America from Bin Laden, right? There's no innocent Americans.
*  So when you start thinking about that, yes, there is a legal component to this. There's a, of course,
*  there's someone in South Africa right now with a folder writing all of these things down and putting
*  them in. But from a more, we're talking about this new generation that's forming their politics as we
*  speak. From that perspective, because they have run out of arguments for the broader discourse,
*  they are now basically talking in a really small bubble. And before you could see how they were
*  struggling to balance what they could say for an Israeli audience that is favorable to this government
*  and what they had to say for the public sphere. I think that internal debate has collapsed and they
*  acknowledged that they cannot win the public debate. And so they're just talking for their bubble.
*  And to the point where, I mean, you have conservative outlooks, outputs in the UK
*  that are starting to sound reasonable. I'm agreeing with Piers Morgan much more than I
*  usually do. And I don't usually agree a lot with him. Israel really has, the Israeli state really
*  does have a lot to answer for. Just another point, I just want to see what you thought about it. It's
*  just how far you think thought the legal net might end up being cast. Because as much as clearly
*  Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Galan, the evidence that they have committed crimes against humanity
*  and war crimes is overwhelming. And clearly we're talking about the prime minister and the defense
*  minister. Fine. But it would be a terrible, terrible, grievous error to suggest that they alone
*  are responsible for what I would regard as one of the great crimes of our age. How far do you, I mean,
*  what about, I mean, IDF soldiers for a start. I mean, I don't want to, I mean, you did set a very
*  clear precedent that I was following orders is an excuse. I'm not doing that just to draw a parallel
*  with a very different specific genocide that committed World War II. But I'm just saying there
*  was a general principle there. But also, I mean, I mentioned Elon Levy there by accident.
*  He keeps tweeting at me, so I just keep responding that you're going to go to jail. It might take 10,
*  20, 30 years, but you are definitely going to prison. And the reason I raise that is, I mean,
*  I don't know, I mean, that guy, I don't use sociopath lightly because it's quite an easy
*  facile thing to do to pathologize horror. And it makes it easier to imagine that actually these
*  terrible horrors aren't court created, you know, those responsible, there's something wrong with
*  them, but actually they're just fellow human beings. But you know, that guy would fail, fail in
*  block test is all I'm saying. The point I'm making is how far do you think, because, you know,
*  the genocide convention, 1948 has five crimes. It criminalizes five crimes. And one of them is,
*  for example, complicity in genocide, as well as public incitement of genocide, which Israel is
*  duty bound to prosecute and has failed to do so. So I'm just wondering how far do you think,
*  I mean, because it would just be ridiculous if those are the only thing, frankly, who face
*  some form of justice. I think that would be absurd. Yeah, I mean, I think international justice is
*  usually more concerned with those with the gravest responsibility, the main responsible parties. So
*  like the Nuremberg trials dealt with, you know, the Nazi leadership, for example, right. So
*  international justice doesn't, I mean, it can, but usually doesn't focus on, you know, the foot
*  soldier, right. That is why domestic litigation is important. And I know there are like, efforts in
*  place right now in the UK to like, lodge war crimes, accusations in domestic law under universal
*  jurisdiction to claim that if a British citizen or even someone who's not a British citizen commits
*  war crimes and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions in Gaza, and then comes establishes
*  presence in the United Kingdom, then they should be investigated for war crimes. So I've mentioned
*  Tayyip Ali, a solicitor a couple of times, and he's leading the charge on that. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
*  Yeah, that's what I was referring to. So there is, let's call it a collaboration between
*  international justice and domestic justice to achieve full accountability. And this is where
*  it gets interesting, because at the end of the day, the main responsible party for achieving
*  accountability is the state itself. Like the way the ICC is premised is, it's almost as if
*  we're the last resort. If you don't do it, we'll do it. And so that's prompted a really interesting
*  conversation, even in Israel itself, and among Israeli scholars, and like, of what would Israel
*  need to do to avoid ending up with more people in the Hague, or even can you save Netanyahu from
*  the Hague? And so for example, there's a lot of discussions right now about whether a parliamentary
*  commission, an inquiry commission, would suffice. And there's a lot of debates between like lawyers
*  on Twitter right now on does that suffice? And of course, I mean, for me at least, it's pretty clear
*  that the answer is no, because the arguments for complementarity require that the same individual
*  be investigated in a credible independent court for the same conduct. So just because you're
*  investigating if maybe some crime was committed at a not a court, that wouldn't satisfy the
*  requirement for complementarity. But just the fact that you're discussing that, like leading,
*  even if it doesn't trigger a successful complementarity challenge by Israel, and
*  and then Netanyahu ends up in Israel being judged in Israel, even if it's just a parliamentary
*  commission in Israel, that itself is huge. That is, I mean, that would be welcomed. It's not enough,
*  but it will be welcomed, right? And that is something that international law and international
*  legal mechanisms have pushed Israel to do, to have to try and save, let's say, their prime minister
*  from international justice. So there's three components, right? There's on the one hand,
*  there's the international justice itself going after those with most responsibility,
*  domestic courts all over the world, also engaging in accountability at the domestic level.
*  And then it's what's going to happen in Israel itself. And I know it sounds absurd. It's always
*  absurd. Like a country will judge its own autocrat. It feels insane. But like, I'm from,
*  as someone from Peru, we have, I think we've put five, six former presidents in jail. We have a
*  specific jail for former presidents in Peru, which is actually very proud of. But we put our own,
*  like our own human rights violator, Fujimori, Alberto Fujimori, in jail. And so it can't happen
*  eventually. It takes time, but it can happen. So all of these mechanisms that are in, you know,
*  floating in the air right now are pushing things in the right direction. They're pushing slowly,
*  but they are pushing. It's just like, you know, Palestinian statehood where like one state declares
*  then another and another and another, and it builds up. It's the same one step at a time.
*  You start pushing for accountability and you might be surprised where you end up.
*  Just like this, you might just, this is so ludicrous. What I'm about to suggest,
*  you might just go, this is, I don't, I'm not going to engage in this. But so for example,
*  if, I mean, look, if the arrest warrant requests aren't accepted, I would regard that as completely
*  outrageous and ridiculous. And I think it would, the odds are very, very small that that would
*  happen. So I think we just presume the arrest warrants get accepted. If say a year after
*  Netanyahu ends, his premiership ends, if the secret services of another country sweeped in,
*  took him out of Israel, would he be, would that, would he be put on trial at the ICC?
*  As in if they talk, if they talk, if some secret agents went in, literally took it,
*  like just dragged him out of the country. I don't know.
*  This is the plot of the dark night.
*  There we go. You put it in my head. The dark night's in my head.
*  So, okay. That's an interesting discussion because there's actually legal disagreement
*  about how to establish the jurisdiction of a court and it varies from country to country.
*  I am not sure how that would work in the ICC. But say, for example, that's how Eichmann ended
*  up in Israel. Well, that's what I did think that, yeah. But like there are cases all around the
*  world where the manner in which a defendant arrives in court matters for jurisdictional purpose. So
*  for example, in Peru, if you're kidnapped and brought to Peru, then that would not make
*  jurisdiction possible. You will be invalidating jurisdiction. If you're in the United States,
*  I mean, there has the Supreme Court, there has ruled that if the border patrol kidnaps you from
*  Mexico and takes you to the US, then that's fine. So it really varies. And I'm not so sure how that
*  would work in the ICC. Just because if the arrest warrant request got accepted and when he's no
*  longer prime minister of Israel, you could just see a whole industry of people determined to get
*  Netanyahu out of Israel and put him on trial. Yeah. I mean, again, it depends on where,
*  what jurisdiction. And I think, I mean, when we start discussing different jurisdictions,
*  there's also another component here that popped into my mind. It's just this, another thing that's
*  changed, this claim that Israel cannot be singled out and that there's a separate standard for
*  Israel and then for the rest of the world, which I've always considered very vacuous, very weak,
*  because it only works if you accept that Israel needs to put on the same pedestal as the United
*  States, Russia, China, states that have sufficient power to bend the rules in their favor. If you
*  put Israel in the same normal category as every other state, and I say this as someone who
*  has, is from a country that had an armed conflict and we prosecuted our own military and our own
*  president, then it's not being singled out. It's just being asked to do what every other state that
*  goes through these things does, like truth commission, trials, put people in jail, work
*  to understand how is it that your country ended up doing that horrible thing. And this brings me back
*  to my own experience as someone who had his own terrorist group attacking the country.
*  It's not a... It's not a easy situation. The shining path. Yeah, the shining path. Exactly.
*  And there were others, the MRTA and all that. And this idea that Israel is being singled out
*  flies in the face of how similar I see both experiences. In Peru, we have a word, it's called
*  it's essentially it's a verb. It basically means to falsely accuse someone of terrorism.
*  I guess the translation would be the but Hamas, right? Or blah, blah is Hamas. And that is how
*  societies that deal with this, like the vulnerability of being attacked, the idea of
*  thinking, wow, there are people who really wouldn't mind if I died. That does something to the mind.
*  But it's not something that many people can experience. I mean, particularly in the global
*  north, I mean, it's not very common to just if you say goodbye to your loved ones, you expect that
*  they will get back home in the evening. When I was little, that wasn't necessarily the case.
*  And so that does things to the mind. And that breaks up a society. It really shatters
*  inner morality here. And you just want vengeance. And it takes time, because individuals will get
*  to the no, this is immoral, we cannot become monsters to fight our monsters. Sure. But societies
*  in general, don't. It's not it's not that easy. People don't work like that. So there are processes
*  in place all over the world to try to deal with atrocity crimes in ways that heal societies.
*  We Peru had a truth commission. Yeah. And we put presidents in jail. And even with all that,
*  we're still dealing with the terraccio with the idea of calling people terrorists as a way to
*  delegitimize them. And so we're still not done. Our truth commission is from 2003. It's 2024.
*  We're still not done. And our Congress just passed another amnesty law for the military
*  in their fight against the shining path to try to produce impunity. Israel has never done that,
*  ever. Much like the United States has not done that. The UK had a few trials, but nothing big.
*  Because it still expects to be placed in that pedestal. And I think it would be even
*  even healthy for Israeli society to have that conversation. So all of these things that have
*  changed, we tend to frame them from the perspective of you started saying like Israel's impunity has
*  disappeared or stuff like that. We can also see them in a different way. In that actually,
*  Israel is slowly being normalized. Not in the technical sense, but in the
*  it's becoming, it's experienced to terrorism and it's experienced with conflict. It's becoming more
*  average. It is expected of Israel now to hold accountability trials for its own war criminals.
*  And that doesn't, this is a discussion that I get a lot in Peru. That doesn't mean that you need to
*  say that the shining path is a bunch of angels that didn't do anything horrible or Hamas. You
*  don't need to love Hamas. It does mean that how you win matters. And these kinds of conflicts,
*  they try to put you in a position where you say, no, no, I just want to win. I don't care what
*  happens. I just want to win. And when that happens, if that happens, hopefully it happens,
*  when Israeli society gets to that point, it will discover that it is not actually being singled out.
*  It is actually being incorporated into a very large community of people all over the world that
*  have gone through the same thing as Israel and have had to deal with crimes committed in their names
*  and healed or improved. So I think that is the positive outcome of everything that's changed
*  since the last time we talked is that possibility, that option. To me, I'm a strong believer.
*  I am a harsh critic of the Peruvian reconciliation process. I think it's very much failed in many
*  regards, but I'm a strong defender of us having started that process because I feel that our
*  society was broken, as broken potentially as this idea of just kill them all as Israel right now.
*  I remember talking to people several years ago in Peru and saying, but you cannot just kill 100,000
*  people to end the shining path. And someone actually once told me, why not? And so I think
*  the positive outlook is, yeah, Israel is not being singled out for its reaction to Hamas. It is
*  actually finally becoming a little bit like everyone else. I think that's a very powerful
*  place to end optimistic in terms of what that might mean for accountability. But I think
*  as we've established, Israel's position is far, far weaker than it was. It's impunity dissolving
*  in front of us. It's what was an extremely strong position with all the cards in its hands that has
*  shifted. And the direction of travel as things stand is only headed in one direction, though we
*  will see. So it was brilliant as ever, Alonzo, to have your incredible expertise as it was earlier
*  this year. We will continue to speak as this horror continues, but hopefully with some optimism. So
*  please like and subscribe for those watching. Leave your comments. Love to hear your thoughts
*  as ever. But thank you so much, Alonzo. I really appreciate it as ever. Brilliant stuff.
