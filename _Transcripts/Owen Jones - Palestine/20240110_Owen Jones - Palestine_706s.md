# Israeli War Crimes ACCIDENTALLY Exposed By David Cameron
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0YpkpPROWM)
*  Before we watch David Cameron squirm, sorry Lord Cameron, who's moved on from his previous
*  vocation of wrecking Britain to making a comeback as Foreign Secretary, let's just be very clear.
*  The British government knows that Israel is in violation, serious violation, of international
*  humanitarian law and the legal norms that govern the conduct of warfare. How do we know this?
*  Because for a start the violations are so rampant and egregious and frankly boasted about publicly,
*  repeatedly in fact by Israeli leaders, army officers, you name it. Indeed the British
*  government, more to the point, has top lawyers who clearly can tell politicians what the legal
*  position is. So what we're going to watch here is a lot of squirming, obfuscation, muddying of waters,
*  pretending stupidity and hand up forgetfulness. This shouldn't be treated as an endearing Hugh
*  Grant style carnival of posh Britishness. Oh golly gosh, I'm the faintest of these constitute war
*  crimes, silly on me. I feel awfully sorry about that, really I do. It should be treated as a
*  confession because Britain is facilitating what it must know to be war crimes and from which David
*  Cameron's performance we can clearly tell it knows to be the case. Now Lord Cameron had to attend a
*  session of the House of Commons for an Affairs Select Committee that's chaired by the Conservative
*  MP Alicia Kearns who's done a pretty good job I would say at scrutinizing the onslaught against
*  Gaza. Not often, you hear me praising a Tory, let's be honest, it is all relative but needs most and
*  she's certainly done a lot better than the leader of the opposition who initially backed the war
*  crimes of cutting off water and energy to a civilian population. Speaking of water, let's just
*  begin with Brendan O'Hara. He's the SNP MP for Argyle and Boots and he had some generally
*  excellent questions about this. About two or three minutes ago and as I replied to the chair,
*  you said and I quote, one of the things we'd like the Israelis to do is switch the water back on.
*  Now that says that they turned it off, it says that you recognize they have the power to turn it on,
*  therefore isn't turning water off and having the ability to turn it back on but choosing not to,
*  isn't that a breach of international humanitarian law? It's just something they ought to do in my
*  view. Of course they should do it, every human being would say you don't cut people's water
*  supply off but I'm asking you in your position as Foreign Secretary, around the point of international
*  humanitarian law, if Israel have the power to turn the water back on that they turned off, surely that
*  is a flagrant breach of international humanitarian law? Well I'm not a lawyer, my view is they ought
*  to switch it on because the north of Gaza, the conflict is now effectively over there and so
*  getting more water and power into northern Gaza would be a very good thing to do. You don't have
*  to be a lawyer to make a judgment about that, you just have to be a human being. Give me, Sir Philip,
*  under international obligations do occupying powers have an obligation to provide access to
*  water, yes or no? You're asking me a technical legal question. Sir Philip, I'm really, forgive me,
*  you and I have played this dance enough times, we all know that under international law there
*  is an obligation for occupying powers to provide water. You're asking me a technical question about
*  occupying powers and what their obligations are in international law, I imagine you're correct
*  Chair but I'm also not a, not a lawyer, I also just would point out I don't... Just bear in mind, we want to have,
*  we've come to such a good place working with you because we have the confidence that you do know
*  these details and that's what your colleagues say, you know that it's not that you presume I'm
*  correct, that is the duty on an occupying power. Yeah, so Chair I think that is right, so yes,
*  but I would also add that in answering your questions earlier about occupying, occupying...
*  I'm not asking you to apply it to Israel, the facts are though that they are required to.
*  Okay well this is an obvious one isn't it, Lord Cameron and his civil servant are snookered there.
*  Brendan O'Hara notes Lord Cameron has said Britain would like Israel to turn the water back on,
*  ergo, Israel turn it off, ergo, Israel have the power to turn it back on, ergo, Israel are choosing
*  not to do so, ergo, a lot of ergos, Israel is deliberately depriving a civilian population
*  of one of the basic necessities of life. There we go, straightforward violation of international
*  law which David Cameron's accidentally admitted to on behalf of Israel, both in terms of collective
*  punishment, that's Article 33 of the Geneva Convention, we're going to go all technical about
*  it, and in terms of the legal obligations as set out of an occupying power. Now David Cameron,
*  Lord Cameron, here tries to swerve this obvious basic fact by trying to make it a mere question
*  of humanity. Now the one quibble I'd have with O'Hara's otherwise excellent line of questioning
*  is he responds to Cameron's attempt to derail these questions by saying every human being would
*  say we shouldn't cut off water, well alas those cutting off water to civilians are human beings,
*  important point to make because it can sometimes be easy to forget those responsible for abominable
*  atrocities are fellow human beings, alas they are. Instead David Cameron also falls back on it,
*  oh no I'm not a lawyer, hold on mate I don't want to sound too pointed here but you are Foreign
*  Secretary I think you need a working understanding of the basic fundamentals of international law
*  to do your job. I'm not a lawyer either, I'm just some journalist, I'm not the Foreign Secretary,
*  more to the point, I don't have a massive team of lawyers at my disposal either. Google as it turns
*  out is actually sufficient, is he really saying that little or me here knows more about international
*  law than him, if so does he want to swap jobs? And then it really does descend into farce when Sir
*  Philip Barton, that guy by the way is the top civil servant at the Foreign Office, in response
*  to Alicia Kearns rightly making clear that under international obligations occupying powers have an
*  obligation to provide access to water, he goes on and babbles about having a technical question,
*  a really pathetic attempt to avoid being quoted on the record as agreeing that this is indeed
*  international law because it would therefore logically follow that he has conceded Israel
*  is in violation of international law. So he falls on back on this passive aggressive sounding,
*  oh I imagine you're correct, that's why Alicia Kearns is quite correct to take on this wilfully
*  slippery performance. It's clear from this performance that the British government knows
*  Israel stands in violation of international law. So if David Cameron can just insult everyone's
*  intelligence by pretending he doesn't know international law because he's not a lawyer,
*  he's only the Foreign Secretary, the obvious question which then follows is the legal advice
*  he has received from actual lawyers. And just a little camera just to clarify, so you have received
*  no advice at any point from any government lawyer that states that Israel is in breach of
*  international humanitarian law? That's not what I said. No that's why I'm asking you to clarify.
*  Yes well I'm going to give exactly the same answer all over again which is what my role is, right?
*  I'm not interested in the role, I'm interested in the legal advice you've received. Yes well the
*  legal advice I've received is consistent with the fact that we have not changed our export.
*  It's not about arms exports, it's about international humanitarian law being upheld
*  when it comes to aid, when it comes to the way in which it strikes have been prosecuted,
*  everything else. One question on arms exports, we've moved from them
*  in any realm, in any respect. So you've never had a piece of paper put in front of you by a foreign
*  office lawyer that says that Israel is in breach of its international humanitarian commitments under
*  international humanitarian law? Look the reason for not answering this question, I can't recall
*  every single bit of paper that's been put in front of me. Slippery so and so isn't he? Now
*  Lord Cameron can clearly piss around here but doesn't mean we have to does it? He's clearly
*  received advice that Israel is in breach of international humanitarian law. You can tell
*  that by his transparent attempts to avoid answering the question by making irrelevant
*  points about his role as for I can't recall every bit of paper put in front of me. Well probably
*  not but I would imagine he's capable of distinguishing between the relative importance
*  of various bits of paper. If I was the Foreign Secretary of a government openly backing the
*  military onslaught of a foreign power I think I'd probably pay a little bit of attention to
*  bits of paper setting up the formal legal position. Don't you? Also he says this separately in his
*  testimony. We have to check regularly whether that is in compliance with international humanitarian
*  law and assess that. We have to check regularly whether that's in compliance with international
*  humanitarian law and assess that. Okay so you probably are reading those bits of paper then
*  so what do they say Lord Cameron? Now finally and this really is just well wretched really
*  and it does speak for itself. He's asked about that interview with the Israeli ambassadors of
*  the UK Zippy Hotebele who makes it clear in that interview she sees no other option than the total
*  destruction of Gaza and he's asked about whether that is the official position of the Israeli
*  government. Sir Foreign Secretary what assessment have you made of the Israeli ambassador's claim
*  that every school mosque and every second house in Gaza has access to tunnels and ammunition?
*  Now she said that in a television interview and when pressed on whether that means the
*  complete destruction of Gaza by Israel she replied and I quote do you have another solution? So in
*  your opinion was she freelancing when she was speaking to that television interviewer or was
*  she speaking for the Israeli government? I don't agree with that approach look if you're asking me
*  No I'm not asking you about the approach I'm asking you do you think she was speaking to the
*  government or was she freelancing? I don't know. Where to begin? Firstly note how Lord Cameron
*  described Zippy Hotebele's comments as an approach well that's one way to describe genocide isn't it
*  and yes backing the total destruction of Gaza is clearly genocidal in intent I don't think we need
*  to faff around here but his answer as to whether it's the official position of the Israeli government
*  I don't know. I don't know. Look maybe I'm unreasonable maybe I'm asking from the moon on a
*  stick here but I kind of feel the Foreign Secretary of the UK backing a foreign power in Gaza a massive
*  military onslaught should have a rather better answer to is that power intent on the total
*  destruction of the territories invading than I don't know. Seems maybe like that's something
*  worth checking out getting a little bit of clarity on maybe give them a ring they've already severely
*  damaged or destroyed 70% of Gaza's housing stock so it doesn't seem does it like a far-fetched war
*  aim? Look this whole farce of a hearing it is a farce is deeply revealing Lord Cameron has long
*  revealed himself to be a slick communicator who excels in deflection and general slipperiness
*  that's his one major skill I'd argue unless you consider inflicting catastrophic damage on the
*  social fabric of a nation is a skill and he put that skill into clear operation here but it's
*  very obvious from this performance that Lord Cameron knows Israel is in flagrant violation of
*  international law it's been declared the British government knows Israel is in flagrant violation
*  of international law it is rare that a country has not only been so screamingly in violation of
*  international law but has also repeatedly jumped up and down and broadcasting to the world full of
*  pride as it turns out that it is in violation of international law now history will damn that will
*  damn Israel's rulers for what they have done I have very little doubt about that but when they
*  look back at the footage of parliamentary sessions like this of statements issued by powers backing
*  this great crime they will damn those who are complicit in one of the great horrors of our age
*  please like and subscribe do keep the show on the road on patreon.com we've got so many interviews
*  to come and videos about what's actually happening not least on South Africa's
*  genocide case at the International Court of Justice this week so stay tuned for that and I'll speak to you soon.
