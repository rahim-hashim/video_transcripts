# Israelâ€™s OUTRAGEOUS Gaza Lie Debunked
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [December 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2wgIO4SuYc)
*  The endless misinformation from the Israeli state is becoming truly desperate, dangerously desperate,
*  as this latest example really underlines. I mean, I guess, I suppose you have a dilemma if your
*  state engaged in brutal collective punishment, which several genocide scholars have described as
*  genocide. What do you do if you've killed around 20,000 people, mostly women and children, injured
*  tens of thousands more, many grievously, displaced most of the entire civilian population, dropped
*  more than two Hiroshima bombs worth of explosives on an area the size of East London visibly
*  laying ruin to much of it? Well, in the case of the Israeli state, the answer is simple.
*  Lie. Muddy the waters sow doubt and confusion, turn reality up on its head. On the one hand,
*  that has meant claiming the grotesquely high fatality figures are actually falsified Hamas
*  propaganda, that it's not real, you shouldn't believe that. Even though Gaza's official death
*  dollars been validated by Israel and the United Nations in previous conflicts, even though the
*  prestigious medical journal, the Lancet said these figures are not being inflated, even though the
*  figures are actually an underestimate because they exclude thousands dead buried under the rubble,
*  their deaths not certified. It's also meant claiming grieving Palestinian parents are faking
*  their own baby's death by using dolls. The Israeli state has not stinted in its attempt to encourage
*  denialism about the catastrophic human cost of what should rightly be described, at the very least,
*  frankly, as a massacre. But just look at the latest example. A graph has been shared by the Israeli
*  spokesperson, Ilan Levy, who you will have seen on our screens propagandizing as Israeli forces
*  engage in what multiple independent experts and NGOs and legal brains have described as serious
*  war crimes. It's a graph which supposedly shows civilian deaths per airstrike in 21st century global
*  conflicts. So it shows that the global average is 4.5 civilian deaths per airstrike. In Mosul,
*  that was 17.1 civilian deaths per airstrike, it supposedly shows in 2017. 21.7 civilian deaths
*  per airstrike in Aleppo, Syria and 11.95 in Raqqa, Syria. It then claims that in Gaza, the figure is
*  just 0.8 civilian deaths per strike. Now, Ilan Levy declares since Hamas launched this war,
*  the Israeli air force has struck 22,000 plus targets in the Gaza Strip. Even based on Hamas
*  numbers passing off terrorists to civilians, that's less than 0.8 civilian deaths per airstrike.
*  That's what world-leading position looks like. Hmm. Now, first off, before we take apart the
*  egregious misinformation in this claim, over 22,000 targets. Remember Gaza is the size of East London,
*  with a population of 2.2 million, well, before this war began. How on earth is it plausible to
*  argue there are 22,000 military targets? What are these targets? Who are these targets? Now,
*  the recent expose by the Israeli-Palestinian publication Plus 970 magazine found that the
*  Israeli forces were deliberately targeting so-called power targets, like high-rise flats,
*  to put pressure on the civilian population. It's also notable that work by BBC Verify at the
*  beginning of this month found that nearly 98,000 buildings in Gaza were damaged or destroyed.
*  But this is a deceit, this graph. This graph, shared by this Israeli spokesperson, relies on
*  figures from the London-based NGO Action on Armed Violence. Its executive director, who I've met,
*  is Dr Ian Overton. He writes in response, this is not true and I run the charity whose data you are
*  citing. Please delete. We don't record every airstrike, just the ones that harm people. So
*  they're not comparing like and like here, not even close. What the dishonest graph does in Gaza's
*  case is compare literally every single strike, every single airstrike, well in the other cases,
*  it's just every strike which causes recorded harm to people. Now Eli Kovasz, the so-called Middle
*  East expert in Israel, who published this graph, which was then shared by the Israeli spokesperson,
*  engaged in a conversation with Dr Overton, refusing to delete the treat, suggesting a community
*  note instead. Now as Dr Overton says, this is first year undergraduate error stuff, though come
*  on, I think that is, I think perhaps, generous in its description about what's happened here.
*  Please delete. You've got the data wrong, you cannot compare like for like. Well none of these
*  people have deleted their misinformation and Kovasz has gone on to hide the tweets calling him out.
*  Now as it happens, as the Times of Israel reports, the Israel Defense Force, primarily believes the
*  overall Gaza death toll claimed by Hamas is fairly accurate and based on their estimates,
*  that more civilians have been killed than Hamas operatives. So all these claims that actually the
*  death toll isn't real, it's Hamas propaganda and actually it's mostly Hamas fighters who have been
*  killed, privately, these people don't actually believe this either. Indeed a new study by the
*  Israeli newspaper Haaretz is entitled, the Israeli army has dropped the restraints in Gaza and the
*  data shows unprecedented killing. Now this study in its own right is deeply chilling and revealing.
*  Their estimates about civilian deaths in Israeli strikes, it should be said, are surely conservative.
*  What the study does is strip out those who are clearly non-combatants like minors aged 17 and
*  under, men of 16 and above and women. Now previous research by the highly respected Iraq body count
*  suggests that the modest excess of adult males could be accounted for. This was at the end of
*  October when after Biden sowed doubt in the official figures, then what happened is the
*  health ministry in Gaza released names, ages and IDs. Israel approved IDs of those who'd been
*  killed to prove they were actually accurate. This was therefore copper bottom data and they
*  suggested the modest excess of adult males could be accounted for by their greater exposure to risk.
*  For example in rescue efforts, just because you're a man of fighting age it doesn't mean you're
*  actually a man who is fighting. Many adult men are clearly not competent. That is a very important
*  point to make. Remember that the Srebrenica massacre of 1995 conducted by Bosnian Serb forces
*  who killed more than 8 000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys did so on the basis they were of fighting age.
*  Now the Haaretz research also suggests that Eron rockets could make up 10 percent of the total
*  rockets fired by Gaza's forces which I'm sure would be contested not least because we don't know
*  obviously for sure what that means in terms of the death toll even if you you say you these
*  Eron rockets if you look at a lot of these Eron rockets or the rockets used by Hamas and other
*  groups they're not exactly very effective to say the least certainly not compared to those used by
*  Israel. That's not to say that they haven't caused death and killed Israeli civilians
*  in the past but overwhelmingly they are of nowhere near the quality of an Israeli weapon clearly.
*  Now even using their conservative methodology that means 61 percent of those killed are civilians
*  using that estimate looking at wars after World War II about half of those killed in those wars
*  were civilians so half compared to 61 percent in this conservative estimate including those wars
*  which focused on ground combat rather than the supposedly relatively precise means of airstrikes.
*  So according to research published by the Financial Times the devastation of northern
*  Gaza in less than six weeks has approached that caused by the carpet bombing of German cities
*  during the second world war but note that carpet bombing was over several years obviously the war
*  World War II went on for six years not all of that obviously involved bombing of of cities but it did
*  include several years. Now around 68 percent of the buildings of northern Gaza have at least 50
*  percent damage which would clearly leave them inhabitable. In Hamburg after many years it was
*  75 percent and also after many years in Cologne 61 percent in Dresden 59 percent. Now there are
*  precedents often conjured up by Israeli apologists these are precedents often conjured up by Israeli
*  apologists they go well this look at the allied bombing of World War II in German cities well again
*  as we've said this is in a much shorter space of time notably also that was before the Geneva
*  Conventions were established after World War II which forbid for example the collective punishment
*  of civilians the fire bombing of Dresden would be classed as a war crime by our current modern
*  standards but let's be clear Nazi Germany was a military superpower which had conquered almost
*  the entire European continent slaughtered tens of millions of people. Gaza is a tiny strip which
*  isn't even an independent state it's been subjected to the longest siege in modern history it's under
*  international law it's regarded as being under occupation because everything that comes in and
*  out is controlled by another power as well as air space sea and so on it has a primitive military
*  capacity notes the Hamas led attack on 7th of October again in which terrible atrocities were
*  committed including the killing of so many civilians we need more clarity about that there was no
*  defense for what happened there the that attack on civilians is never a justification for killing
*  civilians it was mostly done via handheld weapons and made possible because the Israeli government
*  had left its southern communities undefended something which has united Israeli society
*  wherever people think about politics there in anger now the carpet bombing
*  cannot be compared in the case of Gaza in any way to a military superpower which nearly did
*  establish near total control over an entire continent with huge resources and firepower
*  which devastated almost the entire continent now we have to put all of this in the context by the
*  way of revelations from the Israeli newspaper Israel Hayon seen as a de facto Benjamin Netanyahu
*  mouthpiece which claimed last week the Israeli prime minister tasked his top advisor with plans
*  to thin the Palestinian population in Gaza to a minimum by using the pressure of war and humanitarian
*  crisis to drive the population out as refugees that's called ethnic cleansing indeed note that
*  the UN has declared that half of Gaza's population is starving with nine out of ten citizens unable
*  to eat every day with conditions in Gaza making deliveries nearly impossible we've seen some of
*  us and more of us needs to see this as harrowing as it is footage of Palestinians waiting in line
*  to get a handful of flour from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine this is
*  chilling beyond belief and speaks of a humanitarian calamity which is spiraling rapidly
*  desperately out of control that's why those of us with a platform have to keep speaking out this
*  is an atrocity I think of historic proportions I'll keep using this platform as best I can to
*  shed a light on misinformation to provide a platform to the voices we need to be hearing
*  from right now to shed a light on the atrocities being committed with the full support of western
*  states and so much of our media so do share this video press like and subscribe to help get the
