# Gaza BOMBSHELL Report Ignored By Mainstream Media
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [July 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Uke0aZkJ7A)
*  Israel's genocidal onslaught against Gaza hasn't gone away. Quite the opposite. The
*  evidence suggests it has in fact escalated. Now we'll be discussing that in videos to
*  come, but first we've got to focus on a truly hideous article in the Lancet. It really
*  does deserve our urgent attention. We have to talk about this. The media has always failed
*  to reflect the horror of the butchery of Gaza and has in fact repeatedly legitimised Israel's
*  war crimes. But that existing failure has only deepened. It's been nine months. They've
*  undoubtedly claimed at the top of media organisations that fatigue is setting in. There has of course
*  been the UK general elections. There's been Joe Biden's public implosion. The French
*  elections could go on. There's a lot to deflect attention from. One of the great crimes of
*  our age which has Western fingerprints all over it. Now the piece we're discussing was
*  submitted to the Lancet by three prominent health academics. And it suggests a death
*  toll in Gaza, that is the number of Palestinians killed by Israel's military onslaught, let's
*  not be euphemistic, that's what we're talking about, is much, much higher than the
*  official figures suggest. Now the official figures have themselves been subjected to
*  a vicious campaign of atrocity denial, even though they have been proven accurate after
*  previous Israeli attacks, that after the first few weeks, the personal details and Israel
*  assigned IDs of each victim were released. The United Nations and multiple NGOs have
*  defended these figures as credible. The US has done the same. Israeli military sources
*  have privately leaked that they similarly believe these figures to be credible. The
*  official figures exclude those buried under the rubble, many thousands. The reporting
*  system has been trashed because of the destruction of Gaza's hospitals and Gaza's infrastructure.
*  Indeed, we've not even discussed those with serious health conditions. The many Gazans
*  who had cancer, serious health conditions, heart conditions not treated since this genocidal
*  onslaught began, we could go on. That's the problem. Well, this piece of the Lancet
*  really underlines a very important point, that in such violent onslaughts, the vast
*  majority of those killed are not directly killed by missiles, bombs and bullets, which
*  is what the official figures are talking about. The article notes that by the 19th of June
*  2024, 37,396 Palestinians were officially registered as killed in the Gaza Strip, according
*  to its health ministry. They note to the numbers of deaths amongst, say, those working for
*  UNRWA. That is the United Nations Agency for Palestinian Refugees. It's the main humanitarian
*  agency in Gaza. It has suffered the worst death toll of the United Nations ever in such
*  a short space of time since it was founded. That is illustrative of the wider death toll,
*  because if you can look at the proportion of a specific cohort of people being killed,
*  that gives you pointers as to the overall credibility of the death figures.
*  Now, they note the difficulties of identifying the dead in the current, frankly, apocalyptic
*  conditions in Gaza. The Lancet article notes the number of reported deaths is likely an
*  underestimate. The NGO Air Wars, for example, as they say, undertakes detailed assessments
*  of incidents in Gaza, and they find that not all the names of victims who can be identified
*  are included in the Ministry of Health's official list. They also note estimates that
*  the number of bodies under the rubble is likely substantial. That is possibly more than 10,000
*  buried under the rubble. They're not included in the official death statistics. Their class
*  is missing. Let me just read from this piece. Armed conflicts have indirect health implications
*  beyond the direct harm from violence. Even if the conflict ends immediately, there will
*  be many indirect deaths in the coming months and years from causes such as reproductive,
*  communicable and non-communicable diseases. The death toll is expected to be large given
*  the intensity of the conflict, destroyed healthcare infrastructure, severe shortages of food, water
*  and shelter, the population's inability to flee to safe places, and the loss of funding to UNRWA,
*  one of the very few humanitarian organisations still active in the Gaza Strip. Extremely
*  important points there. The destruction of the healthcare system alone imposes a daily death
*  sentence on Palestinians, and that will continue to mean more deaths for a very, very long time.
*  Every single hospital has been attacked to the point of no longer being functioning in a way that
*  you and I would understand. That means what we discuss often, a clinical term, in such situations,
*  we have to focus on excess deaths. That is, you look at the death rate in the years before
*  a particular event happens, a pandemic, or in this case, a military onslaught, and you look at the
*  increase in deaths over and above the pre-existing trend. That's the only really reliable way of
*  looking at the overall death toll, because then you're looking at, for example, those directly
*  killed because of the violence, but you're also including, say, cancer patients who aren't getting
*  the treatment they need, and who may well go on to die when they shouldn't have done, for example,
*  in a year or two after this particular phase ends. Now let me go on, let me read from this further.
*  This part really is crucial and chilling. In recent conflicts, such indirect deaths ranged from 3 to 15
*  times the number of direct deaths. Applying a conservative estimate of four indirect deaths
*  per one direct death to the 37,396 deaths reported, it is not implausible to estimate that up to
*  186,000 or even more deaths could be attributable to the current conflicts in Gaza. Using the 2022
*  Gaza Strip population estimate of 2.3 or 2,375,259 people, this would translate to 7.9%
*  of the total population of the Gaza Strip. A report from February 7, 2024, at the time when
*  the direct death toll was 28,000, estimated that without a ceasefire there would be between 58,260
*  deaths, without an epidemic or escalation, and 85,750 deaths if both occurred by August 6, 2024.
*  186,000 Palestinians are plausibly killed using a conservative estimate. That would be nearly 8%,
*  as they know of Gaza's population, but they also said could be even higher than that.
*  They're going to say, of course, that an immediate urgency is needed, as well as measures to ensure
*  the distribution of medical supplies, food, clean water, other resources for basic human needs.
*  But they also say it's crucial we record the scale and the nature of suffering for the sake
*  of accountability. That's crucial, of course, given the pending requests from the
*  International Criminal Court's Chief Prosecutor for Arrest Warrants for Israeli Prime Minister
*  Benjamin Netanyahu and his offencement to Yov Galant for war crimes and crimes against humanity,
*  as well as the case brought by South Africa against Israel and the International Court of Justice
*  alleging genocide. Now a few points here, it's really important to emphasise how in other
*  conflicts, and I use conflict sparingly here, given it is a genocidal onslaught by a military
*  superpower, but in other conflicts, most deaths are not directly caused by violence. Let's consider
*  Yemen, for example. The United Nations Humanitarian Office in 2020 believed that the war had killed
*  233,000 people, but they believed 131,000 of those deaths had indirect causes, like lack of food,
*  health, services and infrastructure. It should also be noted that the war was not asymmetrical
*  in the way that this is, that is there are multiple armed groups in Yemen with strong military
*  positions, rather than military superpower unleashing apocalyptic firepower, a strip of
*  land no bigger than East London in size. This is important to state because there were those who
*  tried to minimise and cheerlead Israel's genocidal onslaught by playing a truly sadistic game of
*  what aboutery. That is why you talk about the horror in Gaza rather than say Yemen.
*  Now it should be said, I've written more about Yemen, more newspaper columns about Yemen and that
*  war than any other newspaper columns in Britain. I've been writing about Yemen for years. I filmed
*  a documentary in a Yemeni refugee camp back in 2016. I actually care about Yemen. I care about
*  that horror. I care about Western complicity in those deaths. I'm not looking at Yemen for the
*  first time as a convenient stick to pick up, to beat those who oppose the mass slaughter of the
*  Palestinian people. I'm not using the mass slaughter of innocent Yemenis to devalue the lives
*  of Palestinians who are being butchered in huge numbers, which is what we've seen some of the
*  most cynical, disgusting people on earth do. And fuck them. The Western-backed and armed
*  Saudi-led coalition is believed to be responsible specifically for 15,000 civilian deaths.
*  Now on its own terms, all of this is hideous. It is not to belittle the horror of Yemen,
*  to emphasise just how much worse the horror of Gaza is. As I've said,
*  what exists in Yemen on its own terms is truly horrific. And that just merely underlines just
*  how horrific Gaza is. You see, the population of Yemen is well over 33 million compared to what was
*  around 2.3 million in Gaza. The proportion of Gaza's population slaughtered is much, much higher
*  than Yemen, however you cut it. And indeed, the deaths we're talking about in Yemen took place
*  over many years, while in Gaza we're talking about nine months. So a much higher proportion of deaths
*  in a much shorter space of time. Indeed, what the Lancet is telling us is that Gaza's absolute
*  death toll, the absolute numbers of those killed, may now be comparable to the absolute numbers in
*  Yemen, even though the population of Gaza is about 15 times smaller and the time frame
*  is much, much shorter. You actually have to go elsewhere to look for comparable levels of
*  horror, and by that I mean some of the worst crimes in human history. Let's look for example at the
*  reign of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, whose hideous tyranny ruled for about four years
*  in the 1970s before the Vietnamese army overthrew them. It's estimated that around a fifth of the
*  population of Cambodia was killed over the space of those four years, that is around 20% of the
*  population. A truly monstrous crime of human, of historic proportions. I think we all agree on that.
*  What the Lancet is discussing here is based on a conservative estimate,
*  8% in a much shorter space of time. So we're talking potentially about what? Approaching half
*  of the Khmer Rouge slaughter as a proportion of the population, which took place over four years
*  in a much shorter space of time. That's what we're talking about at the moment. Now it must be
*  repeated over and over and over again. And I hate to say this, because it's a horrible thing to say,
*  isn't it? But many more are going to be killed in Gaza. We don't know how many. From those directly
*  killed, bombs, missiles, bullets, to those who will starve, those who denied clean water, those
*  with cancer, heart problems or other serious untreated conditions, pregnant women denied the
*  medical care that they need, as well as newborn babies. The general overall stress is imposed on
*  the human body by living huge periods of time without proper shelter, without the needs of life
*  being satisfied. We have to be honest. This is like, many pointed out, if you just think about
*  famine, that if you immediately just flooded the place as best you could, there was no, there was
*  a total ceasefire and you just flooded the place with aid, you would still have people starving to
*  death for a long period of time. It's like a runaway train, you press the brakes, it takes a long
*  time for it to come to a halt. Now, clearly we are discussing one of the worst crimes of our age,
*  and those who support this obscenity must be damned, but so too must those who are silent.
*  What were you thinking? What were you thinking? You didn't actually have an excuse, did you?
*  I mentioned Pol Pot and Kamui Reyes, and they were some suckers at the time who
*  denied reality and they were gullible idiots. They weren't on a daily basis being live streamed to
*  genocide on their computers, were they? Very few crimes have been so thoroughly and overwhelmingly
*  documented as this one, thanks to the Palestinian journalists in Gaza who have suffered the worst
*  slaughter of journalists ever recorded in human history in such a short space of time,
*  often slaughtered alongside their families. Thanks to social media,
*  thanks to cameras on people's phones, we have seen at least some of the crimes that have been
*  committed. Not most of them, but enough, enough to know some of the worst crimes of our age have
*  been committed. There was never an excuse. You only had to listen to not just that evidence,
*  what all these NGOs were saying, what the United Nations were saying, what multiple foreign
*  governments were saying, the fact that there's a genocide case at the International Court of
*  Justice, the fact that the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has requested
*  arrest warrants against the Prime Minister and the Defence Minister with likely far more charges
*  to come against far more people. What were you thinking? What were you thinking? You see,
*  those who still support this, I've said this before, but I just think they're so
*  too disgusting to even often think about anymore. I mean, they're just depraved freaks. It's those
*  who are silent except for the hand wringing, despite all the evidence.
*  What's your excuse? Cowardice? You were scared? Thought people would yell at you? Thought your
*  career might be compromised? I've said this before as well. It is people like you who are responsible
*  for some of the worst crimes in human history. I said people like you. The people who stayed silent
*  throughout history when horrors were taking place, if they hadn't been silent, they would have stopped
*  those horrors. It's not just the people who directly support these things who are to blame.
*  It's not just the loudly, those loudly apologising and cheerleading horror and denying horror who
*  have blood on their hands. It's the people who knew what was going on or who knew enough of what
*  was going on but did nothing to fight it or to speak out. They're the ones who are at least as
*  responsible for the great horrors of our past and as we can see our present. I'll never stop being
*  angry with them. None of us should stop being angry with these people. This is what they've done.
*  Look at what they're doing. They're still not speaking out. A lot of them have just gone
*  completely silent, not even bothering to hand wring anymore. Occasionally it's so terrible, so sad.
*  No discussion of the crimes committed by the Israeli state with direct support of our governments.
*  The media organisations who have failed from the start to frame this on the terms of what was
*  actually happening, including based on the most overt declarations of intent, pretty much of any
*  atrocity in history. They just loudly went out and told us all what they were going to do. Often
*  those statements by Israeli leaders and officials weren't even reported in Western media outlets,
*  let alone used to frame the reporting of what was happening. Yeah, well they can't get away with this
*  and we have to speak out ever loudly and we can't let them just move on because the Israeli slaughter
*  isn't moving on and we'll talk about them in the coming videos. There's more of the reports that
*  are now coming out from Israeli soldiers who are now leaking the crimes that they committed.
*  We've got a video about this from an Israeli Palestinian media organisation called 972 Mag
*  who have already reported what's going on. Well, silent during a genocide.
*  Those people, I'm just going to keep going about this a little bit. These are the people,
*  they look back at history and see those people as disgusting as well. They see that those people
*  are disgusting in the past. They go, how could people not speak out? What were they thinking?
*  Well now you know, you are those people. That's you.
*  You should feel that guilt and that shame for the rest of your life.
*  For the rest of your life you should think about right now the screams
*  of horror up and down what remains of the Gaza Strip as I speak. The screams of anguish,
*  the screams of pain. Right now people choking to death, people suffocating under rubble,
*  including little kids, people being burned to death. It's happening every day, it's happening
*  now, it's happening as you listen to me and you're still fucking silent some of you people, honestly.
*  We have to escalate our campaigns in support of boycott, investment and sanctions, dismantling
*  Israeli apartheid and occupation and securing a just peace based on equality for Palestinians
*  and Jewish citizens that the land belongs to all on the basis of equality and we can't stop fighting
*  for that. Never let the horrors of this world degrade your own humanity. Please like and
