# Israel Unleashes Final Destruction Of Gaza
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4)
*  The final destruction of Gaza, that's what Israel is currently executing. I'd say this is happening [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=0.0s)]
*  before the eyes of the world, but the Western media is overwhelmingly currently barely even covering [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=6.32s)]
*  the liquidation of Gaza that is currently taking place. Last night's onslaught against Gaza was [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=12.08s)]
*  described by the surviving population as unbearable. According to Ibrahim Amassri, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  a computer engineering student in Gaza, last night was hell for all of us in Gaza. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=23.84s)]
*  They are continuing to exterminate us until the last soul. It has become normal, as if it is [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=29.2s)]
*  necessary to exterminate us to maintain the ecological balance. My mind has collapsed. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=34.96s)]
*  Is it normal for all of this to happen? Let's look at this image of Raffa, the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=40.32s)]
*  southern city in Gaza which had suffered the least destruction of the towns and cities of the strip. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=46.16s)]
*  What it shows is total annihilation. It has been flattened, reduced to rubble as far as the eye [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=51.2s)]
*  can see. Shades of grey rubble and then brown. That's it. Total lifelessness. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=56.48s)]
*  Let's see this footage of Dar al-Aqwam school which was being used as a shelter [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=62.64s)]
*  for displaced Palestinians. The strike on this school killed dozens of Palestinians [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=68.16s)]
*  who were there sheltering, many of them children. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=74.88s)]
*  I've watched footage of children being carried from that school, which I can't show here [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=76.72s)]
*  because it's very disturbing. In any case, YouTube would age restrict the video if I even tried. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=89.28s)]
*  One child is completely blackened by burns. Another's face is entirely red with fresh blood, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=95.36s)]
*  their body limp in the paramedic's arms. Last night Israeli airstrikes completely destroyed [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=101.36s)]
*  the Gharian water desalination plant east of Gaza City. We can see the aftermath of that destruction. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=107.28s)]
*  I watched the moment that the desalination plant was struck, again too graphic to show here. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=124.88s)]
*  You can hear a girl sobbing in the background as she films it happening, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  and you watch as two humans are blown far into the air by the explosion before their corpses [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=135.12s)]
*  plummet to earth. This desalination plant was the only source of clean water for an entire neighborhood. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=140.72s)]
*  Destroying a desalination plant is not only a straightforward war crime, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  it is inherently a genocidal act. It is only done in the knowledge that it will deprive a [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  civilian population of the most basic need of all after oxygen. The Israeli state is imposing [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=158.08s)]
*  relentless so-called evacuation orders in Gaza, demanding the people flee under threat of violence [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=164.72000000000003s)]
*  and death to an ever smaller area, which is part and parcel of what Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=170.08s)]
*  the Israeli prime minister who is wanted by the International Criminal Court for War Crimes and [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  Crimes Against Humanity, openly says as a plan to empty Gaza of its population. As Khalil Saeed, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=177.52s)]
*  a Palestinian-Christian political analyst from Gaza says, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=183.60000000000002s)]
*  My Facebook timeline is filled with people in Gaza saying they are so tired of endless displacement [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  that they would rather stay and die than obey the evacuation order. He goes on, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=191.76000000000002s)]
*  Just imagine, people are so tired that they prefer death over another displacement. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=196.48000000000002s)]
*  As I've been discussing this week, the Israeli military attacked a convoy of ambulances near [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=202.0s)]
*  Ra'far, executed the paramedics and rescue workers through their bodies in a mass grave, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=206.4s)]
*  and even tried to bury their ambulances. Now we have more information, according to a forensic [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=210.72s)]
*  doctor who examined some of the bodies, there was evidence of execution-style killing based on the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=215.6s)]
*  specific and intentional location of shots at close range. Two witnesses said they'd seen the bodies [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=220.24s)]
*  and said that their hands and legs were tied. None of this can be divorced from the deliberate [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=227.68s)]
*  and systematic attempt to destroy the entire healthcare system of Gaza, which a UN report [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=232.96s)]
*  found was part of the crime of extermination. Israel has killed over a thousand Palestinian [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=237.28s)]
*  medics in Gaza since the genocide began and attacked every single hospital and medical [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=243.52s)]
*  facility rendering most inoperable. What we are seeing here is Israel completing the final stage [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=247.04s)]
*  of the Gaza genocide. It's clearly been told by its US patrons that nothing is off limits, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=252.96s)]
*  that they can do as they please, they can destroy anything, they can kill anyone without any [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=257.84s)]
*  restraints. And Gaza today is the West Bank tomorrow. The West Bank is already a site of [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=262.72s)]
*  multiple pogroms and 40,000 Palestinians have already been displaced in the biggest act of [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=267.6s)]
*  ethnic cleansing there since 1967, when it was occupied. Let's listen to what the Israeli [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=271.68s)]
*  Minister of the Economy said in this interview. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=276.40000000000003s)]
*  Keep in mind that Judea and Samaria is the biblical term used by Israel. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=292.72s)]
*  What he says there is if the West Bank doesn't submit to an eternity of Israeli occupation, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=322.8s)]
*  and this is already in the West Bank the longest belligerent occupation in modern history, then [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=330.71999999999997s)]
*  Israel will turn the West Bank into Gaza. Note that the Israeli state is expanding its settlements [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=334.71999999999997s)]
*  there and is preparing the ground for formal annexation. Indeed, a joint statement was signed [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=340.64s)]
*  by both now co-ministers of defence, Israel Katz and Bezalel Smotrich, making it clear [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=344.96s)]
*  formal annexation is the plan. They declare, Judea and Samaria, the cradle of our homeland, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=350.24s)]
*  the land of the Bible, we are here to stay. The horrors of the West Bank are already extreme [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=354.72s)]
*  enough, but they receive all too little attention. Like Omar Zudeh, a 16-year-old Palestinian boy who [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=359.68s)]
*  on Wednesday was killed after the Israeli army shot him in the chest, and one of Waleed Khalid [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=366.96000000000004s)]
*  Abdullah Haqmed. He was a 17-year-old Palestinian boy who had been held in Israeli custody in [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=373.28000000000003s)]
*  northern Israel. As Defence for Children International report, post-mortem examination [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=379.52s)]
*  indicates Waleed suffered from extreme body muscle and fat wasting, evidenced by sunken abdomen, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=385.12s)]
*  according to a doctor who attended the autopsy on behalf of Waleed's family. Waleed also had [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=390.56s)]
*  scabies, rashes on both legs and his groin. In addition to abrasions on his nose, chest and right [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=395.52s)]
*  hip, the examination revealed that Waleed had significant air collection both his chest and [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=400.4s)]
*  abdominal cavities, likely caused by blunt trauma, along with signs of inflammation, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=404.71999999999997s)]
*  likely caused by infection. There was also evidence of edema and congestion in his large [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=408.96s)]
*  intestine, consistent with traumatic injury, likely the result of beatings, which are frequently [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=414.88s)]
*  inflicted by Israeli prison guards on Palestinian child detainees. The autopsy report further states [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=419.35999999999996s)]
*  he suffered extreme, likely prolonged malnutrition and that he likely suffered from an inflamed colon, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=425.35999999999996s)]
*  leading to frequent diarrhea and severe dehydration. The autopsy also revealed a cut on his neck. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=430.32s)]
*  This Palestinian boy who had been repeatedly, clearly severely beaten was starved to death [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=436.0s)]
*  in Israeli captivity. Just imagine for one moment that this was an Israeli child hostage [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=443.28000000000003s)]
*  who had starved to death in Hamas captivity. Indeed, the sight of gone Israeli hostages who [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=450.16s)]
*  were released and survived itself caused international outrage. There's almost no [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=455.04s)]
*  coverage whatsoever for this boy. Long before 7th October, the Israeli state was locking people up, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=459.84000000000003s)]
*  Palestinians including children, either with no trial or charge whatsoever or using a kangaroo [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=473.68s)]
*  court where the judge was an IDF soldier, where it was conducted in Hebrew, where the trial was [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=480.72s)]
*  over in minutes, over 99% conviction rate. These are hostages, including child hostages. Israel is [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=490.64000000000004s)]
*  the only state on earth which systematically tries children in military courts. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=501.28000000000003s)]
*  But there's no outrage, is there? Because people go, well, this is different because the Israeli [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=506.96s)]
*  hostages were dragged from civilian homes and kidnapped for nothing. That is the same as these [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=517.04s)]
*  people. Large numbers of these detainees are people who haven't been charged or convicted of anything [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=524.72s)]
*  and they have been dragged often at the dead of night from their family homes, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=533.68s)]
*  dragged away from their screaming families and often sent to detention with their family having [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=537.76s)]
*  no idea where they're being sent. Hostages who were then used as bargaining chips. Hostages. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=542.48s)]
*  I'm going to end by saying something very difficult. I had a conversation with a fellow journalist [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=550.88s)]
*  who's spoken out about this genocide the other week. We discussed whether everything we're doing [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=556.5600000000001s)]
*  and saying is futile. For the last year and a half, I have stared down the barrel of this camera [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=561.2s)]
*  doing everything I can to reach as many people as possible with the stories, the truth, the facts [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=566.0s)]
*  about the depravity being committed by Israel and facilitated by the West, including my own government. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=572.08s)]
*  18 months and that depravity is worse than ever. Anyone who has used their platform, all too few, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=577.0400000000001s)]
*  will have had moments of asking themselves, what is this all for? This is the difficult part because [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=582.5600000000001s)]
*  what I said to that fellow journalist is no one is coming to rescue the people of Gaza. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=587.92s)]
*  That doesn't mean it's all over for the Palestinian people, far from it, but we have to be [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=595.12s)]
*  honest here. In the here and now, all we can do is bear witness for the coming reckoning. Palestine, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=600.8s)]
*  you see, is the litmus test of our age. If you supported this crime of historic proportions, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=606.24s)]
*  then you are exposed as a depraved monster. If you stayed silent, then you are exposed as a coward. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=613.6s)]
*  Cowardice is always a sin, but in a time of genocide, it is a moral crime. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=621.2s)]
*  Either this crime is accepted for what it is, as in the consensus exists over what it is, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=626.0s)]
*  what is normalised, and our species will collapse into violent barbarism. Then Gaza simply foreshadows [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=633.84s)]
*  the future of much of humanity. So we must bear witness, as loudly as we can, for the coming [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=639.44s)]
*  reckoning, where all who were complicit in this crime are held to account. Because that reckoning [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=644.0s)]
*  is not just about Gaza or Palestine, as crucially important as that is, it's about the future of [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=651.6s)]
*  humanity itself. Please like and subscribe, leave your thoughts in the comments, help us as we take [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6CtOEB8Cw4&t=657.2800000000001s)]
