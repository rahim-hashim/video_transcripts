# Israel's Most LETHAL Lie Falls Apart - But Leaves Catastrophic Impact
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA)
*  Of all the lies peddled by the Israeli state since this horror began, this one has proven [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=0.0s)]
*  the most murderous. Indeed, it has been a key plank of what makes this a genocidal campaign [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=6.16s)]
*  against Gaza. Now, cast your mind back to January when the International Court of Justice, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=12.64s)]
*  that's the world's highest court, placed Israel on trial for alleged genocide, declaring it to be [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=17.28s)]
*  a plausible case. Now, at the exact same time, just coincidentally, a story driven by the Israeli [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=23.36s)]
*  state knocks that news from the headlines. It's centred on the United Nations Relief and Works [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=28.24s)]
*  Agency of Palestine Refugees in the Near East, better known by its acronym, UNRWA. Founded in [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=33.68s)]
*  1949, shortly after the foundation of Israel, it was charged with the welfare of the hundreds of [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=40.08s)]
*  thousands of Palestinian refugees driven from their homes in the so-called Nakba, or catastrophe, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=45.44s)]
*  the term for this act of ethnic cleansing. It continued to look after those refugees and their [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=50.8s)]
*  descendants, and indeed new refugees driven from their homes in subsequent acts of ethnic cleansing [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=56.16s)]
*  orchestrated by Israel, not least in 1967. And today, it's got around 30,000 employees operating [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank and of course Gaza, working with around 6 million [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=69.12s)]
*  registered Palestinian refugees. In Gaza, it's the main humanitarian agency, with around 13,000 [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=75.84s)]
*  employees running schools and healthcare and other core services. Now, in the midst of [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=82.8s)]
*  humanitarian catastrophe, defined by mass indiscriminate bombing, the destruction of [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=87.75999999999999s)]
*  healthcare, siege, famine, the lack of shelter, hygiene, we could go on, it is therefore a [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=92.8s)]
*  lifeline. Yet Israel has long despised UNRWA because it is a continuing reminder of the mass [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=98.16s)]
*  expulsion of Palestinians from their homes, that they have been refugees and are refugees, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=103.6s)]
*  that the United Nations resolution, 194, granted the right of return to such refugees. It exists [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=109.76s)]
*  as a constant reminder that Israel is an occupying power, and as a result, it has a very clear legal [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=116.72s)]
*  set of obligations, which Israel flouts. UNRWA is also seen, by certainly Israeli figures, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=122.48s)]
*  as instrumental in maintaining a Palestinian identity which they want to snuff out. Now, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=128.32s)]
*  the truth is that Palestinian identity will remain whether UNRWA exists or not, but destroying UNRWA [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  undoubtedly helps dismantle the very fabric of Palestinian society. Indeed, UNRWA also provides [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=138.96s)]
*  huge amounts of information about the actual consequences of Israeli crime, something else [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=144.08s)]
*  of course Israel wants to end. Now, since this horror began, Israel has slaughtered huge numbers [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=148.88s)]
*  of UNRWA staff, making it the biggest mass killing of UN workers and indeed aid workers in any [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=154.08s)]
*  conflict in such a short space of time ever recorded. Of course, no, none of those aid workers [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=160.96s)]
*  got even a fraction of the attention received when foreign aid workers were killed by Israel. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=166.16s)]
*  Furthermore, as northern Gaza in particular collapsed into famine, Israel banned UNRWA from [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=176.48s)]
*  entering at all, self-evidently itself genocidal implications. You drag a civilian population into [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=180.88s)]
*  humanitarian catastrophe entirely artificially, then you wage war on the main agency which can [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=186.0s)]
*  protect them. So when the International Court of Justice issued its provisional orders, one of the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=191.12s)]
*  most fundamental being that Israel must allow access to humanitarian aid, the Israeli state [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=195.76s)]
*  declared that UNRWA was complicit in the 7th of October attack, specifically claiming 12 of its [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=200.88s)]
*  employees were directly involved in the attack. Now frankly, on its own terms, this whole claim, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=205.84s)]
*  the smear campaign, was an absurdity, even if true, if 12 out of 30,000 employees were involved in a [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=212.23999999999998s)]
*  crime and we don't know what the specific alleged involvement or the extent of that involvement [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  even was supposed to be, you don't have thereby strangle an entire agency. You'd have to shut [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=224.32s)]
*  down every agency and organisation on earth on that basis because you'll always find individuals [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=229.92s)]
*  in any organisation who've done terrible things. I mean, the National Health Service would be shut [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=236.4s)]
*  down for Harold Shipman, for example. Now there's also a presumption of innocence [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=240.4s)]
*  until guilt is proven, but the head of UNRWA sacked 10 of those 12 employees on the spot. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=244.72s)]
*  He couldn't sack the other two because they'd already been killed in this bloodbath. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=252.72s)]
*  Now he thought, Philip Lazzarini, he thought that he would protect UNRWA by throwing them under a [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=256.0s)]
*  bus with no due process, but clearly to be frank, that was obviously not someone who understands [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=263.04s)]
*  crisis management. It just added fuel to the fire. The Israeli state went further though. They [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=268.64s)]
*  claimed widespread infiltration of UNRWA by members of terrorist organisations and also reheated old [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=273.04s)]
*  claims, for example, that UNRWA schools, in UNRWA schools children are being brainwashed, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=278.32s)]
*  for example, to hate Jewish people. There was also, for example, the claims, not least in the [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=283.04s)]
*  words of the now sacked, but then official Israeli spokesperson, Elon Levy, that UNRWA was a front [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=289.28s)]
*  for Hamas, not infiltrated, just a front for Hamas. This obviously put a target on the back [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=296.08s)]
*  of anyone working for UNRWA, but crucially it led to multiple countries to cut their funding to UNRWA, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=302.32s)]
*  the largest of course being the United States and the House of Representatives last month passed a [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=307.2s)]
*  bill banning funding for UNRWA until at least the beginning of 2025, that is stripping UNRWA of [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=311.44s)]
*  between $300 and $400 million each year. Another country which cut funding was the United Kingdom, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=316.96s)]
*  as well as Canada and Australia and the EU, though since the likes of the EU, Canada, Australia, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=323.68s)]
*  Japan, France have restored funding, but only after the damage was done, indeed $450 million or so of [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=328.32s)]
*  its funding was slashed altogether, utterly devastating, huge numbers of Palestinians [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=334.24s)]
*  being killed and suffering through bombing, bullets, starvation, lack of medical care, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=339.44s)]
*  lack of fresh water, lack of shelter, lack of hygiene, we could go on and the main funding [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=344.8s)]
*  and the funding for the main humanitarian agency was butchered. Now the UN Secretary General [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=349.36s)]
*  commissioned a independent detailed report by the former French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=355.2s)]
*  Now the results, well firstly we can note that Israel had failed to offer any supportive evidence [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=361.28s)]
*  of its specific claims about employees being taking part on the 7th of October. Now I should [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=366.64s)]
*  say that's a parallel review specifically looking into that, but the Israeli state's refusing to [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=373.44s)]
*  cooperate, which is totally normal behaviour if you've got slam dunk evidence, but this review [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=377.52s)]
*  is about UNRWA's neutrality and it highlights that UNRWA regularly gave Israel lists of its employees [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=382.88s)]
*  for Israel to vet and that the Israeli government has not informed UNRWA of any concerns relating [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=388.47999999999996s)]
*  to any UNRWA staff based on those staff lists since 2011. So Israel was given the chance [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=392.71999999999997s)]
*  with its entirely sophisticated and boast about all the time intelligence services to do all that [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=398.56s)]
*  vetting and come up with objections but did not offer any. It was asked to provide evidence, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=403.44s)]
*  Israel for links between UNRWA and Hamas and Islamic Jihad and it has failed to provide the evidence. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=407.67999999999995s)]
*  Now let's just listen to this report from Al Jazeera. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=413.2s)]
*  Big picture is this is a pretty damning report but damning not for UNRWA but for Israel that [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=415.84s)]
*  accused 12 UNRWA employees of allegedly taking part in October 7th. In this report they say that [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=422.64s)]
*  the Kelowna report says that Israel never gave them any evidence to back up those claims. Now [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=433.67999999999995s)]
*  this isn't necessarily new because we've been hearing for months now from the spokesperson for [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=441.28s)]
*  Secretary General Antonio Gutierrez saying that they have not received any sort of evidence. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=446.88s)]
*  So the fact that this is now also from the Kelowna report they also have not received evidence [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=451.11999999999995s)]
*  to put included in their final report sort of backs up what we've been hearing all along. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=458.96s)]
*  Big picture here is this report and this is important here is not intended to look directly [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=463.44s)]
*  at the claims of the alleged 12 people that were allegedly involved. No evidence has been provided. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=471.44s)]
*  This investigation commissioned by the Secretary General is an independent investigation that's an [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=479.84s)]
*  independent review to ensure that UNRWA adheres to the principles of neutrality right and because [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=485.84s)]
*  Israel is saying UNRWA is not neutral. In this report they say there is really no evidence [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=494.32s)]
*  that UNRWA is anything but neutral. They do lay out a few examples where UNRWA can maybe improve [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=500.96s)]
*  on some internal policies such as maybe better training for employees maybe better communication [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=508.15999999999997s)]
*  with donors for example but those are fairly minor quite frankly. There's no as we say any [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=515.6s)]
*  sort of smoking gun in this report at all. There's also claims by Israel that we've heard from for [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=522.32s)]
*  many many months if not years that their anti-semitic books and teaching material and UNRWA schools [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=527.9200000000001s)]
*  in Palestine and particularly in Gaza. This report by the Kelowna report says that they found no [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=537.0400000000001s)]
*  widespread evidence of that whatsoever. So these are a little bit of the few of the highlights that [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=544.08s)]
*  we've seen so far. Well indeed damning for Israel not UNRWA. Indeed the report offers practical [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=549.6800000000001s)]
*  useful suggestions and every organization can always work to improve itself and this report [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=555.2800000000001s)]
*  obviously was always going to offer suggestions for example on better upholding neutrality [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=562.4000000000001s)]
*  dealing with allegations when they arise indications of breaches what the right disciplinary [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=566.96s)]
*  mechanisms are as well as improved communication engaging with donors all just very sensible stuff. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=572.7199999999999s)]
*  Now as regards one specific claim the report says although UNRWA has received criticism over the [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=578.4s)]
*  alleged presence of hate speech and incitement to violence and anti-semitism in the Palestinian [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=582.7199999999999s)]
*  National Authority textbooks it uses the researchers finds that host country curricula and textbooks [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=587.1999999999999s)]
*  are used in accordance with UNESCO recommendations. The researchers assessment is that UNRWA has been [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=592.16s)]
*  responsive to allegations of neutrality breaches and criticism textbooks and has initiated a range [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=597.28s)]
*  of initiatives to ensure neutrality of the material of teaching including preventive and [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=602.16s)]
*  mitigatory mechanisms and procedures such as a critical thinking approach. So I mean actually [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=606.3199999999999s)]
*  UNRWA has been extremely diligent in trying for example in the case of education to make sure [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=612.9599999999999s)]
*  that children have suitable educational material not what the Israeli state has claimed and frankly [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=619.92s)]
*  if the Israeli state wants to get on a moral high ground and start talking about people being [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=626.4s)]
*  brainwashed to hate others goodness me goodness me no self-awareness no self-awareness at all [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=632.72s)]
*  or when you just hate people so much you don't even realize you hate them just because background [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=640.9599999999999s)]
*  noise have you seen what's on your television stations Israelis have you been watching what's [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=646.8s)]
*  on your channels it is the most disgusting stuff I've ever watched in the modern period [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=652.0s)]
*  just genocidal you literally have people on tv in Israel talking about how you need to kill children [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=658.96s)]
*  because they'll end up being terrorists about both about how we should wipe out everyone in [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=663.84s)]
*  Gaza and both and talking about how you know in response to Palestinians in Gaza being on the [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=668.64s)]
*  beach for example which does a massive heat wave and being intense in those circumstances is [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=674.64s)]
*  unbearable there's massive ocean next to Gaza running all the way down and because they saw [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=680.48s)]
*  images that beat you as an Israeli journalist working for literally the most read newspaper [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=685.36s)]
*  in the country responding to that by saying we should exterminate everyone in Gaza [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=689.28s)]
*  and you had what repeated genocidal statements by Israeli leaders to the extent where there was [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=694.96s)]
*  multiple pages in a document submitted to the international court of justice alleging genocide [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=700.96s)]
*  partly because there's so many genocidal statements and we're literally talking about [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=706.08s)]
*  textbooks in schools are we well the difference is the evidence wasn't there for the textbooks [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=709.6s)]

*  of course revealed by the genocidal intent I've just noted expressed by Israeli leaders and [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=732.64s)]
*  officials from the start including the defense minister Yov Galan justifying a total seed of all [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=736.88s)]
*  the essentials of life going into Gaza and the grounds they were fighting human animals as well [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=741.6s)]
*  as an advisor to his a general Giora Ireland and who after 7th of October said that people in Gaza [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=746.32s)]

*  its occupying and colonial project they cut the funding whilst knowing that Gaza was being plunged [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=780.0799999999999s)]

*  were right turns out all the people I've listened to all the way through this have been correct [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=816.96s)]
*  so I just think maybe if I did that and made calls which all turned to be vindicated in the [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=822.5600000000001s)]

*  a news story about these bogus claims with the accompanying text allegations this series demand [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=857.36s)]
*  a serious response as the UK rightly ensures our aid is never used to support terrorism we are seeking [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=863.28s)]
*  urgent discussions with ministers to ensure ordinary Gazans can access aid the humanitarian [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=868.8s)]
*  crisis in Gaza cannot wait in doing so she helped legitimize a literally murderous smear campaign [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=873.68s)]
*  which has undoubtedly caused and will continue to cause massive numbers of deaths she could have [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=880.24s)]
*  put pressure on the British government to save lives she had a choice she acted on the choice she [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=887.4399999999999s)]

*  and I think it should disgust anyone with with a moral compass what did Lisa Nandy tweet today [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=995.84s)]
*  then anyway a united nations web link headlined no evidence yet of Israel's claims against UNRWA [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=1001.28s)]
*  Kelowna report with the accompanying text the Kelowna report makes clear that donors should [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=1005.92s)]
*  have confidence in UNRWA ministers must now come forward and explain how they intend to respond [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QyNfy4UaA&t=1009.92s)]
