Video Description: Labour has just suspended left-wing MP Kate Osamor. Her crime? Describe Israel's onslaught on Gaza as a genocide, just days after the highest court on earth placed Israel on trial for possible genocide.

Meanwhile, Labour's Shadow Foreign Secretary David Lammy claims the party has always been clear through the conflict that international law must be upheld. That is a lie. Here's the sordid truth about Labour's wretched Gaza policy - and how it's allowed the Tories - and Israel - to get away with murder.

# Labour Disgraces Itself Over Gaza
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr71XsdJ8Fw)
*  Labour have completely disgraced themselves over Gaza. Their behaviour has been completely
*  unforgivable and that matters for two reasons. One, it has allowed the Conservatives to get away
*  with murder, literally. The government can keep arming and backing Israel as it butchers the people
*  of Gaza, knowing that they won't come under domestic political pressure for doing so. Secondly,
*  Labour is the inevitable government in waiting, given the total implosion of the Conservative
*  So what's the latest outrage on the part of Labour? They've suspended the left-wing MP
*  Kate Osamor, one of the only black female Labour MPs. Now bear in mind they've already de facto
*  booted Diane Abbott, who was the first ever black female MP elected, while other Labour MPs who are
*  white and not left-wing have been treated completely differently, like Neil Coyle who racially harassed
*  a journalist and reportedly had a complaint of sexual harassment against him. He had the whip
*  restored and sits again as a Labour MP. On the other hand, judging by what's happened to left-wing
*  MPs, they won't restore the whip to Kate Osamor and thus ban her from standing as an MP and it's
*  not just her, come on to that. Now what is Kate Osamor's crime? In her weekly newsletter to local
*  Labour members sent last Friday, she wrote, and I quote, that Holocaust Memorial Day is
*  an international day to remember the six million Jews murdered during the Holocaust, the millions
*  of other people murdered under Nazi persecution of other groups and more recent genocides in
*  Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia and now Gaza. Now first things first, Holocaust Memorial Day exists to
*  remember the Shoah, that is the Nazi's genocide of European Jews and other genocides. In the words of
*  the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust itself, it is an international day on the 27th of January to remember
*  the six million Jews murdered during the Holocaust alongside the millions of people murdered under
*  Nazi persecution of other groups and during more recent genocides in Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia and
*  Darfur. Now the reason I say this is some might be under the impression that Holocaust Memorial Day
*  exists solely to remember the Nazi genocide of the Jewish people, but it doesn't. Now last week,
*  the International Court of Justice, the highest court on earth, accepted South Africa's case
*  against Israel for the crime of genocide as being plausible. So Israel is now on trial for an alleged
*  genocide. Among other things, what that ruling now means is that it is a legitimate opinion to believe
*  that Israel's onslaught against Gaza is a genocide because the case was not dismissed. Now there may
*  be those of you who do not believe this constitutes a genocide. If that's your view, what you can no
*  longer do is dismiss the claim that there's a genocide as an outrage, as a disgrace, as somehow
*  being beyond the realms of acceptable opinion. So Kate Osmore has been suspended for adding what
*  the highest court on earth now considers an alleged ongoing genocide to the list of genocides to
*  remember on a day which exists to remember genocides. So that's now an opinion, that's an opinion
*  clearly, which is unacceptable in the Labour Party. We've already seen fellow left-wing Annie
*  MacDonald be suspended for saying, and I quote, we won't rest until we have justice until all people,
*  Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea can live in peaceful liberty. A call there
*  for peaceful coexistence. Well, you're out for that. Support mass slaughter and apartheid? No
*  problem at all. What is an acceptable opinion as far as the Labour Party is concerned? Well, for
*  start, supporting what is now officially considered as an alleged genocide and specifically supporting
*  war crimes of Chokhmundu. This is part of a general pattern which I predicted back in October would
*  be the case, that those who would be driven from their jobs or their positions threatened or facing
*  harassment, silencing, demonisation, would be those opposing the mass murder of Palestinians,
*  while those supporting this slaughter would be treated as respectable and moderates with no
*  impact on their career whatsoever. Now, to be clear, Keir Starmer, who became leader on a pack of lies,
*  pretending to be left-wing, committing to a range of policies he didn't actually believe in,
*  like nationalisation, higher taxes on the rich, abolishing tuition fees and indeed Labour being a
*  broad church, is looking for an excuse, any excuse, to purge left-wing MPs and his crew is using the
*  mass slaughter of the Palestinian people, which the Labour leadership has aided and abetted,
*  to further that cynical, factional end. Now, let's just go through this particularly
*  sordid episode in Labour history, shall we? On Friday, Labour's shadow Foreign Secretary,
*  David Lammy, tweeted, Labour has been clear throughout the conflict that international
*  law must be upheld, that the independence of international courts must be respected and that
*  all sides must be accountable. Labour must now comply with the orders in the ICJ ruling in full.
*  Sorry, what was that David? Sorry what did you say there? Labour's been clear throughout the
*  conflict that international law must be upheld. Is that what you seriously wrote? Seriously?
*  It's just a bare-faced lie, isn't it? You shouldn't throw the word liar around willy-nilly,
*  but unless David Lammy is completely oblivious to what international law is, unfortunate given
*  he's a lawyer by training, and in which case he shouldn't be shadow Foreign Secretary, then he
*  must know that what he tweeted is not true. Let's start with Keir Starmer, the leader of the Labour
*  Party, sadly, shall we, who said near the start of the Israel onslaught the following.
*  He defended Israel's right to cut off water and energy to civilians, a straightforward war crime.
*  It's in violation of the Geneva Convention, to be precise, Article 33, forbidding collective
*  punishment. That's for a start. Now indeed, in the ICJ judgment, the court specifically referred
*  to the Israeli Defense Minister, Yoav Galan, cutting off water and energy and other basic supplies
*  as part of a siege which Keir Starmer there backed on national radio, and it was of course justified
*  on the grounds that Palestinians were human animals. The ICJ cites that as damning evidence.
*  So, from the outset, the Labour leader supported war crimes, violating international law. It gets
*  worse. Let's listen to David Lammy himself on the 15th of October, when asked about Israel's
*  forceful displacement of the Palestinian people in Gaza, which led to virtually all the Palestinian
*  population being displaced from their homes.
*  Yes or no? Can I answer the question? Please. Very simply. This is a war situation. War is ugly.
*  Very, very sadly, people die. We have rules and those rules mean that you must minimise death.
*  Now, you know, and I know, because Netanyahu has said that there will be an invasion shortly
*  against that backdrop. Of course it's right that civilians must not be in harm's way.
*  And an order has been issued. I'm glad that that order has been extended. Of course I am.
*  But the point I want to get across is that it's hugely important that we minimise the loss of
*  human life. And anyone seeing those scenes from Gaza, it's horrendous for those people that are
*  facing that at this point in time. So he refused to say whether he supported forcible displacement
*  or opposed it. That's a war crime, a very clear war crime, which David Lammy could not condemn.
*  Is that being cleared throughout the conflict that international law must be upheld?
*  Obviously not. It gets worse. Let's listen to Emily Thornberry, my own MP,
*  Labour's shadow attorney general, who will therefore be the top lawyer in the next Labour government,
*  when she was asked about cutting off food, water and power to civilians.
*  But I mean, I don't know. They've already cut off the food. I hear what you're saying. But what I'm
*  saying is that... Is that against international law? It's really simple. Sakeir Sparmer doesn't seem to
*  think it is. What is simple is that whatever actions are taken by a democracy, it has to be
*  done in accordance with international law. And we have heard tonight from the President of the
*  United States that he has been on the phone to Netanyahu and both of them have agreed that
*  democracies need to act in accordance with international law. OK, pause there if I may.
*  Do you think cutting off food, water and electricity is within international law?
*  I think that Israel has an absolute right to defend itself against terrorism. That's not the question I asked.
*  It is an answer to the question that you've asked and I think it's an appropriate one at this time.
*  Why won't you answer whether you think it's in line with international law?
*  Because I've tried to answer and I've tried to say that we've already heard from your previous
*  guest about what might be happening on a day-to-day basis. So we're now on day four
*  and so we hear that there are troops massing on the border. There may well be an incursion.
*  Immediately before an incursion, then as the permanent representative has said,
*  that it might be appropriate in those circumstances for there to be the sort of action that we've heard about.
*  And then the invasion afterwards. I don't know because at the moment we're in the middle of a hot war
*  and Israel is in the middle of defending itself and we have to stand with Israel just like we
*  would expect people to stand with us if we were the victims of terrorism as well.
*  There we go again, refusing to condemn this overt war crime. Also back in October,
*  Labour's international development secretary or shadow international development secretary,
*  Lisa Nandy, also refused to say whether Israel breached international law when it cut off power
*  and water to Gaza. Do you think Israel breached international law by cutting off water and power
*  supplies? Look, I think this is an extraordinarily complex and fast-moving situation. There are 200
*  hostages. And what's the answer to the question? Well, Israel has the right to self-defence and
*  it has a duty to secure the release of its hostages. But we have to ensure that international law is
*  upheld. Right, and so my question is, do you think Israel has breached international humanitarian law
*  by cutting off water and fuel supplies? Well, in the last 24 hours we've seen water, medicine,
*  and food enter Gaza. It is in very limited supply at the moment, but I am hopeful that we'll be able
*  to amplify and scale up those efforts urgently. There is a very small window in which an Israeli
*  government that is responding to fear and pain in Israel and the Egyptian government as well who
*  have serious concerns about the opening of the Rafah crossing may be persuaded with the help of
*  the United States and others to not just allow aid into Gaza, but to allow safe passage through
*  Gaza to reach people in the north. And that's what we've got to focus on. I am going to ask
*  the question again, do you think Israel breached international law by cutting off power and water
*  supplies? Look, I'm not going to sit in your studio and grandstand and tell you that I'm going to make
*  big pronouncements. It gets worse and worse. Israel, oh so coincidentally, succeeded in kicking down
*  the CJ, placing it on trial for genocide off the headlines by suddenly releasing that 12 members
*  of UNRWA, the UN agencies class were looking after Palestinian refugees and the main humanitarian
*  agency in Gaza, were allegedly involved in the 7th of October attacks. Now we don't know what crimes
*  they're accused of. They haven't been tried or found guilty of anything. They've had no justice
*  process in fact and the evidence comes allegedly from interrogations by the Shin Bet, Israel's
*  military intelligence who used torture. So that's unproven and unspecified allegations from a state
*  with a track record of lying through its teeth against members of an organisation which employs
*  30,000 staff. So that's 0.04%. The result, countries such as the United States and Britain
*  have suspended their fund date of UNRWA. What does that mean exactly? UNRWA is the main humanitarian
*  agency in Gaza as they say. Gaza is on the brink of famine. Its people are deprived of necessities
*  like clean water and shelter. Its healthcare system has been destroyed. In its provisional
*  measures, the ICJ has just ruled that Israel must take immediate and effective measures to
*  enable the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance to address
*  the adverse conditions of life faced by Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Well that's now impossible with
*  UNRWA being defunded. As they've said themselves, they won't be able to continue assisting Gaza
*  beyond February unless funding is restored. According to the UN special rapporteur on the
*  right to food, Michael Fakhry, before this decision, famine was imminent. Famine is now
*  inevitable. So what does Lisa Nandy say as Labour's shadow international development secretary after
*  the Conservatives pull the plug on Gaza's main humanitarian agency during an epic humanitarian
*  catastrophe? She says,
*  Now, it gets worse.
*  In a previous video I spoke to Dallol Nader, a Palestinian man whose family was killed in Gaza
*  after he was thrown out of a Labour meeting in my hometown Stockport like he was a bag of trash.
*  Labour's shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds and Labour's deputy leader Angela
*  Reina just stood there. It later transpired that Angela Reina, who has refused to vote for
*  CISFAT and refused to speak out against the massacre of Gaza, previously met Noural,
*  posed for a picture with him and told him, I support Palestine, Palestine must be free.
*  Then does nothing as Palestinians are massacred and then she watches this Palestinian she
*  previously met, who she personally committed to, to support Palestine get aggressively thrown out
*  of her meeting like he was less than dirt. What do you even say? What do you even say?
*  Ruddy stood for leader, Keir Starmer promised, and I quote, to put human rights
*  at the heart of foreign policy. That was place number four, by the way. Just one lie,
*  amongst so many other lies, as he duped Labour members into voting for him on an entirely false
*  prospectus. What actually happened in the end? The Labour Party under his leadership ended up both
*  overtly backing war crimes and refusing to condemn war crimes and backing an Israeli onslaught,
*  which is now being investigated as a possible genocide by the highest court on earth.
*  Does it bode well for them, does it, in terms of running the country? Bear in mind that the sort
*  of people surrounding Keir Starmer and those who are dominant in the Labour Party are now the sort
*  of people who think the Iraq war was a good thing and would do it all over again, even knowing what
*  they do now. What a terrible state our democracy is in, with so little to choose from. Either a
*  Conservative party which has wrecked the country, which is enabling a potential genocide, and a
*  Labour party no longer committed to reversing the damage inflicted by the toys on the country and
*  which also cheers on a potential genocide. Bleak. But all the more reason for the rest of us to
*  speak out and loudly too. Please like and subscribe, do share this video, keep the show
