# NO EXCUSES Israel's Genocide Was Obvious One Year Ago
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA9L0dCWsg8)
*  It's been a year now of Israel's genocide against the Palestinian people, in which some of
*  the worst atrocities of the 21st century, some of the worst crimes it is possible for human to commit,
*  have been live streamed to us every single day, all facilitated by western states and the US
*  administration of Joe Biden in particular. The mass slaughter of the Palestinian people,
*  with credible estimates for medics and public health experts ranging from 119,000 killed,
*  to 186,000 killed, to 335,500 killed. Gaza had a pre-war population estimated between 2.2 million
*  and 2.3 million, so such estimates would suggest a rate of killing comparable to,
*  or in excess of, Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, and certainly the worst rate of killing since
*  the Rwandan genocide of 1994. Even if you use the official death toll of 41,000, which excludes
*  thousands missing under rubble, or those killed because of the destruction of healthcare,
*  or those in unmarked graves, or above all else because of the collapse of the reporting system,
*  as civilisation, the basics of it, are destroyed, it would still be a war with a much worse rate
*  of killing than Iraq, Syria, Yugoslavia, you name it. As per Oxfam's research, in the last year,
*  more women and children have been killed than in any conflict in the same time period for the last
*  two decades. The vast majority of Gaza's population has been violently displaced repeatedly.
*  Around 100,000 have been maimed and injured. Most civilian infrastructure, homes, schools,
*  hospitals, universities, mosques, churches, libraries, we could go on, have been damaged
*  or destroyed, to the extent Gaza looks a different colour and texture when looked at from space.
*  Mass incarceration without charge in the most barbaric conditions imaginable.
*  Torture on an industrial scale. Mass reports of rape and gang rape. As per Save the Children,
*  the sexual abuse of child detainees. The destruction of the healthcare system,
*  with all hospitals destroyed or damaged. Over 900 medical workers killed. Children having
*  amputations and women having caesareans with no anaesthetic. The biggest slaughter of journalists
*  in any conflict in recorded history. The biggest slaughter of aid workers in any conflict in
*  recorded history. The biggest slaughter of UN staff in any conflict in recorded history.
*  Overwhelming evidence of little children killed with sniper shots to the head or massacred in
*  their cars, terrified alongside their families. The bodies of Palestinians thrown from roofs by
*  IDF soldiers, ISIS style. A man-made famine, thanks for a siege of food, medical supplies,
*  and the other basic essentials of human existence, as well as a violent pogrom in the West Bank,
*  and now an Israeli invasion of Lebanon. Now almost a year ago I recorded a video,
*  it was the 9th of October, so two days after the 7th of October attacks. I'm not sharing
*  extracts from this video because of some smug, I told you so, a public school type desire to show
*  off how right I was. I'm sharing these extracts because there has been one theme I've doggedly
*  stuck to throughout this genocide, which is this. Nobody, nobody must be allowed to say,
*  I did not know what was really happening. Nobody must be allowed to plead ignorance.
*  It was clear from the very start, not with the benefit of hindsight, what was going to happen.
*  There has to be accountability, and in that spirit, we must make it clear,
*  we said from the start what would happen. And we were right.
*  What I said in that video wasn't based on any special insight or genius, I just did two things.
*  I looked at precedent, that is Israel's past behaviour, and I took the genocidal statements
*  of Israel's leaders at face value. I didn't think it was hyperbole, I didn't think, I don't know,
*  they were letting off steam or something. When they promised to commit war crimes,
*  when they promised to exact collective punishment against the Palestinian people,
*  when they promised mass destruction, I believed them. And indeed those statements proved the
*  most accurate predictor of what Israel would in fact go on to do. Now it's clear in that video
*  that grave war crimes were committed on the 7th of October for which there's no defence,
*  more on that shortly. I warned in this video that Palestinians were dehumanised
*  and that no worth was attached to their lives. Here's what I said near the beginning of the video.
*  Now the same basic commitment to innocent civilian life, to protecting it, that I just expressed,
*  that applies or should apply to Gaza, to Palestinians, but in truth, it doesn't.
*  Now if asked, the vast majority of people would say that human life is of equal worth,
*  regardless of nationality, ethnicity or religion, but we have to be honest here,
*  in practice many just do not believe this. Some deaths matter far more than others. This is known
*  as a hierarchy of death and Palestinians are near the bottom. This is the inevitable consequence
*  always of occupation and colonisation. When European states subjugated their colonies,
*  they rationalised that subjugation by stripping their colonial subjects of their humanity.
*  They were lesser inferior people and thus could be treated as such. Now believing that some
*  people's lives are inherently inferior is racism and we should say that loud and clear because
*  anti-Palestinian racism is rampant, unchallenged and respectable. Now however this current nightmarish
*  episode ends, there is only one certainty and that is far more Palestinians will die and be maimed.
*  This has been an absolute iron rule and certainty in decades of occupation.
*  As I say there, as I said, Palestinians will die and be maimed, well yes, far more a year on.
*  An estimated 36 Israeli children were killed on the 7th of October. A conservative estimate
*  would make it 14,000 or so Palestinian children since. What I emphasise in this video is that
*  without the context of what the Palestinian people had suffered for so long, there could be no
*  understanding of what had happened and what would go on to happen too. Now if we don't talk about
*  the decades-long occupation, if we don't talk about apartheid and Amnesty International,
*  Human Rights Watch and Israeli human rights organisation Bezalem have all called this apartheid,
*  if we don't talk about the theft of Palestinian land and its illegal colonisation by Israeli
*  settlers, if we don't talk about the 248 Palestinian civilians including 40 children killed
*  by Israeli forces and settlers alone this year before the current violence began, then yes,
*  horrors like this will seem to suddenly appear like lightning from a clear blue sky but that is not
*  the truth. Take those 248 Palestinian civilians and kids, did you even know about them? Be honest,
*  did you know about them? Did you know they existed? I don't think you did in all honesty
*  and that isn't your fault because there is almost no interest in those deaths, there is no meaningful
*  coverage of what happened to them because Palestinian life is simply not deemed to be of any
*  worth or importance and what's more we all know it. Indeed between January 2008 and September 2023
*  out of 6,715 deaths in Israel and Palestine, 95% were Palestinian and 4.6% were Israeli.
*  Out of 158,867 injuries, 4% Israeli, 96% Palestinian. But you know, you know that the
*  horror and condemnation for this overwhelming proportion of Palestinian deaths and injuries
*  is simply not there. They are not regarded as human beings like you and me and if they were,
*  their deaths would not be tolerated. Well again, that basic dehumanization of the Palestinian
*  people is a theme I've continually returned to so that the mass slaughter of Palestinians, for example,
*  before the 7th of October, is simply erased. Here's a key part. And now even greater horrors are to come.
*  Listen now to the Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galan.
*  We are imposing a complete siege on Gaza. There will be no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel.
*  Everything will be closed. We are fighting against human animals and we are acting accordingly.
*  Now let's be clear, these words, what's been uttered here, are on one level collective punishment.
*  That is illegal under international law. What he's speaking about there is commitment to a war crime.
*  It's also the language of genocide. That is genocidal language and we all know it. Human
*  animals, you say this to justify doing anything and everything to those you're going to inflict
*  suffering upon. Now Netanyahu has already said that the people of Gaza must leave because of
*  what is to be unleashed but there is nowhere to escape. They cannot get out. There is nowhere to go.
*  As I say here, what Yoav Galan, Defense Minister, promised here was to commit war crimes and his
*  language was genocidal. But here's the thing, here's the thing. There were countless, countless
*  such genocidal pronouncements at the time. That was just one of them. But many Western media outlets
*  didn't even cover such statements and when they did cover, say, that statement, you've got a
*  failure to explicitly describe what that statement was, what that promise was, which was a promise to
*  break international law. I mean it's just clear cut. What he promised there, cutting off the basics
*  of human existence as civilians, is a violation of international law. It's just a factual description.
*  That was missing. You didn't get that accompanying that statement in multiple
*  Western media outlets. What's striking about it is a siege did happen, has happened, is happening
*  and it caused famine. And the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor issued a request for
*  arrest warrants against Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Galan focusing on that specific crime arising
*  from siege. What should have happened if we had a functioning media in the West is the courage should
*  have been framed around the explicit, countless, multiple genocidal threats and specific commitments
*  to collective punishment and to commit war crimes by Israeli leaders and officials. That didn't happen,
*  even though it proved a hideously accurate predictor of what in fact went on to happen.
*  And journalism and those media outlets must not be allowed to get away with it. Let me be blunt
*  here. How is it possible for me, an isolated, within the Western media, newspaper columnist,
*  sitting there in an Airbnb in Liverpool during a Labour Party conference, how is it possible for me
*  to accurately call out genocidal language and the specific commitment to war crimes on the basis of
*  this shows what was going to happen, which was then vindicated in the worst possible way,
*  but not the rest of the media. And again, I didn't need special insight. I'm not a prophet.
*  I just took seriously what Israeli leaders said they were going to do, which they then went and
*  did. Then I referred to the statement of then British Foreign Secretary, the unfortunately named
*  James Cleverley. Listen now to our Foreign Secretary, James Cleverley.
*  In terms of the Israeli response, do you think it is proportionate for Israel to cut off water,
*  electricity, food, fuel, all those things to the people of Gaza?
*  Israel has a right to defend itself against attack. The UK completely supports Israel's
*  rights to defend itself proportionately. The truth of the matter is that this was a terrorist attack
*  perpetrated by Hamas who are embedded in Gaza, shielding themselves amongst the Palestinian people
*  in Gaza. And we will continue to support Israel as it seeks to defend itself against this brutal
*  terrorist attack initiated by Hamas. So there you have it. The official position
*  of the British government is to support war crimes. That's what he's saying here.
*  Corpability for the atrocities, which will now undoubtedly be committed in the coming days,
*  weeks and months, will be shared with Western governments. Israel is their ally, armed and
*  backed by them, just as the future of the Palestinian people has been disregarded by them.
*  And now some will try to absolve themselves of cheering on this bloodbath by simply blaming
*  Hamas and claiming that Hamas is responsible for all becoming bloodshed and all the lives that will
*  be lost. No, it's not true. Every atrocity committed by the Israeli state is a choice and
*  their bullets and bombs will kill civilians, including children.
*  As I said here, the British government was giving a blank check to Israel to commit what I said
*  would be the atrocities which will now undoubtedly be committed in the coming days, weeks and months,
*  and that therefore, culpability for those atrocities, which were clearly going to happen,
*  would be shared with Western governments arming and backing Israel. As I said, a bloodbath was
*  coming and there could be no excuses. The Israeli state and the Western backers were responsible.
*  This is why I also wrote, on the 24th of October 2023, a column for The Guardian entitled
*  Israel is clear about its intentions in Gaza. World leaders cannot plead ignorance of what is coming.
*  I wrote there that those who backed this obscenity would try and wash the hands of it at future dates
*  and that we must not let them. As I said in that column, from collective punishment by
*  depriving innocent people of water, food, energy and medicine to indiscriminate bombing of civilian
*  excuses.
*  On the 27th of November 2023, I posted a video. It was after a British Israeli friend got my name
*  on the list of a screening by the IDF in central London of footage of atrocities committed by
*  Hamas and other armed groups on the 7th of October. What I then did is a lengthy video in which I very
*  clearly set out what I had seen. I was always clear then, and before, and since, that grave war
*  crimes had been committed on the 7th of October for which there is no defence, no cause on earth
*  ever justifies killings of Indians. I also set out what wasn't in the video footage, and for that I
*  was absolutely vilified, lied about and my job was threatened. But everything I said was correct,
*  factually correct and subsequently vindicated by an in-depth Al Jazeera documentary. You see,
*  the Israeli state in its cheerleaders focused on the atrocities that didn't happen rather than the
*  atrocities that did. Why? To project the image of Gaza being full of subhuman,
*  depraved sociopaths that numb people's empathy or outrage as Gaza was wiped from the face of the
*  earth, and because the Israeli state was always going to murder far, far more civilians. So to
*  present the violence committed by the Israeli state as pure compared to the depravity of Hamas
*  and other armed groups. In other words, to focus on atrocities that didn't happen rather than
*  the ones that did because there wasn't enough of a distinction between those sorts of atrocities
*  and what Israel was going to do and did do in order to justify genocide. Now even as the worst
*  possible crimes have been committed in the last year, mass murder of civilians, mass destruction
*  of civilian infrastructure, torture, rape, ethnic cleansing, we could go on. There has been this
*  abominable failure to properly portray accurately what has actually happened,
*  even though it was clear from the start what would happen. So I say all this again for a very clear
*  reason. We, and I say we, on the grounds that far more knowledgeable and eloquent people said all
*  this at the time. We knew what was going to happen. We said what was going to happen.
*  And mainstream media outlets overwhelmingly failed on those counts and instead echoed
*  Israeli propaganda, stripped away historical context, dehumanised the Palestinian people,
*  failed to accurately cover heinous war crimes. We could go on and doing so made themselves
*  accomplices to genocide. Well if you're going to be an accomplice to genocide, you must be held to
*  account. Just like journalists were held to account for their role in the Rwandan genocide.
*  Over the course of this year, this channel has done its best to offer an alternative,
*  offering up the voices you need to hear, the facts that are being erased, the horrors that
*  are being ignored. In the ahead, it's my intention to expand the operation, not least given the US
*  presidential election, its aftermath beckons and I'm afraid many horrors also to come.
*  But you've made all that the channel has done possible. I've done everything I can not to let
*  you down. But finally, a tribute, and this is really important. We wouldn't know the actual
*  reality of this hideous crime of historic proportions without Palestinian journalists
*  who've been slaughtered, often alongside their little kids and their entire families.
*  The work people such as myself do in the West is only possible because of their work, which they do
*  and did do in impossible circumstances. We must never ever stop paying tribute to them.
*  They are the lions of the world, press back. They will be remembered throughout the ages.
*  And if they can keep using their platforms to tell the truth about one of the worst crimes of
*  our time, while risking their lives every single day, then those of us in far more
*  privileged circumstances, well, that's the very least that we can do. Please like and subscribe,
*  leave your thoughts and your comments. Help keep us showing the road.
*  I should say we're going to cover the US elections. So our plan is to do videos
*  across the United States. So help us do that. Listen to the podcast, I'll speak to you soon.
