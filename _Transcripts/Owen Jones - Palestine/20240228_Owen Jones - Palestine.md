# Labour Purges Jewish Politician... Because He Backed Gaza Ceasefire
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [February 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd1XKWc68hw)
*  Since Israel's onslaught against Gaza began, Kirstama's Labour Party has supported the position of the Conservative government as it has allowed Israel to get away with murder.
*  When predominantly Muslim councillors resigned, a party source boasted that they were shaking off the fleas.
*  Shadow ministers who oppose the slaughter have been sacked or resigned and even been threatened with being purged altogether.
*  Not an empty threat.
*  Two Labour MPs have had the boot. One for calling for peaceful coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians.
*  The other for describing Gaza as a genocide on the day the highest court on earth put Israel on trial for alleged genocide.
*  It gets worse.
*  I'm now going to speak to Martin Abrams. He's a Labour councillor.
*  Well, that's how he's elected. He's Jewish. He's been a family friend since the 1990s.
*  He's a lovely bloke who's far more principled than the dead behind the eyes, West Wing wannabes, who now treat the Labour Party as a personal career ladder.
*  He's just been given the boot by his local Labour council group in Lambeth, London.
*  So he's been given indefinite suspension, along with disciplinary action against three other councillors, one of whom is a black councillor of the Windrush generation.
*  Why? Because they voted for a ceasefire.
*  I start by asking Martin about his family background and how he got involved in politics.
*  Hi, Arran. So and good evening to all your viewers.
*  So I was brought up in a very political, very Labour Jewish family in Tainside in East Manchester.
*  And actually, one of my first memories was going on a minor strike march with my mum and dad.
*  So, you know, the Labour movement and the Labour Party has been in my blood for the best part of four decades.
*  And, you know, I've got parents that have been committed members of the Labour Party for the best part of 45 years.
*  And been Labour Party activists for all that time, campaigning for Tom Pendry MP.
*  And, you know, I'll never forget the look on my mum and dad's face following the crushing election feat in 1992 when Neil Kinnock lost to the Tories.
*  And those kind of memories remain with me.
*  And, you know, I'm not I'm not kind of here to prove my Labour Party credentials, but, you know, I am I am Labour through and through.
*  And, you know, I have been brought up within within the Labour movement.
*  And and, you know, it was actually one of the proudest moments of my life to be elected as a Labour councillor in in Lambeth at that time.
*  And and, you know, I'm keen to to continue serving the residents despite what has happened over recent days.
*  Explain what has happened, because supposedly now national level Labour was supposed to have backed under pressure from the SNP in immediate what they would then rephrase as immediate humanitarian ceasefire.
*  They stripped out collective punishment.
*  That would mean actually doing something like arms, reviewing arms sales, that kind of thing.
*  But but what what the hell happened?
*  What what motion did you vote for and why the hell have you been suspended?
*  So, you know, obviously every council has different timings for their full council meetings.
*  We after the horrific events of October the seventh, the first full council meeting we had was a few weeks, a few weeks after and no no motion was brought to that full council.
*  So it was it was glaringly obvious because there is a green opposition in Lambeth.
*  It was glaringly obvious to me and many other councillors that they would be bringing a ceasefire motion to the next full council, which happened on January the twenty fourth.
*  And, you know, throughout the time building up to that, councillors were asking for, you know, space, a safe space to discuss the conflicts.
*  I know many councillors are, you know, you know, really, really emotionally affected by this.
*  I know that the Green Party is one of the most diverse boroughs in the UK and many of our councillors reflect that diversity.
*  And and, you know, you know, to see the horrific events as to what's been happening over the last few months, it's taken a real personal toll, you know, mentally on many of us.
*  And we were requesting a space to discuss it.
*  I would say that the Labour group could formulate a way forward.
*  Personally, I would have liked to have seen the Labour group put forward their own ceasefire motion to essentially outflank the Greens because no doubt, you know, there was there was a little bit of political point scoring going on here as there is in every political space.
*  But the Greens brought a motion to the full council in January.
*  The Labour group were told that it was unamendable, which still I don't believe has been explained anywhere clearly enough.
*  And we were then whipped to vote against it in full council.
*  And I and three other councillors broke the whip on that day.
*  And three of us voted for the ceasefire motion.
*  And one of us abstained.
*  And then what happened? What were you told after that?
*  So, I mean, after that, you know, once you break the whip, then an investigation is started.
*  And I had to speak to the chief whip.
*  And once the investigation is finished, then we were told we all had to come to a hearing.
*  And this was the most daunting part of this entire thing, because the hearing consisted of the entire Labour group, the local campaigns forum,
*  which is the group elected to, you know, within Labour to select candidates in Lambeth itself, and quite a few Labour group observers as well.
*  So there's about 70 people in the room. And it felt, you know, like a bit of a show trial designed to humiliate and shame the councillors that had voted for a ceasefire.
*  The meeting consisted of four separate hearings for the four individual councillors.
*  The meeting went up two hours, over two hours in total, with about an hour of questioning from members of Labour group and members of the Labour cabinet.
*  And it was gruelling. And it was humiliating, because, you know, it really was a deeply unpleasant experience.
*  And then after that, there was a vote amongst the Labour group and my personal case, I was suspended indefinitely.
*  When you say kind of gruelling and humiliating, what kind of questioning? What was the tone? What was the kind of approach they had?
*  Well, I mean, firstly, you have to listen to the WIPs report following the investigation.
*  And, you know, it really paints a picture of, they really tried to paint a picture of me in particular as, you know, as someone that did not deserve to be a member of Labour group and that should face the highest sanction.
*  I've worked tirelessly to represent my local residents since being elected. And it's hard work. I'm not going to lie.
*  You know, I've got a young family, got a full-time job, but I've really respected the role of a councillor.
*  And, you know, I'm confident that my residents would actually agree with that as well.
*  You know, I've taken the approach as a local councillor to be accessible, to be engaging, you know, hundreds of resident visits, you know, dozens of councillor surgeries, telephone calls.
*  I've been to visit, you know, community groups. I've really embraced the role of a councillor.
*  And, you know, this hearing really painted a picture that was almost entirely negative. And it was, it was a humiliating experience.
*  You know, the one thing that I did not do was say that I would, I would vote for, say that I would not have voted for the Ceasefire motion if history would repeat itself, you know, because I tried to explain that this was a vote of conscience for me based upon my, my Jewish background and, you know, my beliefs and humanitarian beliefs.
*  But that wasn't, that wasn't accepted as a justification for breaking the whip.
*  You know, Owen, you yourself know full well that what we're witnessing in Gaza is one of the greatest crimes of our age.
*  And it's being played out in real time. And as a parent of two young kids, it's very difficult to watch that being played out when there's so many, so many children suffering and seeing images of killed or maimed children has taken a real personal toll on my mind.
*  And I tried to explain that to the Labour group, but they didn't seem to accept that as a justification.
*  I mean, you know, you were, you face this disciplinary action as a Jewish Labour councillor. I know as well a councillor from the Windrush generation, a very respected anti-racism campaigners fought for the Windrush.
*  The victims of that terrible injustice was also booted out.
*  I mean, what does it say about the modern Labour Party, beating out Jewish Labour councillors, Windrush generation councillors, because they voted against the onslaught against Gaza, which is killing tens of thousands of people, including well over 14,000 children.
*  I mean, it's the will to end up upside down.
*  I mean, we're living in a topsy turvy world, aren't we, Aaron? And, you know, there's a distinctly authoritarian approach being taken by this Labour Party, because, you know, if the boot was on the other foot, you know, if we were living between, you know, 2015 and 2019, and, you know, the previous leadership were suspending black and Jewish councillors for voting, you know, for something like that.
*  There would be outrage, you know, it would probably make the six o'clock news.
*  But as it happens, you know, the wider media aren't hugely interested in this, because the current leadership, Keir Starmer, seems to get a free pass at every given opportunity.
*  And it is, it doesn't feel like there's a fair playing field at the moment. And it's people on the left, like myself, that are really suffering as a result.
*  You know, we've seen dozens and dozens of councillors resign over this conflict. You know, we've seen dozens of MPs break the whip during this conflict. And, you know, they've been sacked as a result.
*  Before I ask my final question, you know, I've been writing and talking about Germany, I've been interviewing, for example, German Jewish activists there, who pointed out that a third of those, and research has shown that a third of those who have been arrested or been deplatformed are Jewish over Gaza.
*  And, you know, you just had Yuval Abraham, who I've interviewed, a brilliant Israeli Jewish journalist who spoke at the Berlin Ali Film Festival, condemning the atrocities, the horrors of what the Palestinian people are going through, denounced by the non-Jewish Berlin mayor as anti-Semitism and other German media outlets for being anti-Semitic, and then have a hate mob come to his family's home, trying to violently target his family.
*  I mean, you can see that playing out there, but it seems here as well that there has been actually a disproportionate number of Jewish people who have been targeted in some way, including in the Labour Party, for speaking out against the injustices currently going on in terms of the Palestinian people.
*  I mean, it's remarkable.
*  It is remarkable, and, you know, it's both incredibly depressing, but also incredibly inspiring to see just how many Jewish people are coming out to stand up against and speak out against the atrocities that we're seeing in Gaza.
*  I mean, you know, we've seen huge and increasing numbers on the Jewish Bloc, on the national Palestine marches, you know, we've seen groups like Jewish Voice for Peace and Narmad, you know, really taking leads in that sort of communal space.
*  And, you know, I'm proud to be a member of some of those groups as well, because there has to be a space for Jewish voices that want to speak out and shout and scream about what is almost certainly a genocide being perpetrated in Gaza right now.
*  And the fact that many Jewish people are then being sanctioned or persecuted essentially as a result of them speaking out is just simply not acceptable.
*  And it's incumbent on us as Jews within that space to keep speaking out, you know, that is the very least we can do.
*  You know, I was brought up, Arren, you know, being taught about my ancestors who were basically persecuted in the pogroms of Kiev and came to this country as refugees.
*  You know, I was always taught to stand up against oppression and stand with the oppressed.
*  So for me, you know, when people say never again, when I say never again, I mean never again for everybody.
*  And, you know, there is simply no space or justification for any silence around the genocide that's been committed in Gaza at the moment.
*  And very finally, that's what I was going to ask you. A lot of people will look at all over the Western world and beyond people who are being sacked, deplatformed, arrested, suffering legal consequences, you know, demonized in the media, threatened in various ways for speaking out.
*  And a lot of people might look at that and think, not for me, I can't speak out. I don't want to take the risk.
*  What would you say to those people given what we're seeing in Gaza at the moment?
*  I mean, I understand that, you know, it is, you know, personally and professionally very, very difficult.
*  But I'll go back to what I said before. What we're seeing, though, is one of the greatest crimes of our age in history.
*  We'll judge those that speak out and the history will judge those that remain silent.
*  And that is exactly where we are at the moment. So, you know, personally, I've suffered the consequences of taking that stance.
*  You know, I'm going to keep speaking out. I'm not going to be cowed in any way, shape or form.
*  And I will use whatever platform I have to keep doing what I can.
*  The repercussions for me are nothing compared to the suffering, the pain and the loss that people are facing in Gaza as we have this conversation.
*  So it's incumbent on all of us to keep speaking out in any way, any which way, shape or form and, you know, keep showing that there are voices that will be bold enough to do that.
*  Amen. Well, I'm very proud of you. And I think everyone watching and listening to this will be very proud of you as well.
*  And history will be, I think, can be a damning judge. And I think it will be beyond damning for those who are complicit in this.
*  And I just always say to people, people look back at terrible injustices and think, I would have been on the right side during McCarthyism or all these other terrible things that happened in the past.
*  I would have been on the right side. I would have spoken out. Most people weren't.
*  Most people didn't speak out. And the few who did were often attacked. Whose side would you rather be on?
*  And I think, you know, that's the lesson from history. And I hope people look at your example and they're feeling bold enough to speak out.
*  And so it's a big honor. Please, everyone watching or listening, do share this video. Press like, subscribe.
*  And a massive thanks to Martin, who, as I said, showed courage and leadership.
*  And history will damn those who have suspended him and people like Martin will be remembered in all the best ways. So cheers, Martin.
*  Thank you, Aaron.
