# Israel's Propaganda Machine EXPOSED
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [December 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_wNbcPqgL0)
*  Hello, I am absolutely delighted to be joined by the brilliant Mark Owen Jones who is associate professor of Middle East studies the author of
*  Digital authoritarianism in the Middle East and quick repression and by rain also just confused everyone. We do obviously have remarkably
*  Similar names. We're not
*  Not as far as I know related. I'm sure if you go back long enough in Welsh history
*  There is maybe some who knows some familial ties used to know right son of John. That's what Jones means
*  Yeah, it's not the rarest name in Wales to be fair
*  I'm delighted to tell you today particularly about misinformation in the horror show, which is of course the onslaught against
*  Gaza and and I have to say look every
*  Wartime propaganda as long as there's been war there has been wartime propaganda
*  But obviously the nature of the digital revolution means there's far more I suppose avenues now
*  For that and I suppose the Israeli state has a very sophisticated propaganda machine. So I just want to start
*  One of the things you look at is about the issue of what's called disinfluencers, which I'm very fascinated with
*  What the hell is a disinfluencer and what's their role in the current horror? Well, I the term disinfluencer is something I came up with
*  Because of my research what what I've noticed is essentially it's someone who routinely spreads this information right this information and influencer
*  Combine them you've got this influencer and the reason I use that term is because I've noticed that there's people essentially who routinely spread fake news
*  And that can be the official Israel account lived linked to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or it can be others who seem to be
*  spreading pro-israel propaganda in this case or any other form of propaganda or disinformation and
*  For reasons that seem suspicious and by that I mean they crop up every now and then to you know
*  Share an absolute whopper. So just to give an example, which I think is always useful
*  You know one of the strategies that israel has always used is to initially attribute anything to hamas or palestinian
*  We all remember the killing of shireen abu akhla last year initially, you know the strategy was to say oh we didn't do it
*  Or if it was a palestinian gunman. It was the al jazeera journalist for those who don't remember
*  Yes, sorry
*  Yes
*  Al jazeera journalist and it was later found that she the israeli uh soldiers actually had shot her right despite attempts to cover it up
*  And uh disinfluences in this day and age will do something similar, right? So i've seen a bunch of these
*  tweeting and writing about
*  Uh, what's going on in Gaza?
*  Uh, amjad taha is one of them. He's a famous disinfluencer. He's spread many fake stories in the past
*  But what really caught my attention recently he for example, there was a video that was shared circulated a few weeks ago showed
*  Some people cycling around dead bodies on the road
*  It had very clearly been the result of an israel airstrike or artillery attack and without a
*  You know without waiting a second. He basically claimed it was hamas snipers
*  No, no evidence to back that up. It got thousands and thousands of shares millions of views and shares and uh,
*  It then got picked up by legacy outlets, right?
*  Like the new york post they used him as a source for the story to say that hamas snipers were shooting palestinian civilians
*  But he has no credibility. In fact, i've looked at this guy for three years and he spreads
*  Fake stories, you know, like for example saying that you know, kata bribed ecuador to lose the opening game of the world cup
*  Ecuador won by the way, and and so this is a good example of a disinfluencer but also seeing the emergence of you know
*  Hasbro accounts. These are people who engage in pro israel propaganda
*  But also I would argue that the official state accounts of israel accounts like israel at israel on x
*  Which is linked to the ministry of foreign affairs are disinfluences because they routinely share fake news and this
*  When it happens so often, I mean
*  We can't say it's an accident anymore
*  Which is why I say this because this means deliberately sharing false news as opposed to miss which means accidentally sharing false news
*  I no longer believe that these actors are acting in good faith and sharing news
*  That's false just by accident because they do it so often
*  so what i mean you've alluded to there one of the key roles of disinfluences in this particular conflict is
*  There's a recognition that there was a colossal death toll which is obviously having an impact on western public opinion
*  And so it's to spread the idea that what you're seeing is not the product of israeli military action
*  but either you just give an example, it's actually hamas or
*  for example a recent is
*  what keeps recurring is of
*  babies
*  Who parents are grieving over actually dolls?
*  Uh, or indeed there was a use of one clip for example of a it turned out to be a thai
*  Toddler at halloween from 2021 and they claims that this moving supposed body wrapped up in in a kind of corpse
*  Of course, it was actually a palestinian child pretending to be dead
*  So, I mean that's a kind of example isn't it's to kind of go these aren't really dead people
*  They're not really dying and they spread that online to sow doubt
*  Yeah, I mean that's an example of crisis actors, right?
*  And we've seen this trope in russia ukraine by crisis actors
*  We're talking about the term actor someone who in theory is paid or faking injury
*  And again, you mentioned those two examples
*  But the most I think prominent one is the one shared by the israel account a few weeks ago of a baby
*  That claimed it was a doll wrapped in a shroud and it was it was a real actually wasn't it was a real
*  Baby who'd been killed and was being held by a grieving relative and not only that this has happened against
*  It happened a few days ago the same thing
*  uh accounts claiming that
*  Um the palestinians were using babies that were dolls to evoke sympathy
*  Again to cast doubt on the narrative that there have been so many palestinian losses and let's fuse this into a larger narrative a meta
*  Narrative, which is you know casting doubt on palestinians generally what would joe biden do about a month ago
*  He he basically kind of repeated this narrative that palestinian death figures or hamas death figures were not to be trusted
*  Even though a number of organizations have spoken out from human rights watch to others saying that palestinian death figures ministry of health have historically been
*  Reliable so there is a clear narrative that seeks to cast doubt on the huge volume of innocent palestinian civilians dying
*  And that ties in with israeli propaganda, which obviously tries to seek to minimize
*  the uh their perceived brutality right because obviously that will push public opinion against israel and public opinion is clearly moving against israel
*  And they are getting a little desperate which is why they resort to these ridiculous narratives and lies which are fundamentally also
*  Dehumanizing to lie and to claim that someone has just lost their child is using a doll
*  Is dehumanizing right you're calling that person a liar at the most perhaps the most um saddest or tragic time of their life
*  Yeah, it's the idea that palestinians are so depraved that they will um, it's they will pretend to grieve
*  Um over their dead children who aren't actually dead children. They're actually dolls. That's how to play
*  Well, it's it's an orientalist trope, right? It's the barbarian other it's the barbarian easterner the uncivilized easterner who will lie to gain sympathy
*  It's the duplicitous arab, right? It's tying into all these narratives, uh, you know about people from from the east being somehow
*  Deviant, you know, and it's super problematic, but it's being weaponized on a huge scale right now
*  There's another example, which has a crisis actor and this is a palestinian vlogger
*  Who frequently many I follow him myself on twitter people may see him out and about
*  um, and there's a meme that goes around which shows him in various situations as
*  Singer and he does he does actually think i've seen his video. He's actually quite a good singer's playlist
*  Um, um, but then it goes, you know, it goes through various, you know, like war correspondent and then it will show him pretending supposedly to be a
*  wounded patient
*  Um, which shows he was just pretending and that wasn't actually a wounded patient at all. It was his crisis actor
*  um and
*  Uh, yeah, and there was another example. I can't remember of him in that scenario
*  But that what that he is he isn't a crisis actor
*  Is he and that wasn't actually him and that meme by the way was shared by senior broadcast journalist
*  Here in britain who I won't name because i've got enough on my plate to be honest
*  But what do you what do you tell me tell me about that example?
*  I mean, I think those examples are you know, it's like, you know official israel accounts have shared
*  examples of people saying that they are injured
*  Palestinians faking injuries that are actually screenshots from films behind the scenes of films, right?
*  So people are taking content that decontextualizing and reappropriated to form propaganda and it's crude and it seems stupid
*  But at the end of the day like the secret with this information is not necessarily the quality
*  It's about putting out false information quickly and at scale and then you can fool people into believing those things
*  And just like the vlog I referred to they what they did is they got a palestinian 15 year old
*  Who was attacked last year in a refugee camp?
*  It wasn't him at all and they made it so it was actually him and it wasn't
*  You've also raised this example of them using fake nurses. Tell me about this. What are we talking about here?
*  Well, you know one of the muddy areas here of disinformation propaganda. It's not always clear
*  Who's behind it? Who's making it? But at the same time what's important is we can see who's sharing it, right?
*  The example of my faint nurse has been has become legendary, right?
*  It was about two weeks ago
*  and the reason the nurse was relevant is because one of the focal points of this war has been
*  Hospitals because israel have been attacking hospitals including a shift for medical conflicts, right?
*  And one of the arguments israel always use is that hamas are using these hospitals as bases and operating centers
*  They dig tunnels underneath it and they're using patients as human shields, right?
*  And so what israel have tried to do is try to spend time legitimizing at their attacks on hospitals which have resulted in hundreds of deaths
*  So the the the nurse was it's popped up online the tik tok video of someone who claimed to be a palestinian nurse working at al-shifa
*  Filming herself a selfie video saying oh, you know, i'm i'm basically um, uh hamas are awful
*  They're using people as human shields. They're not letting us leave right?
*  Has to know has to know and it was just I mean it was ridiculous firstly she had immaculate makeup in a war zone
*  Um, she she had like a very strategically placed palestinian ministry of health
*  signed behind her
*  Um, she was wearing um kind of an immaculate coat which you know after the horrors we've seen coming out of hospital is very implausible
*  The audio sounded fake
*  And crucially her accent was terrible. She didn't speak arabic. She wasn't a native speaker
*  And this video was then shared by the official israel ministry of foreign affairs camp in arabic and it was shared by
*  Uh hundreds of other influences and got millions of views, right?
*  The whole point of this video is very simple. It was trying to say i'm an insider
*  I'm a palestinian and I also oppose hamas
*  I agree with the israeli narrative that hamas are using this hospital
*  It was soon deleted because everyone was just taking the piss out of it because it was so obviously it was ludicrous
*  It was ludicrous, right? But it was being shared as if it was
*  Official accounts, right?
*  In a classic attempt of someone we don't necessarily know the source of that propaganda or that disinformation of course because it or deception
*  I mean it was many different things in addition to being propaganda, but it was concocted
*  um, and again, it was purely an attempt to try and
*  legitimize
*  Israeli attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure in hospitals
*  Um by faking an insider, right?
*  And again how many people saw this video and actually thought it was true before it was deleted in the book?
*  I like to think in this case, maybe not many believed it was true
*  Even the most odd people believing it. I saw people believing it. Yeah, I did at the time
*  I just you know, I need some faith in humanity to believe that people aren't necessarily stupid
*  Um, the soundtrack itself of the bobbins was so ludicrous. You'd hope so just two other things just in terms of the western media
*  And and how where how palest how policy is suffering is marginalized through selection bias. Just explain. What do you mean by that?
*  Because I know that's the theme of you
*  Yeah, so, I mean we have a war here. We have a historic, uh, you know
*  war we've we've have a situation where this
*  uh
*  Occupation apartheid is never contextualized. In fact, it's become taboo to specialize to contextualize it
*  You can't almost say that it didn't start on october the 7th
*  because if you say it starts on october the 7th, then that acknowledges that you blaming everything on hamas, which is
*  Unreasonable you need to look at the whole context of history here, but that's that's one aspect of how this
*  Uh conflict is framed. But the thing I think is really important is we've seen such a huge scale of palestinian
*  Uh deaths right verging on what the former icc prosecutor luacampo calls genocide, right?
*  And many people are calling it genocide or genocidal because it is um, and so you have a situation where you have
*  What is being described as genocide yet? You also have a situation where?
*  The number of people being killed is being omitted
*  Or at least completely in made invisible in mainstream media
*  So I did a study early on in this after about 14 days of coverage, for example in the daily mail
*  You know which many people know as a sort of right-leaning british newspaper
*  That's widely read and on the front pages of the first two weeks of this conflict
*  They did not mention the cumulative total of palestinians killed which is already reaching into the thousands not one day
*  And they mentioned for example the number of israelis who were killed about four or five times on the front pages, right?
*  And I know it's a right-wing paper
*  But to me that's a really really potent example of marginalization of palestinian suffering not wanting to give people
*  The full scale of the impact of israeli bombing on palestine and I think that is really key because remember
*  You know some people have said before that omission is one of the most violent forms of censorship
*  If you don't show something that is really crucial and
*  The amount of palestinians killed here is so crucial then you're engaging in some form of either censorship or worse certainly propaganda
*  And deception I would say because you're not giving people readily the full facts that are relevant for them to make an informed understanding of
*  What's going on now in Gaza and israel?
*  The other thing I know you've been speaking about is fear-mongering disinformation used to undermine solidarity with palestinian activists. What do you mean by that?
*  So this is really an interesting one, right?
*  One of the most crucial things to sustain I think the israeli bombing campaign is the notion that they get
*  Not unconditional western support, but they've had certainly uh, very clear support from the u.s
*  And uk and places like germany. So what's really important about
*  This is the way that you counter that support is to have activists and and people mobilize in places like the uk and the u.s
*  To basically express that they are not happy with their country's support for what is genocide, right?
*  So, you know israel knows this and so what do you do?
*  Well, you have to try and undermine solidarity movements abroad because their solidarity movements can change public opinion put pressure on the government
*  So we draw their support for israel and that's what's happening and we there's some really interesting things going on
*  So very early on in this in this in this war in october. I for example would see a video
*  Someone would share this video of a car doing donuts in a freeway in the u.s, right?
*  Bear with me. It sounds strange getting millions of engagements saying hey, look these jobs palestinian terrorists waving the palestinian flag
*  Are uh, you know here spreading, you know spreading their kind of agenda and ideology, right?
*  Essentially trying to get people in the u.s who are reading this content to sort of say
*  Oh my god, these palestinians are muslim terrorists and they're going to come and get us
*  Look at the video
*  Pause it zoom in. It's not even a palestinian flag
*  It's a cuban flag and the funny thing about that particular incident again, which went viral
*  Is that there was a cbs journalist stuck in the traffic a few cars behind?
*  And so I remember reached out to him along with another people and go hey
*  Was this a palestinian flag news? Like no it was nothing to do with that, right?
*  And so that was one example, but there's there's some more potent examples
*  I mean, I won't go into details about what's going on in college campuses in the u.s
*  But something came to light recently that was really alarming which is again
*  And college campuses are an important site of solidarity movements with palestine
*  So trying to smear pro-palestinian activists is a way of trying to spread fear and try to remove support from those movements
*  There was a case in the university of british columbia in canada
*  where um
*  Someone had been sticking i love hamas stickers around right and this was obviously used as an opportunity to say that pro-palestinian
*  Activists support hamas and terrorism and that there's those creating conditions that were making you know
*  Jewish students fearful for their safety, right and you can understand if that was true
*  Why that would be the case? However, it turned out that the person putting those stickers was a contractor for hillel
*  Which is a organization set up to you know, um
*  To promote jewish life on campus and it's been accused by some of being a zionist organization
*  So you have a contractor working for zionist organization?
*  Basically spreading i love hamas stickers around campus to create an atmosphere of fear and distrust
*  And anti-semitism and islamophobia now that level of deception is really akin to an influence operation someone trying to create division
*  amongst activists
*  In the uk in the u.s
*  In the u.s
*  In this case in canada in order to undermine the solidarity movement that would put pressure on its government to try and end their support
*  For the ongoing genocide in israel gaza by israel
*  Just very lastly, uh, because we can't so much from your incredible expertise. I mean maybe this is just hard
*  I mean, it's kind of speculative
*  It's just whenever I tweet about i've always whenever i tweet about lots of things get bombarded by people going, you know screaming all sorts of
*  gibberish, but it's never been so striking to me
*  And that when I tweet something
*  About israel slash gaza. I will immediately be bombarded with accounts which aren't following me
*  But they're clearly my tweets because they'll respond often immediately
*  um and
*  and
*  They're anonymous
*  They've often joined recently but you go through their tweets
*  That's just them responding about just talking about israel gaza and spreading certain narratives and claims which are
*  Obviously supportive of what is well is doing is that a troll farm basically and is it just impossible to prove that?
*  It's very hard to prove that but from what we know about how hasbro 2.0 operate
*  Uh, we know for example that in in previous bombing campaigns of araza
*  They have crisis kind of teams on university campuses in israel where people will all go to a room and engage in explaining where they will
*  Confront people who are seen as pro-palestinian or critical of israel to try and you know
*  Tell them the truth and that will also involve and can involve attacking those people, right?
*  So if you have suddenly loads of people who are told to do that it involves setting up new accounts
*  That is a nature of coordinated. I would say inauthentic behavior even if it's real
*  But at the same time we know and I know from uh, how x is operating now
*  that the prevalence of bots and fake accounts is huge and um
*  The chances are in this
*  In in any war in any conflict situation
*  There any regime will resort to using fake accounts and bots to try and intimidate and target key opinion formers
*  They're deemed to be influential voices with harassment. So I would say it's almost
*  99 99 sure that there are troll farms operating and then they are attacking you
*  Some of those will be real people too who have just got up
*  And and want to attack you but there's no doubt in my mind that there will be in fact
*  There is an israeli company called team. Jorge
*  Who who sell a software called aims and this whole software is basically an interface with loads of avatars
*  So fake accounts on multiple platforms from linkedin to twitter to facebook x who even have crypto accounts
*  And the whole point of these accounts is to create an illusion of real people who engage with other people online
*  You have a software like this
*  As a single operative and especially now with ai and chat gbt
*  You could basically have an army of people at your disposal who could do what you want
*  Whether it's just trying to change a narrative subtly or attack people, right?
*  And we know that israel has these capabilities because people who previously worked for their intelligence service are selling this product to foreign governments
*  So, you know, I have no doubt that this is being deployed now
*  I mean, why wouldn't it be, you know, it's being treated as israel's 911. Of course, it's going to be used
*  Mark that was a tour de force we covered so much and I think this is just an insight into the brilliant work that mark
*  Does on this issue. So do you follow him at?
*  mark with a c o n jones on uh twitter
*  And and do you read his work published on aljazeera and all sorts of different platforms?
*  But all the way through this has been for me crucial in terms of looking at the misinformation that has been spread
*  In this war and this is so important because it is about life or death. That's what misinformation in in in war
*  Boils down to so mark. Thank you so so much for your work. Please like and subscribe and share this video
*  But a huge huge thanks to mark and his amazing work
*  Thank you
