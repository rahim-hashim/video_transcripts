# Pro-Israel Extremist RACIST Attack Against Mehdi Hasan - Live On CNN
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCzt2bKAQWY)
*  Oh my goodness me, where to start?
*  Just a bit of context first actually.
*  Now racism and cheerleading for the state of Israel, let's put it this way, they often
*  go together.
*  It's important to say this because those who oppose the subjugation of the Palestinian
*  people, the generations of ethnic cleansing, occupation, apartheid, siege, colonisation,
*  land theft, mass incarceration, torture, repeated mass slaughter and indeed now genocide, we're
*  often defamed as racist.
*  This is an example of the world turned upside down by us being called racists, by actual
*  raging screaming racists.
*  An odd redefinition of racism to say the least.
*  So if you cheerlead for the subjugation of an entire people by a state whose politicians,
*  army officers and media outlets repeatedly make clear they regard that subjugated people
*  as inferior, indeed that's codified in law, not a racist.
*  If you believe in equal rights for all who live in historic Palestine, for example, you're
*  a racist.
*  At the same time of course, we've seen the rise of an authoritarian far right in the
*  western world, not least in the United States which has felt ever more involved in the facts
*  of racism, not least its anti-Muslim hate.
*  That brings me on to this latest example, CNN.
*  That's where this happened.
*  The target was Mehdi Hassan, a friend of mine, brilliant journalist, I proudly work with
*  him, of course it's Zetiyo.
*  He was on a show alongside someone called Ryan Goderski, someone I'm glad to say I
*  was not previously familiar with, I wish it had stayed that way.
*  He's part of the wave of right wing extremists who have been elevated by the rise of Donald
*  Trump and his far right movement.
*  Now this segment really does underline the depths to which we have plunged.
*  This is why yesterday's rally was disgusting.
*  Don't call us Nazis but I'm going to threaten the brown guys, the terrorists, and kill him.
*  Because I didn't ever say Donald Trump was Hitler.
*  But do you know who sat on a stage yesterday and said, I want to come to the Nazi rally,
*  I don't have to make up words and call you something.
*  You're saying it for yourself.
*  And what you just said, I apologize but I will tell you, I don't accept that apology
*  and you didn't even say it to me.
*  That was disgusting.
*  But I can be offended when you don't even say it to me.
*  I'm not Puerto Rican but I was offended by what he said yesterday.
*  And I'm offended that the former president and potentially future president would allow
*  it and go for 12 hours and not say I don't care.
*  Because you know what, when Kamala Harris put out statements about switching up opinions,
*  it wasn't good enough for Republicans.
*  Why are you looking at me?
*  Because you said it.
*  Why don't you take this back a little bit.
*  What to say.
*  Firstly, these people are not just odious and despicable, they're pathetic.
*  We need to say that.
*  This pond life extremist clearly had that one ready to go, didn't he?
*  That was probably the one line he practiced.
*  He clearly revved himself or probably practiced in front of a mirror, told his friends, knew
*  he had one mission above all else which was to go on that panel and shoehorn that racist
*  bile into the discussion.
*  He knew his target is of course a prominent Muslim commentator and he intentionally brought
*  up Israel's detonation of pages in Lebanon, described notably by a former CIA director
*  as an act of terrorism.
*  This killed large numbers including, I would note, children as well as mutilating many
*  others an overwhelming Lebanon's healthcare system.
*  A clearly racist attack here but look how pathetic he is.
*  Look how he flails around humiliated.
*  He thought he was such the big guy as he walked into the studio with that in his pocket didn't
*  he and then acts like a five year old who just wet himself in front of class.
*  Let's also hear this subsequently from the show's anchor, Abby Phillip.
*  When we get this discussion started you'll see that Ryan is not at the table.
*  There is a line that was crossed there and it's not acceptable to me.
*  It's not acceptable to us at this network.
*  We want discussion.
*  We want people who disagree with each other to talk to each other.
*  But when you cross the line of a complete lack of civility that is not going to happen
*  here on this show.
*  So he was ejected from the panel.
*  I think it was unfortunate it was framed there as simply a lack of civility.
*  That was racism.
*  CNN did subsequently issue a statement that there was zero room for racism obituary at
*  CNN and declared that they wouldn't allow guests to be demeaned for the line of civility
*  to be crossed and announced Ryan Goderski is banned from the network.
*  Now many have pointed out that this use of civility is problematic in other ways.
*  Cable news allows guests to support genocide.
*  That's treated as legitimate opinion that's within the boundaries of civility.
*  As for Ryan Goderski, well this embarrassing ODS performance continued on social media.
*  He tweeted out, you can stay on CNN if you falsely call every Republican a Nazi and have
*  taken money from Qatar funded media.
*  Apparently you can't go to CNN if you make a joke.
*  I'm glad America gets to see what CNN stands for.
*  Child obviously.
*  Well, as the brilliant British commentator Ash Sarko, also a friend of mine, keep name
*  dropping, responded, which part was the joke?
*  Insinuating a Muslim man is part of Hezbollah, panicking and apologizing immediately or trying
*  to present yourself as a victim of cancel culture now.
*  Well, it does really somewhat mentality these people, doesn't it?
*  One moment they're the aggressor, then they're the victim.
*  He can try acting the big guy when he's on camera as he desperately tries to portray
*  fantasizing about a brown Muslim man being killed or mutilated by an explosive device
*  as some sort of joke.
*  I mean, there's something rather menacing going on here that I would note and that is
*  the fantasies of the rising Western far right and Prairie's World cheerleaders, which clearly
*  overlap and intersect about the elimination of anyone who they think challenges them.
*  We can see that with Israel's mass slaughter of Palestinian journalists, the biggest massacre
*  of journalists ever recorded.
*  We can see in a systematic attempt to drive anyone who opposes this genocide out public
*  life, threatening, deplatforming, sacking, often by those who spearheaded the cry of
*  cancel culture.
*  These are people with authoritarian impulses and have darker fantasies, I would say, about
*  what should happen to their opponents.
*  We should take that seriously.
*  As we should take seriously the role of today's Israel in the ascendant far right movement
*  of the West.
*  I mean, that far right movement looks at what in practice is a Western state, one founded,
*  of course, in settler colonialism, as it expands at the expense of an indigenous population,
*  many of them Muslim, but certainly not exclusively, but they certainly zone in on that.
*  But it's this idea of the Western people who they treat as them and the battleground
*  is the front line, if you like, with them.
*  So Israel is us, and the Palestinians are them.
*  And they see that as a kind of template.
*  Not all, of course, of the Palestinian people are Muslim, but they do focus on that fact
*  because they see this as a model when it comes to minorities within the West and for the
*  relationship between the West and the global South.
*  And we can see that with far right movements in Europe, like in France, in Spain, we can
*  see it with Viktor Orbán's far right regime in Hungary, which is deeply anti-Semitic.
*  We can see it with the likes of Richard Spencer, a US neo-Nazi who's repeatedly used hate
*  speech against Jewish people who also calls himself a white Zionist, praising Israel's
*  Jewish nation state law, which cements supremacy for the Jewish population in Israel above
*  everyone else.
*  And we have to take that deadly seriously.
*  On that note, here is a request for your help and one of the most important projects we've
*  so far done on this channel.
*  Is the Democratic Party's complicity in genocide in Palestine going to sink it in these elections?
*  Is Donald Trump going to succeed in creating some sort of far right authoritarian regime?
*  Now, I'm off to the United States, imminently, to travel around the country and film videos
*  in different states, like Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Wisconsin, each day in the
*  run up to the election to talk to voters, to politicians, to important public figures.
*  Now this is very expensive, to say the least, the cost of hiring and paying local videographers
*  for so many videos, let alone any or the other costs, is a vast amount of money.
*  Now this channel obviously is only made possible by you at patreon.com forward slash ownjose84.
*  There's also the question of what happens after the election.
*  We don't know what turmoil could follow.
*  I'd like to be in a position to be able to directly report on it.
*  How much I can do that, how long I can stay for, to be frank, that depends on you.
*  I do think I'll be asking the sorts of questions so much of the mainstream media don't ask,
*  which I do feel is a big part of the reason why we're in this mess.
*  For some other context, we've been spent ages working on one of the most important
*  pieces of work that I've done, an investigative series to do with Israel and Palestine.
*  It's cost £20,000 to have it legaled.
*  I'll come back to that when it's published.
*  Obviously I'm desperate to do more work like that, but I can't unless it's afforded.
*  So if you want to support this work at patreon.com forward slash ownjose84 with whatever you
*  can afford, that's hugely appreciated.
*  No pressure.
*  I know things are very tough for so many who follow this channel and we will persevere.
*  Come what may.
