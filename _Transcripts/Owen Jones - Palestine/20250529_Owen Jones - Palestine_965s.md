# Israel's New ‘AID’ Plan Is A GENOCIDAL LIE
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o)
*  You don't need to be a prophet. Sometimes you can see an image and you can very quickly judge [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=0.0s)]
*  that this image will be remembered throughout the ages as hideous evidence of a heinous crime. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=5.36s)]
*  Like in the Vietnam War, the picture of a 9 year old girl running naked through the streets [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=11.76s)]
*  among other wailing children after her body was burned by a US napalm attack, or the Vietnam [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=16.16s)]
*  Cong captain being shot in the head by the South Vietnamese police chief, like in the Bosnian War [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=22.0s)]
*  starring emaciated Bosniaks behind barbed wire fences in a concentration camp. In Israel's genocide [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=28.72s)]
*  of the Palestinian people, there have been so many images. A genocide of course in which has [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=35.44s)]
*  been more documented and more confessed to than any other genocide in history as it happened. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=41.12s)]
*  But here is one image which will no doubt be remembered throughout the generations [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=47.36s)]
*  as helping to define an abominable crime. It shows starving Palestinians, who have been [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=51.28s)]
*  deliberately and systematically denied the essentials of life by Israel, penned into cages [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=57.04s)]
*  in order to get what little food is being provided. I'll explain what's going on here, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=63.36s)]
*  but there is no doubt that the Israeli state believes that this behaviour will humiliate [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=69.2s)]
*  and degrade Palestinians as a people, all part and parcel of the process of genocide. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=73.68s)]
*  But these images simply attach to Israel. People all over the world think Israel and they think [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=80.48s)]
*  starvation, they think slaughtering children and babies, they think apocalyptic mayhem, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=86.24s)]
*  they think blowing up hospitals, they think massacring medics, we could go on. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=90.56s)]
*  Now some context because this is so important in terms of understanding what Israel is currently [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=94.88s)]
*  doing as they claim to be offering food aid for Palestinians, defying claims that they are [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=100.16s)]
*  deliberately starving the Palestinian people. Now Israel instituted a total blockade on anything, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=105.52s)]
*  literally anything, entering Gaza on the 2nd of March this year, having destroyed Gaza's [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=111.12s)]
*  agriculture and food production. As part of its propaganda campaign, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=117.36s)]
*  Israel has justified its campaign of starvation by claiming that Hamas is stealing aid. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=121.68s)]
*  So let's listen to Cindy McCain, she's the widow of the late John McCain, the hawkish and staunchly [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=127.2s)]
*  pro-Israel Republican Senator. She's now the director of the World Food Programme and says [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=132.32s)]
*  any aid being allowed into Israel is a drop in the bucket compared to what's needed. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=136.4s)]
*  Let's listen to her responding to this claim about Hamas stealing aid. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=141.12s)]
*  It's very straightforward. If you starve an entire people and then allow in minimal aid, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=196.4s)]
*  you're going to get looting. And we should note that the Israeli army has systematically targeted [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=225.2s)]
*  Palestinian police officers in Gaza whose job it was to guard food trucks. They will have known, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=229.67999999999998s)]
*  they must have known, what the consequences of that would be. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=235.67999999999998s)]
*  Let's listen to this as well. It's David Satterfield. He's the US diplomat who served [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=239.67999999999998s)]
*  as a senior advisor on Iraq to George W Bush's Secretary of State, Cotelisa Rice. He was [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=245.12s)]
*  appointed as US ambassador to Turkey by Donald Trump and he was appointed by Joe Biden as the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=249.92s)]
*  special envoy for Middle East humanitarian issues after the 7th of October. This is on CNN. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=254.8s)]
*  Hamas was stealing, profiting and diverting the majority of the aid that was coming in. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=260.0s)]
*  That is Israel's claim. How do you respond to that? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=268.48s)]
*  No such allegation or evidence in support of allegations like that were ever provided [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=274.0s)]
*  privately by informed Israeli security or political officials. It is a claim which, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=282.0s)]
*  on the face of it, is not reflected in any of the experience that those involved in the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=290.0s)]
*  humanitarian effort have seen. Did Hamas benefit politically from its presence at distribution [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=296.48s)]
*  sites to reinforce to the population of Gaza that they remained effective and in place? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=302.8s)]
*  Certainly they did. Did Hamas take some assistance? Quite likely, but from the UN [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=308.96s)]
*  and INGO channels, which were highly accountable, whatever aid was ultimately diverted in any fashion [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=316.79999999999995s)]
*  by Hamas was minimal compared to the aid that was received by the general population. Now, the same [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=325.52s)]
*  can't be said about aid that came in outside the UN or international NGO channels. That's a [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=332.16s)]
*  different matter and Israel understands that. But we're speaking now of the UN. The allegations [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  that the majority, I've heard some claims, all of the assistance was seized by Hamas, that has never [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=344.8s)]
*  been made privately to officials involved in this process nor demonstrated through evidence. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=351.92s)]
*  Indeed, according to Israel's own army, not a single example of 110 aid looting incidents was [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=359.04s)]
*  perpetrated by Hamas. The whole claim by Israel of Hamas stealing aid used by Israel to justify [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=364.48s)]
*  mass starvation is simply a lie. Now, in February, a shadowy US-Israeli organisation called [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=371.04s)]
*  the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation was set up, supposedly in order to take charge of distributing [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=377.04s)]
*  aid. It bypassed all of the existing organisations charged with doing just that, who had experience [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=382.08000000000004s)]
*  of doing it at scale for many generations, not least the United Nations. The whole thing is [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=387.92s)]
*  completely opaque, not at all clear who's funding it. Chris Gunness, the former spokesperson for [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=393.2s)]
*  UNRWA, the UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees, said of it, there's only one word to describe this, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=398.08000000000004s)]
*  and this is aid washing. This is a cynical attempt by the State of Israel and its allies [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=403.52000000000004s)]
*  to use aid to hide the fact that what's actually going on is people are being starved into [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=408.56s)]
*  The UNA chief, Tom Fletcher, says that this Israeli plan makes starvation a bargaining chip. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=413.44s)]
*  It is a cynical side show, he says, a deliberate distraction, a fig leaf for further violence and [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=418.96000000000004s)]
*  displacement. Indeed, aid workers have condemned it as a mechanism for Israel to use food as a weapon, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=424.56s)]
*  to weaponise aid for the military and political objectives of Israel, violating the fundamental [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=430.32s)]
*  principles of humanitarianism, as well as they have also done, which is to emphasise that this [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=435.44s)]
*  cannot meet the needs of Gaza's population. This was the supposed plan. If you're a Palestinian [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=441.84s)]
*  who wants aid, then you need to go to one of four so-called secure distribution sites. Here's a [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=447.59999999999997s)]
*  really important point. None of these sites are in the north of Gaza. If you're in the north of Gaza, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=452.23999999999995s)]
*  then you have to flee to get aid in order to feed you and your family, and Israel is trying to force [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=456.56s)]
*  the entire Palestinian population out of the north into tiny confined areas so they can then [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=461.03999999999996s)]
*  be mass removed by Israel, mass removed of course from Gaza. This is just part of a strategy to [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=466.47999999999996s)]
*  destroy the Palestinian population of Gaza. Using aid to forcibly remove a population, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=472.0s)]
*  it must be noted, is a crime against humanity. Now, the executive director put in charge of this [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=477.67999999999995s)]
*  weird scheme, well, sinister scheme, was Jake Wood, a former US Marine. He's just resigned because he [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=484.56s)]
*  said the foundation cannot abide by the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=490.96s)]
*  impartiality and independence, which I will not abandon. It's in this context that Palestinians [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=496.23999999999995s)]
*  were hemmed into cages for the first delivery. As the brilliant Palestinian analyst Mohammed [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=500.88s)]
*  Shahada noted, what he described as an aid concentration camp in Ra'afah in the south [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=505.76s)]
*  was run by American mercenaries. He notes one spoke with an Iraqi accent, suggesting of course [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=510.32s)]
*  where he had previously served. Shahada also posted a video of a masked American [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=515.52s)]
*  mercenary clearly enjoying the sight of being in front of a camp of desperate hungry Palestinians. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=520.96s)]
*  What happened next? Starving Palestinians over around the checkpoint and took the supplies [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=526.4s)]
*  while being fired out by the Israeli military as the US mercenaries fled. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=545.4399999999999s)]
*  As anyone who knows anything about humanitarian aid could have predicted, this was a disaster on [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=556.4s)]
*  its own terms. As Jeremy Connydike, the president of refugees international said, I cannot stress [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=566.16s)]
*  enough that any humanitarian could tell you what will happen if you cut off a population for two [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=571.76s)]
*  months and then introduce a symbolic amount of aid at a single point distribution. You will be [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=577.1999999999999s)]
*  overrun by desperate people, it's just math. You may recall the founder of World Central Kitchen, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=582.24s)]
*  Chef Jose André, who is something of a dry end in US establishment circles, whose aid workers were [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=588.5600000000001s)]
*  massacred by the Israeli military last April. He said, the Gaza humanitarian foundation has [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=594.4s)]
*  left Palestinians without food. The people that created it are selfish. And now because people [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=599.52s)]
*  are really hungry, just stormed the distribution place, damaging the fence, it seems a helicopter [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=603.92s)]
*  began shooting. World Central Kitchen system of kitchens is the way Palestinians feeding [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=609.36s)]
*  Palestinians. World Central Kitchen themselves posted an update which stated, at this time, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=614.5600000000001s)]
*  World Central Kitchen cannot access Gaza with food. While the IDF has allowed some WCK trucks [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=620.24s)]
*  into the Kerem Shalom crossing, this aid is being held just inside the border. The IDF has not yet [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=625.36s)]
*  provided safe routes for bringing supplies to our kitchens. Now, James Connydike also made a [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=630.5600000000001s)]
*  very important point on this as well. He said the aid package is also really problematic. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=636.0s)]
*  This video shows the contents. Mostly dried and prepackaged food. Pasta, flour, dried beans, tins. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=640.24s)]
*  Why is that relevant? Because it still has to be prepared and the means of preparing it are still [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=647.6s)]
*  being blocked. So for example, as he notes, turning dry pasta or raw flour into edible food means [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=651.84s)]
*  clean water and fuel to cook, but these aren't in the boxes and they're blocked by Israel from [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=656.72s)]
*  entering Gaza. So you can see what's happening here. Israel is using this foundation as a ruse [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=661.6s)]
*  to justify blocking other actual useful aid which can actually be distributed at scale to further [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=665.76s)]
*  its genocidal ends while providing a tiny amount of food which in any case cannot be practically [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=672.0s)]
*  used because of the siege on Gaza. Has anyone ever just listened to what Israeli leaders and officials [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=676.24s)]
*  are saying? I mean, all the way through, just take them literally. You could work out what they're [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=680.4s)]
*  doing all the way through just by listening to what they're saying and yet over and over again [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=687.44s)]
*  Western media outlets just didn't publish these statements or just buried them. Didn't treat them [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=691.28s)]
*  as being significant. As for Western leaders, they just pretend they're in a parallel universe. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=695.4399999999999s)]
*  Now the Israeli finance minister Bezelor Smortzic declared that Israel will only let the bare minimum [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=699.4399999999999s)]
*  into Gaza so that the world doesn't stop Israel. That is stop Israel from its genocidal ambitions. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=704.16s)]
*  He just said it. He said it out loud. You don't have to read between the lines guys. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=709.52s)]
*  Now we should remember that last week David Lammy, the British foreign secretary, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=714.72s)]
*  shameless individual, he said that Britain was taking action against Israel because of its [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=718.8s)]
*  intolerable behaviour despite continuing to arm this genocide. You know, just sat through 19 [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=722.72s)]
*  months of depravity. Now it's intolerable. One of the tokenistic actions he took was to suspend [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=729.12s)]
*  negotiations over a trade deal with Israel. On Earth you may rationally ask, is Britain trying [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=733.76s)]
*  to strike a trade deal with this genocidal state in the first place? In any case, on Monday the [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=737.84s)]
*  UK embassy in Israel posted a tweet featuring Lord Ian Austin. He was the UK trade envoy to Israel [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=741.76s)]
*  and someone who spends a lot of time viciously attacking those who oppose Israeli genocide [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=746.88s)]

*  does is just expose the British government for empty and shameless posturing. Suspending negotiations [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=775.04s)]
*  over a trade deal was frankly risably tokenistic. Oh yeah, I bet they were really rattled in Tel [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=780.7199999999999s)]

*  the British media to scrutinise British involvement in genocide is one of the many ways in which it is [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=805.6s)]

*  Brian Eno, Irvin Welsh, the brilliant historian William Dalrymple, Hanif Qureshi for example. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=866.4799999999999s)]
*  There's some names who are instructive and they're instructive because they show how things are [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=871.52s)]
*  changing. Zadie Smith for example wrote an essay last year which criticised students protesting [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=875.6s)]
*  against Israel's genocide, claiming they were using rhetoric which acted as weapons of mass [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=880.88s)]
*  destruction. Well, she's now signed this letter. Inmokuin once condemned the late scientist Stephen [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=885.44s)]
*  Hawking for boycotting a conference in Israel as well as the boycott campaign more broadly. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=890.88s)]

*  say there's been a sudden shift going on more generally. A shift into recognising this crime [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=900.88s)]
*  for what it is, what it always was. The overwhelming evidence was there from the start, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=907.4399999999999s)]
*  but it is falling apart. We'll see what the significance of that is. I don't want to, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=913.36s)]
*  you know, overblow what in practice remains a Western facilitated genocide, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyc51YW1a9o&t=917.84s)]
