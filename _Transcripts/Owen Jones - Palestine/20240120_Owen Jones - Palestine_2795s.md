# Palestinian-American Scholar Destroys Lies About Israel And Palestine - w Noura Erakat
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgQDChu-jXo)
*  Hello, I've got a very special guest today. I'm very delighted to have the brilliant Nora Erekat,
*  who has many hats. Many of my guests have many hats, but here's one with loads of hats.
*  Activist, university professor, legal scholar, human rights attorney, associate professor at
*  Rutgers University specialising in international studies. One of the great voices that many of us
*  have been looking to, I would say, when this particular round of horror, of course, began,
*  though, and I should say, of course, relevant, that Nora is a Palestinian-American. And it is
*  so important, we've tried to do this on this channel, to elevate Palestinian voices right now,
*  those of Palestinian heritage who have been consciously removed from this so-called discussion.
*  Hi, Nora, by the way. Good to see you. Hi, Owen. Yeah, thank you for that. I think that's
*  absolutely right. You know, everything that's happening right now, especially in the way that
*  folks have understood this as part of a nekba, that genocide is a continuation of a Palestinian nekba,
*  that Zionism is a form of racism and a settler colonial project, is literally building on decades
*  of the Palestinian intellectual and political tradition. But traditions, as you say, that have
*  been consciously excised, not just by places of academic knowledge production and media and
*  government, but even in Israeli policy, which have deliberately targeted archives, right, in the
*  establishment of Israel in 1948. One of the targets was the collection of books, photographs,
*  archives that were all put into military archives that were off, you know, beyond the access of
*  Palestinian scholars. When they do become available, they become available only to Israeli
*  scholars who then become, you know, are the new historians. And now we have to look to the new
*  historians as opposed to looking to the Palestinians who are producing that knowledge. We see that
*  again. In this instance, Israel just bombed a university. It has bombed archives in the Gaza
*  Strip. It bombed the Jalap Tower in 2021. All of this forms part of what people have described as
*  a pastemicide, right? But I think more generally is part of a move to erase a people. Because what is
*  a people without a history, right? They become a motley crew of individuals. But when we have a
*  history, and that is a history that we well documented, that is what we're putting forward.
*  So yes, all of that to say is it does matter that Palestinians are speaking, speaking for themselves,
*  and that when other people speak, they are also building on Palestinian traditions that don't
*  intend to speak on their behalf, but intend to speak with them to remember this isn't just an
*  interesting topic. This is a liberation struggle. And so there's something at stake here for the
*  future. And that's such a powerful point. This isn't something people should dip in and out as a
*  here's an interesting world event. This is about the struggle of the people who've suffered
*  with the direct complicity of Western governments. I was going to come back, actually,
*  I'll ask you that point about the the the university would just be blown up or come on to that.
*  But that point, in terms of complicity, Joe Biden, and the President, obviously the United States,
*  I would say there's not been much subtlety in erasing again, Palestinians, that's what we're
*  talking about there from the so called discussion. Nonetheless, I saw someone describe his statement
*  on 100 days since this current horror began, as they said, someone described it as one of those
*  outrageous statements issued by a president in in history. Because what it did, and no one can
*  begrudge him speaking about hostages and including American hostages, it didn't mention Palestinians
*  once, nothing about the death, the killing, nothing, not not one mention of Palestinians.
*  How do you feel about that? What does that say?
*  One, I have to say, let me just start by saying that as someone who, you know, follows politics,
*  I am shocked. I am shocked that this sitting president who very well knows that his standing
*  has dropped, that his base, his constituent base, the Democrats, who 60% of whom are demanding a
*  ceasefire, which the Democratic establishment is completely ignoring, who have told him that his
*  2024 election prospects are already dismal, that even in his self-interested pursuit went on to
*  put out a statement that is an abject disregard of that constituent voter base and of the Americans
*  of Palestinian heritage, of Arab heritage, of Muslim piety who happen, you know, to understand
*  this very intimately, and it was a disregard to them. So even before I get into the question of
*  humanity and Zionism and the dehumanization of Palestinians, just thinking about, even if you
*  don't care and you're just looking at this, just think about like as an analyst, who is advising
*  this man? Is this, this is like literally self-sabotage or he is such a committed Zionist,
*  he's ready to die on this, on this hill. He is such a committed Zionist, he could care less about
*  his political prospects, about the United States, about, you know, Pax Americana, whatever it may be.
*  As a Palestinian looking at that, I understand full well that this is not just a continuing Israeli
*  genocide of Palestinians, but that this is a U.S. war. This is a U.S. war against Palestinians.
*  This refusal to acknowledge humans, 10,000 children, 1% of the entire population of Palestinian
*  children, 40% of all those who have died, 1,000 of them have had one or more limbs amputated at a
*  rate of 10 per day, who do not merit empathy, basic empathy. And it really, really sets the tone
*  that our struggle is one that is deeply entrenched and is absolutely dehumanizing,
*  where not only is there no quarter, literally for Palestinians seeking shelter from Israeli bombing,
*  but there is literally no shelter for us globally, and especially now in the United States in the
*  eyes of this administration. I'm going to stop by what you said there, in terms of being a kind of
*  an American attack, because I interviewed actually another lawyer of Palestinian heritage, Diana
*  Bita, who's a Palestinian Canadian. And she called it- The Junior Settler Colony.
*  Sorry, say that again. The Junior Settler Colony.
*  Yes, indeed. Yes, exactly. But she said it was an Israeli American attack on Gaza.
*  100%. This would not be possible without the provision of, obviously, US intelligence,
*  military weapons, without the provision of billions of dollars and the provision of immunity
*  within all of these multilateral organs that have some capacity to force Israel to cease its
*  hostilities. This could not be possible. The fact that the US deployed its aircraft to aircraft
*  carriers within the first week after October 7th signaled to the rest of the region that do not
*  become involved because we will strike back. And that's precisely what we're seeing. So we're
*  seeing this on multiple levels. Even earlier this week when Israel was bombing the last hospital,
*  the Nasr hospital in Chaym Yunus, the last fully functioning hospital which was already at capacity,
*  Senator Bernie Sanders, who refuses to call for a ceasefire, was at least trying to mobilize US law.
*  And there's a tremendous amount of US law, right? The Arms Export Control Act, the Leahy Amendment,
*  multiple MOUs that would condition the provision of US military support on the compliance of its
*  recipient with human rights norms. The Senate, by a vote of I think 72 to 11, right, refused
*  to comply with US law on this question, demonstrating the commitment that it has to this war irrespective
*  of any kind of norms. I mean, I would call it a democratic crisis, a crisis of democracy,
*  but then I would have to somehow admit that this is a democracy when that is not true.
*  When there's no respect for a voter base, this idea that do what the majority wants, the majority
*  is clear on this, and there's no respect for a voter base, there's no respect for US law irrespective
*  of the way that they trash international law or in the words of former Justice Antonin Scalia,
*  it's not international law, it's foreign law for everyone else. The US in its role as empire wants
*  to situate itself as a global police force and therefore not subject to these norms and these
*  laws. And this is crystallized very, very much during the Bush administration and in the advent
*  of the global war on terror, where it didn't want to adhere, for example, to the third Geneva
*  Convention on the treatment of prisoners of war. It didn't want to adhere to Yaskozi's norms on
*  the prohibition of torture and so on and so forth. And yet the US in its claim to want to be policemen
*  forgets that it, more than any other country, needs to be policed not only for the harm that
*  it does abroad, but even to its own quote, so-called citizens. We see this most vividly
*  in the moment of Black uprising that's basically demanding accountability for the way that the
*  state, state agents of the state, law enforcement, as well as institutions are all part of
*  maintaining the supremacy of a white racial class as well as maintaining a settler colonial project
*  again, across Indigenous lands. Point, maybe we'll get to this later, but case in point,
*  the US has never even acknowledged the genocide of Native Americans. It attributes this annihilation
*  of a people, multiple peoples, multiple nations, to disease and warfare, which is a lesson for us
*  to think about genocide as well in this moment. Well, not because I'm going to ask you in the
*  context of the ICJ and something that just that historical context I think is just so important.
*  I mean, it's about dehumanization. I was speaking actually earlier to Tal Mitnick,
*  who's an 18-year-old Israeli who went to prison for refusing to serve. Yes. And he said to me
*  that the moderate view, so basically he was in a military prison with soldiers who basically,
*  they weren't conscious objectors, as you will find out, they were deserters and people like that.
*  But he said the moderate view amongst those soldiers was to extort, to kill all Arabs.
*  That's what he said. And I just, in terms of that broader, because that, you know,
*  there's an attempt to make everything begin on the 7th of October, but there's a broader history
*  there, isn't there? That's the continued, the dehumanization of Palestinians, which now has a
*  overtly genocidal, not subtle manifestation in terms of rhetoric and practice. But in terms of,
*  what do you think that context which people don't discuss of how Palestinians were dehumanized in
*  the very beginning? Well, it depends on who we're saying is not discussing it. So like as we said
*  earlier in the Palestinian intellectual and political tradition, it's been a central point
*  of the discussion. In fact, genocide is not possible if not predicated on the thorough
*  dehumanization of people. There wasn't just a revolutionary change after October 7th,
*  where really peace loving Israelis suddenly started to hate Palestinians and thought that all of them
*  were human animals and deserved to die, right? That is deeply ingrained, deeply ingrained in a
*  society that literally has equated Nakba, or the Palestinian catastrophe, to peace, right? It's a
*  framework that has basically created not only an exception, but a framework that has predicated
*  peace and the existence of a Zionist settler sovereign on the continual removal, dispossession
*  and concentration of Palestinians, right? And so here I think it's important to point out, Owen,
*  one of the controversies that I've encountered and been engaging with, even in the human rights
*  community, comes around the time that the human rights community finally catches up to this
*  Palestinian intellectual political tradition in 2020, when they recognize Israel as overseeing
*  an apartheid regime. One of the things that fell out of the bottom of this finding was that it's
*  an apartheid regime based on racism. If you read these reports closely, they basically adhere to
*  a very strict reading of the apartheid convention of 1973, which only finds that you have to find an
*  intent to persecute or to dominate, right? But not dominate based on racism, just to dominate. And so
*  what these organizations did is they dropped a racial analysis out of, from the bottom.
*  B'tselem goes so far as to say in South Africa there was racism based on race and color. In Israel,
*  it's not racism, it's based on nationality and religion, in which completely flies in the face
*  of the definition of racial discrimination in the convention for elimination of all forms of racial
*  discrimination, which defines racial discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, nationality,
*  and ethnicity. So this legal institution created its own framework. And the reason they all do it, Owen,
*  is to not have to grapple with Zionism as a racist ideology. And yet, you know, somehow imagining
*  that Israel just becomes a Frankenstein and just becomes an apartheid regime because it failed to
*  establish Palestinian sovereignty in the form of a truncated state, but takes for granted that it
*  has been a Zionist ideology that has predicated the establishment of a settler sovereign literally
*  on, you know, genocidal expansion and territorial consolidation. It is the engine by which we get to
*  this point. So why does that matter? Because they're basically recommending some sort of
*  juridical reform. We just make this state more equal, you know, one person, one vote, and somehow
*  now racism is solved, apartheid is gone. But what they're not dealing with is that a racist ideology
*  that continues to shape state and society across the board. And that's what we have to deal with
*  and why so many of us have insisted that there is no solution that doesn't grapple with settler
*  decolonization in order to address these issues. Well, I'm going to ask you, because certainly
*  in terms of what happens next, which is obviously crucial, this is what you talk about there.
*  At that point, I just, in terms of, because you're a legal brain, to talk to you about the ICJ,
*  the International Court of Justice application, I spoke to a really fast, brilliant, interesting
*  academic who is from the post-colonial tradition, basically. And he talks about this idea of,
*  you can't, the term they often use is you can't take down the master's house with the master's
*  tools. And it's just something that just really struck me what you just said, which he emphasized
*  that genocide is not a rare event in history. It's actually extremely common. It's actually how many
*  states are forged. How the West is forged, yeah. Exactly. So you can't disentangle therefore the
*  structures of international law from the practice of genocide when it's taught to people as though
*  it's an aberration, but it isn't an aberration. It's actually a-
*  Not even a little bit. It's so constitutive. So I want to just to honor, because we might see
*  from the same tradition, who is this academic that you spoke to? Do you remember?
*  He's a brilliant guy called Dr. Alonso Gomendi. He's a Peruvian-British academic.
*  I don't know him, but I am part of a tradition of critical scholars known as the Third World
*  Approach to International Law, TWIL. We are TWILers who, in that intellectual tradition,
*  seek to basically illuminate the oppressive force of international law. And specifically,
*  insist that international law expand, develop in, on behalf of the expansion of empire,
*  which first expands in the name of Christian dominion, and as such created a global racial
*  hierarchy that when international law becomes more formally enshrined, it becomes enshrined
*  in a way that preserves European and white supremacy as such. So you can see, and there are
*  many, many different scholars study this, and they look at different bodies of law, whether it be
*  Michael Tachri, who's looking at contemporary trade, and how sugar plantations and slave economies
*  actually contributed to that development. And so, I think that's a great example of how
*  that's contributed to that development. Or you think about John Reynolds, a co-author of mine,
*  who looks at emergency regimes of basically a derivative of colonial rule, which suspended
*  all forms of civilian law in order to maintain colonial order that's now enshrined, as an
*  exception in international human rights law, no less on behalf of states. My own work does that as
*  well, as I think about a Palestinian struggle for freedom as refracted through the relationship
*  between law and power, where I, you know, in my narration, I basically narrate that between 1917
*  and 2017, international law has done a lot more to serve Israel's interests than it has been to
*  serve Palestinians. I nonetheless conclude that we can use it strategically, which is why in this
*  moment, you know, you often find me, you know, described as a human rights attorney on the one
*  hand, and on the other hand, producing scholarship that's tearing apart all of these legal regimes
*  for being forms of colonial oppression and embodiments of it. We see that very blatantly,
*  for example, in the way that right now the International Criminal Court Office of the
*  Prosecutor has failed, abjectly failed his mandate, Kareem Khan, in this particular moment. Now,
*  we can say that Kareem Khan is just a bloke, as you all might say, I don't, you know, he's
*  out in the States, and is just a bad guy, and we should, you know, replace him. But let's be clear,
*  even if Kareem Khan has gone, the structure of international criminal law is enshrined in
*  the Rome Statute in particular, right, is a structure of white supremacy that enshrines it,
*  that protects the former colonial powers from ever being prosecuted for their crimes of genocide,
*  of colonialism, right, and racializes black and brown peoples very explicitly. And we see that
*  even in the jurisprudence of the ICC since 2002, it's only taken on Arab and African heads of
*  state with the exception of Slobodan Milosevic, right, and now obviously the arrest warrant of
*  warring for Putin, which I think we can explain as well. So all of this, so what does that mean? So
*  you cited Audre Lorde, we do not use the black feminist theorists, we do not use the master's
*  tools in order to dismantle the master's house. And so, you know, this is really complicated. How
*  do we as advocates, knowing full well that we live imbricated in the house that the master built,
*  how do we dismantle it? Well, there's, I don't think that there's only one way or the other.
*  Disruption is absolutely central. Mass mobilization is absolutely central. To the extent that we use
*  the law, we have to use it without any fidelity to the law, but in a way where we use it, you know,
*  as I describe in my book, you know, think of it like the sail of a boat. You raise the sail
*  when the winds are blowing in our favor, you draw the sail when they're blowing against us,
*  and you create a new sail when necessary. And in this moment, I just want to really lift up global
*  mass movement that but for the millions of people out in the streets, even South Africa probably
*  would not have brought this case before the ICJ. It is precisely because of the people. So even
*  though when we get to the stage and you say, I want to pick your brain as a legal mind,
*  right, and this becomes a specialized discussion that only lawyers can have, I like to push back
*  and say, absolutely not. Absolutely not. Because what we end up doing then is disempowering the very
*  people and the very vehicle that made visible that this was an instance of genocide. It wasn't lawyers.
*  That brought the charge. It was millions of people who brought the charge that created the
*  political environment that now made it possible to bring this case into articulated in the way
*  that it's been articulated. So I mean, what do you think we don't know, obviously, in terms of what
*  provisional measures, if any, will be issued the case in the ICJ in terms of, as people may or may
*  not know, takes itself years to establish in terms of the actual specific claims merits, but you can
*  have provisional measures in the meantime within weeks. I mean, do you think looking at the ICJ,
*  that has become a terrain of struggle, which people should have some optimism about because
*  of the political context that's been created through struggle, rather than just saying being
*  defeatist and going, well, international law is rigged intentionally to ensure that you don't get
*  justice for an oppressed nation like Palestine? Okay. So it's an and also, right? It's an and also
*  construction. We have to believe that international law is rigged because it is. It is rigged and it's
*  constructed in order to maintain the dominance of the former colonial powers. And at the same time,
*  we can't in the face of that construction, then signal defeat and surrender. To the contrary,
*  we have to be strategic, use the law when it's necessary and helpful. Let me give you an example.
*  I have a lot to say about the ICC and the Rome Statute, but I was part of one of the teams that
*  submitted a petition to the ICC charging Netanyahu, Galean and Galan with genocide.
*  I would have been the first one to say, and I did say in 2014, that any ICC investigation,
*  one would be depoliticized, drop the context out of the bottom and prosecute Hamas first.
*  We're seeing that happen, right? But I don't regret bringing that petition because as a result,
*  we were able to start scaffolding a legal argument that then created the controversy to have this
*  conversation on media and to democratize a conversation where everybody now can probably
*  cite and rattle off the 1948 Genocide Convention and the critique, right? And the critique that
*  genocide was practiced as a tradition of Western development long before it was proscribed
*  in the 1948 Convention once it was practiced within Europe's shores, right? And so similarly,
*  in this moment, I'm very well aware, ICG jurisprudence on the merits is a really,
*  really high threshold of when there's genocide. It's quite unfortunate. It should be more expansive,
*  right? It should be more expansive. But the threshold makes it as such in some of the
*  jurisprudence that if a belligerent state can demonstrate that there are any other reasons
*  for this type of, you know, a trot of warfare, then that, you know, that that makes dispositive
*  the claim of genocidal intent. Now, one, I'm not sure that Israel will be able to meet that
*  threshold. We shouldn't be defiant on that level either. But assuming that that is a high risk,
*  right? This moment of bringing the case on provisional measures is still absolutely necessary
*  because the standard is lower. It's only plausibility. It's not as high. Number two,
*  that enables us to build, you know, more political will in order to isolate Israel in the United
*  States who are bringing this warfare. Number three, it empowers the base to continue advocating and
*  agitating for ceasefire. And it gives a greater basis for national governments, right? There's
*  at least eight heads of state, heads of state and 11 foreign ministries that have described what
*  Israel is doing as genocide. And it gives those states also a greater platform. Number one,
*  to bring cases of universal jurisdictions within their national court. But also number two,
*  to engage in advocacy amongst other states that they too must, you know, cease and desist from
*  providing Israel with military and economic aid because then they are complicit in genocide as
*  well. And this, Owen, all before we reach the merit stage. So this is what I mean about thinking
*  about this strategically. We, you know, I think just take for granted that this law is not for us.
*  And at the same time, mobilize it in our service, which I think we're doing really well right now.
*  And I also think that we shouldn't take for granted that we, law is not, law is not a holy text,
*  right? You know, I think some people might be, you know, the Quran, you can never amend,
*  that is a holy text, right? Law is not like that. You can amend it at any time. So the fact that you
*  can create new law and has been proposed, for example, by legal scholar and advocate,
*  Reveal Rabaria, whose article the Harvard Law Review refused to publish, but then the Nation
*  published, who has said that one of the reasons that this might be too difficult for people to
*  recognize either apartheid in Palestine or genocide in this moment is because we have to advance our
*  own language, which means, you know, mobilizing to then make nekba, legible within international
*  law. And that is not a fanciful, you know, desire. That's actually a very practical measure
*  that we can take in order to advance, in order to advance our cause. So again,
*  take international law with a grain of salt and that it is a site of oppression.
*  Use it strategically when it's going to serve our purposes, right? Think of it like in guerrilla
*  combat, make your adversaries strengths into weaknesses, turn your weaknesses into strengths.
*  And then thirdly, don't take for granted that we can change the law and create new law when necessary.
*  I mean, now is the time to do it, especially when we see this pitched battle between the
*  global north and the global south. Wow, that was a real tour de force that and so, so important.
*  That was genuinely extremely, I mean, it's just the way you elucidated that. I think people find
*  that absolutely fascinating and very, I find that just incredibly thought provoking, to be honest.
*  I know we're doing a little whistle stop tour here of big subjects. You're a busy person,
*  very in demand, which is great, obviously, but Zionism, we talked about Zionism there a bit in
*  the beginning. Now it's so important we hear that from the Palestinian perspective, we talk about
*  Zionism, because a lot of people feel uncomfortable talking about it. People will say, well, look,
*  the Zionists and the Zionists, the Zionists who believe in a greater Israel and overtly like Ben
*  Gavir, people like that, purge all the Palestinians. But then there's Zionists who would say they have
*  support of a two state solution. And, you know, is there for that a useful catchall term, lots of
*  Jewish people would say they're Zionists, but there's a range of opinions. So what do we mean
*  when we talk about Zionism? And how do we kind of, you know, because there is obviously there are a
*  people using anti semitism to shut down any sympathy at all with the Palestinian people.
*  And there was also real anti semitism as well, where we have to demarcate. So how do we have
*  these conversations? So you brought up several things, right? So let's just start by getting
*  rid of the most obvious argument, which is the weaponization of, you know, and you know, the
*  conflation of anti Zionism and anti semitism. This is the most disingenuous, the most disingenuous
*  argument that has basically made my existence as a Palestinian. When I say that proudly,
*  if we take it to its logical end, I am I have an embodiment of anti semitism for daring to exist.
*  Well, just get rid of that. Right. And also not take for granted that so many of those
*  were advancing this argument are actually white nationalists and white supremacists who I think,
*  right, are mobilizing this argument in order to advance white supremacy, but doing it in a way
*  that it's ensconced and protected by an argument against anti semitism. Right. Because you can't
*  very proudly say that you're a white supremacist, but you can say like Richard Spencer, that, you
*  know, this white supremacists just want to advance European sovereignty in the image of the way that
*  Zionists have advanced, you know, Zionist sovereignty. Right. And so here you have
*  very, you know, self avowed anti Zionists in the classical, you know, in classical tropes,
*  who are basically defending Israel, but harming Jewish people. Right. And so one, just to take
*  that with a grain of salt, I don't even, there's not much to do there. Right. There's really not
*  much to do there. And it's really unfortunate anti-Semitism proceeds even a Zionist political
*  movement. So what are we talking about? And for Zionists to then insist that all Jews are somehow
*  represented by the state of Israel, even though, and here's why, here's where we get into, you know,
*  the theorization of Zionism. Zionism proposed to respond to, you know, European enlightenment forms
*  of anti-Semitism that excluded Jews from European citizenship and made them eligible for it only if
*  they, you know, assimilated into, you know, the enlightened European man, right in their image,
*  meaning they discard any external markers of their piety and certain, you know, and agree to
*  fully assimilate, right, that they can then be accepted within Europe. And so Zionism responds
*  to that by internalizing anti-Semitism. And in fact, it's, you know, it's born in the same,
*  you know, crucible, you know, in that same, you know, political intellectual milieu in order to
*  say that in order for Jews to be equal and earn acceptance within Europe, they have to create a
*  state outside of its shores. And I recommend very highly an article by Shirin Say Ali and Max Ayl,
*  who look at Derrida in order, you know, to articulate this very well. Now, once they,
*  when they do that, they also reconstruct the new Jew within Israel as being a European Jew, so that
*  now there's this homogenized history of a rich global Jewish, you know, tradition that suddenly
*  becomes, in the words of Elisha Haat, a history of Holocaust and Shtetl, right? We don't even,
*  you drop, and even to become, to be eligible to become a new Jew within Israel and really to
*  become white, right? You have to bifurcate for those Middle Eastern Jews your Arab and Jewish
*  identity. You have to not speak Arabic. You have to not identify with your culture and your other
*  traditions. This is a very, you know, this is an aspiration to whiteness, as I lay out in my article
*  on whiteness as property in Israel based on Cheryl Harris's seminal work. Okay, so I think I got lost
*  in walking you through thinking about Zionism and that racial issue, but here what Zionists have done
*  is they basically constructed Judaism no longer merely as a religion where people have an affinity
*  with one another, but instead as a juridical category and a nationality that's extraterritorially
*  applied, and so unlike other forms of, you know, using whiteness or citizenship through bloodline,
*  you don't have to demonstrate familial relationship or relationship to the land. You just have to
*  demonstrate a Jewish identity, which is precisely why we're saying that this is a racist category,
*  right? That somebody born today or tomorrow or yesterday who identifies as Jewish has more right
*  to land, employment, education, right, housing, right, within historic Palestine than a Palestinian
*  family that preceded the existence of the state of Israel in 1948, because what happens in 1950 and
*  1952 through the legislation of law is the bifurcation of Israeli citizenship and Jewish
*  nationality, so that there are two categories always happening. One is being an Israeli citizen
*  who's also a Jewish national, and the other one is being an Israeli citizen only. These are the
*  Palestinian, the 20% of the Israeli population who are Palestinians who did not leave, right? And so
*  anyways, this is basically the construction and the legal argumentation about apartheid.
*  That's that, you know, on the question of the first question of what we can establish, and I
*  think it also goes to the heart of the second piece. Liberal Zionists who care about Palestinians,
*  who do believe that they have human rights, but who condition the approximation of those rights,
*  who condition that recognition on humanity as secondary to the protection of Israel
*  as a Zionist settler sovereign with a definitive Jewish demographic majority.
*  So even those liberal Zionists who have some empathy for Palestinians, for example,
*  will forgo that empathy if Israel as a Jewish-only state is threatened.
*  And so I don't think that we can mince words here. I think that we have to be very straightforward
*  that liberal Zionists are not leading us to a better future. They want to enshrine, they want
*  to make an exception, right? They want to say this is bad and the Necabal was bad and it's
*  unfortunately unfortunate that we've excluded Palestinian refugees, but it's okay because it's
*  serving a broader good. But you didn't ask the very people who are paying the highest price for
*  the exception you're demanding. And unless Palestinians are saying that that's fine with
*  them, I don't think that that's okay and Palestinians have not said that.
*  Just finally then, I mean, I suppose as well, that final question, it almost becomes a bit
*  of an abstraction because so-called liberal Zionism has pretty much died a death in modern Israel in
*  any case. But in terms of where things go next, I interviewed the Israeli journalist Gideon Levy,
*  a very courageous journalist. And the reason he's so courageous is because he's so isolated
*  within Israel. And I keep interviewing these brilliant Israeli peace activists who are very
*  courageous and they're very isolated. The point he makes is forget change happening within Israeli
*  society. It isn't going to happen. And his view is that the only possible way things would change
*  would be given the patronage of the United States, which Israel completely depends on
*  militarily, political support, diplomatic support aid, all the rest of it, that when the US shifts,
*  then things will change. And then we could point to the fact because of struggles,
*  if you look at younger Americans, the polling suggests they're the most pro-Palestinian ever,
*  that when they come of age politically, and they've become a lot more very politicized over
*  Palestine, I would say, that's when things will change. And I'm just wondering, where do you see
*  the end game for all of this? How does, we're looking at genocide in Gaza, we're looking at
*  apartheid, we're looking at the set of colonialism, that project, as things stand, we can see all the
*  horrors, it's not, there's no foreseeable end to any of that. Is that how it ends you think?
*  Yeah, this is probably the part where I'm going to be the least uplifting and say a few things.
*  Number one, 100%. There has been a dramatic revolutionary generational shift amongst Americans,
*  and especially young Americans and racialized communities who very clearly see, who are part
*  of movements for gender justice, racial justice, climate change, gun reform, who see how badly
*  the adults have failed them, and the future that they're leaving behind for them, right?
*  And this grouping, I think, even has a critique of Zionism, even at such a young,
*  formative age, a critique of Zionism, or at least of Israel, that helps them understand
*  that it is as dangerous to them and their future as is white supremacy and capitalism.
*  And so 100%, I see this generational shift, and I have a lot of hope that, you know,
*  everything is generational, everything is generational. Think about gender justice,
*  think about same-sex marriages, think about even abolition of slavery, and Jim Crow and the rest of
*  it. These things happen generationally, so that just, that feels on track, right? Here's where I'm
*  less optimistic, it's two-fold. Number one, the U.S. can drop out as Israel's primary patron,
*  as I think it will, but that won't preclude Israel from finding another primary imperial patron.
*  And so the U.S. is now a central part of the problem, but, and if it stopped now, obviously
*  we can stop the genocide now, but I don't think that that will necessarily yield the outcome
*  immediately that we want because of other options. I mean, think about it,
*  primary patrons before the U.S. were Britain and to some extent France. Before it was the United
*  States following the 1967 war. Who knows what the future horizon Israel's already trying to permeate
*  China and Chinese government in order to establish those ties there, seeing the writing on the wall.
*  So that's number two, Israelis, Israelis who honestly, I in this moment, I'm mortified
*  by Israeli society, not just its military and political elite, like it's society, which were
*  out, you know, I remember even during their uprisings against the Supreme Court
*  reform, right, were being sprayed by water cannons and beaten up by police. And there was a father
*  who said, my son is fighting, you know, to protect, you know, and Hawada, Hawada, which, you know,
*  they wanted to wipe off the mat and subject to settler programs. My son is out there in Hawada
*  and look how the government is treating me. Right? I mean, we got glimpses of just how problematic
*  Israeli society is and wanting to establish some reform to save a democracy that's that excludes,
*  you know, half of the people over which Israel governs. Right? That literally just excludes them.
*  In this moment, it's even worse. Even worse. School children are bullying principals who express
*  empathy for Palestinian life. School children are not learning empathy, are on television
*  singing ballads about decimating and flattening. Right? What do you do with this? What do we do
*  with a society that frankly is lifting up and normalizing fascism? And that is echoed also by
*  Netanyahu who says he doesn't care what the Hague says and he doesn't care what the US says
*  because the US is advocating for a certain future. Right? And so this is also what we have to think
*  of. That this, you know, Israeli society may very well, even in the scenario that it becomes
*  completely isolated globally as it should, as any pariah apartheid state should. Right? And we would
*  still have to contend with the reality of what will lead to a transformation within Israeli
*  society. External pressure is necessary and it's our duty for those who have access to levers
*  of that pressure. But that doesn't mean that that leaves Israeli society and government as a site
*  of target. And that responsibility belongs to the Israelis. Right? Belongs to whatever is left
*  of the Israeli left. What does that transformation look like? And so this is where we are.
*  And I think, you know, unfortunately I think that the targets of that desperation
*  and that violence will continue to be Palestinians, you know, will be our kin and our friends.
*  And that's horrifying and precisely why we're fighting so hard. But it shouldn't just be left
*  to us. And it shouldn't just be left to a juridical question or an equation. And it shouldn't just be
*  left to a discussion on like these IR meta discussions of what do states do and how, you
*  know, are they funded. There has to be some soul searching here. Right? There has to be some full
*  frontal confrontation with an insistence on, you know, the Zionist insistence on Jewish supremacy
*  and exceptionalism. Wow. Extremely powerful stuff. I mean, just in terms of what you referred to,
*  just so people know, I interviewed, as I said, this 18-year-old called Hal Mitnick earlier and
*  actually included the video of a principal, a teacher being bullied by young students after
*  they shared a Haaretz article, the Israeli relatively progressive newspaper, which had a
*  kind of platitudinous call for peace of Palestinians to be humanized and basically nearly got lynched
*  by the students. And the point Hal made to me was unlike American or British younger people,
*  the youngest generation in Israel are significantly more reactionary. And he said, actually, he used
*  the word fascistic compared to- Go in, go in. Israel is exceptional where its youth
*  are more conservative than their adults. Yeah. That's not how, you know, normally the young
*  are more radical than the, you know, the elders and not in Israel. And that is really here,
*  you know, what we should be concerned with and talking about. To what end? To what end? Can you
*  imagine if every country based on, you know, sovereignty and what they decide sovereignty
*  looks like modeled Israel, where they said, you know, think about it, think about, you know,
*  Modi's India or think about, you know, white nationalists when they say that this is their
*  right for them to, this is in the name of their sovereignty. The first people to suffer from this
*  equation would be Jews who are minorities. You know, why would they want that future? They would
*  reject it outright, be it in the United States, in Canada, in France, in Britain. And so why would
*  they want to create this model in Israel as if this form of exception is contained? Exceptions
*  are not contained. Exceptions are replicated and become the norm. And so we should reject them.
*  Candid, brutal and the truth. And that's often reflects, I think, the conversations that I've
*  been having on this channel over the last few weeks. We're not here to cheer people up. We're
*  here to tell people the truth. And reality is how things stand, a brutal one, but we need
*  desperately voices like Nora. For those who haven't caught up with Nora, I think you can see why I was
*  so desperate for her to speak to us. And you can see that was a real tour de force throughout. So
*  do share this video, obviously, subscribe, get the word out, like press like obviously, but Nora,
*  that was absolutely fantastic. Thank you so much. Thank you, Owen and thank you how you, you know,
*  you continue to disturb people and run amok. It has been wonderful. And even from across the pond,
*  a source of strength and inspiration. Well, I never I keep saying I never forgive myself
*  for doing anything else. What's the point of me having my platform? I've always disturbed
*  people throughout my life. So at least there's that one consistency. But thank you and lots of love.
*  All right, thank you.
