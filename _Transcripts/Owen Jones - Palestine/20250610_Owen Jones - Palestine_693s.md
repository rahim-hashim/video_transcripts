# Israel Allies With ISIS - To STARVE Gaza to Death
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM)
*  Israel is allying with ISIS affiliated militia in Gaza. This is something I discussed last November [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=0.0s)]
*  on this channel, some of you may remember, I was smeared over it, we'll come on to that. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=6.96s)]
*  But this has now erupted as a scandal in Israel and it further links Israel to the looting of aid, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=10.48s)]
*  which Israel has blamed on Hamas rather than its own criminal allies as part of a deliberate [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=16.96s)]
*  campaign of course of starvation. Avigdor Lieberman is a right-wing Israeli politician who [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  previously served under Benjamin Netanyahu as his deputy prime minister, his foreign minister and [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=28.08s)]
*  his defence minister. On Wednesday evening, Lieberman declared that the prime minister, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=33.44s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, had transferred weapons to ISIS-linked clans in Gaza. Lieberman, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=38.4s)]
*  who heads a far-right party, what, another far-right party in Israel? I'm shocked, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=44.48s)]
*  I hear you cry. Anyway, he told Israeli radio the following, the Israeli government is giving weapons [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=47.92s)]
*  to a group of criminals and felons. Identified with Islamic State and the direction of the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=53.28s)]
*  prime minister, to my knowledge, this did not go to approval by the cabinet. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=57.92s)]
*  Here's the thing, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, who's subject to an arrest warrant [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=62.64s)]
*  by the International Criminal Court, didn't deny it. He responded, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=66.8s)]
*  Israel is working to defeat Hamas in various ways on the recommendation of all heads of the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=70.4s)]
*  security establishment. He did a video message boasting that Israel had activated clans in Gaza [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=74.88s)]
*  that opposed Hamas, calling it a good thing that saved the lives of Israeli soldiers. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=80.0s)]
*  What's wrong with that? He said, who are we talking about here? Let's just be clear, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=84.08s)]
*  who are we talking about? It's a militia headed by this guy called Yasser Abu Shabab. I expect [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=89.28s)]
*  we're going to be hearing a lot more about him, so keep his name in mind. According to the Israeli [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=96.0s)]
*  newspaper Israel Hayom, he was previously imprisoned by Hamas but escaped thanks to an air strike by [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=100.88s)]
*  the Israeli military towards the beginning of the genocide, and he allegedly commands a militia of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=106.0s)]
*  up to 300 gunmen. Now, this militia is based in the south of Gaza and has been looting aid coming [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=111.28s)]
*  to Gaza. We already knew they were operating under the nose of the Israeli military without [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=118.0s)]
*  any intervention, and I was previously discussing the links with the Israeli military and these [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=122.72s)]
*  bunch of thugs. And indeed, the Israeli military has systematically killed police officers charged [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=129.52s)]
*  with guarding aid coming into Gaza, allowing these gangs to be able to loot the aid. Now, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=134.4s)]
*  it causes something anti-terrorist service. In practice, it is a criminal gang which is [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=140.32s)]
*  terrorizing people in Gaza. Let's read this from the Times of Israel. Israel has been arming a [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=144.4s)]
*  criminal gang in the Gaza Strip as part of an effort to strengthen opposition to Hamas in the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=148.72s)]
*  enclave. Defence sources confirmed on Thursday following remarks on the matter by former defence [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=152.96s)]
*  minister Avigdor Lieberman. I'd say astonishing, but nothing should surprise us about the behaviour [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=157.6s)]
*  of the Israeli state. But as ever, note the lack of scandal here. Where it's not all over, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=163.36s)]
*  I mean, it should be all over the Western media, but so much should. And it's not. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=167.68s)]
*  The Times of Israel note it's operating in Ratha in an area under Israeli military control. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=171.28s)]
*  They're clearly being protected by the IDF. Interestingly, Abu Shabab's own family have [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=175.76000000000002s)]
*  disowned him because of his collaboration. They said in a statement, we, like everyone else, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  were surprised by video footage broadcast by the resistance showing the involvement of Yasser's [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=183.76000000000002s)]
*  groups within a dangerous security framework, reaching the point of operating within undercover [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=188.56s)]
*  units and supporting the Zionist occupation forces who were brutally killing our people. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=194.48s)]
*  We affirm that we will not accept Yasser's return to the family. We have no objection to those around [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=198.0s)]
*  him liquidating him immediately. And we tell you that his blood is forfeit. Oh wow, they're actually [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=202.48s)]
*  they're so angry they want him dead. The Guardian quote Jonathan Whittle, the head of the UN Office [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=208.0s)]
*  for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Occupied Palestine, who says Israel has publicly [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  claimed that the UN and NGO aid has been diverted by Hamas. But this doesn't hold up to scrutiny. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=217.28s)]
*  The real theft of aid since the beginning of the war has been carried out by criminal gangs under [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=222.24s)]
*  the watch of Israeli forces, and they were allowed to operate in proximity to the Kerem Shalom crossing [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=225.84s)]
*  point into Gaza. He confirmed to the Guardian this included Abu Shabab. Now look, Israel is pursuing [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=231.52s)]
*  a policy of deliberate starvation, which is achieving in various ways, allowing gangsters [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=237.12s)]
*  to steal aid is one of those ways. And it is yet another example of every accusations of confession. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=241.52s)]
*  They justified the siege on Gaza by claiming Hamas was stealing aid. The likes of Cindy McCain, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=246.16s)]
*  widow of late hawkish Republican Senator John McCain, and director of the World [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=251.28s)]
*  Freedom Programme said this wasn't happening. The people stealing the aid are Israel's allies. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=255.04s)]
*  Let me quote from the ever brilliant Palestinian analyst Mohammed Shahada. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=259.12s)]
*  Important Israel is not arming criminal gangs to challenge Hamas, he says. 300 untrained drug [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=262.96s)]
*  dealers and criminals can't overpower Hamas's 30,000 militants, he says. Israel has been using [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=267.44s)]
*  those ISIS linked gangs to indirectly maintain its starvation of Gaza and to outsource other [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=272.24s)]
*  dirty work to them. Every time the world pressures Israel to allow aid into Gaza, Israel unleashes [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=276.32s)]
*  those gangs in Ra'afa and Khan Yunis to loot all the aid going in so that the IDF can claim, look, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=281.52s)]
*  we're letting food in, it's not our fault people are starving. Israel has also been using those [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=286.08s)]
*  criminal gangs to carry out activities the IDF deems dangerous for its soldiers, e.g. sweeping [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=290.24s)]
*  areas, inspecting booby-trapped neighbourhoods, recon missions, surveillance, espionage, and protect [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=294.96000000000004s)]
*  Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, the Israeli front, facilities and interact with aid seekers. And now [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=300.56s)]
*  Israel is using those gangs to establish concentration camps with a Palestinian face to bait and lure [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=306.72s)]
*  starving Gazans to move to eastern Ra'afa, Egypt's borders, with a promise of safety and food. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=313.12s)]
*  Gazans wouldn't trust to live in such a camp surrounded by IDF soldiers, so Israel created [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=318.0s)]
*  this new puppet security force out the criminal gangs to run those camps instead. I mean, heeds [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=321.84s)]
*  are so much more important work and exposing the truth than, you know, in that tweet than you read [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=327.12s)]
*  in articles all over the Western media. Let's quote Yair Lapid, Israeli opposition leader and [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=333.44s)]
*  former prime minister, and he said, after Netanyahu finished giving millions of dollars to Hamas, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=339.2s)]
*  he moved on to giving weapons to organisations close to ISIS in Gaza, all off the cuff, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=343.76s)]
*  all without strategic planning, all leading to more disasters. Weapons that enter Gaza will [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=347.76s)]
*  eventually be turned against IDF soldiers and Israeli citizens. This point about being linked [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=351.76s)]
*  to ISIS is very interesting, isn't it? At the beginning of the genocide, remember what the [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=356.16s)]
*  Israeli state kept saying ad nauseam, Hamas is ISIS. Yet the Israeli state stands accused of [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=359.84000000000003s)]
*  arming and supporting ISIS linked militias. It's been widely noted that history is repeating itself. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=364.64000000000004s)]
*  In the 1980s, the Israeli state saw its Islamist group as a counterweight to Fatah. Fatah at the [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=370.72s)]
*  time, of course, was led by Yasser Arafat. It was deemed public enemy number one. What was this [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=375.92s)]
*  Islamist group named? Hamas. They allowed it to grow, to divide the Palestinian national movement [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=380.16s)]
*  as they saw it. This strategy was accelerated under Netanyahu. It suited him for the West Bank [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=385.36s)]
*  and Gaza to be ruled by rival factions, where he could say there was no partner for peace, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=390.48s)]
*  in quotes, because Hamas was beyond the pale as it was betrayed in terms of Fatah not representing [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=394.72s)]
*  at the same time all of the occupied territories. It was like, we can't deal with any of these [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=401.68s)]
*  people. That was his narrative. That would succeed in rebuffing already weak international pressure [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=405.04s)]
*  to allow an independent Palestinian state. With the support of Netanyahu, money was funneled from [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=410.72s)]
*  Qatar to Hamas before 7th October. Now, based on the evidence, I did a video on this back in November [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=415.20000000000005s)]
*  and I was smeared because of it. Now, there's an organization in the UK called the Community [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=420.08000000000004s)]
*  Security Trust, whose mandate is to protect Jewish people from anti-Semitism. That's very important. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=424.08000000000004s)]
*  Anti-Semitism is a growing problem. It's real. And Jewish people are at risk of hate crimes. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=430.40000000000003s)]
*  They need protection and security. A communal organization for that function is something I [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=434.56s)]
*  support. The problem is certain staffers have been attacking critics of Israel's genocide, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=438.88s)]
*  like myself, and wrongly invoking what is the very real evil of anti-Semitism, which should be taken [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=443.52s)]
*  very seriously. And I do take it very seriously. One of these staffers thought a good use of his [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=447.92s)]
*  time, for example, and resources in the fight against anti-Semitism was combed through my videos [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=451.36s)]
*  and clip all the time I'd said Jewish, even though these were cases of me, for example, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=456.15999999999997s)]
*  opposing anti-Semitism or noting Jewish activists who oppose Israel's genocide. He did it to make [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=460.8s)]
*  it look like I had this creepy obsession with Jewish people, this sinister obsession. That was [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=466.0s)]
*  the function. As Zach Polanski, who's running to be leader of the Green Party, who's Jewish, again, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=470.4s)]
*  I say those words, then he could take those words and splice it together to do the same thing. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=477.76s)]
*  That's what we're dealing with here. He noted that example as a way of, that's not making Jewish [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=483.44s)]
*  people feel safe. It's whipping up fears based on nonsense amongst Jewish people. Because make it [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=489.6s)]
*  look, oh my God, look, here's this newspaper columnist, he's obsessed with us. This is dangerous. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=496.32000000000005s)]
*  Completely cynical. And it has that effect. Now, he also refers to my video about Israel and ISIS [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=501.04s)]
*  link gangs last November. And he wrote at the time the following, Tyson, a YouTube video, Israel [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=509.44s)]
*  allying with ISIS to starve Gaza is no more than the worst kind of shameless clickbait sensationalism. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=514.96s)]
*  Given also the abundance of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories regarding Israel and ISIS, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=520.8000000000001s)]
*  it's also just reckless. Now, at the time I speak to you here, I asked him for a response and he [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=526.32s)]
*  hasn't given me one. Now, here's what I'd say to him and to people who have adopted his strategy. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=534.32s)]
*  Stop abusing the concept of anti-Semitism. Just stop it. Cut out. It's a very real evil. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=542.48s)]
*  It's a hatred of Jewish people. Discussing the behaviour of the Israeli state based on evidence [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=549.04s)]
*  is an anti-Semitism. You know, the criminal behaviour of the Israeli state, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=555.84s)]
*  not the Jewish people, is not anti-Semitism. And I would urge you and others to stop trashing [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=563.9200000000001s)]
*  the demarcation between the Israeli state and Jewish people. It's not one and the same. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=572.48s)]
*  There was supposed to be a theoretical agreement on that. But it's defenders of Israel who tried [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=578.64s)]
*  to trash that by saying anyone who opposes what Israel is doing is attacking Jewish people. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=584.24s)]
*  Cut it out. Stop it. It's dangerous. It's irresponsible. Now, you would now have to condemn [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=589.2s)]
*  the Israeli opposition as indulging anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. Do you believe that? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=594.72s)]
*  There should be a teachable lesson for you that you are undermining the fight against anti-Semitism [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=598.88s)]
*  by smearing people who just don't like war crimes. That's really what this is. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFW9G3KCpaM&t=602.96s)]
