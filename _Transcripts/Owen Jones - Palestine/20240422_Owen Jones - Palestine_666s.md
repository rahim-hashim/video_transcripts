# Palestinians Must Suffer Agonising Deaths, Because They Went To The Beach - Israeli TV
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT4F-gcgbd4)
*  This is truly disturbing stuff, to say the least, and it's disturbing because it's not exceptional.
*  Here is yet another case study of the genocidal mania which has enveloped Israel. That mania has
*  overwhelmed Israeli society so much, with extremely courageous exceptions who will in time be
*  vindicated by history, that it's become like a background hum. It causes no shock or horror in
*  the mainstream, with the most obscene genocidal statements causing few to blink. Now I'm going
*  to show a horrific clip of unashamed genocidal incitement, but let's just start with Ynet.
*  It's a mainstream Israeli news outlet and it posted a clip of Palestinians at the beach in
*  Gaza, which is, as I'm sure you'll know, a coastal strip right next to the Mediterranean,
*  which goes all the way down its coastal border. Ynet wrote in an accompanying tweet,
*  Poor Gaza civilians having fun at the beach, not too far away from where Israeli women,
*  children and elders are being held hostage. Horrific genocide, famine and other old wives'
*  tales. Hashtag no famine in Gaza, hashtag no genocide in Gaza. If you click on the story,
*  the headline is, Garzans flocked to the beach amid hostage families' fune. Then the subheading is,
*  Images of Garzans bathing in the sea enrage families of Hamas hostages as their loved ones
*  continue to languish in captivity. This is a joke and it's at our expense, says hostage's cousin.
*  It goes on to say, as Gaza was swept by an early season heatwave, Garzans flocked to the beaches
*  of the coastal enclave to cool off. The sight of life in Gaza seemingly going back to normal
*  amid war was especially stinging for some of the families of the Israeli hostages who'd been held
*  in captivity for 195 days. Where to even begin? I mean, the clue is there in the article, isn't it?
*  Early season heatwave. It's hot. Gaza has been virtually destroyed. The civilian population
*  clearly have no jobs or schools or universities to go to. Their lives have been made miserable
*  beyond imagination. What do you expect them to do? To avoid going to the sea, which runs down
*  the entire strip in which they live when it's extremely hot and just sit in the rubble, sobbing
*  24 hours a day? When they ride, why not? The sight of life in Gaza seemingly going back to normal.
*  I mean, that's just deranged, isn't it? Given most civilian infrastructure has been severely
*  damaged or destroyed, families gripping Gaza, almost the entire population has been displaced,
*  with one and a half million of Gaza's pre-war population, 2.2 million or so, sheltering in
*  Raffa, which had a pre-war population of 280,000, and tens of thousands have suffered violent deaths,
*  leaving huge numbers of their loved ones grief stricken, I think we can conclude that no,
*  life is not returning to normal. You can find examples throughout history of pictures of people
*  suffering the most obscene crimes, having moments of levity, and their persecutors have used those
*  images in order to claim that they did not suffer, when in truth, they were trying to escape the
*  horror of their present. Even the German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, who has played a key
*  role when it comes to complicity in Israel's crimes, challenged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
*  Netanyahu about this, as the Guardian journalist Patrick Wintour writes, meeting between Baerbock
*  and Netanyahu became difficult, as did cameras with cats. Baerbock reportedly recommended that
*  Israel stop circulating the photos of life supposedly returning to normal in the Palestinian
*  enclave, as they don't portray the real situation in Gaza, there is hunger in Gaza. At this point,
*  Netanyahu said to have raised his voice and insisted, it's real, it's reality, it's not like
*  what the Nazis stage, we're not like the Nazis who produce fake images of a manufactured reality.
*  According to the Channel 13 report, the German Foreign Minister responded,
*  are you saying that our doctors in the field in Gaza aren't telling the truth,
*  are you saying that the international media is lying? This is a crucial point here, Israel's
*  propaganda machine is seeking to erase the reality of the crimes it's committing, which itself has
*  murderous consequences, and again, raising throughout history, which do these sorts of horrors
*  have done exactly the same thing over and over again. The murderous consequences are that it
*  helps deflect pressure on actually preventing, for example, Palestinians starving to death.
*  The logic of that Israeli media piece is collective punishment, that the Palestinians should be
*  suffering unimaginable horror at all times, with no respite. Which brings me to this clip from
*  Channel 12, the most watched channel in Israel. It features Yehuda Slezinger, he was a journalist
*  for Israel Hayom, the most read newspaper in the country. Let's listen to him.
*  I'm in the sea, and I'm connecting it to other clips we saw yesterday, which are even more
*  fascinating and not as scary as the ones we saw yesterday, which are clips of Yarden Bibas.
*  There is a connection between these things, because in Yarden Bibas, only those who
*  chewed him in the back, didn't kill his family or chewed them, only those who chewed
*  him in the back and took a selfie with him, and did all these things, they reach those people
*  who are dead. Deadly, dead in the ruins. And instead we see them floating in the sea,
*  and in their stalpits, and in their fun. These people, they don't feel sorry for the
*  murder of Taza, they don't feel sorry for them, they didn't say they wanted Hamas, they celebrated,
*  they shared sweets, some of them killed Shani Louk's bodies, some of them took selfies
*  with our victims, they don't feel sorry for the murder. They are now floating in the sea
*  together. Instead of being scary, instead of being tortured, instead of going through
*  hard trials, instead of hiding from the consequences, they are floating in the sea.
*  That's exactly the reason why they are there.
*  I'll tell you two things, because that's your view.
*  And that's a question I know, but when a person wants to, we should see there
*  much more beautiful, much more beautiful, blood of Azatians, until they come to their leaders
*  and say, let them go, let them go, because we can't afford to.
*  So, okay.
*  Just straightforward genocide and incitement. Taking collective punishment to its logical
*  genocidal conclusion, he declares that the people of Gaza deserve death, a hard death,
*  an agonizing death. He says there are no innocent people in Gaza, and decries of enjoying on the
*  beach instead of starving, being jerked around, being severely tormented and hiding from shelling.
*  We should have seen a lot more revenge, a lot more rivers of Gazan's blood.
*  Sadistic genocidal incitement, actually deriving thrills from the high idea of civilians suffering
*  hideous, tortured, anguished deaths, as indeed they have on a mass scale.
*  Now, a legal point here. Israel is obliged to prosecute that man. He has committed a very
*  grave criminal offence. You see, the Genocide Convention of 1948 has five criminal offences
*  that it lists, one of which is genocide, but another is direct and public incitement to commit
*  genocide. What he said there clearly is direct and public incitement to commit genocide.
*  Now, the US dragged its feet on ratifying the Genocide Convention. It didn't do so until 1988,
*  and the man who pushed for that successfully was a democratic senator from Delaware who goes by the
*  name of Joe Biden. Well, history has many dark ironies. Now, Israel did not drag its feet,
*  on the other hand, as you would expect, because the Shoah, the industrialized slaughter of six
*  million Jews, the attempt to wipe out the entire Jewish population of Europe, succeeding in
*  exterminating two thirds in a very short space of time, that was the basis, of course, for the
*  Genocide Convention. So Israel ratified the Genocide Convention in 1950, translating it
*  to its statute books. And get this, Israel carries not only the death penalty for genocide,
*  but it treats public incitement to commit genocide as an equal criminal offence. That is,
*  a capital offence. Now, I don't support the death penalty in any circumstances. What I would say is
*  that there's a very good reason for direct and public incitement to commit genocide being severely
*  criminalized, because it encourages people, public incitement, to commit genocide. Those soldiers who
*  are on the rampage in Gaza are radicalized by this rhetoric, but also genocidal conduct by those
*  soldiers is normalized by such rhetoric going unpunished. But the problem is Israel would have
*  to prosecute most of its government, as well as a load of politicians, generals, journalists, army
*  officers, soldiers, for also participating in genocidal rhetoric. Now, here's another example.
*  Let's listen to Israeli finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, being interviewed.
*  Again, genocidal mania. Nazis, we'd all agree, are genocidal totalitarian mass murderers who
*  conquered Europe in an entirely plausible attempt at establishing global hegemony, being responsible
*  for the slaughter of tens of millions of people in the process. Nazis are legitimate targets,
*  something which is not least understood in the context of a Jewish audience, for whom
*  the very mention of Nazis triggers a more than well-grounded and justified profound emotional
*  response. Now, here he says Gaza's population, its civilians are Nazis, he wants to slaughter,
*  rape and murder every Jew. He goes on to justify what he said, for example, the vast majority of
*  the population of Gaza grows up with the visceral hatred of the state of Israel, not understanding
*  why a people who have suffered generations of occupation, siege, ethnic cleansing, land theft,
*  illegal colonisation, apartheid, repeated mass slaughters, would have an antipathy towards their
*  oppressor, not least in the context of the current genocidal mayhem being visited upon them. And
*  there's no self-awareness here, given a, the visceral hatred of Gaza whipped up across Israeli
*  society by the likes of Smotrich, and b, it is Gaza being wiped off the face of the earth with mass
*  slaughter of its civilian population. Describing Palestinians as Nazis drives genocidal mania,
*  it leaves them all with target signs on their backs. Now Smotrich should be prosecuted too,
*  under the Genocide Convention, and Israel's own ratification of it, but of course he won't be,
*  he will remain Israel's finance minister. It's striking, isn't it, how we have constant moral
*  panics about placards at protests against the mass slaughter of innocent people in Gaza,
*  and those moral panics are used to justify demonising all those who support ending this
*  utter carnage. But the genocidal statement of Israel's own rulers and their establishment,
*  that's disregarded, often not even reported on, or not reported in any prominent way,
*  when as I keep saying if the media did their jobs, this would all frame the coverage of what's
*  happening to Gaza. So it is our responsibility to expose this genocidal mania, because it's driven
*  by impunity, that is as Westerners, our governments have allowed Israel to get away with anything,
*  and therefore there's no check on this genocidal mania, because those driving understand very
*  clearly there will be no consequences. That's why it's up to us. Please like and subscribe,
