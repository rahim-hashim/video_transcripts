# Bill Clinton's VILE Anti-Palestinian Racist Speech
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [November 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw)
*  If you're an opponent of Israel's genocide who lives in the United States and hello from [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=0.0s)]
*  Wisconsin then the choice ahead of you is grim indeed. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  There is Kamala Harris, Vice President of the Administration which has armed and facilitated [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Israel's genocide from day one, who herself was the star performer at the 2017 Policy [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=11.16s)]
*  Conference of AIPAC, the main pro-Israel lobby here, and who has offered zero evidence that [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=15.32s)]
*  she intends to break from the current administration's policy of make Israel's genocide possible [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=19.2s)]
*  while doing occasional hand wringing and sad face about how many Palestinians your weapons [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  are slaughtering. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=27.6s)]
*  Then there was Donald Trump, who the polling shows the vast majority of people in Israel [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=28.88s)]
*  want to win, whose allies are the staunch champion Benjamin Netanyahu's band of extremists, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=32.0s)]
*  who as president helped facilitate the Israeli far-right's dreams, who uses the very word [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=37.96s)]
*  Palestine as an insult, and who is the architect of the racist Muslim ban. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=41.8s)]
*  Now this disastrous state of affairs is despite the fact that say the polling shows Americans [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=45.64s)]
*  oppose Israel's onslaught by a big margin, that most democratic voters rightly think [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=50.96s)]
*  Israel's committing genocide against the Palestinian people, and over half of Americans [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=55.4s)]
*  think US arm shipments to Israel should end until the onslaught against Gaza is finished. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=59.4s)]
*  Ended. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=64.4s)]
*  That is. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=65.4s)]
*  That Israeli war crimes end. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=66.4s)]
*  Where is the political representation for these people? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=70.28s)]
*  Now I'm here covering the US presidential elections both in the run up and in the aftermath. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=72.88s)]
*  You can support this project, we're paying brilliant videographers to make videos going [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=77.12s)]
*  out and about, which we're about to go and do now with the videographer to talk to ordinary [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=81.0s)]
*  voters in Wisconsin as well as really interesting people, public figures. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=84.0s)]
*  I'll be going next to Dearborn in Michigan to talk to Muslim Americans who traditionally [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=88.32s)]
*  vote for the Democrats, you can click the link in the video if you want to support that. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=92.28s)]
*  Let's start with this truly vile intervention from Bill Clinton, the former US president, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=96.48s)]
*  and of course husband to failed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=100.12s)]
*  This was in Michigan, which has the largest Muslim population in the United States. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=103.8s)]
*  Let me talk about the hardest issue here in Michigan is the Middle East. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=108.72s)]
*  And I have to be careful what I say because there's only one president at a time and none [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=115.72s)]
*  of us can get ahead of where we're going. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=123.12s)]
*  But I think we're going to have to essentially start again on the peace process. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=128.48s)]
*  And I understand why young Palestinian and Arab Americans in Michigan think too many [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=135.08s)]
*  people have died. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=146.60000000000002s)]
*  I get that. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=149.64000000000001s)]
*  But if you lived in one of those kibbutzim in Israel right next to Gaza where the people [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=152.42s)]
*  there were the most pro friendship with Palestine, most pro two-state solution of any of the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=166.77999999999997s)]
*  Israeli communities were the ones right next to Gaza. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=177.94s)]
*  And Hamas butchered them. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=184.57999999999998s)]
*  And so then the people who criticize it are essentially saying, yeah, but look how many [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=189.74s)]
*  people you've killed in retaliation. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=194.86s)]
*  So how many is enough for you to kill to punish them for the terrible things they did? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=196.78s)]
*  That all sounds nice until you realize what would you do if it was your family and you [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=202.56s)]
*  hadn't done anything but support a homeland for the Palestinians and one day they come [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=211.04s)]
*  for you and slaughter the people in your village? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=215.96s)]
*  You would say, well, you'll have to forgive me. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=220.92000000000002s)]
*  I'm not keeping score that way. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=224.0s)]
*  It isn't how many we've had to kill because Hamas makes sure that they're shielded by [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=226.86s)]
*  civilians. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=236.66000000000003s)]
*  They'll force you to kill civilians if you want to defend yourself. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=237.66000000000003s)]
*  Okay, well, this is both disgusting and insane. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=245.34s)]
*  Why is this man doing a stump speech in support of Kamala Harris where he supports Israel's [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=248.66000000000003s)]
*  genocidal onslaught in Michigan of all places? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=252.74s)]
*  What he says here is obscene. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=255.82s)]
*  The utterly dismissive way he talks about the mass slaughter of Palestinians with no [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=256.9s)]
*  effort to conceal the fact he doesn't think their lives have even a fraction of the worth [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=260.38s)]
*  of Israelis. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=264.21999999999997s)]
*  He talks emotionally about the slaughter of Israelis, but not Palestinians. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=265.21999999999997s)]
*  He says, I understand why young Palestinian and Arab Americans in Michigan think too many [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=268.96s)]
*  people have died. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=272.65999999999997s)]
*  I get that. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=273.65999999999997s)]
*  The use of the passive died there as though they got killed by a hurricane rather than [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=274.65999999999997s)]
*  being bombed or shot or starved or burned alive, suffocated under rubble, blown apart [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=278.26s)]
*  and so on. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=282.62s)]
*  He can't even say he thinks too many have been killed rather than say died. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=283.62s)]
*  Let's just take on this nonsense about human shields. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=287.54s)]
*  He actually says Hamas forces Israel to kill civilians. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=290.88s)]
*  This is truly disgusting apologism for war crimes, deliberately absolving the US ally [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=294.34000000000003s)]
*  of Israel for its responsibility for the mass slaughter of civilians. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=300.02s)]
*  You can rightly condemn Hamas for war crimes committed on the 7th of October. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=304.78000000000003s)]
*  The evidence for the use of human shields is simply not there. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=308.5s)]
*  They wouldn't be able to maintain any level of popular support or acquiescence if that [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=311.7s)]
*  were true. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=315.58s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=316.58s)]
*  The evidence simply has not been produced for it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=317.58s)]
*  Pre-war Gaza was one of the most densely populated places on earth, an open air prison, and Israel [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=318.9s)]
*  has detonated the equivalent worth of several Hiroshima bombs there. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=324.34s)]
*  What would human shields have to do there with the mass killing that we've seen? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=328.62s)]
*  The argument here is that what Israel judges to be military targets are located in civilian [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=332.7s)]
*  areas. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=336.74s)]
*  Well firstly, what Israel considers a military target is deliberately all encompassing to [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=337.74s)]
*  provide a rationale for the mass destruction of Gaza as now an overwhelming abundance of [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=341.06s)]
*  evidence shows. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=346.42s)]
*  Secondly, even if you think there's a legitimate military target somewhere, you can't just [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=347.42s)]
*  blow it up and kill everyone. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=350.86s)]
*  It has to be proportionate to military aims. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=352.22s)]
*  You can't just treat civilians with contempt, even if that rationale were true. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=355.62s)]
*  And thirdly, recently when Iranian missiles targeted Israel, broadcasters spoke in shock [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=360.34000000000003s)]
*  tones about how Mossad headquarters were being targeted, which could mean civilian deaths, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=364.02s)]
*  significant civilian deaths in Israel, because it's located in a civilian area. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=370.34s)]
*  As indeed I would note, the IDF headquarters is surrounded by civilian apartments, shopping [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=374.5s)]
*  malls, you name it. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=378.94s)]
*  And guess what, that's the same in country after country. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=379.94s)]
*  Are these countries also using civilians as human shields? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=381.97999999999996s)]
*  And also guess what, there's overwhelming evidence of Israel using Palestinians as human [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=385.06s)]
*  shields because that's right, every accusation is a confession. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=389.12s)]
*  Even the likes of CNN and the New York Times have covered this, despite their overall scandalous [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=393.2s)]
*  coverage of this genocide. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=397.53999999999996s)]
*  Clinton could simply have read the New York Times piece entitled Pithily, How Israel's [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=399.46s)]
*  Army Uses Palestinians as Human Shields in Gaza. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=403.53999999999996s)]
*  It details how one Palestinian detained for 10 days was then released without charge, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=408.06s)]
*  but he was used as a human shield. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=412.62s)]
*  This was back in March. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=414.62s)]
*  Let's read it. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=415.62s)]
*  Mr. Shabir, then 17, said he was forced to walk handcuffed through the empty rooms of [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=416.62s)]
*  his hometown, Khan Yunis, in southern Gaza, searching for explosives sent by Hamas. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=420.46s)]
*  To avoid being blown up themselves, the soldiers made him go ahead, Mr. Shabir said. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=424.79999999999995s)]
*  In one wrecked building, he stopped in his tracks, running along the wall, he says, was [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=428.44s)]
*  a series of wires attached to explosives. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=431.8s)]
*  The soldiers sent me like a dog to a booby-trapped apartment, he said. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=433.84s)]
*  I thought these would be the last moments of my life. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=437.04s)]
*  He was a high school student. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=439.0s)]
*  CNN also documents how the Israeli military forced Palestinians into booby-trapped homes [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=440.72s)]
*  and tunnels to protect their own. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=444.8s)]
*  And there's multiple other examples of this evidence. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=446.64s)]
*  What is grotesque is Clinton speaks with humanity about Israelis being slaughtered, but not [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=448.76s)]
*  about Palestinians, who he clearly frames as collateral damage, however many are killed. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=453.15999999999997s)]
*  He's also about the overwhelming evidence of Israel doing indiscriminate bombing, destroying [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=457.72s)]
*  most of Gaza's infrastructure so it looks like a different colour and texture when looked [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=460.92s)]
*  at from space, as well as overwhelming evidence of Israeli soldiers deliberately shooting [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=464.28000000000003s)]
*  dead innocent civilians, including kids, destroying the entire medical system, preventing the [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=468.64000000000004s)]
*  essentials of life from entering, committing hideous torture as well as rape. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=473.0s)]
*  We could go on. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=476.76000000000005s)]
*  He also suggests Israelis have a right to express grievance when justifying Israeli [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=477.84000000000003s)]
*  violence, but not in the case of Palestinians. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=482.32000000000005s)]
*  Decades of ethnic cleansing, mass slaughter, occupation, siege, colonisation, mass incarceration, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=484.96s)]
*  torture, we could go on. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=489.35999999999996s)]
*  None of that relevant to him. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=490.79999999999995s)]
*  Here's another truly diabolical excerpt from Clinton's speech. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=492.03999999999996s)]
*  their faith existed. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=514.96s)]
*  They were there. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=518.84s)]
*  In the time of King David, in the southernmost tribes, Hadzidea and Samaria. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=520.8000000000001s)]
*  So here's what I want to tell you. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=528.9200000000001s)]
*  I'm going to do everything I can to convince people that they cannot murder their way out [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=530.96s)]
*  of this, neither side. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=536.6800000000001s)]
*  You can't kill your way out of this. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=538.92s)]
*  And they have to make a new beginning. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=542.28s)]
*  But when I read that people in Michigan are thinking about not voting because they're [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=546.1999999999999s)]
*  mad at the Biden administration for honouring his historic obligation to try to keep Israel [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=551.36s)]
*  from being destroyed, I think that's a mistake. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=560.28s)]
*  Because Donald Trump has shown what he wants. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=564.24s)]
*  Kamala Harris has said that she will try to negotiate an end to the violence, an end [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=568.2s)]
*  to the killing and a new priest process. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=574.36s)]
*  And that ought to be enough. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=577.36s)]
*  I mean, where to begin? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=578.96s)]
*  Let's leave the low-lying fruit. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=579.96s)]
*  Harris said she'll try to negotiate an end to the violence. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=581.5200000000001s)]
*  He said that ought to be enough. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=584.0400000000001s)]
*  Oh, OK, America's disillusioned over a democratic administration containing Kamala Harris, having [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=585.5200000000001s)]
*  now facilitated over a year of genocidal mayhem. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=590.32s)]
*  Like, why can't you just take Harris at a word? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=592.96s)]
*  What's wrong with you? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=594.5200000000001s)]
*  As for the rest, goodness me. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=595.5200000000001s)]
*  This historical revisionism is grotesque and it is racist. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=597.32s)]
*  He tries to make out this is a religious conflict. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=601.1600000000001s)]
*  It isn't. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=602.96s)]
*  It's about an indigenous people being murderously emptied from their land. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=603.96s)]
*  The fact he refers to the West Bank as Judea and Samaria, using the same theological term [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=606.6400000000001s)]
*  as the Israeli far right, to suggest what is illegally occupied territory was given [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=611.32s)]
*  by God to Israel. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=615.36s)]
*  That should say enough. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=616.36s)]
*  And his argument here that Judaism predates Islam. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=618.0s)]
*  What argument is he even making? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=621.0s)]
*  If he wants to go there, does he not realise that the majority of Palestinians are the [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=622.36s)]
*  descendants of the Jews of ancient Israel? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=626.04s)]
*  They then subsequently converted to Christianity or Islam. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=628.28s)]
*  In the end, that being more the latter. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=631.48s)]
*  But notice how he, like so many others, erases Christian Palestinians. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=634.52s)]
*  As it happens, a large proportion of both Palestinians and Israeli Jews share genetic [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=638.94s)]
*  roots. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=643.04s)]
*  If you want to go there, you can trace them back, all of them, to the Canaanites who inhabited [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=644.04s)]
*  that land. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=648.72s)]
*  What Clinton shows here is racist contempt. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=649.72s)]
*  It drips with Islamophobia, but more generally anti-Palestinian racism. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=651.8s)]
*  Now Trump's trying to exploit all this, saying he'll stop the destruction, suffering in [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=655.64s)]
*  Lebanon, promoting the idea he'll bring peace, while his allies brief that he'll [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=658.68s)]
*  get the onslaught against Gaza to end by the time of his inauguration. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=662.12s)]
*  Don't believe him. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=665.24s)]
*  His record speaks for itself. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=666.24s)]
*  And his idea of peace is the same as the Israeli regime. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=667.24s)]
*  Use overwhelming, murderous force. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=670.04s)]
*  As the Roman Empire put it, they create a desert and they call it peace. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=672.04s)]
*  Very bleak. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=676.0s)]
*  But I'm here to report the truth. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=677.0s)]
*  As I say, we've got professional films made by brilliant videographers looking at what's [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=678.0s)]
*  going on on the ground, thanks to you. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=681.3199999999999s)]
*  The first here in Madison, then Dearborn, in Michigan, then Pennsylvania, North Carolina, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=683.96s)]
*  all before the election. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=688.52s)]
*  Then we'll go around the US elsewhere, depending on the results. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=689.52s)]
*  Obviously, we're paying these brilliant videographers properly. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=692.5600000000001s)]
*  It's very expensive. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=695.0400000000001s)]
*  If you want to support this as we offer an alternative to the corporate media, then you [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=696.0400000000001s)]

*  forward slash Owen Jones. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=706.72s)]
*  Very excited to release the first of these videos, the next thing published on the channel. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=707.72s)]
*  And there'll be one of these videos each day. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=711.64s)]
*  So stay tuned and give us support if you want to pay these videographers properly for their [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3HEZc5vCw&t=713.16s)]
