# Brits To Be JAILED Over Gaza War Crimes? w/. Sean Summerfield
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA)
*  This interview is so so important, it's about a big big question. Could British citizens [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=0.0s)]
*  really be arrested and prosecuted for war crimes and crimes against humanity [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=6.24s)]
*  committed because of Israel's onslaught against Gaza? Now you may think it sounds far-fetched, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=11.84s)]
*  given the impunity long enjoyed by Israel and indeed the role of the British state in arming [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=17.68s)]
*  and facilitating Israel's genocide. But a legal team have launched a major legal case, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=22.64s)]
*  submitting a detailed report to the Metropolitan Police against 10 British individuals for alleged [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=28.48s)]
*  war crimes and crimes against humanity. This comes in the context of a broader set of legal challenges [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=34.64s)]
*  both in individual countries and of course, for example, the International Criminal Court [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=42.96s)]
*  issuing arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=48.0s)]
*  and his former defence minister, Yov Galan. Now I've spoken to a member of the legal team [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  here in Britain, the barrister, Sean Summerfield. He specialises in international criminal law and [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=58.16s)]
*  human rights. I start by asking him, how did this case come about and why did these lawyers decide [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=62.64s)]
*  this was a case they needed to pursue? I think it's probably quite clear that the report comes [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=68.0s)]
*  or certainly situated within the context of a much wider solidarity movement. We've seen protests up [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=73.44s)]
*  and down the country, people turning out in tens of thousands week in week out to protest [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=80.8s)]
*  the current state of affairs in Gaza and more broadly the occupation and the situation in [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=86.72s)]
*  Palestine. States have systematically failed the Palestinian people and when that happens, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=92.56s)]
*  it falls on civil society and lawyers to do what they can, I think, to provide accountability. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=98.64s)]
*  But for us in this report, we are very much lawyers. And so although the report is situated [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=106.48s)]
*  within that broader context, for us, it's about following the evidence and that's what we did here. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=112.56s)]
*  We came together, it's me, it's a small team of barristers and solicitors, in particular the Public [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  Interest Law Centre and Paul Heron, who's the director of that. And we've been working closely [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=124.56s)]
*  with the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights as well, who've been integral to the research that [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=128.88s)]
*  we've had to conduct and a team of researchers in The Hague who really deserve credit for putting [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=133.36s)]
*  together and compiling the dossier that we put forward. Grave crimes, war crimes, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=138.48s)]
*  it's crimes against humanity. And when the evidence suggests that they have been committed [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=145.12s)]
*  by whoever they've been committed by, there needs to be accountability. And the evidence that we [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=148.48s)]
*  collected suggests that Brits have been involved, they've been over to Israel, they've joined the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=154.39999999999998s)]
*  Israeli military and they've been fighting out there. And the evidence we submit suggests [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=159.44s)]
*  complicity in atrocity crimes. And that really is the background to the report, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=165.44s)]
*  that's why we think it's so important and that's why the submission to the war crimes team. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  And now, with the summary, now obviously what is not publicly published, that's of course to avoid [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=177.76000000000002s)]
*  jeopardising any possible future prosecution of the 10 individuals. I think people understand why [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=184.0s)]
*  it's not been released because that would obviously jeopardise any potential public [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=190.0s)]
*  prosecution. What can you tell us though, that's actually in the report, what are the sorts of, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=192.88s)]
*  I guess, allegations that have been made against these 10 British citizens? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=199.04s)]
*  So, the International Criminal Court has jurisdiction over four crimes, war crimes, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=206.0s)]
*  crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime of aggression. The last two of those are very much [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=211.28s)]
*  leadership crimes and we've seen arrest warrants from the ICC in respect of [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=216.48s)]
*  Benyamin Netanyahu and others. War crimes and crimes against humanity, however, can be committed [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=220.39999999999998s)]
*  by foot soldiers and by the officers that command them. And that is very much the focus of this [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=226.32s)]
*  report. It includes the whole range of war crimes and crimes against humanity and there's a big [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=232.48s)]
*  overlap there in terms of the definition of them both. But in short, it includes murder, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  includes killing of Palestinians, it includes the indiscriminate targeting of civilian areas [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=242.56s)]
*  and civilian areas that are very clearly demarcated as civilian areas that include hospitals as well. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=248.48s)]
*  It includes the consecration of particular sites and the forced displacement of people as well. So, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=254.16s)]
*  all of those constitute both war crimes and crimes against humanity and we submit that there is [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=259.52s)]
*  evidence of these 10 Brits involving themselves in those crimes. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=265.12s)]
*  I mean, anyone who spends time on the hideous atrocities being committed live streamed, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=270.72s)]
*  I think this is important to come onto. It's grim stuff. I have to sit through any of the [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=280.88s)]
*  evidence often video and post-credit companies and what Hakely... We know from the summary of [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=289.44s)]
*  the report it says, it looks about, for example, one would say, saying, dead bodies stashed next [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=295.04s)]
*  to each other, one recorded a bike and the police to find the bodies of my uncle, my son, my nephew, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=301.36s)]
*  my brother-in-law. Someone saying their father, husband and children were forced to strip and [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=304.88s)]
*  taken one by one in the middle of the flat stream living room, soldier beaten and electrocuted, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=311.2s)]
*  large billiards step, bulldozers running over dead bodies, obviously desecrating the dead, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=315.84s)]
*  corpses scattered on the ground, especially in the hospital courtyards. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=324.96s)]
*  Now, these are actually examples here. These are these testimonies. I'm sure it's because, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=329.59999999999997s)]
*  as well as some would argue, well, I've argued, this is the most documented crime as it actually [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=336.56s)]
*  happened. I mean, that's because of social media and new technologies, the internet, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=344.08s)]
*  people's phones. But it's also the most confessed crime as it actually happened. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=349.35999999999996s)]
*  And that speaks to impurity, doesn't it? The IDF soldiers have willingly posted war crimes [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=354.08s)]
*  on the internet and I'm just able to do a documentary which itself detailed that. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=360.71999999999997s)]
*  Richard Sanders, the journalist, I mean, to me about that. I mean, is that partly what has helped [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=364.96s)]
*  your investigations though, the fact that many IDF soldiers potentially purchase it as L.C. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=371.6s)]
*  Milkson have willingly posted in order to boast or frankly for comic amusement, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=378.0s)]
*  and war crimes committed in Galway? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=386.24s)]
*  Absolutely. Absolutely it is. The report and the vast majority of the evidence that we've collected [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=390.16s)]
*  has gone into that report. And I don't want to go into specifics that, as you've alluded to, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=396.64000000000004s)]
*  would perhaps lead to the identification of these suspects because it could prejudice any [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=401.12s)]
*  investigation or prosecution that might follow. But the majority of the evidence is open source [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=405.44s)]
*  and you might find that surprising. I think a lot of people will find that surprising, but [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=411.12s)]
*  it's the reality of this conflict, as you've said. If you have soldiers who one might think [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=415.04s)]
*  ill-advisedly are documenting what might well amount to a war crime, then they ought to expect, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=420.8s)]
*  you might think, that lawyers will take that information and present it as evidence against [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=428.08s)]
*  them. And so although we have testimony, and you've referred to some of that, and the Palestinian [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=433.92s)]
*  Center for Human Rights have been exceptional in helping us to obtain that, it's the open source [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=439.28000000000003s)]
*  evidence that perhaps is the most damning in respect of the individual suspects. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=444.8s)]
*  Will Barron Why is this such an important case? Why does it matter in terms of the board of [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=448.96000000000004s)]
*  context? Because in the mention of Marrow, since there were 10 individuals identified [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=454.8s)]
*  who had allegedly committed these crimes and therefore, this was up to the Chief Justice [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=461.36s)]
*  for 10 individuals, but it's not about simply about the Senate individuals. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=468.24s)]
*  Will Barron So why is it important? What is the general, you know, seeking to achieve in a broader sense? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=472.0s)]
*  Jason Williams War crimes and crimes against humanity are grave international crimes. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=481.28s)]
*  The gravest crimes it's possible to commit. If there is evidence that people, anyone has committed [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=486.48s)]
*  those crimes, there needs to be accountability for it because international criminal law matters. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=493.12s)]
*  It's the framework with which we hold people to account. If there is evidence, and we suggest [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=498.16s)]
*  there is, it needs to be properly examined. And if it leads to arrest, warrants and prosecutions, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=503.28000000000003s)]
*  then that's where it leads to. And that's now on the Metropolitan Police to do that. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=509.68s)]
*  The Public Interest Law Center is a British based organization. We are a team, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=515.0400000000001s)]
*  largely of British lawyers as well. And I think everybody has an interest in making sure that [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=520.4s)]
*  if war crimes are committed by Brits, there's accountability because nobody wants those war [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=526.64s)]
*  crimes in their name. Will Barron [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=531.52s)]
*  Well, I mean, something I'm going to ask you as well, just as your opinion as a lawyer. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=534.08s)]
*  I've often said on this channel, it's all about never let this be normalized, that people watching [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=539.76s)]
*  and listening should never allow themselves to stop being shocked by what's actually taking place, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=546.0s)]
*  facilitated by the British government, I would note. And that people should tell themselves [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=554.4s)]
*  every day, I can't believe this has really happened. We have some dynamics, and not to be [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=559.4399999999999s)]
*  naive, but just keep saying that. And I'm interested just in terms of why this is important, because [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=564.64s)]
*  not just for the people of Palestine who are suffering unimaginable horror, but as a lawyer, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=571.04s)]
*  are you not concerned that what we're seeing is the normalization of some of the worst possible [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=577.84s)]
*  atrocities it's possible to commit against human beings, unless these legal actions are taken, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=586.24s)]
*  then international war, whether it's huge problems, will just collapse, and then you get a descent [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=592.96s)]
*  more generally into barbarism. Will Barron [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=601.2s)]
*  Yes, I think so. I think it's why it was so encouraging to see that the ICC took their time, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=604.64s)]
*  but then did act. And we have arrest warrants now. And that does in itself send a message that the [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=610.56s)]
*  international community, for all its failings and its failure to support the Palestinian people for [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=617.1999999999999s)]
*  decades now, will take action when it comes to these grave international crimes. And the principle [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=621.4399999999999s)]
*  of complementarity means that individual states have an obligation to prosecute. And the International [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=627.76s)]
*  Criminal Court is really only engaged when states are either unwilling or unable to prosecute. And [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=634.8s)]
*  so if there is that, and there really is, that very clear obligation on states to act, then they [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=640.3199999999999s)]
*  need to be doing that. And if as lawyers we can encourage that, and in doing so uphold the [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=646.08s)]
*  principle of international criminal law, then all the better. I think there's a secondary point here [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=652.16s)]
*  to the report as well. The primary focus, of course, is on accountability. But if it sends a [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=656.72s)]
*  message as well to individuals with dual nationality who are perhaps thinking about going out there and [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=662.1600000000001s)]
*  joining the Israeli military, or any foreign power engaged in conflict, in what now must be [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=668.24s)]
*  full knowledge of at least the accusation of atrocities being committed. And the message, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=676.88s)]
*  I hope, is think again, because the international community is watching. There are people that are [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=682.48s)]
*  prepared to create dossiers like this, to submit them to the appropriate authorities, and to call [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=687.44s)]
*  for accountability. Just a couple of final things. I mean, just on that, a lot of people actually [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=692.5600000000001s)]
*  may be shocked that the British government is standing aside whilst allowing richest citizens [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=698.32s)]
*  to go to Israel and to fight, well, to be part of a genocide launch, which is what many of us with [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=706.4s)]
*  the guards, what's happened to guards of. And I'm doing nothing about, I mean, the UK government may [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=714.64s)]
*  stand aside and say, well, in a way they wouldn't Russia, where they without the international [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=723.36s)]
*  criminal court having tried Petian, they will say war crimes have been committed by Russia quite [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=730.4s)]
*  correctly. That's a fact. But that they're allowing British soldiers to go and fight in a [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=734.72s)]
*  territory when a body there, a signature to the international criminal court has issued arrest [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=741.84s)]
*  for war crimes and crimes against humanity by Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence minister, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=746.4s)]
*  Yoeghal. I mean, what about Germany thoughts on that, that British soldiers are just freely, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=751.2s)]
*  so British citizens are freely able to go and to fight with the IDF with no legal repercussions. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=756.4s)]
*  Well, it is inherently a political question, perhaps it's not so necessary than a legal one [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=765.28s)]
*  for me. But I do think when there is evidence that these atrocities are ongoing, it is absolutely [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=769.44s)]
*  something that the government should be looking at, because you're absolutely right. If the [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=776.4s)]
*  evidence is there more broadly, and you have bodies like the UN and Antresca Albanese, as the UN [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=780.96s)]
*  special rapporteur, being a very outspoken voice for addressing the atrocities that have been [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=788.0s)]
*  committed when you have Amnesty International and Human Rights, what's talking about these [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=793.52s)]
*  ongoing atrocities, then is it really right that people go out there and join that fight? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=797.36s)]
*  If the answer is no, then it is perhaps something that does need to be looked at, but perhaps [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=805.4399999999999s)]
*  in the political sphere initially before any legal action is taken. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=810.8s)]
*  Just finally, what would you like to see in terms of the next steps? Because a lot of people [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=817.84s)]
*  listening might think this is just too good to be true, the idea that justice, accountability of [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=822.88s)]
*  any description will actually be served when it comes to anything to do with Israel and its [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=829.12s)]
*  treatment of the past of new people. People look at this and say, this is commendable, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=836.0s)]
*  it's raising awareness, that's important itself, that they will struggle to imagine waking up, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=842.96s)]
*  getting the news alert which says British citizens have been arrested with allegations that they [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=849.04s)]
*  created war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. So what would you say in terms of what [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=855.92s)]
*  you'd like to see next and how realistic is this, how possible is this, that there could be some [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=861.92s)]
*  justice and accountability in this country the way that you're fighting for? It really would be a [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=866.9599999999999s)]
*  watershed moment wouldn't it, if we woke up and the newspaper reports were such that the arrest [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=872.0s)]
*  warrant said either they'd been issued or people had been arrested. In terms of what I want to see, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=878.32s)]
*  I want to see the dossier taken seriously by the Met War Crimes team and I'm sure they will, I want [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=884.4000000000001s)]
*  to see them look at it, I want them to use the tools at their disposal, they're a police force [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=889.84s)]
*  and a unit set up specifically to address these kind of issues and so I want to see them conduct [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=894.72s)]
*  their own investigation using the tools at their disposal. The dossier we've provided we say is [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=900.6400000000001s)]
*  complex, we say it's compelling but it's compiled by a team of researchers and a small group of [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=906.16s)]
*  lawyers without the resources of the Met Police and without recourse perhaps to cooperation with [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=911.84s)]
*  other countries and other forces and so if they use the tools at their disposal they will hopefully [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=919.36s)]
*  expand on the research that we've done and see where the evidence leads them. If the evidence [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=925.04s)]
*  leads, and this is as a lawyer what it really comes down to, if the evidence leads [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=930.4s)]
*  to the conclusion that there are reasonable prospects of conviction at the end of this [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=935.44s)]
*  then there should be a arrest warrant. In terms of how hopeful I am for that, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=939.9200000000001s)]
*  it's evidence-led but what I can say is that we met preliminarily with the war crimes unit before [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=946.4000000000001s)]
*  the submission outside New Scotland Yard on Monday, so we met with them and that really was procedurally [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=953.2s)]
*  just to tee up the submission to let them know what was happening and to have discussions about [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=959.2s)]
*  next steps and they were completely open to that, supportive if I can say that, but certainly we [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=963.12s)]
*  weren't met by some obstructive state machinery which are the types that you might expect perhaps [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=971.2s)]
*  cynically and so every indication has been I think that they'll look at it, they'll take it seriously [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=977.92s)]
*  and we'll see where we end up with that. In terms of time frames I don't have them, it's a question [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=984.64s)]
*  for the Met Police, it will take some time, we accept that but hopefully in the fullness of time [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=988.56s)]
*  we'll see developments in this case. Fantastic stuff, that was so clear and you know I think [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=994.2399999999999s)]
*  this is a really really really important element and hopefully we'll have an impact [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=1001.76s)]
*  in terms of challenging the impunity, I mean this is the problem, impunity reigns in this area, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=1009.68s)]
*  the reason IDF soldiers often post their war queries is they think they can get away with anything [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=1015.12s)]
*  and we're eligible crimes such as into lawyer, but hopefully this in itself will have some impacts [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=1020.4s)]
*  there, this impunity is beginning to crumble, we've seen that of course with the arrest [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=1027.12s)]
*  by the International Criminal Court, it's such an important case. For those watching do share this [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=1031.2s)]
*  video, leave comments, press like, subscribe, all great because then more people will see this into [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=1035.52s)]
*  war. That's all I had to say, but Sean thanks so so much for joining us and everything cross [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=1040.72s)]
*  in terms of Hamlin's case process. You're very welcome, thank you again. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Foqx-RlPA&t=1045.28s)]
