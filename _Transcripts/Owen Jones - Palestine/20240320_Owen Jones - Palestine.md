# October 7th The Whole Story Finally Revealed
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [March 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfzw-sBVP2E)
*  October 7th. It's not the day that the clock started on what we often euphemistically call
*  the Israel-Palestine conflict, but it is the moment of course that the current horror began.
*  That was the day when Hamas and other armed groups broke through the fence separating Gaza and Israel,
*  committing atrocities which the Israeli state used to justify what many of us consider to be genocide
*  against the Palestinian people of Gaza, tens of thousands of Palestinians killed, including over
*  14,000 children, mass displacement of virtually the entire population, the mass destruction
*  of civilian infrastructure, the violent dismantling of the health system, growing famine,
*  we could go on. But what's true about that day itself and what's false? Now we're approaching
*  six months since that fateful morning and a really brilliant and important new documentary about
*  Algeria's investigations seeks to finally establish the truth, the whole truth and nothing
*  but the truth. Now I've watched it and it is chilling. It's a brilliant piece of journalism,
*  but it is chilling and it's chilling in part because of the atrocities which were committed
*  against unarmed and innocent Israeli civilians on the 7th of October. And it's chilling because
*  of the false claims which were used in order to justify the mass slaughter of the Palestinian
*  people in Gaza, which is ongoing. Now I'm going to interview the top journalist Richard Sanders,
*  who's done so much work, of course, on this crucial piece of investigative journalism.
*  A little note first, back in late November, I recorded a video which was posted on my YouTube
*  channel and on other platforms. Following a screening I watched hosted by the Israeli
*  Defence Forces in central London. It was a compilation of atrocities committed by Hamas
*  and other armed groups, real terrible atrocities. Now that video caused huge controversy to say the
*  least and indeed a firestorm of smears, lies and really disturbing false claims are what I'd
*  actually said, which appeared in multiple media outlets and all over social media.
*  What I made clear from the beginning was that Hamas had committed serious and grave war crimes
*  on the 7th of October, which I have seen too much evidence for with my own eyes, which nobody should
*  be any doubt about. I also said that in some cases the actions of the Israeli military were
*  responsible for some of those civilian casualties, but that the evidence was that overwhelmingly it
*  was Hamas militants responsible for the large majority of civilian deaths and that most of
*  those killed in 7th of October were civilians. And of course, civilians were also taken hostage
*  in large numbers. That itself is a grave war crime. I also said that notwithstanding the
*  terrible atrocities which were committed by Hamas militants, some of the most extreme claims,
*  which actually often received the most attention, which were then used to justify
*  the mass slaughter of the Palestinian people, the most notorious claim, but not the only such claim,
*  probably being the beheading of babies, were not justified by the evidence provided.
*  Let's just see a clip from the documentary related to that.
*  Hamas fighters and others committed crimes on October 7. The Israeli media, however,
*  focuses not on the crimes they committed, but on crimes they did not.
*  I'm talking to some of the soldiers and they say what they've witnessed as they've been walking
*  through these different houses, these different communities, babies, their heads cut off. That's
*  what they said. No one could expect that it would be like this. The horrors that I'm hearing from
*  these soldiers, as I mentioned earlier, about 40 babies at least were taken out on journeys.
*  The I-Unit's list of the dead shows no babies were killed in Kaffa Azar,
*  the kibbutz this report came from.
*  The story was nevertheless picked up by international media
*  and repeated by President Biden.
*  I've been doing this a long time. I never really thought that I would see and have confirmed
*  pictures of terrorists beheading children.
*  Now, what I would say, having watched this brilliant documentary, obviously with far,
*  far more work and evidence and skill clearly involved than what I spoke about in my video in
*  response to the IDF screening, what I said in that video is entirely justified by what Al Jazeera
*  has uncovered. I think I would say to those critics who did respond that they should watch
*  this documentary and they will see that what I said is entirely justified by the evidence.
*  Before I start the interview, my academic training was history and based on that,
*  I know it's so important we understand why events, however horrible happened,
*  what exactly happened in the events and what those events then led to.
*  It's often very difficult at the time to do that, not least when there's so much human suffering,
*  so much pain and raw emotion involved and when you have an ongoing conflict in which
*  propaganda seeks to erase truth and state actors and their allies seek to stifle
*  critical voices and to marshal evidence real or otherwise to support a military onslaught.
*  It's not important we try, it isn't easy, but this documentary I think really does come the
*  closest to knowing exactly what happened that day and as we see the mass slaughter of the
*  Palestinian people, we do need to know exactly what happened on that terrible day and which I've said
*  terrible war crimes were committed, which does not justify in any way the mass slaughter which has
*  since taken place any more than the atrocities against Hutus in Rwanda in the 1990s or in the
*  same decade against Serbs in Bosnia justified genocides there. Now let's go talk to the great
*  Richard Sanders. Richard, I watched it and yeah, I mean it was chilling, it was really very well put
*  together by the way, brilliant work as you would expect from you and your team and it was chilling
*  for lots and lots of different reasons. I just want to start because what you do is you look
*  in this and it's very well evidenced and sourced and it paints a very clear picture that
*  atrocities were committed on the 7th of October, but some of the more high profile or the most
*  high profile examples didn't actually happen and in fact I was quite struck by one of the
*  in the commentary when it was pointed out that actually there were crimes committed
*  but the media ended up focusing on crimes that weren't committed. So firstly I just want to ask
*  what's the purpose of doing this? Some would say well look why do we need to get bogged down in
*  this? Atrocities we know were committed, you say that in the film, war crimes were definitely
*  committed and you see them, I've seen them with my own eyes. What's the purpose
*  journalistically I suppose of saying this happened but this didn't happen, why is that important?
*  Because of everything that has happened since in the wake of October the 7th and as a result of
*  October the 7th the Israelis have launched this bombardment and subsequently a ground invasion of
*  the Gaza Strip which as you say has cost at this stage over 31,000 lives, almost half of them
*  children, is an appalling cost and so we need to get what happened on October the 7th right
*  because it's being used as justification for this and it will reverberate for decades to come as
*  well. Now if you look whenever the Israelis or their supporters in the west are challenged
*  about these appalling death tolls and so on, they talk about babies and they talk about rates.
*  It's used again and again to signify something that what happened on October the 7th was so
*  appalling that the people who committed it have effectively abdicated their right to expect to be
*  treated as human beings. There's a long tradition of this, you can go back to the way native
*  Americans were exterminated in the 19th century, the Indian mutiny as we still call it, the same
*  thing whereby the atrocities supposedly committed by those rising up are portrayed in the worst
*  possible light and it's always the same, it's always babies, it's always and rates, it's always
*  those two things and so it's not just nitpicking, it's not just saying normal people were killed in
*  this way, not that way. Those specific things were used and are used for a reason to justify
*  what has subsequently happened and therefore it's really important to put under the microscope
*  whether they did actually happen or not. So it was clear before we just discussed some of that, that
*  war crimes were committed by Hamas and other armed groups and individuals because actually there was
*  quite a lot of chaos, the fence came down and basically anyone who wanted to leave that fence
*  at that point could leave so it's actually not entirely clear often who were even talking about
*  or looking at. And I suppose, I mean we see for example at the music festival, the Nova music
*  festival which became I suppose the most striking horror of that day for lots of obvious reasons,
*  lots of generally younger people partying and then they're then suffering horrible violent deaths
*  and you do see clearly atrocities are committed. I mean just the fact for example
*  you know shooting at Port-au-Louse, you know that's good, they don't know who, you know I mean
*  or for example you know trying to hide in a bomb shelter and then throwing grenades in and so you
*  can see these atrocities, you can see them shooting at people in Kabut-Zim and it also
*  pays special attention to chaos, that you know they were kind of victims of their own success in that,
*  they didn't think they would be able to push in so far and they didn't seem to have a strategy so
*  they ended up in Kabut-Zim and it wasn't actually clear even what they're trying to do. So what did
*  we learn from that, the kind of approach you know that the actual war crimes that committed and what
*  that said about the kind of military strategy I suppose of that day? Yes I mean we focus quite
*  a bit on these bomb shelters along the main highway, all Israeli bus stops have a little
*  bomb shelter next to them in case there's a missile alert and it's actually very instructive that
*  story because what you have is people fleeing at the music festival take shelter in these bomb
*  shelters so that's about 100 people in all in the four bomb shelters. Now it's clear that the main
*  aim of the day is to take hostages, they want to overrun these military bases but that aside
*  the main aim of the day is to take hostages. Now you're right Hamas is clearly surprised by
*  their own success as everyone is, you know the collapse that the intelligence failure combined
*  with the collapse of the Israeli military is extraordinary, it is astonishing, unprecedented
*  which is what has given rise to one or two conspiracy theories about why that that should
*  have happened. But so they find themselves suddenly in this position where they have
*  huge numbers of civilians at their mercy and at that point they're rather taken by surprise,
*  at that point everything is going to depend on the caliber of the sort of low ground level military
*  leadership of Hamas and that's what they're clearly found wanting, it becomes chaotic,
*  they're not imposing discipline in fact as far as I can see they're joining in in the
*  committing of atrocities. So these four bomb shelters given that what they're fundamentally
*  trying to do is to get hostages this is a godsend to them, these people have effectively
*  handed themselves to them, these bomb shelters don't have doors on them, there they are they're
*  rounded up they can just take them out and take them and they don't, they just stand outside
*  lobbing hand grenades in and it's you know it goes on for longer than we show in the film,
*  it's appalling to watch and you can hear the screams of people inside, it's dreadful to watch
*  and it really is indicative of you know well of an entirely unacceptable way of behaving, you know
*  we're saying they didn't kill slaughter and mutilate babies, they didn't commit
*  widespread and systematic rape but they did some dreadful things and that's clearly true
*  but success exposed Hamas's limitations as a military movement. I mean yeah just I mean
*  in terms of on that I mean one of the things I did a video some might be aware in response to
*  saw the IDF screening of which compiled various horrors of the day of 7th of October
*  and one of the points I suppose I raised was in terms of just how disorderly it was
*  that you did have some evidence, so I heard for example Hamas militants, one of them yelling
*  at the Nova Festival save the bullets for the soldiers, so there was some attempt at demarcation
*  but with others there wasn't, I mean do you think that's reasonable, do you think some basically
*  their strategy was basically if we come across civilians we can use them as hostages and we're
*  going to kill soldiers, while others were just their perspective basically was civilians were
*  fair game as well and so it was kind of there wasn't just one clear approach there was lots
*  of different ones which varied depending on who the individual was really. I hadn't heard that
*  specifically and that would be interesting if that was the case, I think a lot certainly of the
*  kibbutz's your fate a lot depended on who the bloke was who walked in the front door you know
*  because it was chaotic. The fact of the matter is that young men with guns given a license to
*  commit violence tend to behave very badly, the norm is they're going to behave very badly,
*  they need to be constrained by good platoon level company level leadership and that was not there,
*  so I mean on the whole if you actually look at what they're doing the music festival is a wild
*  card, they clearly hadn't anticipated the music festival and there wasn't a plan for it and their
*  instinctive response seems to have been to simply shoot as many people as they could and what they're
*  doing and you can see this in the kibbutz's they enter into environments and shoot anything that
*  moves, plastic cars they shoot at, if they see somebody scuttling along a pathway they shoot at
*  them, they see a movement in a house they shoot at that person. Once they have people in their power
*  you know sort of helpless in front of them they generally take them hostage, not always
*  you know and I can certainly you know think of instances where people are helpless in front of
*  them and they kill them, so yes you're right to a degree it's left to the initiative of individuals
*  at that point but on the whole the prevailing ethos is extraordinarily cavalier towards
*  civilian life. I think it's a really important point to make and as I said having seen
*  much of the original footage, more footage of horror than I care really to have preferred to
*  have watched but yeah it's clear that's definitely what happened. Now there were certain claims made
*  that day which were false and I think we just need to just talk about that. Now one of the most I
*  think notorious example is beheaded babies and clearly that is going to have the most visceral
*  impact on people imaginable. The idea of beheading a baby is probably the most disturbed thing
*  anyone could probably think of. I don't think there's anything worse than that really is there.
*  So that was repeated by Joe Biden using the bully pulpit of the US presidency wasn't it, days after
*  it happened and it was you know clearly when the onslaught given within five days more Palestinians
*  had been killed than the Israelis killed on the 7th October it was used basically every time anyone
*  had any kind of qualms or problems with what was happening it would be well these people beheaded
*  babies. I mean that's clearly what happened. So just can we just talk about this question of
*  beheaded babies because to be clear 36 children died were killed on the 7th October which is bad
*  enough in its own terms. One baby was killed shot through a safe door but also a pregnant woman
*  was shot and had a cesarean and that unborn baby was killed as well. There were no beheaded babies
*  so can you just talk us through what the hell happened with that and what that claim meant really?
*  Yes I mean you can see why rumours perhaps are flying around people also are aware of the use
*  that can be made of these stories but almost immediately extraordinary stories start to be
*  told about babies and this is very simple in a way because we have the list of the dead we spent
*  a lot of time it's very complicated and difficult to do we spent a lot of time drawing up a very
*  comprehensive list of the dead and as you say there are two babies killed on October 7th appalling
*  a child eight month old child who dies when a bullet is fired through the door of a safe room
*  another baby who dies after an emergency cesarean but that's it there are no other babies those two
*  babies are not beheaded or burned or anything like that. Or put in an oven that was another one.
*  Yes that's right they're put in the oven so basically it's very simple whenever you hear
*  people talking about the large-scale murder of babies the mutilation of babies you know it's not
*  true okay you know it's not true and that's terribly important and that began to seep out
*  after a week or two I think an awareness began to seep into some parts of the press that some of
*  these stories weren't reliable I mean the 40 babies most of them beheaded was sort of discredited
*  pretty quickly. Now but that was terribly important because that should have established
*  a precedent whereby we thought well hang on if Israeli officials Israeli army officers and first
*  responders are telling us something we shouldn't take it on trust but in fact people did continue
*  to take things on trust and this has important implications for what in a way was the next
*  wave of atrocity stories after the babies which was rape and sexual violence. Before we come on
*  to that I mean another really striking well in fact let's talk about Zaka so Zaka just so people
*  are aware they're a kind of first responder Jewish kind of religious Jewish first responder service
*  they've been involved in quite a lot of scandal over the last decades involving serious allegations
*  of involving well financial scandal but also sexual abuse and their late that was their late
*  leader wasn't he who committed suicide. Now Zaka and people may have seen they did big press
*  conferences and addressed journalists with often blood curdling examples of horrors and atrocities
*  and the leader Yossi Landau you actually interviewed now we saw him give some performances
*  where he is overwhelmed apparently with emotion deeply affected by horrors unspeakable horrors
*  that he has seen including for example families where their hands and you know they're tied
*  with a family where they're tortured the eyes gauge out of the father before the killed the
*  fingers chopped off of the boy before you know and then they're tortured horribly like that and then
*  they're all killed and then they go and eat afterwards some some food that was then repeated
*  by Anthony Blinken the Secretary of State that didn't happen did it. No it's simply untrue and
*  again we know this because we can pick apart the we can look through the list of the dead and there's
*  simply no family that corresponds to that I mean you know 13 children under the age of 12 die on
*  October 7th two of them are actually killed by the Israelis so that that leaves 11 and you know so
*  you can look in detail at the circumstances of their deaths and none of them none of them die
*  in those circumstances so yes Zaka specifically Yossi Landau the southern commander of Zaka
*  the source of an awful lot of these stories early on and ultra-orthodox religious organization
*  through a rather strange arrangement the Israelis have whereby they farm out the sort of collection
*  of bodies which is partly to do with religious reasons to an organization like this so first of
*  all let's be fair to them they are amateurs they're volunteers they're not forensically trained
*  you know they they they were not equipped to be commenting on the state of the bodies they found
*  but nevertheless did and Zaka itself has eventually said well actually you know our volunteers are not
*  trained they're not trained in forensics why do they tell all these stories let's pick this apart
*  um first of all to be fair to them they're overwhelmed and they're traumatized they're
*  they're just not so they they you know they have seen dreadful things and they're traumatized
*  by it I think possibly sometimes they were confused by what they're looking at I mean
*  a body that has been violently killed particularly if rocket-propelled grenades are involved is a
*  dreadful sight and you you you the imagination can fill in all sorts of things having said that
*  a number of the stories simply um just have seemed to have no foundation in fact at all
*  and I think people can draw their own conclusions from that now why they're doing this we have in
*  the film um Netanyahu goes to visit them and he thanks them for talking to the press and for the
*  stories they're telling to the to the world's press and it's quite explicit he says you know
*  this is another front in the war we the the um the sort of information war is a part of the war he's
*  quite explicit about it well he says that you influence public opinion in the west and that
*  public opinion then has a pressure on the leaders of those in the west and we know from other quotes
*  Benjamin Netanyahu is actually very concerned about he expressed concerns apparently about
*  demonstrations protests in the west so he's very clear about the role of western public opinion
*  because the west arms and supports israel yeah so his point to them was actually you'll play
*  a key role because you're influencing public opinion and we need to keep public opinion on
*  our side and you do that by by by bigging up the stories by by doing rapes and doing babies and so
*  we actually filmed yossi doing a sort of talk to a group of female americans um who were visiting
*  israel and yes i mean he has he he has he goes through a routine he does and this was you know
*  this was filmed in january he was still telling all the same stories and you can see the impact
*  these women are putting their heads in their hands and you know um you can see the impact it has but
*  as you say this was also an organization organization in crisis um allegations of child
*  sexual abuse um financial crisis financial irregularities and it depends entirely on
*  voluntary contributions and um its financial problems have disappeared since october well i
*  noted the other day i uh noted that elon levy the israeli government spokesperson has been using
*  cameo uh which is um where people can record videos for fans and in exchange for money
*  um and he defended himself by pointing out that he was raising money for zacker um yeah and so
*  you know there's a whole bunch of reasons um i i think the people who are really culpable well
*  politicians regurgitated it's not surprising that israeli politicians regurgitated it's
*  disgraceful when western politicians start to just regurgitate this stuff without question but
*  they do and british politicians have a lot british politicians of both political parties
*  including david lamby shadow foreign secretary he's in the film yeah yeah and you know the and you
*  know again as i say every time you watch them every time the conversation is about a ceasefire
*  and and the scale of the civilian casualties they will talk about babies and they will talk about
*  every every single time now the media to a degree the media initially i mean you know you're you're
*  aside where clearly large numbers of people have been killed this is the poor fella who's had to
*  pick up the bodies why wouldn't you believe him you know if you know in normal circumstances you
*  would i think with the passage of time and particularly once the 40 baby story begun to
*  unravel greater skepticism should have kicked in and it didn't and and particularly again we'll
*  go on to this the sexual violence while skepticism began to kick in about beheaded babies it doesn't
*  seem to have kicked in about the sexual violence before we talk about sexual violence and there
*  was a story which was popularized by by zacker and you interview yassi yossi lander about this and
*  i'm slightly bemused about why he agreed to be interviewed given his performance here a hideous
*  story about a pregnant woman it is not the only questionable story that yossi landau tells about
*  we go further
*  then we see a woman she was lying on the floor a puddle of blood big puddle of blood
*  she was a pregnant woman
*  her stomach was butchered open
*  the baby that was connected to the court was stabbed and she was shot in the back
*  kibbutz berry has denied this account the story of the pregnant woman reported by zacker is not
*  relevant to berry and that story is believed to have happened the saverin shatiyah massacre
*  where the phalange a israel-backed paramilitary force conducted a hideous massacre for which ariel
*  sharon then in the israeli the idf then became israeli prime minister it was held
*  culpable for by an israeli commission um now there's no evidence for that happening is there and what
*  i found astonishing is he tried to show you a photo to prove it had happened but the photo
*  didn't prove anything of the sort yes i mean psychologically people more qualified than
*  myself would have to try and pick this apart um why he offered to show me a photo that he didn't have
*  your photo that he didn't have seems very strange i know there you go but but going back yes and that
*  horrific scene didn't didn't happen and reportedly supposedly did sabra and shatila i mean you know
*  this is perhaps a slightly controversial thing to say this but this is a thing palestinians would
*  say and i think there's some logic to this um if you actually listen to israeli descriptions of
*  what happens on october the 7th they're not actually describing what happened on october
*  they're describing what happened at sabra and shatila um sexual violence now obviously something
*  very difficult to talk about um now i thought a really brilliant interviewee was madeline reese
*  obe she's a british lawyer current secretary general of the women's international league for
*  peace and freedom i believe that there was right in every conflict whenever there are men with guns
*  intent on perpetrating violence it is highly unlikely there will not be sexual violence but
*  nothing that i've seen put forward so far suggests that it was widespread and systematic it's a very
*  high bar to actually reach we know war crimes and atrocities were committed on the 7th of october
*  and therefore you know it's so we're not saying this is not to say this did not happen that's not
*  the argument being made here at all there is the the argument was made about systematic rape that
*  was used as a strategy deliberate strategy by specifically hamas yeah so so with
*  rape and sexual violence yes so the basic point we're making in the film is that they you simply
*  cannot argue that it was widespread and systematic systematic is terribly important because the idea
*  is that it's deliberately instrumentalized by by hamas as a weapon of war and there simply isn't
*  the evidence for this as you say terribly important to say we're not saying there were no rapes at
*  all there may have been but but that it was widespread and systematic there simply isn't
*  the evidence for when you actually boil it down and the the un report that came out a little while
*  back essentially did this as well when you boil it down the that reporting the new york times the
*  bbc and the guardian who have all done big exposés investigations into this they all essentially rely
*  on israeli officials on army officials and on first responders okay we're in the same group of
*  problematic witnesses who were discredited by the by the baby stuff okay so you have to put that
*  aside and then look at the solid evidence so let's come back to firstly the visual evidence you know
*  i've watched almost seven hours of footage from october the seventh and there is nothing in it
*  that would indicate that there are no instances of sexual violence in the footage i have witnessed
*  you then have huge numbers of post-mortem videos and photos which again i mean you would see women
*  who have blood on their trousers and so on i mean you know that that really isn't evidence so the
*  the one image that i took particularly seriously was an image of a young woman who who was
*  photographed her body was photographed she's lying next to her car which is next to the main
*  highway about nine miles north of the festival side the music festival site it's a particularly
*  tragic death she they'd clearly left the music festival very early her and her husband and
*  they'd almost made it you know they she dies at about just before seven i think and had they got
*  there a minute earlier they they they run straight into the very first hamas fighters arriving
*  that kibbutz there now basically her the the footage of her body it's clear she's she's not
*  wearing underwear and that's what seems significant there the new york times made it the centerpiece
*  of their story is that they have a picture of the family and about a third of the article relates
*  to this and almost immediately afterwards the sister came out on instagram and said no she
*  wasn't raped we know she wasn't raped and basically she was in touch with the family she texted just a
*  few minutes before she died and there was no mention of rape at that point in fact at that
*  point you know they they weren't in trouble at that point they were hoping to to get out of there
*  then after she shot the husband is on the phone to his brother and i think he's on the phone for 44
*  minutes and again no mention of rape so you know i think it's pretty clear that that which was the
*  most compelling visual evidence there was was not evidence that that that was not the case now if
*  we take that un report from a couple of weeks ago it talks a lot about young women tied to
*  trees or to posts with the the lower part of their clothing removed now that certainly would you know
*  be indicative that something disturbing might happen but again i've just not seen any images
*  as far as i can see there are no images to support this um the sexual mutilation of bodies i've seen
*  no images to support this again it was interesting that un report a couple of weeks ago said that
*  there's nothing to support the idea that there is a pattern of the sexual mutilation of bodies so
*  you know and and there's a problem that there are so few witnesses there's no there's no forensics
*  at all that might be the chaos of the day it's startling how few witnesses there are the music
*  festival is an open site thousands of people survive the massacre at the the music festival
*  and to have effectively two witnesses i mean one or two others have spoken to journalists or
*  individual journalists but to effectively only have two witnesses is strange i mean i know
*  people are traumatized sometimes people don't speak for some time sometimes years afterwards
*  i understand all of that but it's odd you would think there would be more than two witnesses coming
*  forward the fact that there are there are no victims of course at all again that may be because
*  they're you know they were killed um but the the paucity the lack of witnesses is strange
*  before i just finally ask about in terms of those killed by um by the israeli military we'll just
*  talk about that i mean the point made by my near namesake marco jones who's a academic researcher
*  who i've interviewed myself um is you know why these stories and the point he made which i
*  thought was very astute was if the israeli state is killing far far far far more palestinians which
*  it has i mean both in absolute numbers and proportionately the number of october 7th
*  is that gaza has now suffered is obviously huge so then a distinction has to be made
*  we might be killing more but their killings are depraved that's what makes it that's why we're
*  morally superior so we retain moral superiority even though there's far more oh so you know over
*  14 000 palestinian children have been killed and that point you made about the set you know if we
*  talk about that baby being shot through the safe uh the door of a safe room horrible that's not
*  morally different is it from israel they could go well we're not delivering we're not trying to kill
*  palestinian kids well i mean if you if you're if you're just carpet bombing a gaza you're
*  going to do that aren't you as we've seen but that's the point isn't it is to go well actually
*  they intentionally killed babies and children in a sadistic fashion because they are they you know
*  they're and that's and that's they're they're animals and that's why that justifies what we're
*  doing and that's why we're morally superior that's the point it dehumanizes there's a sort of specific
*  switch in the brain once people have become savages which is the word marco rubio actually
*  uses in our film then they can't expect the same treatment and we emotionally feel differently
*  about their deaths once once you have people have moved into the category of savage savages and
*  barbarians then then um it matters less and that's why specifically there is such a focus on these
*  depraved crimes of rape and babies finally in terms of um we the what there's a bit just there's a lot
*  of discussion about the Hannibal directive and which for those who don't know because an israeli
*  soldier was taken hostage a long time ago by Hamas kept for years and huge numbers of palestinian
*  prisoners were released as a consequence with seeming humiliation so then the argument was well
*  if they try and keep take a soldier hostage it's better that that they're killed rather than taking
*  captive and the question is whether that was then applied to the question of civilian hostages on
*  that day and you interview various military analysts who are actually disturbed by the
*  footage of helicopters firing um on you know without knowing what the targets are so we just
*  talked through i mean at the festival what what do we know at the festival about that well i think
*  the Hannibal directive if it applies it's to do with apache helicopters and it's also within the
*  kibbutz's i mean there's you always get these strange things going on on on social media there
*  was one particular post which pointed people towards the festival as the site of um the sort
*  of friendly fire deaths and actually i'm not really seeing um evidence there i think i think
*  it would be else elsewhere but basically what you have is the Hannibal directive actually goes all
*  the way back to the 80s and as you say the it was a view that you know better you kill everyone
*  than let somebody be taken back as as hostage because then they've got us you know they can
*  use it as a bargaining chip and so on it was supposedly rescinded a few years ago but the
*  reporting specifically from the israeli newspaper um was that it was it was revived on october the
*  7th specifically at midday a version of the Hannibal directive was issued now the israeli
*  army has not denied this it certainly hasn't confirmed it but has not denied this and the
*  the visual evidence would seem to us to support it so two aspects to this firstly the apache
*  helicopters the israelis released enormous quantities of gun camera footage and you can
*  just look at it they you look at the footage and particularly when they're shooting vehicles they
*  can't possibly know who they're shooting and we you know we geolocated a lot of this imagery
*  and you know a lot of these cars and people are moving west they're heading towards the gaza
*  strip they're coming from the settlements so you know they can't possibly have known that these
*  these cars and these groups of people didn't include hostages now we know from an eyewitness
*  there is certainly one person who was killed by a helicopter we think the number is quite a bit
*  higher than that and here in analyzing deaths you run into the problems of the complete chaos and
*  also the amateurishness of zaka that the work the proper work of documenting where bodies were found
*  what state they were founded and so on was not simply wasn't done so we're always struggling a
*  little bit here but we have identified 27 people who were clearly taken hostage taken away from
*  their homes and but were dead before they got to the fence and we simply don't know how they died
*  i think there's a fair chance that a number of them were killed by apache helicopters we wouldn't
*  know about it because they're dead and everyone who was with them was dead very interesting thing
*  yossi landau told me it's not in the film list but um zaka were asked to collect the palestinian
*  bodies as well which they did and after a while 21 of them were sent back they they said now hang
*  on these aren't palestinians these are israelis which begs the question of why they were mistaken
*  for israelis in the first place and logic would say it's because they were found in the open country
*  towards the fence surrounded by other palestinians logic would suggest there so i'm i'm very much
*  back you know this is very much a guess probably somewhere in the 20s you know teens 20s people
*  killed by apache helicopters but quite important that because you also you do see stuff on social
*  media that the majority of people were killed um yeah that wasn't the case which is you know
*  there's just no evidence for that whatsoever you're then coming into the kibbutzis where ground
*  troops also appear to have been extremely aggressive in the way they retook kibbutz like
*  berri and kafar azar i mean it's actually very interesting you watch the raw footage of journalists
*  being shown around these kibbutz seem in the days afterwards and a lot of them are saying
*  you can sort of hear them chatting to their sort of military minders and so on saying
*  hang on that house is completely destroyed well you know because the hamas come across the border
*  with side arms and and with rocket propelled grenades they also burn houses you know so that's
*  that's quite important you because they're trying to smoke people out of their safe rooms so you see
*  a house destroyed by fire that quite possibly is hamas but a lot of those houses and we showed this
*  in the film are clearly simply destroyed by heavy heavy weaponry so that's when you see from the top
*  like their roofs are missing and all the rest of it that's from well that can be damage that can be
*  fire damage and i don't think the apache helicopters were firing within the kibbutzis it's
*  we're dealing with it on the whole i don't think they were anyway it's tanks i mean the incident
*  we we tell at berri where there are 12 people who were pretty clearly killed by the israeli forces
*  when they retake this house which actually is interesting because it's the house that
*  senior officials and yossi lander then talk about as having been full of babies or children
*  and in fact not only only was it not full of babies or children in fact the people there
*  um were killed by the israeli military there are six others we've identified who are are clearly
*  killed by the israeli forces as they come in again i suspect the real figure may be higher
*  and you often see pictures of people who are being sort of dug out from the the rubble um and we just
*  don't know how they died obviously they were they were they were dead once the house fell on them
*  whether they were dead already we we just don't know so again i you know i think we've got a figure
*  of 18 killed by ground troops i suspect it'll be rather higher but again not as high as some of the
*  speculation you see no a large majority of those killed including the civilians were killed not
*  they were killed by hamas or other armed groups yes by hamas and others who came through the fence
*  you know at the very least 90 percent of the people who are killed of the civilians who are killed
*  are killed by hamas and others at the very least 90 i think that's important to say just because
*  i think often when i post about this people do suggest i just see the comments people say
*  say it's a lot higher um i think it's important there isn't the evidence for that and even if we
*  start to include those deaths where it's questionable and so on you you you you still
*  don't get into anything like the sort of numbers some people are talking about just finally then i
*  mean as we we've seen now the horror unleashed against gaza and and i mean we don't actually
*  know the actual death toll because we have the official death toll which doesn't include those
*  thousands buried under the rubble and there are also people think you can just pluck out of random
*  someone with cancer who's not getting medical care i mean it's just endless and the these one
*  projection is that in terms of excess deaths if for example rafa is invaded um then by august over
*  five percent of gaza's population will have been killed so we're talking about uh truly i mean just
*  by historic standards that's a that's one of the great killings killings about killing to be about
*  time um 7th of october as we've established atrocities were clearly committed and that's
*  that's absolutely true um but these equally false claims were made in order to justify what happened
*  next that's that's clearly what happened do you think we'll ever have a proper understanding of
*  what happened on 7th of october or do you think i think we're fairly fairly close to it i mean
*  you'll never have an absolutely definitive totting up of the bodies and so on and i think this is
*  a huge frustration for the relatives of those who died and there's a those 27 people for example
*  we identify i think their families are enormously frustrated as well by the fact that they don't
*  know what happened and it's very distressing for them so i think you know the the inadequacy of
*  zakka and also the fact that it was overwhelmed and the fact that bodies were not properly collected
*  and registered and so on means we'll never have a precise reckoning but i think we in our film i
*  think we've got a you know a fairly good broad reckoning of what happened yeah and it comes
*  across i should be clear that's very clear that comes across like that yeah yeah and it's appalling
*  it's appalling what happened um but you know as i say some of the things that are claimed didn't
*  happen it's quite important because those those are the things that are used to justify what then
*  happens subsequently well it's a brilliant piece of journalistic work and again also you know my
*  training was as historian and it is important that we understand actually what happens for our
*  history and and this is i think a crucial contribution to what will be you know the
*  the picture of what happened that day and what's happened since so the link for that is in the
*  video description so make sure you watch it and you share it and please like this video and subscribe
*  to share the video but richard thank you so so much brilliant thank you very much
