# Israeli Activists Destroy Gaza Aid - And Israeli Authorities Do Nothing
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zcx_a83uvmw)
*  Israel is deliberately starving Gaza to death.
*  This is no baseless conspiracy theory.
*  Israel promised to do this openly from the very start, with the Defence Minister, Yov
*  Galan, publicly declaring on the 9th of October that the essentials of life, including food
*  and energy, would be blocked from entering Gaza on the grounds that Israel was fighting
*  human animals.
*  With the Israeli Army Coordinator of COGATS, the agency charged with overseeing Israeli
*  operations in the occupied territories, subsequently clarifying, for those naive enough to believe
*  otherwise or disingenuous, that by human animals Israel meant the civilian population of Gaza.
*  Now there are many ways that the Israeli state has starved the Palestinian people in Gaza,
*  resulting in the fastest decline in the nutritional status of a population in recorded history.
*  What one means is allowing right-wing extremists to block and attack, in this case, Jordanian
*  aid trucks from entering Gaza.
*  So deliberately standing back while aid trucks meant for those starving to death, deprived
*  of the basics of life in Gaza, blocking that from getting in, with no intervention from
*  the state.
*  Now in footage which was recorded and placed online, you can see these extremists blocking
*  aid trucks, with Israeli authorities doing nothing, and throwing out their contents and
*  destroying their contents.
*  Let's have a look.
*  Indeed, footage shows them attacking trucks attempting to bring food into Gaza.
*  They specifically destroyed bags of flour on aid trucks headed into Gaza.
*  Now as the courageous Israeli human rights organisation, Betzlen, put it, this happened
*  in the presence of Israeli forces who didn't intervene.
*  This flies in the face of the ICJ, that's the International Court of Justice, that issued
*  provisional measures to force Israel to enable humanitarian assistance.
*  Furthermore today, Israeli extremists set fire to humanitarian aid coming in from Jordan.
*  Now a crucial point, these aren't just some random right-wing extremists.
*  They have behaved like this for months, repeatedly and successfully, blocking aid all under the
*  watchful gaze of the Israeli authorities.
*  For those who believe the Israeli authorities are a soft touch, who aren't fond of brutally
*  dispersing those they deem to be a problem, or indeed arresting or killing them, well
*  where to begin?
*  It's not just of course their sort of Palestinians in the West Bank, where around 500 Palestinians
*  have been killed by Israeli security forces and settlers, many of them children, since
*  the 7th of October.
*  In Tel Aviv, Israeli police have brutally smashed protests by Jewish Israeli citizens
*  who were protesting against Benjamin Netanyahu's regime, using water cannon and arresting
*  protesters.
*  Indeed there has been police brutality against the relatives of Israeli hostages.
*  Now according to the testimonies of two courageous Israeli women who tried to stop the thugs
*  from attacking the A-trucks, which we saw earlier, and thanks here to the translation
*  of a brilliant Israeli Jewish leftist activist who posts anonymously under the Twitter handle
*  at I really hate you, great name, do check him out, but this is what they said, there
*  were very few security forces and police on the scene who did nothing to stop the destruction
*  that stood aside.
*  Now one of these settlers physically attacked one of these women, a police officer refused
*  to detain him and he returned to the destruction.
*  They said these two women, the police, did not call for additional forces or try to block
*  arrival of those they describe as the criminals, including armed settlers.
*  They say in all that time we did not see a single arrest and all that was done was the
*  useless removal of a few who immediately returned to continue.
*  Now in this particular case, it's important to note when we're talking about this, the
*  provisional orders mentioned by Betsalem issued in January this year.
*  So the International Court of Justice ordered the Israeli state to, and I quote, take immediate
*  and effective measures to enable the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian
*  aid in order to prevent genocide from taking place.
*  Now at the end of March, the ICJ issued a subsequent provisional order ordering Israel
*  to increase the provision of basic humanitarian goods to Gaza, including food, water, fuel,
*  shelter, adding the catastrophic living conditions of the Palestinians in Gaza Strip has deteriorated
*  further in particular in view of the prolonged and widespread deprivation of food and other
*  basic necessities to which the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have been subjected, adding
*  Palestinians in Gaza are no longer facing only a risk of famine, but that famine is
*  setting in.
*  Now, if Israel was truly interested in avoiding genocide or indeed being found guilty of the
*  charge of genocide, that's as grievous a charge as it gets.
*  Let alone interested in preserving the lives of Palestinians, it would look upon this blocking
*  of aid as the gravest of crimes and clamp down on those responsible, arresting them
*  on mass, charging and convicting them and making it clear from the bully pulpit, for
*  example, of the prime minister's office that there would be no tolerance for these
*  criminals.
*  Yet after months of these deliberate attempts to starve the people of Gaza, few have been
*  arrested while the authorities have stood back, as in this case, for hours while these
*  attacks have taken place.
*  In practical terms, the authorities have allowed these so-called protesters, in practical terms,
*  genocidal maniacs to block life-saving aid from entering Gaza.
*  Indeed, back in March, Israeli police blocked a humanitarian aid convoy organised by Standing
*  Together, a peace movement bringing together Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel.
*  Now, these are examples of courageous activists because they're isolated.
*  Israel has become awash with genocidal mania.
*  Polling consistently finds that a large majority of Israeli Jewish civilians, as opposed to
*  20% of the population who are Palestinian citizens of Israel, oppose any humanitarian
*  aid being allowed into Gaza.
*  In practice, that means genocide.
*  Of course it does.
*  You block all the necessities of life from entering a besieged strip, they're all going
*  to die.
*  That's genocide.
*  Now, I'm not quoting these polling figures to argue for collective guilt and punishment,
*  by the way, as those supporting the genocide of the longsword against Gaza do.
*  It's simply to be realistic about the current dynamics of Israeli public opinion.
*  To make it clear, the extremists that we've been looking at are not isolated.
*  To make the case for why we need external pressure on Israel, just as we did in the
*  case of apartheid South Africa, when most warlike South Africans were invested in supporting
*  apartheid for a very long time.
*  Now, famine stalks Gaza.
*  Oxfam state that in northern Gaza, people are being forced to live on less than 12%
*  of the recommended daily intake of calories.
*  Indeed, last month, Betsalem issued a report entitled, Manufacturing Famine, Israel is committing
*  the war crime of starvation in the Gaza Strip, not pulling punches there.
*  The report begins by noting the Israeli airstrike on a World Central Kitchen convoy in early
*  April, in which several foreign aid workers were killed, which led to the suspension of
*  the work of multiple foreign aid agencies in Gaza, which those who attacked that aid
*  convoy would have been fully aware would have been the consequences.
*  Describes this report how for months Israel refused to let humanitarian aid in through
*  the land crossings in Israel's territory, limiting what aid could enter, that when through
*  international pressure, Israel did allow aid through its territory, the, and I quote, the
*  amounts were far cry from the needs of the population.
*  While Israel deliberately repeatedly lied to the world that there was no serious nutritional
*  crisis in Gaza in an attempt, of course, to prevent action from being taken to prevent
*  famine.
*  The report looks at how the integrated food security phase classification, classed by
*  March, almost the entire population of Gaza is experiencing phase three level food insecurity
*  or worse, with half a million at the highest level of food insecurity possible.
*  Now the how here is important.
*  That includes how domestic food production and agriculture has been destroyed by incessant
*  bombing following years of blockade.
*  While huge numbers displaced from homes have little or no access to running water or to
*  supplies and provisions needed for cooking.
*  There's all elements which need to be discussed as well as the fact that so little aid is
*  coming in or is able to be distributed in Gaza for multiple reasons.
*  But the fact is you have to combine that with the effects of mass displacement and the destruction
*  of food production and agriculture.
*  How aid trucks go through a lengthy, arduous process is discussed by Betson's report until
*  they reach their destination, as well as how most aid supplies transported from Egypt to
*  Gaza in trucks via one of only two crossings, both in the southern Gaza Strip, with access
*  to crossings made difficult and time consuming with many stops on the way, many searches
*  on the way, with the trucks cargo checked multiple times, causing major delays.
*  Only a fraction of the aid reaches northern Gaza due to restrictions imposed by Israel
*  and of course severe damage to infrastructure.
*  There's another element not discussed in the report about, for example, the targeting of
*  police forces, police officers in Gaza by the Israeli states who were there to look
*  after security for those aid trucks, which is obviously needed when you have a desperately
*  starving population.
*  Even the Biden administration has protested over that.
*  The report looks at how Israel, and this is crucial, waged a war against UNRWA with a
*  smear campaign based on no evidence.
*  The main humanitarian agency in Gaza is UNRWA and the report looks at how Palestinians have
*  been massacred while trying to get food.
*  That obviously has an impact in terms of deterrence for people trying to access food.
*  But since the report has been a very specific escalation, Israel has seized control of the
*  Rafa crossing, which is the primary route for aid getting into Gaza and has escalated
*  its attacks on Rafa, where most Gazans have fled after being ordered to flee on the basis
*  they would be safe there.
*  That has further blocked whatever limited aid was getting into Gaza in the first place.
*  For the past week, no food has entered the two main crossings in southern Gaza, including
*  the Rafa crossing.
*  What we're discussing here is a genocidal campaign being waged by Israel against the
*  Palestinian people in Gaza.
*  Famine is one of the main elements, of course.
*  The attempt to starve the population as well as deprive them of other essentials of life,
*  which are needed to sustain human life.
*  And there are other elements, of course, like the destruction of the medical system, the
*  mass destruction of hospitals, the mass slaughter of medics, as well as mass displacement, as
*  well as, of course, the mass bombardment that we see.
*  These are all different elements of a genocidal campaign, which has clearly set out in accordance
*  to what Israeli leaders and officials said they were going to do from the start, exact
*  collective punishment against the people of Gaza on the basis that the Israeli state clearly
*  does not want the Palestinian people to remain within Gaza.
*  So mass slaughter, mass displacement, all key elements.
*  And of course, this is the basis of their genocidal campaign.
*  Allowing these right-wing extremists, who I'm afraid are not marginal in Israeli society,
*  to blockade is just one means of this attack.
*  There are multi-pronged assaults, if you like, for example, on the distribution of food.
*  We need to speak out about this because the Israeli state and its allies are lying.
*  And despite the hand-wrigging of the Western states, who have facilitated this from the
*  very start, their complicity is clear to the whole world, as well as those of media outlets
*  across the West who have cheered this on, legitimized it and whitewashed the reality.
*  We're not going to whitewash the reality and we're going to keep speaking out.
