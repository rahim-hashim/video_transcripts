Video Description: We're often asked: "Which country on earth would tolerate rockets being fired at them like Israel?"

We rarely hear asked: "Which people on earth would tolerate siege, decades of brutal occupation and illegal settlements?"

I said this in 2012 but it's as true now as it ever was.

# The truth about Palestine
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 19, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIcHB4ih1Xc)
*  Now he's often said, and Barack Obama made this point, he said what country on earth would tolerate rockets being fired at them?
*  I ask you this, what people on earth would tolerate a siege which stops basic supplies getting in,
*  an occupation, a 45 year old occupation, a brutal occupation at that,
*  illegal settlements all over the West Bank which are in total violation of international law,
*  and what we've seen in the course of this onslaught are the deaths of 158 Palestinians,
*  at least 30 of Hema children. Now we all want a secure and lasting peace when we have Israeli
*  ministers like the interior minister calling for Gaza to be sent back to the middle ages,
*  when in the last offensive we had another minister calling for a Holocaust to be afflicted on Gaza,
*  when we have the son of Ariel Sharon who wrote in the Jerusalem Post talking about how Nagasaki
*  and Hiroshima were solutions, possible solutions to be inflicted, when we have those people we
*  won't get a secure peace but the way we will get it for Arabs and Jews alike to end the occupation,
*  end the siege of Gaza, and dismantle the illegal settlements and finally have a just settlement
*  for the Palestinian people ensuring peaceful Arabs and Jews and the region as a whole.
