# Is Trump's Victory Inevitable Given Biden's Gaza Disgrace? - w/. Waleed Shahid
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [February 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q)
*  Now, whatever you think about the military onslaught being waged against the people of Gaza by the Israeli state, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=0.0s)]
*  there's no question that it would not be possible without the support of the United States of America, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=5.12s)]
*  the last global superpower, of course, and the key protector, defender, armor of Israel. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  Without the arms, diplomatic support, political support, aid that the US offers, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=18.72s)]
*  none of this would be possible. That's a straightforward fact. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=25.44s)]
*  You don't have to agree or disagree with me about Gaza. That's a fact. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=28.0s)]
*  So it's really important, actually, that I speak to a brilliant guest, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=32.32s)]
*  Waleed Shaheed, who is a progressive strategist, the former spokesperson of the Justice Democrats, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  who played such a fundamental role in helping to build the new generation of progressive Democrats. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=42.08s)]
*  We can see them, of course, with the squad in the Congress, but also politicians across the United States. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=48.24s)]
*  I think that gives us a lot of hope for the future of progressive politics in the US. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=53.52s)]
*  Waleed has played a pivotal role in all of that. So a key person to speak to. How are you doing? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=60.400000000000006s)]
*  I'm good. Thanks for having me on. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=65.12s)]
*  Okay. Let's just start, shall we, in terms of Joe Biden? Because I'll just start with a big question. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=67.92s)]
*  Is he buggered? Has he destroyed his presidency? I mean, he's someone he probably could have got away [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=72.88s)]
*  with by the standards of most US presidents. Probably could have got away with looking [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=77.92s)]
*  relatively ineffective. Particularly given, I suppose, the expectations maybe a lot of people [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=82.72s)]
*  on the left had about him. You know, things like Widri from Afghanistan didn't launch any major war [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=87.84s)]
*  that slaughtered huge numbers of people. So he didn't have the kind of LBJ problem of doing [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=93.36s)]
*  some kind of relatively progressive legislation at home, but then just destroying Southeast Asia. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=98.32s)]
*  That came to a pretty abrupt end, that particular hope, with his support of his [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  role as President of the United States. So basically, has he nuked any chance of winning [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=109.92s)]
*  the presidential election? Does that mean Donald Trump's going to become president? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=114.0s)]
*  I think right now all signs point to Donald Trump winning the general election, but American [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=117.6s)]
*  elections can change very quickly. And so who knows what happens when we get to October? A majority [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=122.48s)]
*  of American voters right now say they don't believe Joe Biden or Donald Trump will be on the ticket [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=128.8s)]
*  when it comes to the actual election. So that's a significant number, but you're right that there [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=134.24s)]
*  was actually a lot of goodwill, a fair amount of goodwill between President Biden and younger voters, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  progressive voters and working class voters because of things like the withdrawal of troops [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=145.28s)]
*  from Afghanistan, some student debt pauses, the Inflation Reduction Act, which is the most [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=152.0s)]
*  significant climate investment in U.S. history and global history. And through that, he was [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=159.12s)]
*  able to represent the majority of the Democratic base and majority of the kinds of voters who were [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=166.4s)]
*  most skeptical of him. And then the war in Gaza started and the U.S., in many significant ways, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=172.56s)]
*  Biden has broken partially or fully from the failed conventional wisdom of the Clinton, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=180.56s)]
*  Obama wings of the Democratic Party. But on Israel, he's frankly doubled down on a set of [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=186.88s)]
*  failed policies. And when there's no good faith negotiating partner on the other side, meaning [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=193.2s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu has in his own self-interest the reelection of Donald Trump so he can [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=200.88s)]
*  get away with even more gross violations. So currently it does look like Donald Trump will [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=208.24s)]
*  win the general election. And I remember even many people in your country, Owen, were very much [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=215.04s)]
*  jealous that we had Joe Biden and not Keir Starmer. And I remember that people were much more [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=221.04s)]
*  happy with Joe Biden than the Labor Party leader. And so- [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=226.48s)]
*  We desperately. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=229.28s)]
*  We desperately. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=230.39999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. But things have changed a lot in the last three months and he's bled a lot of support from [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=231.2s)]
*  young people. And then the key constituency, it's this weird fact of American geography with our [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=237.6s)]
*  electoral college that the largest community of Arab Americans happens to be in Michigan, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=244.8s)]
*  which is a swing state that's very difficult for a Democratic president to win without that state. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=249.44s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, obviously people are very angry. Those who obviously passionately oppose what's [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=255.76000000000002s)]
*  happened to Gaza with Keir Starmer. But of course, Joe Biden is the president of the world's remaining [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  superpower and now is called often genocide Joe, I suppose. So I take your point. I mean, just in [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=264.48s)]
*  terms of, because we often in the US and British context, but in the US we talk about the most [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=271.76s)]
*  progressive generation ever. The polling amongst younger voters for Joe Biden is bad, isn't it? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=277.36s)]
*  I mean, it's terrible. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=282.96s)]
*  Yeah. I think something like in Michigan, it seemed like younger, there's some poll that [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=285.84s)]
*  showed that younger voters, so voters under the age of 30, equally split between Biden and a [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=292.64s)]
*  potential third party candidate, meaning either Robert Kennedy or Cornel West. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=299.2s)]
*  Those are abysmal numbers for a Democratic candidate who's the president going for reelection. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=303.76s)]
*  I mean, there's been a generational divide in the Democratic party for a long time over issues from [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=310.48s)]
*  healthcare to climate to reproductive rights. And now we're seeing it spill over to questions of war [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=314.8s)]
*  and foreign policy. This is a generation, as you know, that grew up with wars on terrors in [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=319.36s)]
*  Afghanistan and Iraq that failed. And I think this generation is just skeptical of what the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=326.08s)]
*  administration says that terrorism can only be rooted out through more war and more terror and [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=332.08s)]
*  more bombs. They've seen that fail twice already in our lifetime. And I think want, think that [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=338.0s)]
*  there's probably a diplomatic and political solution to the question of Hamas, the question of [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=343.84s)]
*  Palestinian human rights and do not support US funding for this war. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=349.36s)]
*  Again, it was already going to be difficult given the president's age, given the skyrocketing cost [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=354.79999999999995s)]
*  of living in the US, like for many, that affects young people a lot who, especially those who haven't [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=360.64s)]
*  attended college, those in the service sector, grocery bills, rent, healthcare. And then on top [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=366.96s)]
*  of that, you see that the president is funding a war overseas. I think it all is a recipe for [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=373.91999999999996s)]
*  disaster when it comes to the general election. Yeah, I mean, just talking about kind of, I guess, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=378.64s)]
*  you know, Michigan's coming up. Can you just tell us a little bit about what that means and what [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=387.76s)]
*  that represents to signify? Because Michigan traditionally is a kind of bellwether state, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=391.36s)]
*  isn't it? And its demographics have changed. You've had traditionally blue collar white Americans who [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=395.03999999999996s)]
*  live there. There's a growing Muslim population in Michigan. You've seen quite a lot of racist [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=400.08s)]
*  portrayals, I have to say, of its voters in US newspapers. So what's the kind of situation there? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=404.96s)]
*  Yeah, Michigan is part of what we call the blue wall. It's largely one of the largest union [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=410.56s)]
*  countries, union states in the country. The United Auto Workers, most of their members are in Michigan. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=419.52s)]
*  If you think of things like GM and Chrysler and Ford, those are all, those factories are largely [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=425.35999999999996s)]
*  based in Michigan. And used to be a completely democratic state until 2016 when Trump famously [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=431.68s)]
*  beat Hillary Clinton with 10,000 votes and a majority of union households. And so Michigan is [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=439.76s)]
*  also where many Lebanese and Palestinian Americans migrated to due to war and occupation in their [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=446.24s)]
*  home countries. And there's this kind of, I don't know if you would call it poetic justice or poetic [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=454.32s)]
*  injustice that these same new Americans, that these migrants who've become citizens, become voters, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=458.96s)]
*  become members of the Democratic Party may decide the fate of President Biden and may decide the [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=464.71999999999997s)]
*  fate of American democracy come November. Next week on February 27th is the Democratic primary [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=469.35999999999996s)]
*  in Michigan in which there's a centrist candidate, Dean Phillips, running who has no chance. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=476.56s)]
*  Marianne Williamson dropped out. Michigan is one of a handful of states that has a none of the above [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=482.24s)]
*  option. It's called uncommitted. So the primary will have Dean Phillips, Joe Biden, and then an [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=486.88s)]
*  option that says uncommitted. There's a major effort underway in Michigan led by the Arab American [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=491.44s)]
*  community there to get voters to vote uncommitted to show that the anti-war constituency in the [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=498.08s)]
*  Democratic Party could hold the margin of victory for President Biden come November. And so 10,000 [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=505.44s)]
*  votes is all they need to show that this is a constituency that's uncommitted to Joe Biden [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=513.52s)]
*  unless he stops funding the war in Gaza. And it's been supported by elected officials like [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=518.0s)]
*  Rashida Tlaib, the mayor of Dearborn, Abdullah Hamoud, who has a New York Times op-ed out today [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=524.96s)]
*  about some of this stuff, the majority leader in the Michigan state house, Abraham Ayush. And so [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=530.56s)]
*  it's like a pretty significant effort. This is a generation that is very well organized politically [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=539.04s)]
*  and is like a core constituency of both the labor movement and the Democratic Party. And so [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=546.4s)]
*  they're taking this battle into the into the Democratic primary. And it's been controversial. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=552.0799999999999s)]
*  Like if you turn on TV in the past couple days, you're just filled with talking heads and pundits [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=557.36s)]
*  being like these stupid people from Michigan are going to throw that are damaging the president's [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=562.24s)]
*  reputation before November. They're going to cause Donald Trump to win. I think it's a very [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=567.76s)]
*  substantive campaign using the levers of democracy to get to put pressure on the administration. But [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=573.92s)]
*  you know, many people in this country just see things as red versus blue, Trump versus Biden. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=578.4s)]
*  And we'll see what happens on February 27th. Something which I thought was very striking, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=583.6s)]
*  and it gave me quite a wide smile. I can't remember which USG spoke, so I read it in, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=590.88s)]
*  but it had a kind of democratic source talking about young disaffection or youth disaffection [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=596.24s)]
*  or relative millennial millennial. I think that's generous, call it young, because the oldest [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=602.64s)]
*  millennial is about 43 now. Millennials in Gen Z who are upset with Joe Biden. And they were like, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=606.24s)]
*  well, they often consume their news in different ways, like TikTok. So they're not seeing all the [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=612.8s)]
*  ways that Joe Biden is really trying to influence Benjamin Netanyahu behind the scenes. And I kind [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=617.6800000000001s)]
*  of thought when I saw that, I was like, well, that's probably for the best, because anyone who [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=623.28s)]
*  believes that is being a bit of a sucker. And you know, if they're seeing on cable news, which does [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=626.0799999999999s)]
*  have an older age in terms of the average age he watches cable news or reading various newspapers, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=631.04s)]
*  leaked reports about how Joe Biden's got really, really upset this time. He's really, really upset. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=636.48s)]
*  Oh, it's so awful. Oh, Benjamin, can you really cut it out? Honestly, I'm really, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=644.64s)]
*  really mean it this time. Please just tone it down a bit. It's just because obviously the US has [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=649.44s)]
*  lots of levers that can pull like military support and it could just pull the plug anytime it wanted. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=654.72s)]
*  So I just think that's interesting because they have a view basically that younger people, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=660.24s)]
*  because they're seeing basically children being blown apart on TikTok, that's having quite an [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=665.2s)]
*  impact on them. I think it's quite a damning indictment. You're not thinking like the US [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=670.4s)]
*  media ecosystem, that basically what are clearly ineffective ways to change the situation are [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=674.4s)]
*  portrayed as, you know, that young people would change their mind if only they saw what the [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=681.6s)]
*  Democrats were actually doing behind the scenes. Well, so much of the US media ecosystem, particularly [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=686.8s)]
*  cable TV is entirely framed on does X help or hurt Joe Biden? Does X help or hurt Donald Trump? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=694.16s)]
*  And that's just not, you know, I do think that a lot of younger people are getting their news from [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=702.4s)]
*  not cable TV, from either digital outlets or social media. And that's frankly just not how [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=707.76s)]
*  much of the coverage of Gaza is framed in digital outlets or social media is not, is it's sometimes [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=713.4399999999999s)]
*  much more substantive about the issue itself, the humanitarian concerns that are happening, the [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=719.36s)]
*  skyrocketing death toll of women and children. Like the whole got much of the Gaza debate, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=724.48s)]
*  much of the debate around the war is totally framed on MSNBC and CNN and other outlets as, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=730.24s)]
*  well, you know, what can the president do? It's Netanyahu. And in October, when the war started, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=737.44s)]
*  Netanyahu was framed in a different light today because of the things they're trying to shed, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=744.96s)]
*  the administration is trying to shed its previous kind of bear hug of him. They tried to convince [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=749.52s)]
*  us originally in October that the bear hug approach would get Netanyahu to do to be less [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=756.1600000000001s)]
*  vengeful. Now, you know, this Listen to Michigan campaign launched three weeks ago. In the last [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=763.12s)]
*  three weeks, there's been so many leaks from the White House and from sources close to Biden that [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=769.44s)]
*  they had this leak. And when they went to Dearborn, the White House said that they [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=775.2800000000001s)]
*  apologized for some of the actions and rhetoric they had in October, and they should have taken [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=779.84s)]
*  a more forceful stance. They said that privately to a group of Arab Americans in Dearborn. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=784.0s)]
*  Biden hasn't said anything publicly even to that extent. And, you know, like you said, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=790.64s)]
*  the main thing they could do is to stop funding a war they apparently disagree with. I think that [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=797.12s)]
*  many people in Dearborn, they keep saying, and Detroit, they keep saying that the policy matters [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=803.84s)]
*  more than the rhetoric and the messaging. And so, yeah, I mean, it is improvement that they're [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=811.44s)]
*  trying to damage control their brand, I guess, but they could condition or restrict or end the [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=817.2800000000001s)]
*  military funding tomorrow if they wanted to. If I was going to ask you a bit of a kind of not [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=823.6800000000001s)]
*  devil's advocate position, but just, you know, going into the weeds a bit. And it does need a [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=828.1600000000001s)]
*  heavy caveat because Joe Biden, his entire political career has made it clear that he will [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=832.08s)]
*  unequivocally stand behind Israel no matter what it does. In the mid 1980s, he told Congress [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=837.36s)]
*  that if Israel didn't exist, the US would have to invent it to serve US interests. I mean, he [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=843.28s)]
*  didn't even put a kind of spin on it as a kind of, you know, on the terms of design as in [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=848.0s)]
*  traditionally, he just said, this will facilitate US interests. That was the argument he was making [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=853.2s)]
*  in his speech. But nonetheless, it's true, 50% now of supporters of Joe Biden think Israel's [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=856.96s)]
*  committing genocide, but there were other Democratic voters who actually support what [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=863.84s)]
*  Israel's doing. And that doesn't include then the Republican side of the equation. And you have APAC, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=867.9200000000001s)]
*  for those who don't know, it's the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which is extremely [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=874.32s)]
*  powerful lobby, which targets with huge amounts of money, either supports candidates who support [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=878.5600000000001s)]
*  what Israel is doing or go hard against candidates who don't. And there isn't the equity, there isn't [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=885.12s)]
*  a body with the equivalent strength on the other side. So these are real challenges, aren't they? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=890.8s)]
*  These, you know, we could say, well, actually, there's a growing constituency, which I'll ask [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=894.88s)]
*  you about. But actually, there's a massive challenge. And so how, what's the argument there? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=898.56s)]
*  What's the counter argument? I think, well, I think there are parts of your argument that are true, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=904.0799999999999s)]
*  which is that, look, the Arab American community, the Muslim American community, and, frankly, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=909.3599999999999s)]
*  like millennial organizations are new in this country, their political infrastructure isn't [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=915.52s)]
*  as well financed or well developed. You know, I hear all the time that when it comes to calls [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=920.24s)]
*  into Congress, APAC is always beating progressives on like getting people in congressional [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=926.24s)]
*  districts to make phone calls to members of Congress. That has slowly started to change [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=932.08s)]
*  since this war started in October. Like, there have been huge phone and like call in days [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=937.44s)]
*  to members of Congress. Rashida Tlaib broke some fundraising records. You know, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=945.36s)]
*  it's still not to the level of the financial or political might of APAC, but it's developed. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=949.76s)]
*  But frankly, like on the political side, I do think President Biden, there keeps being these op [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=955.12s)]
*  ads like every day about what President Biden can do to win back voters. And it's always about [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=961.52s)]
*  he needs to do a TikTok or he needs to do Instagram. He needs to do more selfies on Instagram. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=966.24s)]
*  And he needs to do he needs to do he needs to show people that he's not senile, blah, blah, blah. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=972.16s)]
*  But the main a big thing he can do that isn't about his age is that he can try to unite the [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=976.24s)]
*  Democratic Party and align with the preferences of the majority of Democrats, which is, you know, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=980.88s)]
*  and supporting a ceasefire ending funding for the war. I don't think a Democratic Party divided [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=988.16s)]
*  against itself can win a general election. He's pissed off a very large constituency of the [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=994.32s)]
*  volunteers that would knock doors or phone bank for him. And, you know, this is he, he has he has [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1000.88s)]
*  he is the one who's fractured the party. And that's a much easier thing for him to resolve than [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1009.92s)]
*  questions around his age, which are kind of baked. But yeah, I do think that there is the political [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1014.8s)]
*  infrastructure needs to be developed needs to be more enhanced. But this is this is frankly, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1022.56s)]
*  an ideological issue for Joe Biden, where he is much more deeply sympathetic to [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1026.64s)]
*  Israel as an idea as a country, perhaps the idea of Israel from its founding rather than the state [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1033.44s)]
*  of Israel today, which is increasingly a far right ethno national state. You know, it's it's also [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1039.8400000000001s)]
*  bizarre because you can find speeches and statements from President Biden about the about Ireland, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1046.72s)]
*  about South Africa that are very conditions that are somewhat similar to the conditions of [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1053.76s)]
*  Palestinians today, where he was much more sympathetic to South Africans or Catholics in [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1060.16s)]
*  Ireland, based on his own personal attachment and affiliations with some of those movements. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1065.84s)]
*  Some of the things that, you know, President Biden was accused of being an IRA sympathizer [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1072.8799999999999s)]
*  his entire political career. And so I do think that it's it's kind of bizarre to see where he [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1078.48s)]
*  draws his he has somewhat of a hierarchy of human value based on his personal attachment or his [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1084.64s)]
*  ideological views. So I'm I am a little pessimistic about whether he would change his approach. But [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1090.64s)]
*  the only thing that has that could potentially change the approach is the whether the electoral [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1096.72s)]
*  math of winning winning the general election, Michigan being a pivotal state. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1104.88s)]
*  I do think it's striking is worth just spelling out just how dramatic that was shift has been [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1109.2s)]
*  in US public opinion, because the US traditionally overwhelmingly stood behind the Israeli state. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1113.7600000000002s)]
*  And now the polling shows, you know, look, if you'd said 20 or 30 years ago, the idea that [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1121.68s)]
*  half of democratic voters would say that Israel is committing a genocide, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1127.2800000000002s)]
*  no one would believe that would have been possible. And amongst younger people, you can see [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1131.76s)]
*  very, very hostile positions now towards the Israeli state, which was not the case for young [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1137.36s)]
*  people in the 1980s. And so that's even more that's even more astonishing and surprising given how [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1142.72s)]
*  when you turn on TV in the United States, every every time there's a commercial break, you'll see [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1150.4s)]
*  commercials from the Israeli government talking about Hamas talking about the hostages. And you [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1154.96s)]
*  have most Democratic Party elected officials supporting Israel wholeheartedly, given those [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1160.56s)]
*  two things and the in the public information campaign, public affairs campaign against [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1166.6399999999999s)]
*  Palestinian human rights, the fact that those poll numbers are what they are is to me very [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1171.28s)]
*  surprising to me, does it look like I mean, think something's got to give because, you know, it's [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1175.44s)]
*  clear which way I mean, Israel, Israel's leaders are not clearly thinking very well about the long [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1181.04s)]
*  term, and in that the US is their protector, is the guarantor. I mean, it has been put to me as [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1188.0s)]
*  well could just end with the rise of China, Israel might just go shopping for another for another [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1193.52s)]
*  guarantor. And maybe, you know, who knows how things will shift. But as things stand, and you [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1198.32s)]
*  know, that they are losing that is that's very significant, isn't it for the long term, actually, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1203.6s)]
*  because we can see the polling in Britain as well, there's been a dramatic shift away from [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1208.64s)]
*  Israel in favor of the Palestinians over despite the fact media coverage is so weighted in favor [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1213.1200000000001s)]
*  and of the Israeli state. So I mean, so I mean, just thinking that is that is growing, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1220.48s)]
*  it's escalating, that's something you can build. Yeah, I think so. I mean, the ICJ case from South [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1226.8s)]
*  Africa, the President Lula's remarks this this week, Israel, Israel and the United States have [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1232.8s)]
*  isolated themselves. I mean, the United States looks, Israel is making a buffoon of the United [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1240.16s)]
*  States claim to fight for democracy and against authoritarianism abroad. This is Joe Biden's rule [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1245.76s)]
*  based rules based international order, in which he defended his support of Ukraine against the [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1251.3600000000001s)]
*  Russian invasion. Israel is making a mockery of any of those claims that of Joe Biden or the United [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1258.0800000000002s)]
*  States. And it is also in the South. Historically, Bibi Netanyahu has done whatever he could to [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1264.8s)]
*  damage democratic presidents in order to help Republicans, because he knows he gets even more [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1271.6s)]
*  political support, even more military support under Republican presidents. And I wouldn't put [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1277.04s)]
*  it past him to also try to drag the United States and Joe Biden into an unpopular war, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1282.1599999999999s)]
*  because he knows that the Democratic base is against that. And so it is this unique situation [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1289.2s)]
*  where a lot the electoral math and electoral consequences could potentially change the course [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1297.84s)]
*  of this, but it is not going to come without a major, major political pressure and more [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1303.1200000000001s)]
*  increasing protests and and and lobbying of members of Congress, call in days, this kind of thing. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1309.44s)]
*  To get the message across. But, you know, things have changed in the past three weeks in terms of [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1318.24s)]
*  these leaks. And I think it's not satisfying anyone. So now they'll have to try something new. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1322.72s)]
*  So essentially that point you made about how the US has become isolated. Before I, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1327.6s)]
*  people might not know my PhD dropout, but, but my originally my promise to become an academic and, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1332.96s)]
*  you know, I was studying American history and my master's thesis was on neoconservatives [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1338.64s)]
*  in rise in the 1970s as a product reflection of US decline. The reason I bring that up is it did [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1343.28s)]
*  seem like the US was in steep decline in the 1970s, but then you've got the collapse of the [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1349.28s)]
*  Soviet led world. US power got a huge boost, went into a kind of triumphalist phase, which now looks [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1353.2s)]
*  pretty heuristic, I have to say. And I've been thinking about this a lot because I'm in Greece, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1358.96s)]
*  I'm in Athens, the Acropolis over there. So I'm thinking about the decline, the rise and decline [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1363.52s)]
*  of civilisations. The reason just in the 21st century, every major thing that's happened [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1367.6s)]
*  has accelerated the process of Western decline. And that you've got how the financial crash, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1373.28s)]
*  obviously, but you've had Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, all of them clearly catastrophes. And it just seems [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1378.24s)]
*  to me this is such an obvious calamity for the West generally, but the US in particular. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1386.9599999999998s)]
*  And because it's such an egregious, I mean, astonishingly deranged obscenity, which is [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1392.8000000000002s)]
*  clearly being armed and facilitated by the US, it's quite difficult to see how it recovers. And I [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1400.4s)]
*  don't know if that's even been thought of in the US in a big way. I think it has because [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1404.72s)]
*  if they're not scared of young people, if they're not scared of Arab or Muslim [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1414.3200000000002s)]
*  Americans in Michigan, they are somewhat afraid of their stature. This is the thing about Trumpism [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1418.4s)]
*  that there's so many people in the foreign policy establishment in the US that hated Donald Trump [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1424.96s)]
*  because he set the US image backward and he set US relationships backwards. And this is something [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1430.48s)]
*  Joe Biden and Jake Sullivan and other people in the White House say they care deeply about is [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1436.0800000000002s)]
*  resetting US leadership abroad, particularly as it pertains to the rise of authoritarianism [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1443.28s)]
*  and also on climate change. And so when it comes to things like this and what they describe as [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1449.28s)]
*  their Cold War with China, they do not want China to increase their alliances economically or [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1456.3999999999999s)]
*  politically with countries in the global South, in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. All of these [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1463.28s)]
*  are countries who have in one way or another supported South Africa's effort at the ICJ. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1469.52s)]
*  And so I think that this is in so many ways like is the alliance with Bibi Netanyahu going to drag [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1474.6399999999999s)]
*  the United States and Joe Biden through the mud on so many things that they seem to care about, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1484.08s)]
*  whether it's their election, their status in the world, and their hawkishness on China. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1489.44s)]
*  Everyone knows that the US and Joe Biden care way more about the Russian invasion of Ukraine [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1496.64s)]
*  rather than Israel's occupation of Gaza. Is the United States going to lose support for continuing [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1501.76s)]
*  to arm Ukraine because so many countries pull out from support. They see that the US picks and [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1509.3600000000001s)]
*  chooses its friends and picks and chooses its support for freedom, democracy, and human rights [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1516.88s)]
*  based on who their allies are. And so yeah, would that make the United States look like hypocrites? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1522.6399999999999s)]
*  Increasingly it does seem like so. And Brazil is one of those countries in the middle that [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1528.8s)]
*  could end up right now as non-aligned but has significant relationships with both the US and [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1534.8799999999999s)]
*  China. So who knows what happens, but this is much bigger than just Israel. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1541.6799999999998s)]
*  Before I ask my final question, just in terms of Donald Trump, he stands in this [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1547.7600000000002s)]
*  grim tradition of what I describe as anti-Semites for Israel, in that he has a long history of saying [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1554.24s)]
*  and perpetrating anti-Semitic tropes. And Nixon was another example of this. Nixon was recorded [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1560.64s)]
*  saying all sorts of terrible anti-Semitic things, including it should be said to Henry Kissinger, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1567.5200000000002s)]
*  who was of course Jewish. That isn't to speak about. Obviously Henry Kissinger was a war criminal. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1572.08s)]
*  But the fact he was in an administration where he suffered anti-Semitism from a president who [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1579.04s)]
*  was four square behind Israel, it's quite striking. You see this with Elon Musk, other examples. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1586.32s)]
*  But he's been playing quite an interesting game because he seems to not be saying very much, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1592.08s)]
*  as far as I can tell, making inflammatory statements. Is that because he's trying to [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1596.32s)]
*  not intervene in order to let this cause division amongst the Democrats? Or is he actually saying [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1601.8400000000001s)]
*  quite a lot and it's just not being reported as much as it should be? I think it's definitely [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1607.76s)]
*  the second one. We have this interesting media environment where the media has decided that [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1611.92s)]
*  they don't want to platform Donald Trump. They don't want to platform Donald Trump, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1619.52s)]
*  and they haven't really platformed him since January 6th. We can debate whether that was a [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1625.84s)]
*  positive or negative thing for democracy and political literacy, but a lot of Donald Trump's [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1631.1999999999998s)]
*  statements do not get amplified or covered in the mainstream media. He is mostly posting on [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1637.1999999999998s)]
*  the social media platform Truth, in which he has said horrendous things about Palestinians and [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1644.1599999999999s)]
*  Muslims in the last three or four months. He has claimed that Hamas is coming across the Mexican [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1650.32s)]
*  border. He has said he wants to increase surveillance and deportations of Palestinians [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1654.88s)]
*  and Arabs with ties to Gaza and have a more muscular Muslim ban than what he had before. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1662.0s)]
*  This is why some of the polling is confusing because if the media is still going to [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1673.3600000000001s)]
*  quote unquote deplatform Trump, what does that mean about whether any of these things that I just [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1678.88s)]
*  said are going to get covered or affect people's views? I'm under no illusions that it's important [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1684.8s)]
*  to defeat Donald Trump and Trumpism, which is why I'm so concerned that Biden is putting Netanyahu [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1691.6799999999998s)]
*  ahead of that effort. Trump has said a fair amount about this, but it's just not being covered. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1697.44s)]
*  Just finally, what you've got to say about whether Joe Biden will be the normie at all. I know [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1706.32s)]
*  that I prefer to talk about the politics, but it is difficult to ignore the fact that [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1710.96s)]
*  the mental capacity of Joe Biden does not seem to be all that. I know this has become such a [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1716.24s)]
*  right-wing, something the hard-right, far-right talk about a lot. Part of me makes me think, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1720.64s)]
*  just stay away from it, but it's kind of hard to ignore. What do you think? There's that and the [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1726.4s)]
*  combination of just Gaza and there is the precedent. I mentioned LBJ before. LBJ in the end did stand [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1732.24s)]
*  down as the normie because he was so damaged by Vietnam. Do you think that could happen? [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1738.48s)]
*  It definitely could happen. One of the most read columnists in the US, Ezra Klein, called for that. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1743.44s)]
*  Ezra Klein isn't the most left-wing columnist. He is pretty mainstream. He's center-left, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1750.0s)]
*  mainstream Democratic Party, and he called for a convention. You kind of feel like you're living in [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1755.28s)]
*  a bizarro world where when you watch TV or you read the New York Times, you have every Democratic [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1762.24s)]
*  strategist consultant, administration official saying, Joe Biden is so focused, he's so strong, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1769.6000000000001s)]
*  his mind is totally there, and there's nothing to worry about. But voters are not... This is a huge [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1778.8s)]
*  divide between the elite and voters where voters are watching Joe Biden's press conferences and he [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1788.24s)]
*  does not seem all that there. In the press conference in which he was defending his mental [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1793.84s)]
*  acuity, he got the name of... He said that the president of Mexico was controlling the Rafa border [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1800.24s)]
*  in Egypt. He said that Sisi was the president of Mexico. Those things wouldn't be a huge deal if [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1807.04s)]
*  it wasn't in the context of defending a press conference totally entirely about whether he was [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1812.96s)]
*  too old to be president. I think most voters think he's too old. I think most voters think Donald [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1818.64s)]
*  Trump is too old. Who knows how much this... It's only February and Biden's already had these major [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1824.72s)]
*  gaps. John Stewart said it really well on his first show at the Daily Show. Does anyone have a [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1831.6000000000001s)]
*  video recording of Joe Biden seeming very strong and having his wits about him? I don't know. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1839.2800000000002s)]
*  Right now, it does not seem like there is any effort from the most powerful figures in the [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1849.1200000000001s)]
*  Democratic Party to have a convention or have a contested convention or put forward another [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1853.8400000000001s)]
*  nominee. Ultimately, it would have to be Joe Biden himself and his team himself deciding that they [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1859.76s)]
*  would not run. Right now, it seems like they are going to defend him no matter what. These are the [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1865.6s)]
*  same people who defended Dianne Feinstein until the very end. It will not happen without one of them [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1870.8s)]
*  deciding to leak something about the president that's damaging career, fully damaging. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1878.48s)]
*  Yeah. I think you've just underlined why after... I suppose all the great turmoil, I call it, which [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1887.28s)]
*  has existed since 2016-ish. It increasingly felt like 2024 was the grand finale of this particular [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1893.76s)]
*  season. I don't know what's going to happen next, but it does feel like things are coming [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1901.04s)]
*  to a head somewhat with many of the multiple, Ukraine, Israel, in terms of the US itself, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1904.8799999999999s)]
*  what happens with its democracy. This is a big year and I think we'll be speaking to you more, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1912.48s)]
*  if that's okay with you, I believe, because you're such an important voice and I think people can see [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1918.24s)]
*  why. Do make sure you share this video if you're watching all the podcasts. Press like, subscribe, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1922.16s)]
*  for more lead. Honestly, thanks so much. That was so educational and disturbing, as many of my [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1928.8000000000002s)]
*  TVs tend to be at the moment. Thank you. Thanks so much. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjS8rFN7Q&t=1934.64s)]
