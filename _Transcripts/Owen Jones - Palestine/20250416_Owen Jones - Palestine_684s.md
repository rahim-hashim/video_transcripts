# Israel Just CONFESSED
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU)
*  Some of you may understandably feel like you are losing your minds. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=0.0s)]
*  What exactly is Israel supposed to do, you are asking, before politicians and media outlets [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=4.16s)]
*  accept that a despicable, heinous crime of historic proportions has been committed in [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=9.68s)]
*  foreview of the world and take action accordingly? What atrocity exactly, what genocidal statement, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=15.44s)]
*  what confession of criminal intent and action crosses that line? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=21.36s)]
*  The situation in Gaza right now, facing the remaining Palestinian survivors, is worse than [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=25.84s)]
*  ever and most media outlets are going silent. We will not do so. Let me just go through some [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=30.8s)]
*  of the latest. The Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz has just publicly confessed to deliberately [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=37.36s)]
*  starving the Palestinian population. Let me just read his tweet out. He says, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  As I mentioned in my announcement, Israel's policy is clear and no humanitarian aid is about [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  to enter Gaza and preventing humanitarian aid to Gaza is one of the main pressure tools [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=53.52s)]
*  that prevents Hamas from using this measure against the population in addition to the other [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=58.400000000000006s)]
*  steps that Israel is taking and it is a shame that there are those who try to mislead. In the current [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  reality, no one is prepared to bring any humanitarian aid into Gaza and no one is preparing [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=68.64s)]
*  to bring in any such aid. I emphasize that in relation to the future, the mechanism for [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=74.64s)]
*  using civil society must be built as a tool that will not allow Hamas access the issue in the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=79.76s)]
*  future. There is no room for interpretation here. The Israeli Defense Minister has made clear that [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  no humanitarian aid is allowed to enter Gaza. At the same time, Israel has destroyed agriculture [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=90.64s)]
*  and food production in Gaza. At the end of last year, the UN found that 70% of farmland [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  had been decimated, 90% of cattle killed. A report by Forensic Architecture, a team of experts, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=102.4s)]
*  found that 83% of plant life had been destroyed in Gaza. The International Criminal Court last [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=109.44s)]
*  year issued arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Katz's predecessor [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=115.12s)]
*  Yoav Galan for war crimes and crimes against humanity centering on the question of starvation. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=120.8s)]
*  Deliberately starving a civilian population clearly violates multiple international laws such as [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=127.84s)]
*  Article 33 of the Geneva Convention prohibiting collective punishment and is inherently a [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=133.28s)]
*  genocidal act. Article 2 of the Genocide Convention of 1948, paragraph C, which states, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=137.92s)]
*  deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=143.92s)]
*  destruction in whole or in part. Katz has simply once again admitted to war crimes, crimes against [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=150.23999999999998s)]
*  humanity and genocidal acts. There is no other interpretation, no other way of reframing what's [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=155.2s)]
*  been said, no leeway possible. There has been a total blockade in Gaza since the 1st of March and [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  the bakeries of Gaza shut two weeks ago. And Philip Lazzarini, the Commissioner General of UNRWA, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=166.96s)]
*  the UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees, says that stocks which entered Gaza during this [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=172.24s)]
*  easter have been depleted. We can see the desperation of hungry children in Gaza. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=176.24s)]
*  Now the NGO Medecins Sans Frontieres has issued a hideously terrified statement entitled Gaza has [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=182.88s)]
*  become a mass grave for Palestinians and those helping them. Let me read what the emergency [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=197.92s)]
*  coordinator Amand Bazarol has stated. Gaza has been turned into a mass grave of Palestinians [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=202.64s)]
*  and those coming to their assistance. We are witnessing in real time the destruction and [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=209.68s)]
*  forced displacement of the entire population in Gaza. With nowhere safe for Palestinians or those [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=213.52s)]
*  trying to help them, the humanitarian response is severely struggling under the weight of insecurity [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=219.12s)]
*  and critical supply shortages leaving people with few, if any, options for accessing care. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=224.24s)]
*  MSF note that at least 409 aid workers have been killed adding, although the situation has already [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=230.16s)]
*  been catastrophic for over 18 months. Over the past three weeks, MSF has witnessed several incidents [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=236.0s)]
*  involving the killing of humanitarian and medical workers. The coordination of humanitarian movements [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=241.84s)]
*  with Israeli authorities, known as the humanitarian notification system, an already imperfect system, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=247.28s)]
*  has become more unreliable and is now barely affording any protection guarantees. Indeed, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=253.2s)]
*  this is a crucial point. Repeatedly, aid workers and medics have coordinated movements with the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=258.08s)]
*  Israeli military and then been slaughtered by Israeli soldiers. One striking example, of course, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=263.6s)]
*  are the paramedics who were sent to save five-year-old Hind Rajab last year, whose four cousins, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=268.8s)]
*  aunt and uncle, had already been killed by the Israeli army. They then killed the paramedics as [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=274.16s)]
*  well as Hind Rajab. As the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=278.40000000000003s)]
*  intensive military operations, displacement orders, the blockade on the entry of all aid and [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=283.20000000000005s)]
*  commercial supplies and shrinking humanitarian space are driving what is likely the worst [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=287.36s)]
*  humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip since October 2023. They know water insecurity deepens [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=292.16s)]
*  with over half of water and sanitation facilities inaccessible, drastically reducing access to [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=298.48s)]
*  drinking water, undermining basic hygiene and compromising public health. Food consumption [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=304.08000000000004s)]
*  and dietary diversity in Gaza have sharply deteriorated, recent food security analysis [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=309.04s)]
*  indicates. This week, the Anglican Ali Arab Hospital, a hospital run by the Anglican Church [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=314.56s)]
*  in Jerusalem and the last fully functioning hospital in Gaza, was bombed by the Israeli [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=320.72s)]
*  military, destroying its laboratory and damaging its emergency room. This is part and parcel of a [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=325.44000000000005s)]
*  deliberate attempt to systematically destroy the healthcare system of Gaza, that itself is a [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=330.88000000000005s)]
*  genocidal act. And guess what the BBC did originally when reporting this? Their original headline was [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=336.24s)]
*  Gaza Hospital hit by Israeli strike, Hamas says. This is obviously insane, the hospital was [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=341.44000000000005s)]
*  objectively hit by an Israeli missile. It is a fact. Israel itself confirmed it. Only after [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=347.2s)]
*  online outrage was the headline changed to, Israeli airstrike destroys part of last fully functioning [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=352.96s)]
*  hospital in Gaza City. Itself a rare event that BBC fully apportioning direct responsibility to Israel [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=359.2s)]
*  for such an attack. Now we know of course that at the end of March, Israel massacred 15 red [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=367.28s)]
*  crescent medics and first responders, ambushing them, executing them, then burying them in a mass [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=371.91999999999996s)]
*  grave as well as crushing up and trying to bury their ambulances, then lying about it, lies exposed [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=376.56s)]
*  by incontrovertible video footage evidence. Well even the New York Times has come out and admitted [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=381.92s)]
*  the paramedics and rescue workers killed in an Israeli shooting in Gaza last month died mainly [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=387.52s)]
*  from gunshots to their head or chest, while others had shrapnel injuries or other wounds according [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=393.2s)]
*  to the autopsy reports obtained by the New York Times. Most they know had been shot multiple times. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=398.16s)]
*  Meanwhile the UN reports that almost 70% of Gaza is now under Israeli displacement or no-go orders. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=405.04s)]
*  This is an attempt to force the surviving Palestinian population into a tiny area, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=411.44s)]
*  bearing in mind Gaza overall is the size of East London, in order to make the life of the survivors [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=415.6s)]
*  unbearable in the hope they either die or flee. That is disgracefully labelled voluntary transfer. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=421.92s)]
*  I want to end with a recently published article in The Economist entitled, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=428.0s)]
*  Israel is intent on destroying Gaza. With a subheading, without pressure from America, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=431.44s)]
*  it's hard to see anything stopping it. Some might look at this and laud it. Some honesty in the [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=435.84s)]
*  mainstream media you may say. Now before I just comment on that, let's just go through some of [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=440.55999999999995s)]
*  what it says. The Economist says, Israeli security officials have confirmed to The Economist that the [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=445.35999999999996s)]
*  plan is to permanently empty the Rafah area in Gaza South, which represents around 20% of the entire [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=450.0s)]
*  territory. A similar operation is underway in a smaller area in the north. It goes on, these moves [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=455.84s)]
*  are part of a wider plan to force over 2 million Gazans out of the cities and towns and to the [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=461.12s)]
*  coast. In the short run, this is to create kill zones in which, in theory, only Hamas fighters [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=466.64s)]
*  will remain. In the longer term, Israel hopes that Gazans will voluntarily, in quotes, emigrate. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=471.52s)]
*  Discussing, of course, voluntary migration when you've annihilated an entire territory and made [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=477.12s)]
*  it unlivable is, of course, just code for driving people out, or those who survive. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=481.2s)]
*  The Economist notes too, the UN's World Food Programme has closed 25 bakeries that produce [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=485.76s)]
*  pita bread as it can no longer supply them with fuel or flour. Nor can families bake their own [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=490.88s)]
*  bread. A kilogram of cooking at gas now costs at least 250 shekels, or $66, compared with 8 to 10 [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=496.08s)]
*  shekels before the aid cut off. And a bag of flour weighing 25 kilograms is almost twice that. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=502.48s)]
*  Staples like sugar and cooking oil are disappearing from market. It adds that water to scarce. It says [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=508.0s)]
*  output from the main desalination plant in southern Gaza has dropped by 85% since Israel [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=513.28s)]
*  stopped supplying it with electricity last month. Most Gazans have access to just 6 litres of clean [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=519.2s)]
*  water a day, according to the UN. It concludes, without pressure from Donald Trump, it's hard [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=524.32s)]
*  to see anything else that could prevent Israel's final destruction of Gaza. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=528.32s)]
*  Well, my response to the Economist is, where the fuck have you been? If they'd written this headline, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=532.4000000000001s)]
*  a headline entitled Israel's Intent on Destroying Gaza Back in October 2023, maybe they deserve [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=537.2800000000001s)]
*  some kudos. After all, Israeli leaders and officials back then made clear they were going [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=542.24s)]
*  to wipe Gaza out. They made no distinction in their statements between civilians and military [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=547.28s)]
*  targets. They made clear they were going to block humanitarian aid from entering and they unleashed [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=552.24s)]
*  mayhem through their firepower. We could see what they were doing. They began, all the way through [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=557.76s)]
*  October, raising Gaza from the face of the earth. Instead, the Economist has waited 18 months, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=562.16s)]
*  18 months, of a live-streamed genocide with atrocities every single day. Mass destruction, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=568.0799999999999s)]
*  mass death, mass starvation, until it states what was obvious to some of us who didn't own [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=575.36s)]
*  newspapers and magazines from the very beginning. I am imploring you, those watching, keep the [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=582.24s)]
*  receipts, keep every receipt you have from these media outlets and politicians from the beginning. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=589.36s)]
*  There will be a reckoning, however long it takes, there will be a reckoning, because the future of [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=595.28s)]
*  our species depends on it. If we normalise this, I'll keep saying it, if we normalise this [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=600.08s)]
*  depravity, if we normalise these crimes, it will not just be the Palestinian people who face [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=605.84s)]
*  apocalypse, which is what they're facing. It's an apocalyptic situation. It will be humanity as a [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=613.6800000000001s)]
*  whole. We cannot allow that to happen. We will dust over the crime scene to reveal every fingerprint [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=619.76s)]
*  belonging to every politician and every journalist, and they will be held to account. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=628.16s)]
*  One final thing, does the Palestinian family in Gaza describe the apocalyptic situation, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=634.16s)]
*  the lack of food? Please help them if you can. It's the family of Ahmed Mata. He's a wonderful [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=638.56s)]
*  27-year-old. They desperately need your help. I've included the GoFundMe page in the video [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=644.0s)]
*  description. Please help if you can. They need your help in order to live, to survive. Thanks so [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_y6CTxwbU&t=649.8399999999999s)]
