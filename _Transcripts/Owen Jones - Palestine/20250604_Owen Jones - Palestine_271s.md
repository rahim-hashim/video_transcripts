# My message to Western journalists complicit in Israel's genocide: You will pay for what you did
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw)
*  Well first of all I just want to say a special thanks to Amnesty and Eternal Appreciation [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=0.0s)]
*  for their tireless and courageous work, not least exposing the Western facilitated Israeli [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=6.8s)]
*  genocide of the Palestinian people. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=12.44s)]
*  I want to thank those who voted for me, put their trust in my work, who I know expect [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=13.44s)]
*  me to tell the truth. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=17.72s)]
*  And I don't say this to embarrass our hosts who I know must do crucial work with a range [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=19.2s)]
*  All to erase brilliant journalists who work tirelessly and courageously for mainstream [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=25.44s)]
*  outlets, my colleague Nezri Malik, Alex Crawford at Sky News and so many people here. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=30.72s)]
*  This evening must not become exploited to whitewash the British mainstream media of [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=36.12s)]
*  their records. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  Gaza is a crime scene. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=44.6s)]
*  Dust it off and you will find the fingerprints of British editors and British journalists [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=48.16s)]
*  amongst the apocalyptic rubble. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=54.44s)]
*  British media outlets, including some represented here today, have not been passive bystanders [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=56.6s)]
*  in one of the great crimes of our age, but they have been active participants. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=60.8s)]
*  From the very beginning there was an avalanche of genocidal and criminal statements of intent [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=65.52s)]
*  by Israeli leaders and yet the Western media buried these statements or simply didn't cover [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  them at all, let alone frame their coverage around them, despite them offering the most [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=75.0s)]
*  accurate roadmap to what Israel in fact went on to do. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=79.0s)]
*  Even today, Western media outlets refuse to accurately reflect unambiguously genocidal [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=83.32000000000001s)]
*  official Israeli policy. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=89.68s)]
*  There hasn't even been the slightest pretense that Palestinian life has any worth whatsoever. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=91.4s)]
*  The lie of beheaded Israeli babies received infinitely more outrage and coverage than [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=98.72s)]
*  the actual mass butchery of Palestinian babies it was used to justify. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=104.16s)]
*  The Western media has continually amplified Israeli lies despite overwhelming evidence [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=109.2s)]
*  of relentless deceit. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=113.64s)]
*  Palestinian voices have been systematically marginalised or subjected to perverse show [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=115.4s)]
*  trailers on BBC and Sky News. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=119.52000000000001s)]
*  Atrocities have been ignored and whitewashed, Israeli guilt repeatedly erased, the facts [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=122.68s)]
*  of international law suppressed, opponents of genocide have been systematically deplatformed [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=127.0s)]
*  or monstered or both and the vast majority of Western journalists couldn't even utter [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=132.44s)]
*  one sentence of solidarity with their Palestinian colleagues in Gaza as they suffered the worst [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=137.4s)]
*  thoughts of journalists in the history of our species like Hassan Shaba, Hassan Esliya [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=143.48000000000002s)]
*  and Hamza al-Darud. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  The Western media has no excuses and nowhere to hide. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=151.68s)]
*  No crime in history has been so thoroughly documented as it happened. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=155.16s)]
*  No crime in history has been so boasted about by its perpetrators from politicians at the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  top to soldiers on the ground as it happened. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=164.36s)]
*  There must be a reckoning. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=167.4s)]
*  The absence of consequences for the Iraq war paved the way for this catastrophe. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=169.44000000000003s)]
*  This time those in the Western media who have facilitated genocide must suffer the consequences [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=175.24s)]
*  to their careers and reputations. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=182.20000000000002s)]
*  Not for vengeance but because if this time there are no consequences then we condemn [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=184.52s)]
*  humanity to ever greater calamities. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=189.12s)]
*  When I say to my fellow journalists keep every receipt of what editors and producers did [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=191.76s)]
*  and didn't do. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=197.16s)]
*  Every relevant email, every relevant WhatsApp and text message, note down every relevant [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=199.07999999999998s)]
*  conversation. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=203.76s)]
*  One day there is going to be a reckoning and the superiors who made these decisions should [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=204.88s)]
*  be forced to defend their decisions in front of the whole world. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  This is the biggest scandal of Western journalism in modern history. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=214.88s)]
*  And I know to finally, I know, I know those complicit in our media, I know those complicit [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=219.2s)]
*  in this genocide believe they are protected in perpetuity by an iron dome of Israeli impunity [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=227.07999999999998s)]
*  reinforced by anti-Palestinian racism. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=234.48s)]
*  But that is already crumbling in real time. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=237.12s)]
*  They have gambled that in a year, two years, five years, ten years, twenty years no consequences [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=240.39999999999998s)]
*  will ever arrive. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=246.6s)]
*  They are wrong. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=248.04s)]
*  A reckoning is coming. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=249.04s)]
*  And to the guilty men and women of the Western media they are going to pay for what they [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=250.2s)]
*  have done to the Palestinian people. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=253.95999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9SQokMSOw&t=254.95999999999998s)]
