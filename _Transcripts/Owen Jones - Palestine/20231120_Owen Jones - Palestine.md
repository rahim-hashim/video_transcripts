# 'Annihilate Everyone' Israeli TV Promotes Genocidal Song
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [November 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV0pEUXMz6M)
*  It needs to be repeated over and over again that the Israeli state is not exactly being subtle
*  about its intentions as regards its onslaught against Gaza. In preparing his people for war,
*  the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu quoted the biblical story of Amalek in which God commands
*  the Israelites to kill all men, women, children and livestock. Israeli leaders and officials have
*  variously justified a total siege of food, water, energy on the grounds that they're fighting human
*  animals saying that they're targeting for damage not accuracy promising to reduce Gaza to a city of
*  tents stating that Gaza must be destroyed because almost every building in Gaza is a stronghold of
*  Hamas. We really could go on. If there was a hypothetical war crimes tribunal you wouldn't
*  need to dig through top secret classified Israeli documents to work out intent. You just need to
*  listen and read out, read through what Israeli leaders and officials said publicly which could
*  hardly be less subtle than screaming we are committing war crimes by the way very loudly.
*  Well if you want the most disturbing example of the unambiguously genocidal mentality that
*  now grips Israeli society then I'm afraid this is it. A song shared on the website of and the
*  twitter account of the public broadcaster Khan News features a group of children promising to
*  annihilate everyone in Gaza. This is not a joke. It's called Friendship Song 2023 and Khan News
*  shared it yesterday before abruptly deleting it so they shared it on their website and their
*  twitter account and then deleted it and it was made by a PR producer we'll talk about this
*  and the lyrics promise to annihilate the Swastika bearers in another year there will be nothing
*  there and we will safely return to our homes within a year we will annihilate everyone and
*  then we will return to plow our fields. Now where do you even begin here? You might think this is
*  too on the nose too completely unhinged to be real. Well I have some bad news for you. Now this
*  comes on top of some other frankly genocidal rhetoric from the Israeli state and influential
*  politicians and public figures which I will come on to but let's just start with a song.
*  Brace yourself it really is beyond belief.
*  Now the guy behind this is Ofa Rosenbaum who's also running a campaign supposedly to help
*  restore trust in the Israeli security forces. He appeared on Khan News to argue against
*  humanitarian considerations in Gaza because our duty is to fight them like they're not humans.
*  Again here you go.
*  Again a overtly murderous mentality there being showcased.
*  Now here's another example the Israeli deputy speaker of the Knesset that's Israel's parliament
*  tweeted all the preoccupation with whether or not there is internet in Gaza shows we have learned
*  nothing. We are too humane. Burn Gaza now no less. Straightforward genocidal language again
*  and should be considered incitement as such. One of the retired Israeli general Giora Eiland,
*  a former head of the Israeli National Security Council and he wrote a column in Yediyeth Aronof,
*  a very mainstream supposedly centrist relatively, Israeli daily newspaper founded back in 1939.
*  This is what he writes.
*  The international community is warning us against a severe humanitarian disaster and severe epidemics.
*  We must not shy away from this. After all severe epidemics in the south of Gaza will bring victory
*  closer. There's no reason why the Hamas generals in southern Gaza wouldn't surrender when they have
*  no fuel no water and when plagues reach them and the danger to the lives of their family members
*  will increase. I mean on one level that's unhinged enough the fact that a mainstream newspaper will
*  publish that and you might think he might be retired but that could be indicative clearly
*  of military thinking given how senior he was in the armed forces but I think well he's retired
*  but it gets so much worse because the Israeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrich writes on
*  Twitter I agree with every word of Giora Eiland in this column. That's right one of those senior
*  members of the Israeli government openly endorsing using mass disease and mass starvation and thirst
*  as a means to conquer Gaza open wanton confession of intent war crimes. Here's another example
*  Shay Golden used to work for Haaretz a left of centre publication and is now regarded as I
*  suppose centre right he's a journalist with Israel's channel 14. Now let's listen to what he says here
*  So he's saying Palestinians can't imagine how many will be killed and slaughtered. Now let's be
*  honest this is the sort of rhetoric along this you might expect from ISIS and in fact some of it is
*  just kind of religiously founded so you can make that kind of comparison. The key point though is
*  Israel is a military superpower and it is armed and backed by western governments including
*  the global superpower the United States. It has the capacity to follow through on its promises
*  and its government and society are in the grip of a genocidal mentality. The death toll in Gaza
*  compared to other conflicts already in such a short space of time is absolutely chilling and
*  horrific. It is a far greater death rate than previous conflicts Bosnia, Syria, Yemen we could
*  go on and we know its government and society as I say are in the grip of this government of this
*  genocide mentality. It's the only honest way of describing this and that's why the warnings of
*  genocide scholars do need to be listened to because listen to what they're saying listen to
*  how much of Israeli society not all very brave and courageous Israeli peace activists who I think
*  will win in the end but this is a dark period to say the least and the way that Israeli officials
*  and politicians are speaking got to take it seriously in the same way we listen when people
*  talk about the the rhetoric of TV pundits in Russia unhinged maniacs on Russian television.
*  Where's the same outrage here? It's just not there is it? Because the same seriousness
*  in terms of Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine brutal in its own terms but again a death rate
*  far lower than that in Gaza that is not being applied to what's happening in Gaza with the very
*  real risk of a genocide. We have to take this seriously it is horrifying. Please like and
