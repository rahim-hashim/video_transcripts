# Israeli Ambassador HUMILIATES Himself
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyjX2yHqMc)
*  The Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, Gilan Erdan, put on quite the performance yesterday
*  at the UN General Assembly. It was completely ludicrous, frankly utterly humiliating,
*  but also provided an extremely appropriate visual metaphor. Let's just have a little look shall we?
*  This is...
*  This is...
*  You are shredding the UN Charter with your own hands.
*  Yes, yes, that's what you're doing, shredding the UN Charter.
*  Shame on you.
*  You alright Gilad? Is that a sit down? Maybe a glass of water?
*  You often get a bit excitable when you don't have a decent night's rest. Maybe a little lie down.
*  Anyway, this performance was put on during a debate by the UN General Assembly about whether
*  Palestine should be granted full membership of the United Nations, giving it new rights and privileges.
*  Before yesterday, it's been a non-member observer state for the last 12 years. Now I said this
*  speech by the Israeli ambassador was an appropriate visual metaphor because he was
*  accusing the vast majority of the United Nations of shredding the UN Charter while he himself was
*  shamelessly and unapologetically shredding the UN Charter in front of the entire world. This is
*  known as projection, which has been a pillar of Israel's strategy, not least since it unleashed
*  a genocidal onslaught against the Palestinian people in October 2023. That is constantly
*  accusing others of doing what you are clearly doing yourself in full view of the world, indeed
*  in front of cameras. Now it is worth noting that since October, Israel has butchered around 200
*  UN members of staff, the biggest slaughter of UN staff in such a short period of time,
*  since the United Nations was founded in the ruins of the post-war world back in 1945. And Israel has
*  violated numerous UN resolutions, not least of course relating to its treatment, its subjugation
*  of the Palestinian people. Let's just hear one last other contribution from this fascinating character.
*  Today, with sick and twisted irony, the very body established to prevent evil is now
*  welcoming a terror state into its ranks. What would Churchill say if he were alive today?
*  What would Roosevelt think? They are turning in their graves, turning in their graves.
*  This week, only this week, Israel commemorated Yom HaShoah, Holocaust Remembrance Day.
*  And it is during our sacred week that this shameless body has chosen to reward
*  modern-day Nazis with rights and privileges? As Israelis mourn the Jewish babies burned in the
*  crematoria, you here at the UN usher in the collaborators of the Israeli babies
*  burned on October 7th. How can you be so blind? Well, just on Winston Churchill, whatever else
*  you might think of the guy, he's not exactly the sort of guy you want as your go-to reference on
*  questions of antisemitism. I mean, just in terms of antisemitism, Churchill invoked, back in 1920,
*  the classic antisemitic trope of the Jewish Bolshevik international conspiracy. He despised
*  Bolshevism. He pointed to the fact that most leading Bolsheviks were Jewish, arguing that the
*  principal inspiration driving power for Bolshevism came from what he described as the Jewish leaders.
*  Now later on the question of Palestine itself, he made explicitly racist justifications for the
*  fate of the Palestinian people, saying that, I do not admit that a wrong has been done to those
*  people by the fact that a stronger race, a higher grade race, or at any rate a more worldly-wide
*  wise race, to put it that way, has come in and taken their place. I do not admit it. And he
*  alluded to the fate of those he described as the Red Indians, which he approved of for the same
*  reasons. Yeah, I'm sure he is spitting in his grave, but do you know what? Good. He then invokes
*  the Holocaust, of course, the greatest single crime in human history, which I would note was
*  perpetrated by Europeans, specifically Germany and its wartime allies, not by the Palestinian people
*  who have been forced to pay the price for what Germany and its allies did, a point inadvertently
*  made there by, of course, the Israeli ambassador in his speech. He describes Palestine as modern-day
*  Nazis, frankly a disgrace. Firstly, you can and should condemn war crimes committed by Hamas
*  without belittling the attempt by the Nazis to exterminate by industrialized means a defenseless
*  civilian population based on disturbed, unhinged conspiracism. And secondly, the official government
*  of the state of Palestine recognized by the international community is not Hamas, as the
*  ambassador knows full well. But we, of course, have repeatedly heard the likes of Israeli
*  finance minister, for example, Bezalel Smocic, describe the civilian populations of Gaza and
*  the West Bank as Nazis. That itself is genocidal rhetoric. Describing civilian populations as
*  Nazis is the state they are fair game to be targeted. Now, the ambassador goes on to refer
*  to Israeli babies burned on October 7th. Here again we see on full display the strategy of
*  the Israeli state to repeatedly refer to atrocities which simply did not happen on October 7th. Look,
*  many civilians were killed and taken hostage by Hamas and other armed Palestinian groups. All
*  clearly war crimes. I've been very clear about that from the start. One Israeli baby was killed
*  on October 7th, shot through the door of a safe room. Obviously something to be condemned
*  without reservation, along, I would say, with the 36 Israeli children, that is those under 18,
*  killed on 7th of October. Every one of those killings is a terrible crime. It is simply not true,
*  not true, that Israeli babies were burned to death on 7th of October. That is a lie,
*  and we know that it's a lie because I'm referring to Israeli official statistics. By contrast,
*  huge numbers of Palestinian babies have actually been burned to death.
*  What a thing to have to say, what a thing to actually have to come out and say.
*  It's true. It's just, you say these things, but no words can do justice to what I'm actually
*  describing. You see, you know, some of you may have your own babies. You know, you see babies,
*  people, you know, your friends, your relatives, their little babies.
*  So many babies like that have been burned to death by the Israeli state. How do you even
*  absorb that? Around 15,000 plus Palestinian children have been killed. Now it's not exactly
*  clear how many of the 15,000 plus Palestinian children have been slaughtered are babies,
*  but clearly it's a very significant number, isn't it? Some buried under rubble and suffocated,
*  some burned to death, some of them immediately killed by the power of explosives, the fire and
*  the rubble falling on them. Some slowly cooked to death, some slowly suffocated to death.
*  Hideous thing to have to say that, isn't it? I don't want to say that kind of thing. I don't
*  talk about it. I find it horrific to talk about, but we can't shy away from the reality of what's
*  been unleashed against the Palestinians by the Israeli state. So this really is an example of
*  projection because the Israeli state has burned to death huge numbers of Palestinian babies.
*  Indeed, since that speech, every chance other young Palestinians have been burned to death.
*  Now you might ask why do they keep referring to false atrocities when actual atrocities did
*  happen on 7th October? What's the strategy there? It's very straightforward because you see,
*  because the Israeli state went on and knew it was going to go on to and has killed far, far,
*  far more people and will kill far more people than were killed by Hamas and other armed groups on
*  7th October. They had to make the argument that the forms, the way that Israelis were killed is
*  just infinitely worse and more sadistic and monstrous. So their form of violence is unhinged
*  and sadistic because they're like animals. Whereas the way we kill people, that's humane.
*  That is the point. That's the point of this whole strategy.
*  What's worse than burning babies to death or beheading babies, the other lie which we kept
*  hearing circulated, anyone who does that, you just think they're a monster. So they had to make a
*  distinction between the forms of violence on 7th October and the forms of violence the Israeli
*  state went on to inflict. And there's not enough of a distinction between the way that Israeli
*  civilians were killed and the way Palestinians have been killed. That's their problem. So then
*  they have to go, well, actually, this is why we're morally superior. But it's a lie. And they should
*  refer to war crimes that were actually committed, but they keep referring to war crimes that weren't.
*  That's the reason. Now the Israeli state has committed some of the worst atrocities in the
*  21st century. There's murderous bombing campaigns, shelling, bullets, deliberate starvation, the
*  deprivation of the basic essentials of life, the mass destruction of the medical system. We really
*  could go on. What is clear is that Israel as currently constituted will never accept
*  Palestinian national self-determination, which condemns those Palestinians under its domination,
*  many millions, between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea to eternal occupation and apartheid
*  or indeed to the fate of genocide. Now, as a palate cleanser, after listening to this individual,
*  let's listen to Palestine's UN ambassador Riyad Mansour.
*  Against all odds, we survived. Our flag flies high and proud in Palestine and across the globe
*  and on the campus of Columbia University. It has become a symbol
*  of the world, raised by all those who believe in freedom and its just rule.
*  By all those who can no longer stand idly by in the face of such utter injustice,
*  it is true that we will not disappear, but the lives lost cannot be restored.
*  I found it very emotional to listen to and I'm sure some of you teared up. I did when I first
*  listened to that. The Palestinian people have faced a deliberate attempt to snuff them out
*  and the solidarity they have received has clearly meant a huge amount beyond words to them in their
*  darkest hour. That alone is reason for us to keep yelling as loud as we can. Now let's hear how he
*  went on to sum up in that speech.
*  Now the UN General Assembly then voted. Let's have a watch.
*  The General Assembly is now voting on draft resolution A-ES10-L30-Revision1
*  entitled admission of new members to the United Nations. Will all delegations confirm that their
*  votes are accurately reflected on the screen? The voting has been completed. Please lock the machine.
*  Nice applause at the end there. So 143 nations voted in favour, just 9 voted against and just
*  25 abstained. I'm sure you'll be shocked to learn that of the 9 countries who voted against,
*  one of them was the United States of America as well, shamefully alongside the now right wing
*  led Latin American nation of Argentina and tiny nations like Micronesia which has a population of
*  just over 100,000 and Nauru population 12,000. Amongst the 25 nations which abstained, the UK
*  was one of them. What a disgrace. Total disgrace. Not least given not to belabor this point but
*  without Britain we wouldn't be in this mess. Another great victory there for the British Empire
*  which we're condemned to live in perpetually. Now Israel is a rogue state. You can see that from
*  the mass. It gets away with its behaviour because of the patronage and support of the global north,
*  principally the United States, the last remaining superpower, albeit a power in decline partly
*  because of this kind of thing. Now an obvious response here is well there's many other terrible
*  regimes on earth and that is true but it has long been the case that racist domination has been
*  understood as a particular horror in its own right, hence the particular opposition to apartheid
*  South Africa when again there were no shortage of other terrible regimes on earth at the time.
*  And that form of racist domination is so dangerous because of course it can lead to genocide
*  as we can see today. The fact is as I will keep saying Israel's lost. It has lost. It has lost
*  public opinion across the world not simply in states which long rejected it but in the states
*  which arm and support it. Now the US may have opposed for membership for Palestine but public
*  opinion in the US has swung dramatically against Israel and will continue to do so. The US will
*  find it increasingly very difficult to continue its policy of critical support for Israel and
*  therefore Israel will find it increasingly very difficult to continue to subject the Palestinian
*  people to these horrors. And beneath all these theatrics the Israeli state and its representatives
*  know it. They know where this is all headed. There will be a just peace based on equality for all.
*  That will happen in the lifetimes of many of you watching and listening. The real question is how
*  many more have to suffer and be slaughtered before that happens. Please like and subscribe. Do leave
