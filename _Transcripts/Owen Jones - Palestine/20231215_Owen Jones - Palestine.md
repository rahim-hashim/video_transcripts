# Israeli Dissidents EXPOSE Genocidal Language
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [December 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxzcKiSuJQw)
*  This is one of the most chilling things I think you'll watch about the current horror in Gaza.
*  It's been put together by peace activists in Israel who are so unbelievably courageous,
*  they need our support, they are going to be vindicated by history. It exposes the
*  genocidal rhetoric of Israeli politicians and officials. It's presented by Talia Ben Abba,
*  she's an Israeli refuse-nic, that is she refused to serve in the Israeli defense forces in protest
*  at the occupation. She was sent to prison for doing so, that's real courage. I had the honour
*  of interviewing her on this channel, please do have a listen to that. Now listen to this video,
*  listen carefully, it's been put together by the Refusa Solidarity Network that brings together
*  Israeli conscientious objectors. It's also led by donkeys who do political videos in the UK,
*  many of you may already be aware of them. My name is Talia Ben Abba, I'm a conscientious
*  objector. I refused to serve in the Israeli military because I refused to take part in the
*  occupation of the Palestinian people. I spent four months in military prison because of that.
*  I want people of the world to know the genocidal language that is being used by Israel's extremist
*  government.
*  It's an entire nation out there that is responsible. It's not true, this rhetoric about
*  civilians not aware, not involved, it's absolutely not true.
*  Netanyahu is using the word Amalek because he's referring to the biblical enemies of the Israeli
*  people that were described in the Bible. This is what the Bible says about Amalek,
*  do not spare them but put them to death, men, women, children and infants. It is the only nation
*  in the Bible that God orders the Jews to kill completely, so nothing is remembered of them.
*  Please, people around the world who care about this issue, share the words of these leaders
*  who are being a danger for Palestinians and Israeli hostages alike. We need to stop them,
*  we need to stop this war. Just listen to that, absorb those words. This isn't normal,
*  as Raz Segal, the Israeli-American scholar of genocide and Holocaust Studies put it when I
*  interviewed him, it's rare for intent to be so loudly communicated. Normally when regimes
*  commit terrible crimes they go to great lengths to cover it all up. Israeli leaders, officials
*  and media outlets, they're not doing that. Why, you might ask? Because they think they can get
*  away with it and indeed as things stand they will. Other regimes may fear war crimes, tribunals or
*  even the threat of Western military intervention. Indeed, if a state hostile to Western interests
*  committed even a fraction of Israel's atrocities, with rhetoric not as extreme as this, there would
*  be deafening demands for military intervention. It's striking that the US security adviser Jake
*  Sullivan today declared Israel has agreed to end widespread bombing and move towards precision
*  targeting of Hamas. That isn't happening on the ground by the way, but I beg your pardon, sorry,
*  what are you doing there? Just admitting casually that Israel has in fact been carpet bombing Gaza
*  for the last 10 weeks with the total support of the US which offers never-ending military aid,
*  other forms of aid and diplomatic as well as political cover. Now there are accusations,
*  just to keep us up to date with just the horrors unfolding, aired by Al Jazeera that in the Shaddia
*  Abu Ghazal school in Gaza, those sheltering inside were killed execution style by Israeli forces
*  including women, children and babies. Grave accusations of grave war crimes that must
*  be investigated as soon as possible, but of course Israel is preventing that from happening.
*  Israeli soldiers meanwhile fill themselves rummaging through private homes in Gaza,
*  destroying plastic figurines in toy stores, trying to set fire to food and water supplies,
*  chanting racist slogans as they dance around. Meanwhile as Ashok Swain, professor of peace and
*  conflict at Sala University in Sweden puts it, Israel is not only killing Palestinians of the
*  West Bank, putting them in jails, taking away their homes and land, also bulldozing their monuments
*  and memorials, all these in a single word he says, genocide. Again none of this is subtle, you may
*  have looked at atrocities throughout history when terrible crimes have been committed, when so many
*  innocent people have been slaughtered and you may have wondered, how is this possible? How did so
*  many people who regarded themselves as decent, moderate, humane, either say nothing at all or
*  even speak out in support of these crimes? Well now you know, now you know. We're living through
*  one of the great crimes of history and I firmly believe that you either speak out, you either do
*  something, however small, to try and stop this from happening so you can look future generations
*  in the eye and say I tried, I tried to fight this or you render yourselves complicit in what is a
*  monumental crime which will scream through history, harsh words perhaps but necessary words I don't
*  apologise for. So thank you to the courage of Israeli peace activists, they are on the right
*  side of history, they will be vindicated by history and their courage should be applauded.
