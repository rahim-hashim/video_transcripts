# Why Israel Slaughters Aid Workers - And How Media Outlets Covered It Up
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXXVGj05oIk)
*  Why is this crucial smoking gun evidence being disregarded?
*  This evidence, if the media was doing their job, should frame the entire discussion,
*  all the reporting, about how the Israeli army is operating in Gaza.
*  Whether it be this week the slaughter of seven aid workers,
*  whether it be the butchery of tens of thousands of Palestinians,
*  or the wiping of much of Gaza off the face of the earth,
*  the famine now enveloping Gaza,
*  IDF soldiers repeatedly posting their war crimes loudly and proudly,
*  and triumphantly celebrating the mass destruction of Gaza
*  as comic fodder for public amusement on the likes of TikTok.
*  You name it, I could go on.
*  Yesterday on social media, I challenged the Daily Telegraph's
*  Global Health Security editor about a piece that he had written entitled
*  What Happened to Israel's Rules of Engagement?
*  Now to be clear, this wasn't a puff piece he'd written for Israel.
*  It detailed terrible crimes committed by the Israeli state,
*  such as, as he rightly describes,
*  horrific video footage emerged from a captured Israeli drone
*  showing four young Palestinian men,
*  none of them armed or posing any obvious threat,
*  killed while casually strolling on wasteland
*  by a series of Israel Defense Forces IDF drone strike.
*  I personally watched the footage, by the way, and it was absolutely horrific,
*  like so much of the footage of the crimes I've seen committed by the Israeli state
*  against the Palestinian people in Gaza and beyond.
*  Now, the journalist also mentions how in January, quite correctly he mentions,
*  two members of an Al Jazeera crew were killed by the IDF
*  when they conducted a targeted strike on a car
*  with no plausible immediate threat post the IDF.
*  He also notes Israeli hostages, those three Israeli hostages,
*  who were gunned down whilst waving white flags as they shouted in Hebrew.
*  Itself, like the latest slaughter of foreign aid workers
*  who coordinated their movements with the Israeli military,
*  underlining that Palestinian civilians in Gaza don't stand a chance.
*  Now, the journalist in question asks,
*  So what is going wrong?
*  Why are so many innocent people being killed by the IDF
*  using targeted weapon systems?
*  He then says critics point to two overlapping factors,
*  poorly defined rules of engagement and a culture of impunity
*  that has been allowed to spread among IDF commanders on the ground.
*  Now, he says that the IDF chief of staff,
*  or the claims has repeatedly tried to rein in his staff,
*  but has been undermined by politicians who dehumanise Palestinians in Israel
*  and defend and even praise IDF and police excesses.
*  The journalist notes a Harret article,
*  which found the Israeli army had created kill zones
*  where anyone who crosses into them is shot,
*  thereby, rubbishing official Israeli claims that 9000 terrorists
*  have been killed since October because the Israeli state shoots
*  so many civilians and then claims after the event that they're terrorists.
*  So that 9000 out of 40,000 or so who is supposedly Hamas terrorist
*  is a bogus figure.
*  He notes how the IDF investigates itself and when Palestinians are killed,
*  issues only retrospective assertions of blame with little evidence to support.
*  He also goes on to say that when journalists were killed,
*  Israel altered its story repeatedly after the event,
*  then eventually alleged two had been members of a terrorist organisation
*  at some point with a document produced by the IDF to prove this theory,
*  this false claim was riddled with inconsistencies,
*  which when challenged, the IDF refused to explain.
*  Now, you may reasonably ask, why the hell would I challenge this journalist?
*  You'd read this article and conclude he's challenged the Israeli narrative,
*  far better than many journalists and clearly established they are committing war crimes.
*  That's the conclusion you come to if you read that article
*  because it's missing absolutely fundamental pieces of evidence
*  which should frame all coverage of the IDF.
*  And that's what I want to talk about
*  because this underlines one of the great journalistic scandals of our time.
*  Number one piece of evidence.
*  9th of October, the Israeli defence minister, Yoav Galant,
*  publicly declared that Israel was imposing a complete siege on Gaza.
*  No electricity, no food, no water, no fuel.
*  Everything is closed.
*  And he justified it with the overtly genocidal language.
*  We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly.
*  For those who then in bad faith go, oh, he means Hamas, human animals.
*  He's talking about cutting off all of the essentials of life
*  to an entire civilian population.
*  What he said there wasn't hidden away in a document somewhere.
*  He said it literally on camera in front of the entire world's media.
*  Why does this matter?
*  Because the guy in charge of the Israeli military,
*  who is one of three members of Israel's war cabinet,
*  made it clear that Israel was going to starve Gaza
*  and deprive its people of all of the essentials of life.
*  Which not only explains why, as the Foreign Secretary David Cameron
*  recently detailed, Israel has gone to vast lengths to stop aid from getting in,
*  using every possible route to delay it getting in,
*  ensuring there aren't enough land routes,
*  letting deranged Israeli protesters block it getting in,
*  whilst also making it possible to get around in Gaza
*  to the people who need it.
*  Destroying roads doesn't help, does it?
*  As well as all the checkpoints,
*  waging war on UNRWA, the main humanitarian agency,
*  masking aid workers, killing police officers
*  charged with protecting aid trucks
*  in defiance of even the Biden administration,
*  all while destroying local food production and agriculture.
*  Doesn't just explain that.
*  I would say that the official policy of mass starvation,
*  which was openly declared from the very start,
*  is pretty relevant to a discussion about why the Israeli state
*  deliberately struck an aid convoy, not once, not twice,
*  but three times as the survivors desperately moved from vehicle to vehicle,
*  as the Israeli military hunted them down
*  until every single one of them was dead,
*  with multiple aid agencies subsequently concluding
*  they could not protect the lives of their staff quite rationally
*  and therefore suspending their operations
*  while aid ships were turned away back to Cyprus,
*  ensuring starvation, more starvation.
*  That's the consequence.
*  So why isn't what the Israeli defence minister said
*  front and centre of this discussion, this coverage?
*  It gets worse. Oh, it gets worse.
*  10th of October, let's go back then.
*  Yov Galan, again, defence minister,
*  told Israeli troops on the Gaza border
*  that he had, quote unquote,
*  released all the restraints.
*  He also declared, Gaza won't return to what it was before.
*  We will eliminate everything.
*  If it doesn't take one day, it will take a week,
*  it will take weeks or even months.
*  We will reach all places.
*  On the 12th of October, Yov Galan, defence minister,
*  member of the War Cabinet, declared Israel was moving
*  to a full-scale response and that he had removed
*  every restriction.
*  Let's quote that again.
*  He said he had removed every restriction on Israeli forces.
*  What did he publicly tell the world in all these statements?
*  It isn't subtle.
*  We're not reading between the lines.
*  We're not relying on anonymous officials.
*  We're not relying on leaked documents.
*  We're listening to the public statements
*  of the man who runs the Israeli so-called war effort
*  in practice of genocidal onslaught.
*  He told us that Israel was gonna destroy Gaza.
*  I think Gaza won't return to what it was before.
*  We will destroy everything.
*  Covers destroying Gaza.
*  Guess what?
*  He wasn't bluffing.
*  The Israeli state has destroyed or severely damaged
*  most of Gaza, dropping the equivalent of several nuclear bonds
*  on an area the size of East London.
*  And that is before a proposed invasion of Ra'afah,
*  that is with even more damage to come.
*  And they are still attacking targets all across Gaza.
*  He also made it clear by saying he'd released all restraints
*  on Israeli troops and removed every restriction
*  on Israeli forces that he was giving the Israeli army
*  total impunity to do as it wished.
*  What other interpretation is there of his comments?
*  He said those words.
*  Unambiguously, he left no room for ambiguity,
*  non-firmness interpretation.
*  All you had to do from the very start is listen
*  to what Israeli leaders and officials said.
*  That's what I did.
*  I'm not a genius.
*  I'm not a prophet.
*  I didn't have any special unique insight.
*  All I did is take Israeli leaders at their word.
*  I believed them when they said what they were gonna do.
*  And they went on to do to Gaza exactly what they promised.
*  To the letter.
*  They starved the population.
*  They were the world's biggest
*  and the fastest collapse in the nutritional status
*  of a population ever recorded.
*  They raised Gaza to the ground.
*  They let Israeli soldiers do exactly as they wished
*  with no consequences.
*  That's why in October, I penned a column for The Guardian
*  that headline entirely reflected the point of that article.
*  Why did I write it?
*  It was a marker.
*  Because I knew as the scale of the entirely promised calamity
*  became so obscene, so nauseating, so repellent,
*  except to the most sociopathic in our midst,
*  who it turns out do exist.
*  A lot of cheerleaders of this atrocity would go,
*  oh no, what's happened?
*  This is awful.
*  What on earth is Israel doing?
*  I didn't sign up for this.
*  Yes, you did.
*  You see, you people have no excuse.
*  None, literally zero.
*  I've read out a fraction, by the way,
*  a fraction of the statements issued by Israeli leaders
*  and officials.
*  It is unbelievably rare for a state determined
*  to commit an atrocity of this scale
*  to be so open and honest and frank about it
*  from the very start.
*  Exceptionally rare.
*  And that is why I am so frustrated
*  with what superficially seems like a completely reasonable
*  telegraph article, where you might expect me to go,
*  well, even though it's the telegraph, well done,
*  solid journalism, Israel being held to account.
*  Wherever the quotes from the Minister of Defense
*  from day one explaining what Israel was going to do.
*  He's in charge of the army.
*  He sets the rules.
*  He said clearly Gaza was gonna be starved,
*  not just starved, all the essentials of life stopped.
*  He said they were gonna destroy Gaza.
*  And he said very clearly he's removing all restraints
*  and restrictions on the IDF, pretty relevant
*  when discussing rules of engagement, I'd say.
*  What we are talking about in general
*  is one of the most scandalous episodes
*  in the history of Western journalism.
*  Entirely deliberate, by the way.
*  I'm not suggesting this was an accident.
*  And that is saying something.
*  From the very start, all discussion
*  about Israel's onslaught against Gaza
*  should have been framed if we had a functioning media
*  around what Israeli leaders and officials said and promised.
*  But that didn't happen.
*  It's like we've lived in a parallel universe
*  where those pronouncements are just ignored.
*  Like they're irrelevant.
*  Like they were just hyperbole, maybe.
*  Maybe they were just letting off some steam.
*  Rather than being literally the Israeli state
*  very clearly saying what they were gonna do.
*  And we're treated to, at best, a debate
*  about whether Israel's so-called military response
*  is proportionate or not, where we can agree to disagree.
*  As a genocidal frenzy, which was explicitly promised
*  from the start, slaughters the Palestinians of Gaza.
*  We really could go on, by the way.
*  Honestly, as I've said, a fraction.
*  This is a fraction.
*  I'm just talking about the Minister of Defense
*  because he's in charge of the army, pretty relevant.
*  Let's take Giora Eiland.
*  He's an Israeli general, the former head
*  of the Israeli National Security Council
*  and an advisor to the defense minister.
*  When I read out some of these quotes,
*  I think some of you are gonna go,
*  come on, he didn't really say that.
*  That's too extreme.
*  That's like so fanatical and deranged and unhinged.
*  Like it wouldn't make it into a film
*  about some sort of horror because it would be seen
*  as too one-dimensionally evil.
*  Bad luck, this is real.
*  You're not in a film.
*  This is real.
*  He backed Israel's siege at the very start.
*  Do you know what he said, though?
*  He said, it's not enough.
*  In order to make the siege effective,
*  we have to prevent others from giving assistance to Gaza.
*  What was that he said there, general?
*  Advisor to the defense minister,
*  former head of Israel's National Security Council.
*  Should we just focus on what you said there?
*  We have to prevent others from giving assistance to Gaza.
*  You don't need to be a conspiracy theorist, do you?
*  Process those words when considering
*  the World Central Kitchen Massacre
*  and the slaughter of around 200 aid workers.
*  He goes on, the people should be told
*  that they have two choices, to stay and to starve or to leave.
*  If Egypt and other countries prefer
*  that these people will perish in Gaza, this is their choice.
*  Oh, real charm of this guy, isn't he?
*  By the way, believe it or not,
*  this guy is regarded as a relatively
*  moderate person in Israel.
*  So that's a good thing.
*  A deliberately moderate person in Israel.
*  So that's the point, a deliberate strategy of starvation
*  to drive the Palestinian population out
*  from the horse's mouth, to make life so impossible
*  that Palestinians die en masse,
*  except for those who somehow make it out.
*  Genocide, I mean, that's why it's in the South Africa's case,
*  as I'll go through.
*  These are all inside of his case against Israel
*  in the International Court of Justice.
*  In other interviews, he said,
*  a country can be attacked in a much broader way
*  to bring the country to the brink of dysfunction.
*  This is the necessary outcome of events in Gaza.
*  Really helpful, this guy, just putting it all on record.
*  He then said that Israel has no interest
*  in the Gaza Strip being rehabilitated,
*  and this is an important point
*  that needs to be made clear to the Americans.
*  He also said that if we ever want to see the hostages alive,
*  the only way is to create a severe
*  humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
*  Honestly, if you don't believe me, just Google this.
*  You're shocked, because you're thinking,
*  why isn't this just all over the media?
*  Yeah, well, it's time to ask some searching questions,
*  I would say, about the media, if this is maybe a surprise.
*  He goes on to say that water should be targeted,
*  noting that water in Gaza comes from wells
*  with salt water and fit for consumption.
*  They have water treatment plants.
*  Israel should hit those plants.
*  When the entire world says, we've gone insane,
*  oh, and this is a humanitarian disaster,
*  we will say it's not an end, it's a means.
*  He's declared the state of Israel has no choice
*  but to make Gaza a place that is temporarily
*  or permanently impossible to live in.
*  He denounced the idea that there are poor women in Gaza,
*  as in innocent women, because they are all the mothers,
*  sisters, or wives of Hamas murderers.
*  This was, as I say, all cited in South Africa's case,
*  alleging genocide at the ICJ.
*  For good reason, you're listening
*  to very overt genocidal language.
*  Now, the failure of Western media outlets and politicians
*  to frame the conduct of the war
*  around what Israeli leaders and officials said and promised
*  is an act of unforgivable deceit.
*  You were lied to.
*  Lies by omission are lies.
*  You were sold a narrative which was false.
*  We can all see listening to what Israeli leaders
*  and officials said was a perfectly reliable guide
*  to predict what would happen to Gaza, as has happened.
*  Now, just this week, the Guardian newspaper
*  reported speaking to nine doctors, all but one
*  foreign volunteers, who reported treating
*  a steady stream of children, elderly people, and others
*  who were clearly not competent with single bullet wounds
*  to their head or chest.
*  These doctors added the types and locations of the wounds
*  and accounts of Palestinians who brought children
*  to the hospital led them to believe the victims were
*  directly targeted by Israeli troops,
*  deliberately shooting children in the head
*  and the chest to kill them.
*  This is corroborated by the testimony
*  of a Canadian doctor back in mid-February
*  who told the Los Angeles Times of children aged between five
*  and eight being carried to the emergency room by their parents.
*  All had single sniper shots to the head.
*  Children, kids aged between five and eight,
*  deliberately shot in the head by Israeli snipers.
*  This was inevitable based on what Israeli leaders
*  and officials and media outlets have said and promised
*  from the start, including those who went on Israeli television
*  calling for children to be targeted on the grounds
*  that they would grow up as terrorists.
*  This brings me to the killing of the world central kitchen
*  aid workers, 200 aid workers, overwhelmingly Palestinians,
*  butchered, barely a murmur.
*  But killing Westerners, well, hold on a minute,
*  lines crossed there.
*  And that's not to belittle the horror of what's happened.
*  All of their loved ones are grieving over a terrible crime
*  committed against them, but it should not take.
*  The blood of Westerners being spilled to prove Israel
*  is on the rampage committing some of the worst atrocities
*  of the 21st century.
*  Here's what we know.
*  World central kitchen, supposedly there to fill the vacuum
*  left by UNRWA, the main humanitarian agency in Gaza,
*  which Israel has sought to liquidate
*  through unevident smears and the mass slaughter of its staff
*  was working hand in glove with the IDF.
*  In this case, they offered their coordinates
*  to the Israeli military in an area designated as
*  de-conflicted, that is free of conflict.
*  They were traveling in clearly marked humanitarian vehicles
*  inscribed in big letters with world central kitchen.
*  They were accompanied with three former British soldiers
*  working as security guards, a crucial detail,
*  because the supposed justification for wiping out
*  this aid convoy is that a terrorist was possibly present,
*  as though these former soldiers were just accidentally
*  traveling with a terrorist.
*  Turns out no such terrorist was present
*  because whoever they are, if they even exist,
*  they weren't even in the convoy.
*  What happened is a drone using very precisely targeted
*  missiles hit the first car.
*  As the injured and I would say deeply traumatized
*  at this point survivors desperately scrambled
*  to a second car, another precisely targeted missile
*  hit them.
*  And then after their final journey to a third car,
*  another precisely targeted missile hit them,
*  killing all of them.
*  They were chased from car to car.
*  All of this happening over distance of around a kilometer
*  and a half until every last one was dead.
*  As the Telegraph reports, according to unnamed
*  Israeli security sources who briefed the local media,
*  they were dropped, these missiles, in succession
*  from a Hermes 450 drone with sophisticated night sights
*  and deliberately guided down onto the three clearly marked
*  humanitarian vehicles traveling below.
*  Even though the drone pilots would have both the authority
*  and technical means to swerve the bombs away
*  until the very last moment, they chose not to.
*  It is technically impossible for that to be a mistake.
*  That is a clearly deliberately targeted attack.
*  Are we seriously suggesting for one second
*  that after three, during the course of three strikes,
*  they didn't know what they were doing,
*  even though they could see who they were targeting?
*  Wait for the latest explanation.
*  IDF sources have told Israeli newspaper, Haritz,
*  that the bombing of the convoy was not a communication mishap
*  but commanders and units in the field
*  ignoring instructions and disobeying orders.
*  Sorry, what exactly is the claim here?
*  That the IDF, far from presenting itself
*  as one of the most sophisticated and modern armies on earth,
*  is just a rank tank collection of warlords
*  doing exactly what they want.
*  If it's true that some form of mutiny happened here
*  in the army in order, in this case, to specifically
*  just wipe out an entire aid convoy,
*  the Israeli army is gonna have to immediately arrest
*  and charge them all with the gravest of crimes.
*  I suppose that will happen any second now, won't it?
*  You see, this really is the time for Occam's razor to shine,
*  which is that the Israeli state made it clear from the start
*  it was going to starve Gaza's population.
*  It was going to reduce Gaza to ruin.
*  It was going to allow Israeli soldiers
*  to have total impunity.
*  And when you're looking for explanations
*  as to why an aid convoy coordinated
*  with the Israeli military in a deconflicted zone
*  on a pre-approved route manned by former British soldiers
*  was targeted, that is what you have to look at.
*  The failure, the refusal to frame the coverage
*  of what has happened to Gaza based on what was promised
*  from the start is a scandal.
*  And that should tell you everything you need to know
*  about the way, with courageous exceptions,
*  the British media, the Western media operates,
*  because they didn't tell you the truth.
*  They lied to you.
*  And when you look at the horrors now being inflicted,
*  there's your answer.
