# Jewish Director SMEARED Over Gaza - Jonathan Glazer's Stand For Peace
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [March 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNYWSYdxuIc)
*  Those who are apologists for Israel's mass slaughter of Gaza, one of the great crimes of our age,
*  know they have no moral high ground, deep down at least. As tens of thousands are slaughtered,
*  over 14,000 of them Palestinian children, as many more are maimed, the vast majority displaced,
*  and of course traumatised. With a nether-ending litany of war crimes as Gaza is essentially white
*  from the face of the earth. So all they've got is deflection, smears, distortion, outright shameless
*  lies. Now this is a point I've been making all the way through this obscenity, but it is worth
*  repeating. Which brings me to the latest victim of those who are as morally disgraced as they are
*  shameless. It was the Oscars this weekend and Jonathan Glazer is the director of The Zone of
*  Interest, a new German language film based on the Martin Amis novel about the Nazi commandant
*  Rudolf Hoss and his wife who lived near Auschwitz concentration camp where around a million of the
*  six million total Jews who were murdered in the Holocaust were exterminated. Now the film has
*  raved reviews, it won an Oscar, and so Glazer took to the stage for his acceptance speech.
*  Now Glazer, importantly, is Jewish. His ancestors were Jews who fled Ukraine and Bessarabia,
*  a former region in Eastern Europe which straddles modern-day Moldova and Ukraine. They fled of
*  course the horrible vicious anti-Semitism that existed. On the stage with him were the producers
*  Len Blavatnik and James Wilson, both also Jewish. Wilson himself last once said publicly,
*  there's obviously things going on in the world in Gaza that remind us starkly of the sort of
*  selective empathy that there seems to be groups of innocent people being killed that we care about
*  less than other innocent people. Well indeed. Now let's just hear what Jonathan Glazer.
*  Thank you so much, I'm gonna read, I'm afraid. Thank you to Academy for this honour and to our
*  partners A24, Film4, Access and the Polish Film Institute, to the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum
*  for their trust and guidance, to my producers, actors, collaborators. All our choices were made
*  to reflect and confront us in the present, not to say look what they did then, rather look what we
*  do now. Our film shows where dehumanization leads at its worst. It shaped all of our past and present.
*  Right now we stand here as men who refute their Jewishness and the Holocaust being
*  hijacked by an occupation which has led to conflict for so many innocent people.
*  Whether the victims of October the 7th in Israel or the ongoing attack
*  on Gaza, all the victims of this dehumanization. How do we resist?
*  Alexandra Bistron Kaladzi Hƒçek, the girl who glows in the film as she did in Life, chose to.
*  I dedicate this to her memory and her resistance. Thank you.
*  Firstly I think the reception there is striking, whoops and cheers. Now there is a culture of fear
*  and silence about speaking out over this atrocity but you can see that despite all that, strong
*  opposition to Israel's onslaught permeates the very elite of the arts. I would also note that he
*  didn't just mention those slaughtered in Gaza but also the victims of October the 7th. That didn't
*  protect him from the bad faith smears which came his way. So what happened next? Well unsurprisingly
*  Iglaiza was targeted and what those people who targeted him did is lie about him maliciously so.
*  Batsheh Ungar Sargon is the opinion editor of Newsweek, admittedly a publication which in practice
*  has stopped being a credible news outlet and is now just some weird hard right rag. She tweeted
*  I simply cannot fathom the moral of what in someone's soul that leads them to win an award for a movie
*  about the Holocaust and then with the platform given to them to accept that award by saying we
*  stand here as men who refute their Jewishness. Now what happened next? Well the news was that
*  stand here as men who refute their Jewishness. Now what I find amazing even though she works
*  for some rag, she's supposed to be a journalist. What she wrote there is a straightforward case of
*  lie by omission. Iglaiza didn't say we stand here as men who refute their Jewishness, he said
*  right now we stand here as men who refute their Jewishness and the Holocaust being hijacked by
*  an occupation which has led to conflict for so many innocent people. It's completely and utterly
*  different from what she's claimed. That tweet is still up. How shameless is that? Now the community
*  note feature of Twitter is hit and miss but she did get community noted explaining the quote has
*  been shortened and displayed out context. It's just incredible behaviour. Then there's John Podoretz,
*  the editor of commentary, a magazine I studied at length in my postgraduate studies when I was
*  researching the rise of the US right. It shifted from being a supposedly left of centre publication
*  to playing a pivotal role in the rise of US neoconservatism. He tweeted
*  How shameless can you get? It's just lying, just flagrant lying, dishonesty in order to justify
*  a truly hideous claim against someone describing the Jewish director of an Oscar-winning film
*  about the Holocaust as one of Judaism's historical villains because he opposes a terrible injustice
*  which killed so many innocent people in which he specifically spoke about those
*  killed including Israelis. Now let's look at the Anti-Defamation League in the US which
*  supposedly exists to fight anti-Semitism but as you can see here in practice conflates that with
*  uncritical support for the state of Israel. It tweeted Israel is not hijacking Judaism or the
*  Holocaust by defending itself against genocidal terrorists. Glazer's comments at the Oscars are
*  both factually incorrect and morally reprehensible. They minimise the Shoah and excuse terrorism of
*  the most heinous kind. While Israel's minister of diaspora affairs and combating anti-Semitism
*  Amichai Chikli, a member of the ruling Likud party said, and I'm sorry to have to read it out
*  because he's actually off the charts, vile this. Glazer was the next useful idiot who stuck a knife
*  into the back of his people and in the backs of women who were raped and then shot in the head
*  afterwards in children who were slaughtered in their beds in entire families who were burned
*  alive. There was no forgiving such vile types, auto-antisemitic Jews from Judith Butler until
*  last night's idiot but there's no reason to get excited over the phenomenon it has accompanied
*  us for generations. It's just worth absorbing that for a minute. Glazer firstly spoke about
*  the victims of 7th October in his speech suggesting he stuck a knife in the backs of fellow Jews and
*  those killed in atrocities committed that day. I mean, frankly his violent imagery is just beyond
*  appalling because he opposes, to quote about the language, children being slaughtered in their
*  beds and entire families being burned alive regardless of whether they are Palestinian,
*  Israeli or indeed any other ethnicity or nationality. Literally the point of what he's
*  saying is more consistency is universal humanism. 36 Israeli kids were killed on 7th October and
*  that's truly appalling in its own right while over 14,000 Palestinian children have been killed
*  since, many of them I would note while they were lying in their beds with Israeli missiles blowing
*  up their homes and on that note entire families have been burned alive over and over again in
*  Gaza, entire bloodlines wiped off on the face of the earth in just that manner. This constant attempt
*  to smear Jewish people as antisemites because they object to the Israeli state claiming to be acting
*  in their name as it kills innocent people and oppresses an entire people is just so revolting.
*  The way he's reframing this minister, a speech based on universal humanity on opposing any
*  innocents being slaughtered as something violent and hateful, it just shows how these people rely
*  on turning the world upside down to justify their own moral bankruptcy. War is peace to them, love
*  is hatred. Let's hear instead the thoughts of progressive Jewish thinkers and activists like
*  Zimmerman, co-founder of If Not Now, an organisation of US Jews opposed to Israeli apartheid,
*  who said the Zone of Interest is a brilliant chilling film about those who choose to tune out
*  the horrors of genocide happening next door so it's unsurprising that those who are actively
*  invested in averting a collective gaze away from Israel's genocide are losing it. The pro-Israel
*  narrative claims the memory of the Holocaust is a trump card to say that Jews are history's ultimate
*  victims and capable of perpetrating evil but also justified if they do. Never again permits all
*  violence to stop another Holocaust, exactly what Glazer rejects. She also adds, contrary to the
*  lies and smears of Israel's propagandists, Glazer is part of a significant growing Jewish voice
*  around across the world that opposes the abuse of Jewish history to justify Israel's campaign of
*  dehumanisation and genocide against the Palestinian people. We are not fringe. Now in The Nation,
*  Dave Zirin wrote a piece entitled Jonathan Glazer's brave Oscar speech represents the best of
*  Judaism. He refers to the well-known adage, two Jews, three opinions, but adapts it to,
*  today though, the Zionist catchphrase could now be, a million Jews, no opinions. Too many Zionists
*  were brought to no disagreement with Israel's war on Gaza and are willing to distort the truth to
*  defend it. I have to say that on that, is there any other example of an attempt to so vigorously
*  police the borders of a minority in political grounds in this fashion? Indeed, there was a
*  piece by the former editor of the Jerusalem Post last November which suggested literally excluding
*  anti-war Jewish voices from the very concept of Jewishness. Now in The Nation, he notes that Glazer
*  was the only Oscar winner to say anything about Gaza, describing Hollywood as a pep squad,
*  progressive except for Palestine, adding, as Jews our tradition of debate could not be more rich.
*  It says so much about the podoretzas of the world and how alien they truly are to Jewish tradition
*  that they want to take this tradition of debate and put a stake in its heart.
*  Well, very eloquently put. Now, a few things. The Oscars included speeches from winners,
*  the official Oscars that is, on their YouTube channel, but not Jonathan Glazer's. I just want
*  to add that while it's commendable that Jonathan Glazer implicitly, the two producers who stood
*  by him, made this statement, I don't believe Jewish people have any special responsibility
*  to speak out on this compared to any of the rest of us. It is of course inspiring, particularly in
*  the US, how we see this new Jewish left. I feel that that's very exciting personally because the
*  left as a whole owes so much to the contribution of progressive Jews. There wouldn't be a left
*  as we understand it without them. That's just a basic historical and political fact, which has
*  not been lost to many anti-Semites, not least the Nazis themselves. But everyone's got responsibility
*  to speak out. And clearly, as you can hear from the weeping and cheering, there's a lot of
*  popularity for that stance among people who have big platforms, who can influence a lot of other
*  people. But I think a lot of them are scared. You can see why the huge vile attack on Jonathan
*  Glazer is intended as a punishment beating. It's intended to deter anyone else from speaking out
*  so many public figures feel they should say something, anything, but then they see what
*  happens to an Oscar winning Jewish director and they're like, I just can't go through with that.
*  Well, there is safety in numbers and they can't take us all down. I would know that many celebrities
*  at the Oscars did wear red pins to support Gaza, Billy Eilish, Phineas O'Connell, Mark Ruffalo,
*  Rami Yousef at the behest of artists for Ceasefire. A statement written by them also had
*  signatures including Cate Blanchett, Ben Affleck, Jennifer Lopez and Bradley Cooper. More generally,
*  it just underlies what we're up against. The way apologists for this appalling crime and the
*  root of it, the historic oppression and resulting dehumanization of Palestinian behaviour, is so
*  indicative. Lies, unapologetic lies, that is, distortion, smears, turning reality on its head.
*  Well, I'll keep saying it because it's true, the likes of Jonathan Glazer will be remembered
*  kindly by history. Those who are apologists for mass murder, oppression, terrible injustice,
*  not so much. Please like and subscribe, do share the video, do subscribe, keep the show
