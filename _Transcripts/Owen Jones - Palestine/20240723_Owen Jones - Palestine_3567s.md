# Israel's Occupation DESTROYED By Palestinian Diplomat - w. Majed Bamya
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [July 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=girQdxNLZP4)
*  Now, the International Court of Justice, the world's top court, of course, issued a historic
*  ruling last week. This was an advisory opinion, but what that means in practice is how these,
*  the top world's judges understand international law, what international law says. And it's
*  on the question of Israel's occupation of Palestine, which is the longest belligerent
*  occupation in modern times. And this is at the request of the UN General Assembly at
*  the end of 2022. So they were asked to do this before the current horrors began, of
*  course, last October. Now, there's no better person for me to just talk this through than
*  the brilliant Ambassador Majed Bamiyyeh, who is Deputy Permanent Observer of the State
*  of Palestine at the United Nations. So a very longstanding Palestinian diplomat based in
*  New York. Firstly, it's great to see you. How are you doing?
*  Good to see you. We've known better times, but hopefully better times are ahead.
*  Yes, absolutely. And I think, well, we'll talk about that. And one of the things I think I'm
*  going to talk to you about is the way public opinion has shifted in many of the states which
*  support and arm Israel and the implications that has for an often very lonely fight that you and
*  other fellow diplomats have been fighting over the last few years. I just want to start actually
*  just by talking about your role there. The United Nations, of course, represents supposedly all the
*  states that exist in the world. Palestine has been denied full statehood. In fact, the United
*  States used its veto on the Security Council to stop a bid for Palestine to get full statehood.
*  Could you just explain, being a diplomat in these circumstances, just tell us about your role?
*  What's it like being a diplomat in New York having to make the case for Palestinian rights
*  when you're up against a state with, let's be honest, which has the power and patronage of the
*  world's only superpower, as well as other powerful states? Just like what are the difficulties,
*  the challenges you have to face? So, you know, when you're a diplomat, your role is to represent
*  your country's position and interests. In the case of a Palestinian diplomat, you have the
*  added weight of representing a national cause and being faced with repeated tragedies. The worst one
*  may be in our modern history being the one unfolding today in Gaza. And when we are at the UN,
*  there's a battle of narratives that's part of our role to present the evidence, the facts,
*  the arguments in the hope to shift mentalities within the UN and among governments, but also
*  among public opinions because these expressions are public. There's also the role of legislating
*  in order to preserve the rights of the Palestinian people and to preserve the
*  essentials for a just and lasting peace, which is ending occupation and the freedom for the
*  people and avoid those who are trying to tamper with the rules of international law or adapt them
*  to the illegality instead of ensuring that the illegality ends in order to uphold the rules.
*  And this is a place where you can mobilize the world as a whole. But of course, as you said,
*  not all players have the same rights in these forums and some tend to abuse some of the rights
*  that are given to them because of historical reasons. Our membership bid was blocked by a
*  veto despite having overwhelming support in the Security Council. And the answer came from the
*  General Assembly where 143 UN member states called on the Security Council to reverse its decision,
*  meaning that the country that used the veto no longer resorts to the veto and that Palestine be
*  welcomed as a member state with equal rights to all other in the international community as a
*  contribution to ending occupation and having just and lasting peace in the Middle East.
*  Jason Vale And actually, before I ask you about the
*  International Court of Justice, it can be, I mean, you make a really important point there that
*  we can overstate, I suppose, the weakness relatively of Palestine because actually
*  most of the world's countries recognize Palestine as a state. And we've just recently seen
*  Spain, Ireland, Norway recognize Palestine as a state. So, I mean, there is actually,
*  I know the US is the world's hegemon, but Palestine has been recognized by most states, hasn't it?
*  Ali Kassim It has been by a huge number of countries,
*  over three quarters of the world countries have recognized us. And the last ones to have recognized
*  us, as you said, Spain, Ireland, Norway and Slovenia, and just before that, Jamaica, Barbados,
*  Bahamas, Trinidad and Tobago, and then Armenia also recognized the state of Palestine more recently.
*  So this is the last of several waves of recognition because countries are conscious
*  that this is an injustice, a profound injustice, that the Palestinian people have been deprived
*  of the right to self-determination, including the right to the independent state, that nothing can
*  justify such a prolonged deprivation of an entire nation of their right to life, to liberty,
*  of dignity. And therefore they want to contribute and recognition is one of the forms of contribution
*  required. The second is to advance accountability and upholding the rules of international law,
*  including holding accountable the country that has kept us in shackles for so long.
*  S1 The international justice, let's just talk about that ruling. So Israel's defenders would go,
*  advise your opinion, it's not legally binding, doesn't matter. What would you say when they say that?
*  Ali Kassim Apparently nothing is legally binding. The UN
*  Charter, which is supposed to be one of the most important documents ever produced by humanity,
*  the Geneva Convention, the Universal Declaration for Human Rights, of course use advisory opinion,
*  but that's an authoritative opinion. What does it mean, advisory opinion? It just means it's not a
*  contentious case. It's not a case between two states that have recognized the jurisdiction of
*  the court simply because Israel refuses to acknowledge the jurisdiction of the court.
*  It means that the General Assembly is asking the court, guide us, what does the law say?
*  And so we're asking the highest court in the land to tell us what international law says.
*  And international law is binding. And therefore the interpretation of how that law applies to a
*  specific case by the highest court has authority. So there's no contortion there. And I'd like to
*  set determination that the court relied on is in the Charter. It is a peremptory norm of international
*  law, one of the most fundamental norms on which our international law based order relies. And so
*  countries have an option. Either they are ready to sacrifice all these rules, all these lessons of
*  history that we translated into rules, all the institutions that we built to protect these rules
*  and accept the Israeli narrative that all of this is simply anti-Semitism, that the ICJ is
*  anti-Semitic, that the ICC is anti-Semitic, that the General Assembly is anti-Semitic, that the
*  Security Council is anti-Semitic, that the Human Rights Council is anti-Semitic, that the ICRC is
*  anti-Semitic, that the UN agencies are anti-Semitic, that the Secretary General is anti-Semitic.
*  Or we can accept that this is the way for Israel to try to evade the law, to project itself as a
*  state above the law. And what we've always repeated is if you allow that, if you allow Israel
*  for any reason to be a state above the law, it will continue conducting itself as an outlaw state.
*  And so, no, what the ICJ says is based on binding rules. And we heard countries trying to evade
*  their obligations by contesting Security Council resolutions even, not only the ICJ advisor opinion
*  saying is a resolution binding or not. So we have to draw a line. This is the time. Given what
*  happened in Gaza, we know what is the price of giving a pass to countries from upholding
*  the rules of international law. And this opinion places the entire international community, not
*  only Israel, in front of their obligations and what they need to do under international law as
*  obligations they committed themselves to and that they need to apply to Israel as they would do in
*  other situations. Let's talk about that ICJ ruling. I mean, for you, what is the most,
*  was it what you expected? I mean, the reason I say that is actually I noticed people I've interviewed
*  who were experts on international law and they were surprised actually at how far the ruling went.
*  And actually the number, you know, the fact that many of the rulings were near unanimous, but also
*  all of the rulings had a massive majority. I think 12 to 4 was the narrowest margin.
*  11 to 4 and 12 to 3. Sorry, 11 to 4, of course it's 15. Sorry, my math's terrible there.
*  What for you is, I mean, just overall before we talk about some of the specifics, what is the most
*  important, what's the most important significance that represents a kind of departure that moves
*  this along that is most important for Palestinian claims for justice? What's the kind of key,
*  this is what's fundamentally now has changed. So the heart of the resolution, and I think some
*  are misrepresenting it, is not that settlements are illegal because, I mean, that has been repeated,
*  including by this court before. It's important, it's part of the advisory opinion, but the heart
*  of the advisory opinion is that the occupation itself, the occupation as a whole on the entirety
*  of the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, is illegal. And once you say that,
*  once you say it's an internationally wrongful act, you say that the obligation is to bring it to an
*  end. And the court has added to that as rapidly as possible. It means that we should all mobilize
*  immediately in order to bring this occupation to an end as rapidly as possible. This is the
*  most important element. And then we can discuss how it arrived to that conclusion based on a lot
*  of illegalities that surrounded this occupation and that show that its very purpose was illegal.
*  I mean, this is kind of a critical point, isn't it? This is about annexation, isn't it? I mean,
*  let's talk about this point about annexation and what the court found when it came to annexation.
*  So you have two pillars on which the court based its opinion and a third extremely important
*  element. The two pillars is what Israel is doing is annexation in violation of the principle of
*  the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force, which is a principle that
*  has its reflection in the UN Charter, which is a key principle in the modern era, the post-Second
*  World War era, and that we absolutely need to uphold. So they're seeing that what Israel is
*  doing is to try to create an irreversible reality through the settlements, through the infrastructure,
*  through the demolition of homes, through all these policies and practices with the aim to seize the
*  land unlawfully, to take over the land and integrate it to the territory of Israel. And
*  the court is crystal clear in determining that we have a situation of annexation of large parts of
*  the OPP. The second pillar on which it will reach the conclusion that there's illegality of the
*  occupation is the denial of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination,
*  which is also enshrined in the UN Charter, which is also a critical principle for the world as we
*  know it. And therefore, these are among the two greatest violations that you can be responsible
*  of. And then there's a third element that the court is looking at, which are the violations of
*  human rights and international humanitarian law, and notably in a discriminatory manner.
*  And it reaches the conclusion that what Israel is doing violates Article III of the Convention on
*  the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, and the Article III pertains to
*  and condemns racial segregation and or apartheid, and calls to eradicate, to prevent, to prohibit,
*  and eradicate such practices. I mean, all of these have been discussed, debated. There's a lot of
*  evidence out there from the UN, from civil society, Israeli, Palestinian, international,
*  including among the most respected institutions and bodies. But having the Qahayist Court make
*  determinations on these aspects, on these fundamental aspects, tells you the level of
*  illegality that was reached by Israel. And the court did not yet have to look in this situation
*  on genocide because the question, these questions were posed in a different context, and it has a
*  case that was brought by South Africa to look into genocide, so that is happening in parallel.
*  So you're talking about the worst, the most serious violations that we can imagine in our humanity,
*  fundamental rules that are being breached, and the court therefore concludes that not only the
*  policies and practices are illegal, but an occupation that is annexationist, that aims to
*  deprive a nation of its right to self-determination, is by itself illegal, and therefore it's not enough
*  to end the settlements or to end other discrimination or the violations of human rights.
*  You need to end the occupation itself because itself is illegal. So this includes, we talk about
*  settlements, which have, that's already been determined that they violate the Geneva Conventions.
*  But what we're discussing here is, so incentives are provided for Israeli citizens to settle the
*  West Bank, as well as a land policy of favoring Israelis over Palestinians, and that occupying
*  powers have an obligation to provide sufficient resources to not occupy power, that Israel's use
*  of natural resources is inconsistent with its obligations under international law because it
*  diverts those resources to settlers and to Israeli civilians. Yes, so what you have, the rules that
*  we have, whether the charter, or even IHL rules that define the laws of occupation, they aim at
*  avoiding a phenomena that is well known, that was there before the Second World War and after the
*  Second World War, and that humanity was aiming to bring to an end, which is colonialism. Yeah. And
*  occupation has rules governing it, but colonialism is completely prohibited. And the reality of how
*  Israel has conducted its occupation is evidently colonial in nature. And so the court is looking at
*  some of these practices from the possible transfer of Palestinians, the disposition and displacement
*  of the population, and at the transfer of Israel's own population into the occupied territory,
*  which is considered a war crime under the Geneva Convention. And Israel tries to bring in the
*  religious explanation to the settlements enterprise, to that colonization of land.
*  But that's not how the law applies. It is not based on your religion.
*  It's not based on your religion or origin that we're looking at. We're looking at your nationality
*  and the land and how it is attributed. So people could say, well, Nazareth is in Israel,
*  and the Palestinian population is Muslim and Christian, and therefore Nazareth, given its
*  significance, should be in the Palestinian state. And then again, based on other historical claims,
*  you would read all the borders of all the countries in the world based on these kind of elements. So
*  we have to abide by the law and again, not granting a pass and not accepting a narrative
*  that would change the rules based on the identity of the perpetrators of
*  violations or of the victims of these violations. So the court was extremely
*  clear in denouncing the settlement activity, but also all the policies around it,
*  the demolition of homes, whether for punitive reasons or for using the fact that people lack
*  permits. And the court shows that if it's punitive, then this is collective punishment
*  against entire families and communities. That is illegal. That's a war crime.
*  Even though the court does not use the criminal law language, but I'm adding that layer. It looks
*  at the lack of permits and says, well, yeah, the settlers can get permits all the time and the
*  Palestinians almost never get permits. So it's not true that this is an administrative or technical
*  issue. This is clearly with the aim to seize the land. This is clearly about acquisition of land by
*  force. So it dismisses the Israeli pretext for their violations, including
*  the chief pretext. The chief pretext that is used by Israel to any concern is security.
*  Security. Whatever you say, this is about security. I have to take over the Jordan Valley for security
*  reasons. I have to displace communities for security reasons. I have to bomb Gaza into oblivion
*  for security reasons. And the court says these are fundamental rules. You cannot use security as a
*  reason to violate such fundamental rules of international law, the right of relation to
*  subdetermination, the prohibition on annexation. So it's also very important to understand how
*  international law functions or any country can say, yes, I will take over the land. I will violate
*  the rights of entire nations because my security so requires. And we are all entitled to security.
*  The Palestinian people is entitled to security. And the way to provide such security is to uphold
*  international law. So I mean, what example is East Jerusalem? I mean, Jerusalem being treated as
*  sovereign capital, including East Jerusalem, which obviously has been annexed by Israel,
*  where Palestinians are treated, there's an inhospitable environment. And so the point
*  there they're making is Palestinians are treated as foreigners. So that's the indigenous population.
*  But legally, Israel is treating them as foreigners and extending its own law and settlements.
*  And that brings them under Israel's permanent control. And this is what I mean, you know,
*  they said obviously religious, so either it's racial discrimination or apartheid. Obviously,
*  many of us, I would be one of them would say, I mean, that's just apartheid. Amnesty International,
*  Human Rights Watch, the Israeli human rights organization, Betz Alem, they'll call this
*  apartheid. But can you kind of flesh this out, the kind of apartheid, how, I mean, you know,
*  how this judgment, I know they set aside the rule about how it fleshes out that this is the crime
*  of apartheid. So the court, first of all, only places itself in the occupied Palestinian territory
*  and the 1967 borders. So it did not look at the situation within Israel. We believe that racial
*  segregation and apartheid occurred on both sides of the green light with very different situations,
*  but still a situation of hostility and negation of rights for the Palestinian people as a whole.
*  Because of what you're describing, including that the Israeli narrative has always contested
*  our presence, denying our very existence, denying the fact we are Palestinians,
*  and even the fact that they've dispossessed us and displaced us from the land. Until recently,
*  where they, you know, the fundamentalists in Israel found no problem in saying that there was
*  an Akbar and they just want to repeat it or take it to its term, confessing to what we have been
*  denouncing for decades about what Israel had done in 1948 in order to establish its state,
*  which is dispossess and displace the indigenous population that was there.
*  So the court examines these legislation and measures that discriminate against the Palestinian
*  people because they belong to the Palestinian group within the occupied Palestinian territory,
*  and it arrives to a conclusion that it is systemic, that you can find this discrimination
*  in a systemic manner across a number of policies and legislation that the court examines,
*  including the 2018 Jewish nation state law, which speaks of promoting settlements, which
*  speaks of the self-determination for Jews only, and which completely denies the existence of the
*  Palestinians as a group, as a people entitled and endowed with certain inalienable rights.
*  So I hope that countries now who have been, you know, fighting the world apartheid and its use,
*  or fighting the world's racial segregation, because the court does not decide which one of
*  them is being committed or both of them is being committed, but at least it says one of them,
*  at least, is being committed. I hope that the countries that spent a lot of effort denying
*  racial segregation apartheid instead of putting effort to bring it to an end, will now look these
*  realities in the eyes and start acting to change these realities instead of caring about the
*  vocabulary and the feeling that Israel might have around this vocabulary.
*  Will Barron A really important point too,
*  and it's important to make this point because it keeps, it's come up a lot. Obviously, the court,
*  what it sets out, focuses on the West Bank, but it has also conclusively, definitively settled the
*  question of the status of Gaza. As per international law, Gaza was under Israeli occupation
*  prior to 7th of October. So the disengagement, the withdrawal of the Israeli military back in
*  the mid 2000s, that's often presented as the end of Israeli occupation. So can you just explain
*  that, what the court, what that means, the significance of that, that you don't have,
*  occupation is not simply defined by all your soldiers there, but the control you exerts
*  over a territory and that qualifies under international law as an occupation?
*  Yes, you are right. The opinion speaks of the entirety of the occupied Palestinian territory
*  and examines the situation in Gaza and conclude that what is relevant is that you keep effective
*  control over that territory and given Israel's control on the land borders, on the sea, on the
*  maritime space, as well as in the air space, effectively Israel has remained an occupied
*  power in Gaza without interruption. And that is even more true after the 7th of October, where now
*  the Israeli military is heavily present in occupied Gaza Strip. So all of the territory
*  is occupied, the West Bank, including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, and the occupation
*  needs to end on the entirety of the territory. The court is very clear in mentioning on the entirety
*  of the occupied Palestinian territory, the occupation is illegal and must be brought to an
*  end. And therefore the court is placing itself also within the legislation by the Security Council
*  and the General Assembly over two state solutions on the 67 borders. And that's the international
*  consensus. And just to go back on the historical claims, the Palestinian people have had continued
*  presence in the land of Palestine over millennia and they have a historical claim, they have
*  connection. I have a family home in Yaffa, in Jaffa, as we say in Palestine. My father was born in
*  Yaffa. I'm a refugee from Yaffa. And therefore the statehood issue, the borders issue is a different
*  one from the connection that exists to the land or from the rights that are bestowed on individuals
*  or on groups like the refugees or like the Palestinians who are citizens of Israel. They have
*  rights and that's different from the issue of the statehood. And therefore if the Palestinians are
*  able to accept a two state solution despite that very strong historical claim and despite this
*  history of brutal dispossession, then the same should be expected from Israel. If the world came
*  to us saying you have to accept the solution, this is the only way forward and they've spent
*  all this effort and all this pressure to convince us to accept, how come now they can accept that
*  we have an Israeli government who says I will not accept a Palestinian state, I will destroy that
*  Palestinian state. I refuse to make peace with Palestine. I'll even vote in the Israeli Knesset
*  with absolute overwhelming majorities of almost every political party in the land,
*  opposition and government except for the Palestinian citizens of Israel, members of the Knesset.
*  We will vote to say we reject a Palestinian state and we're putting all the resources to
*  destroy it. That's the bias, that's a double standard that cannot be accepted. It's not
*  enough to continue repeating two state solution, two state solution. What are you doing about the
*  existential threat we face? Because when you hear the Israeli leaders you have the impression we
*  are occupying Israel, not Israel is occupying Palestine. You have the impression that they are
*  facing an existential threat, not that we are facing an existential threat by the mass killing
*  of our people and by the stealing, by the fact our land is being stolen and our natural resources
*  are being exploited. All things that the court analyzes very clearly and therefore we are faced
*  with the existential threat and that existential threat is posed by the continued Israeli occupation,
*  by the negation of our existence as Palestinians both within Israel borders and within the occupied
*  Palestinian territory and the refugees. Israel denies that we have any rights as a collective
*  and they also violate our human rights as individuals.
*  Yeah, I mean I was going to ask about that actually. I mean on one level obviously this is,
*  look, it's massive vindication. The highest court on earth has set out in no uncertain terms
*  the most damning possible indictment of the Israeli occupation. It couldn't actually really
*  been much more damning of the Israeli occupation. It's as damning as it gets. And actually I have
*  to say as I mentioned I know there are some specialists on international law who are
*  sympathetic and supportive of the Palestinian cause but they were surprised at how far that
*  the court went. On one level that must be great but on the other level do you find it a bit kind
*  of like, well duh, you know that it has to, that the obvious dynamics have to be pointed out. But
*  is that useful? Because I suppose, I mean particularly look I've worked in the Western
*  media now for 13 long years and you know you'll often have this portrayed by Western media outlets
*  as quote unquote a conflict with the kind of implication that there were two sides
*  of comparable weight. When what this ruling does is spell out in black and white the dynamics
*  of the situation. That you have the occupier and you have the occupied. That this is colonization.
*  Do you see what I mean? So I'm just wondering what you think about that because on one level you must
*  be like well this is a huge vindication but on the other is it just a case of does it really take
*  the you know the stark facts that you grew up with that your lived experience
*  you know defines your whole life that it needs this to be spelled out. But is it good because then
*  now from now on no one can dispute these dynamics? It's a very important question because
*  what has happened notably in recent month is a confusion between the debate over the justness
*  of the means and the justice of the cause. When you are fighting for liberation not all means are
*  justified. There are rules that apply to both the occupying power and the occupied people
*  regarding the means that they are using. There are restrictions and there is a protection of
*  innocent civilians that apply across the board and we are committed to these laws and these rules.
*  But there's a big difference between the two parties when it comes to the justice of the cause.
*  The colonization colonial powers are always wrong to want to colonize a land always and people under
*  colonization under occupation are always right to seek freedom and liberation. So there shouldn't be
*  a confusion about both parties or this trying to draw a symmetry in a really asymmetric situation.
*  It also and that's very important in what the court says about security. It's reversing the order of
*  things. It is saying that we need to provide for the security of our occupier that wants to remain
*  our occupier. That's not the way it works. When you are peace partners with an occupying power that
*  wants to end its occupation and the people who will become free there's a logic to put in place
*  arrangements that provide for the security of both sides. Allowing Israel to use that conditionality
*  of security is effectively allowing it to perpetuate its occupation forever.
*  You have now in the opposition in Israel not only in power but you have fundamentalists in power who
*  use religious texts to explain why they have the right to kill Palestinians. Again whether Muslims,
*  whether Christians, whether civilians, whether combatants, whether children, whether elderly,
*  whether men, whether women, they're just killing Palestinians across the board without any regard
*  for our lives or our rights. But in the opposition itself you have people who tell you we have to
*  keep the Jordan Valley. The Jordan Valley is one-third of the West Bank. It's all where all our
*  natural resources almost are whether the water, whether agriculture. It is our border with Jordan
*  and they tell you but our security requires that we take it. Sorry what if well what does my security
*  require? If every country can say I need to take the land of my neighbor because I feel more secure
*  once I do, what kind of rules are there? So it is very important to always never forget that while
*  there are rules we all have to abide by, there's an occupying power and there's an occupied people
*  and they're not on the same level or the same footing whether in front of history or in front
*  of the law. And when you come to the charter and the right to self-determination and the prohibition
*  on annexation, it is clear who has these obligations and who has these rights. I want to
*  tell you about a Palestinian leader if you allow me. Please take. Called Faisal Hosseini from Jerusalem.
*  He's an iconic figure for the Palestinian national struggle, maybe less well known than others in the
*  international community and he believed in the peaceful path. And to explain to people why he,
*  I believe also very profoundly in that path even though we still have to demonstrate that it would
*  lead to liberation. That is the difficulty we are facing to showcase that this political, legal,
*  peaceful track, peaceful path would lead us to liberation. And to explain why he believed in it,
*  Faisal Hosseini used an image. He used to say I can't defeat Mike Tyson but not by challenging
*  him to the boxing ring but to a chess game. And he thought that the peaceful path would expose Israel
*  rather than bring us to its playing field, its favorite playing field and the violence that it's
*  able to exert in these situations. But I've always thought that there was a problem, a flaw
*  in Faisal Hosseini's presentation regardless how powerful it was, how convincing it was. What
*  happens if you sit to a chess game with Mike Tyson and you're on the verge of winning,
*  which means getting to liberation, and Mike Tyson just throws the chess game to the floor
*  and knocks out Faisal Hosseini? What happens then? So Faisal Hosseini, and that's what he did in
*  reality, each time he was beaten all the way to the floor even when he was an older man with
*  health problems and they used to beat him, Israeli police in Jerusalem as he was fighting for
*  Palestinian rights, he would get up and sit again and he would have the chess game again.
*  And when he was on the verge of winning, Mike Tyson would get up, throw the chess game and
*  knock him out once again. And if you're a Palestinian watching this scene time and time again,
*  over and over again, there is a chance that a Palestinian youngster would tell himself,
*  I'll take my chances at the boxing ring. Most probably I would not be able to win,
*  but at least maybe I can inflict some injury on Mike Tyson. Maybe at least I can
*  make him feel the cost of this exercise rather than stupidly sit at the table, play a chess game,
*  and get knocked out each time. The way we allow Faisal Hosseini to prevail and his thinking to
*  prevail, and I think that's in the interest of everyone as we've seen in recent months,
*  is to uphold the rules, is to force Mike Tyson to finish the game. It is to prevent him from
*  knocking out the peaceful Faisal Hosseini. And this is the occasion that this ICJ ruling provides.
*  It reminds us all of the rules of the chess game. And if these rules are upheld, there will be
*  national liberation for Palestine. But there will also be peace and security for all. It is
*  in the best interest of Mike Tyson to restrain him in this situation. And it's in the best interest,
*  of course, of the Palestinian people who are being beaten over and over again,
*  harshly and brutally, but it's also in the best interest of finding peaceful solutions and allowing
*  all to live, including all our children, to live in a peaceful world where they are not inflicted
*  any harm. And this is the test now, because the judges, they did their work. They set the rules.
*  You're right, people have lost a bit of their confidence and faith in these institutions,
*  and therefore they thought that the judges will do politics. And the reason why people feel this
*  is better than what they expected is because the judges did what they were mandated to do,
*  which is to say what the law states with as much clarity as possible. They did the job.
*  But saying the rules does not allow to enforce them. As I said, there's many,
*  there's the ICJ or advisor opinion on the wall, and Israel continued building it. And already
*  that opinion said settlements are illegal. Israel tripled the number of settlers since then.
*  You have the resolutions of the Security Council for the last 50 years. You have
*  General Assembly resolutions for the last 70. We have the Charter that guarantees our rights
*  that were denied and dismissed and destroyed. So it's not about just stating the law. It's
*  about enforcing the law. And that's where the ruling also is important because it speaks of
*  third party responsibility. Well, that's one of the, just a couple of final questions,
*  and that's one of them. In terms of the duties this imposes on, for example, the United States
*  of America, on Britain, on those countries, what, that's the kind of crucial, kind of,
*  tell us about that part of the judgment and what that, the responsibilities, the legal
*  responsibilities that those countries have. Can I just read some excerpts before we go into that?
*  Please do. Just so those who are watching this are aware of what the court said itself.
*  As its main determinations. The court considers that the violations by Israel of the prohibition
*  of the acquisition of territory by force and of the Palestinian people's right to set determination
*  have a direct impact on the legality of the continued presence of Israel as an occupying
*  power in the occupied Palestinian territory. The sustained abuse by Israel of its position as an
*  occupying power through annexation and an assertion of permanent control over the occupied
*  Palestinian territory and continued frustration of the right of the Palestinian people to set
*  determination violates fundamental principles of international law and renders Israel's presence
*  in the occupied Palestinian territory unlawful. This illegality relates to the entirety of the
*  Palestinian territory occupied by Israel in 1967. This is the territorial unit across which Israel
*  has imposed policies and practices to fragment and frustrate the ability of the Palestinian people
*  to exercise its right to set determination and over a large swath of which it has extended Israeli
*  sovereignty in violation of international law. The entirety of the occupied Palestinian territory
*  is also the territory in relation to which the Palestinian people should be able to exercise
*  its right to set determination, the integrity of which must be respected. You cannot make it clearer
*  than that. When you speak of third party responsibility, first there's the responsibility
*  of Israel and it's very clear and again this is the court saying Israel has an obligation to put an end
*  to its occupation as rapidly as possible. So if I need to quote Israel has an obligation to bring
*  an end to its presence in the occupied Palestinian territory as rapidly as possible. It also has an
*  obligation to reparation for all the damages it has inflicted and imagine if Israel had to pay
*  for the damage it had cost to the Palestinians in 1948, in 1967, in the last two years,
*  since for the last 57 years. Do you think it would be destroying Gaza at such a scale?
*  Israel considers I destroy and the rest of the world needs to manage reconstruction and then I
*  destroy again. They destroy UN funded projects in the West Bank and they destroy UN infrastructure
*  in Gaza. They've destroyed universities and hospitals and homes. 70% of the homes were
*  destroyed of damage in the Gaza Strip. This large scale destruction is only made possible because
*  Israel never had to pay neither politically nor financially for the destruction and the
*  devastation it has caused. So that's an important element to see if we can afford that. As for the
*  other states and I want us to be you know very clear about what these elements mean. Member states
*  are under obligation not to recognize any changes in the physical character of demographic composition,
*  institutional structure or status of the territory occupied by Israel. You cannot accept
*  or endorse this annexation of territory, these changes through settlements, forcible transfer,
*  etc. etc. Except as agreed by the parties through negotiations. So therefore only the Palestinians
*  can accept something. As long as we don't accept it and we don't accept these changes that Israel
*  has made, the rest of the international community has to stop these changes. The court says that
*  Israel needs to evacuate all the settlers and dismantle all the settlements. You cannot use the
*  fact that you've transferred these people there and now say okay I need new borders to accommodate
*  them and I need more to do for their security. They're not supposed to be there in the first
*  place. If they are not there you don't need your soldiers there. You don't need to invent reasons
*  for your checkpoints. You don't need to build roads for them. You don't need to steal our resources
*  for their purposes. It says that third states should abstain from treaty relations with Israel
*  in all cases in which it purports to act on behalf of the occupied Palestinian territory.
*  So all treaties should be clear that beyond 67 Israel has no rights and should have no existence
*  beyond the 67 borders. That becomes Palestine. To abstain from entering into economic or trade
*  dealings with Israel concerning the occupied Palestinian territory of Parz delo which may
*  entrench its unlawful presence in the territory. To abstain in the establishment and maintenance
*  of diplomatic missions in Israel from any recognition of its illegal presence in the
*  occupied Palestinian territory. And the court says earlier that this applies to considering
*  Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. That violates international law. And to take steps to prevent
*  trade or investment relations that assist in the maintenance of the illegal situation created by
*  Israel. This relate to trade with settlements or trade that goes to the benefit of the army and
*  its presence in the occupying forces and their presence on our land. This could apply to trade
*  in arms. This could apply to settlement products which are sold in European markets. What does it
*  mean to just label a product? It comes from a settlement. You're allowing the settlements to
*  benefit from that trade and then you're saying the consumer can make a decision. No, states have a
*  responsibility before the consumer which is to ban these settlement products. I'll give you a
*  number. The UNCTAD, the UN development agency, considered that it estimated that settlements
*  bring in 30 billion dollars a year to the Israeli economy. 30 billion dollars a year. This is the
*  only occupation in the world that has all benefit, no cost. Why would they end it? Instead of paying
*  the price for colonizing our land, they steal our resources and they sell them in European markets.
*  It's unheard of. Instead of holding people accountable, they are punishing the Palestinian
*  population. Instead of being punished for settling the land and exerting violence against the
*  Palestinians, we start seeing now, 57 years later, a few settlers, individual settlers,
*  being punished. You should punish the government that is sending these
*  settlers, that is protecting these violent settlers and encouraging them and inciting them
*  and arming them. This is where it will be decisive to see if states can show the necessary political
*  will to uphold the law and to restrain Israel and to stop this long history of terrible
*  violations and of crimes. The court says, of course, these same obligations apply to the UN,
*  but it adds that the modalities to end the occupation is for the General Assembly, the
*  Security Council, to take the responsibility in deciding of any additional measure required to
*  bring it to an end and of the modalities to bring an end to the occupation. It also says that if
*  you're a high contracting party of the Geneva Conventions, you need to uphold the convention.
*  It also says that all states should cooperate to help bring the occupation to an end and to
*  support the right of the Palestinians to self-determination. We consider that includes
*  the recognition of the state of Palestine. That's one of the elements that is cooperating in order
*  to uphold our right to self-determination that has been considered as a fundamental right,
*  or again, we asserted as a fundamental right by the court.
*  Just my final question, and that was a brilliant detailed explanation and people can see why,
*  you excel at your job as a diplomat and the Palestinian delegation obviously very lucky
*  to have you, but I just want to end by asking you this. It's quite a difficult question
*  in that we're obviously talking about a belligerent occupation which goes back decades and
*  the suffering of the Palestinian people predates that, the Nakba of 1948 and
*  the suffering before that as well. In the last few months, we've seen some of the worst atrocities
*  of the 21st century live streamed on a daily basis. Tens of thousands of innocent people
*  suffocated under rubble, burned to death, many of them kids, babies having their limbs amputated
*  without anesthetic, starvation, the ruin of the entire medical system.
*  Well, the fact I call it genocide is irrelevant. What many leading genocide scholars have no doubt
*  whatsoever that this is genocide and of course a case in the International Court of Justice which
*  is currently trying Israel on the allegation of Israel based on the case submitted by the
*  state of South Africa. Some of the worst unimaginable atrocities live streamed on a daily
*  basis for those who have the inclination to seek out, they know what's happening.
*  And yet at the same time, we've seen a dramatic shift in public attitudes in Western states.
*  Sympathy for the Palestinian people, the Palestinian nation has never been as big
*  as it has been today. So I guess that's my question really. It's amidst horror which
*  you know what, I find it almost impossible to deal with and I'm not Palestinian, this isn't
*  the lived experience you have. I can't even begin to imagine how you cope with this.
*  I just can't imagine it. Amidst that, do you have some hope and optimism that the tide is shifting
*  and that yes, there's a lagging indicator here. But when you have polls showing that more Americans
*  than not think genocide is taking place, that polls in America where it was verboten to talk
*  about Israel in critical terms for so long, that particular amongst younger Americans there has been
*  a dramatic shift against the Israeli state. Do you have a hope that actually it might not be
*  next week or next month or whenever, that too many people have heard things they can't unhear,
*  seen things they can't unsee, read things they can't unread. This has had a profound impact
*  on so many people who if I'm going to be honest and I read the comments on my YouTube channel
*  and on my Twitter and elsewhere, when I post these videos like this, people who before,
*  and this is disparaged them, had never really thought about Palestine before,
*  but now see it as one of the great issues of our time. Do you have that sense that actually
*  they're going to lose this in the end? They are going to lose this and that the tide will shift
*  in your favor? What's your kind of sense? So this was a moment of contrast because we've
*  waited for this moment for a while to see this court making such a determination, but you're also
*  very conscious of this coming in a certain reality, terrifying reality, especially for
*  our people in Gaza, for all our people, but especially in Gaza, where they have every reason
*  to doubt that the law means anything anymore. I've used the expression, this is year zero in
*  international law in Gaza. This is before any, it looks like before any rule has been enacted.
*  You're speaking of killing civilians by thousands, having food a few meters away and
*  letting them starve. You're speaking of bombing people in tents after they have escaped from one
*  corner to the other within an open air prison. You speak of some of the most horrifying scenes
*  and practices that you can imagine on live TV and of leaders who are talking to the leaders of the
*  entire world almost normally. The Israeli prime minister will be hosted by the congress in a couple
*  of days. So as much as for peoples around the world, this Israeli government, Israel,
*  as it presently conducts itself, is a pariah state. As we have the solidarity and support of
*  almost all the governments in the world, as we have the support and solidarity of, I think,
*  all the peoples in the world, the fate of the Palestinian people has not fundamentally changed
*  till now. And this has been going on for a hundred years of fighting, of trying, of convincing.
*  What we do here, there are moments when you have to wonder, does it have any bearing? Does it have
*  any sense? We adopt the Security Council's gender-centered resolutions for a ceasefire,
*  for stopping the indiscriminate killing, for stopping the organized famine of a nation of
*  two million people. Organized, orchestrated famine that kills children in the worst way possible
*  when their organs tear themselves apart because they have nothing to eat.
*  People dying of diseases that we have eradicated. Hospitals turned into cemeteries.
*  Schools, universities, we are among the most educated population in the world. It took a lot of effort
*  for refugees and deads to impose that life of education and make it a cornerstone of our identity.
*  An entire generation of persons in Gaza were not able to go to school this year.
*  None of this should have been possible. And it has to make us,
*  none of this should have been possible. And it has to make us doubt. I have an answer which is not a
*  satisfactory answer. Against all odds, I have faith. I cannot say it's hope. I cannot say it's
*  analysis. I cannot say it's based on the trends that you're talking about, the new generation,
*  et cetera, because I know there are forces that are able to sustain that kind of pressure,
*  the popular pressure. I've seen in countries, demonstrators for Palestine or for raising a
*  pasion flag being beaten in terrible ways. I've seen the polemics and the controversies in some
*  corners of the globe. While you have this overwhelming support that you can test in polls
*  and the general mood and even that we can sense here when we speak and the whole room
*  applauds and when the Israeli representative speaks and everybody is disgusted by how he
*  speaks of the Palestinians and which disregard he addresses the world.
*  Our role is not to win the argument, just to win the argument. Our role is to win the argument to
*  change reality. And at that, we have all collectively failed. And this failure leads to despair and leads
*  to actions that are also not the right ones. So I genuinely believe the Palestinian people will be
*  free, but that's a belief. And I try to work and we all are trying to do our part in making that
*  happen. I believe that peace is not only possible, it is indispensable. It's just the reality.
*  History has created this situation. Political forces have created this situation. And some people
*  want to reverse that situation, change the course of history as it was. And some of us are trying to
*  ensure the freedom and the dignity of the Palestinian people within the reality that was created
*  by these changes. And we were hoping that that would spare Palestinian life. So it is terrible
*  to see that instead of having a Palestinian state next to Israel, both living in peace and security,
*  you're having a genocide in Gaza. Instead of having a population flourish and thrive,
*  they are still displacing communities. They're still settlers killing people in the streets.
*  They're still Israeli army shooting people in full disregard. There's still settlements being
*  built on our lands. There's still... So what I can tell you is the following.
*  This is a terrifying tragedy. I don't know how you recover from it. Our people are resilient,
*  but nobody should have to demonstrate such resilience. Our first duty is to put an end to it
*  by all the means we have available to us. And then we have to make sure it never happens again.
*  And to make sure that the Palestinian people are able to exist, to just be free and just be...
*  Live a dignified life in their land. That shouldn't take all this effort, all these lives,
*  all these sacrifices, all this time. And we are hoping this is a turning point, that what's
*  happening in Palestine, as you said, the whole world considers it is important for the future
*  of the world, not only for the Palestinian people. What happened in the court, what's happening in
*  every forum, that it will be the beginning of real change that people can observe.
*  That is our duty for the ones who have lost their lives, for the ones who were killed,
*  the Palestinians that were killed. And this is our duty for all those who remain alive and who
*  will have to survive and who will have to face the reality the next day of the horrors they have in
*  you, with at least the prospect that their children will not have to have... That the children or
*  children's children will not have to face the same reality that they can finally be free.
*  Beautifully put. And I don't think it's much consolation, obviously, given the horrors that
*  you're up against, but there are so many who will never, ever, ever give up on their solidarity with
*  the Palestinian people. And that includes so many people who before this current genocidal onslaught
*  began would never have imagined that this was a cause that they would be championing.
*  It's so important we elevate voices like your own. You've been such an eloquent exposition,
*  grounded in facts, grounded in the law, which I think offers an incontrovertible case,
*  which is obviously incontrovertible because we've just had the International Court of Justice's
*  opinion based explaining what international law says in this context. It can't be easy to do the
*  job that you're doing at the best of times, and this is the worst of times, but I think we're all
*  in all listening to you of the job that you're doing in the circumstances that you're in.
*  For those obviously watching, thanks so much as ever. Please press like and subscribe,
*  but thank you so much. Can I just tell you one more thing?
*  You have these kind words towards me, and I've seen a trend to consider those speaking out as
*  the heroes of the story, and I believe that is a mistake. I come from a situation of privilege,
*  notably now being in New York and being able to advocate for my country with a certain sense of
*  security, relative but very existent compared to those on the ground. So there are heroes on the
*  ground, and we learn often their names when they're killed, but there are many heroes,
*  and we are only their echo, and that is the easiest part of the struggle. So I just seize
*  this opportunity to salute those who have paid the price for conducting the hardest part of the
*  struggle, which is to be in that situation and to continue striving for liberation, to continue
*  striving for life. Doctors that continue to work in impossible situations, rescue workers who know
*  that they have become targets, journalists, individuals, mothers trying to save their children,
*  fathers trying to save their children, the neighbors trying to help each other, communities
*  still standing tall in the face of great adversity, and thank you for giving us a chance to speak to
*  the extent we can to raise their voices through ours. Amen to that, and I couldn't agree with
*  you more obviously, and those within Gaza who've, in the midst of an unimaginable genocidal onslaught,
*  those doctors and nurses who've carried on their jobs in impossible circumstances as every single
*  hospital and medical facility has been destroyed, and of course the journalists who've suffered the
*  biggest slaughter of journalists in any conflict in human history. Just today I was talking,
*  corresponding with a Palestinian journalist who's living in the ruins of what was Khan Unis with his
*  family, his brother killed, looking after his kids as well as his brother's kids, and the work
*  of those Palestinian journalists will be remembered throughout the ages. We wouldn't know about
*  the vast majority of what we know, the horrors have been committed, without the lions of the
*  world press back, the journalists of Gaza, many of whom have been slaughtered alongside their
*  families, and we should always of course pay tribute, so I'm glad you made that point.
*  Thank you so much, Majid, it's been such an honor, really appreciate it. Thank you.
