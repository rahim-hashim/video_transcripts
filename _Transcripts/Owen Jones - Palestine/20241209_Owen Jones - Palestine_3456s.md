# Assad OVERTHROWN - The Truth: Syrian Activist Offers Masterclass w/. Rami Jarrah
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [December 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U)
*  Now, after six decades, the Syrian Ba'athist dictatorship has finally been toppled, the vast [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=0.0s)]
*  majority of that, of course, under the Al-Assads and for the 21st century, all of that under [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=6.0s)]
*  Bashar al-Assad. Now, we've seen scenes of jubilation in Syria and beyond. This was a vicious [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=11.44s)]
*  dictatorship which killed hundreds of thousands of its own people, including with barrel bombs [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=20.32s)]
*  and chemical weapons. Despite styling itself when it suited as anti-imperialist, collaborated with [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=24.72s)]
*  the war and terror with the George Bush administration, Tony Blair sought at one point to give him [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=31.279999999999998s)]
*  a knighthood, despised by the Palestinian people. We're seeing Palestinian prisoners being released [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=38.239999999999995s)]
*  amongst other prisoners who have been imprisoned for so long that some of them think they are [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=44.4s)]
*  being liberated by the Iraqi army of Saddam Hussein and many aren't even aware that Bashar [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=50.64s)]
*  al-Assad is even the ruler. They think it's his father. Hideous horrors, but some are, I would say, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=57.6s)]
*  confused and I've seen that on social media. There is no better person to talk about this [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  than my brilliant guest Rami Jarrah, who is Syrian, who's someone who has been arrested by the Syrian [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  regime, been involved in activism, journalism, someone who throughout Israel's genocide against [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=77.36s)]
*  the Palestinian people, I followed his moral integrity, has always shone through. He's been a [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=83.84s)]
*  brilliant voice. I have to say so many Syrian voices have been, including Syrian Palestinian voices, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=89.52s)]
*  of course, through the genocide, speaking out against these horrors and now asking us to have [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=95.36s)]
*  consistency when we talk, of course, about the regime of Assad. It's great to speak to you. How [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=101.68s)]
*  are you doing? I'm good. I'm good. It's a pleasure. Really is a pleasure. I just want to start. How do [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=108.4s)]
*  you feel? Mixed feelings, very mixed feelings, because, and I think I speak for quite a few [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=114.64000000000001s)]
*  Syrians right now because we haven't had really time to prepare to even understand what's going [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  on right now. Most of the conversations I've been having over the past few days have been, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=129.44000000000003s)]
*  I mean, it was usually the case that some people that aren't as fixated on Syria would contact me [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=137.20000000000002s)]
*  and ask me questions. And most of the time, just saying, I really don't have an answer, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=142.0s)]
*  like what's going on right now? Who is who in all of this? So it feels like something very similar [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=145.04000000000002s)]
*  to 2011, as strange as that sounds, because the environment is totally different. But I've, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=155.2s)]
*  over the past, since it became clear that Assad was going to fall, and eventually he did, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=162.32s)]
*  it only really just sunk in with me, I think, the day before yesterday, that it really sunk in, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  that this is happening. The rest of these past, just under two weeks was just, I don't know, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  it's just a weird dream, honestly. And I still haven't come to terms with it. I think my wife's [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  doing a much better job than me. She's able to deal with her emotions. And she's just able to [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=191.84s)]
*  sit there and cry it out, cries of joy, honestly. For me, it's really mixed feelings right now. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=200.16s)]
*  I've put Syria behind me. I think this is something that maybe is not as representative [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=207.68s)]
*  of other people, but I've really put Syria behind me in the past few years. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=213.6s)]
*  It's worth pointing out to many viewers and listeners that the Baathist regime has been [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=220.24s)]
*  in power for over 60 years. And of the Syrian population, only 4.2% over 65. And the vast [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=225.12s)]
*  majority of those won't remember the time before the Baathists either. So we're talking like 99% [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=233.12s)]
*  of Syrians. Their lived memory has only been this dictatorship. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=238.4s)]
*  Jude, would you just tell me about your background in terms of your parents were political [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=244.24s)]
*  activists? I know you grew up in London, but you ended up getting arrested when you went to [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  Syria. So you just tell us a bit about your family's history and what happened with you. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=253.44s)]
*  So my parents are both poets. And usually, a poet requires some imagination. And I think [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=258.0s)]
*  somewhere like Syria, I don't think they really want you to use your imagination. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=268.16s)]
*  So very quickly, I think my dad at the age of around 22 had to leave Syria. And so they were [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  in exile. They were dissidents of the government. They'd been outspoken since they left the country. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=283.28s)]
*  And then I was born in Cyprus and grew up in London, as you mentioned. And then in 2000, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=290.47999999999996s)]
*  I mean, I spent my whole life outside the country. My Arabic wasn't exactly something that I could [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=297.2s)]
*  talk, but I had that sort of weird accent, which I've managed to fix over the past decade. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  But so I traveled to Syria for the very first time in 2004 for reasons I'm not going to indulge [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=308.8s)]
*  in right now. I was actually forced to travel to Syria. But that's a really long story that has [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=316.24s)]
*  nothing to do with what we're talking about. But when I arrived in Damascus, I was basically [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=322.48s)]
*  greeted in the airport when I was... I think they have a manifesto on the plane, right, on who's [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=328.8s)]
*  coming. So they didn't wait for me to go to passport control. I was actually greeted coming [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=335.44s)]
*  out of the plane. And I went into an intelligence... There's an intelligence officer's room once you're [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=340.88s)]
*  coming into Damascus airport. And I went in and it wasn't scary or anything at the time. I was scared, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=350.08s)]
*  but I mean, in hindsight, it was obvious that they didn't have any bad plans for me. But [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=358.64s)]
*  I was immediately told that I'm not going to be able to leave the country. And I would have to [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=365.44s)]
*  report back to something called the Civil Administration to prove that I was Syrian, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=370.88s)]
*  because they said that my passport was not accepted as an official passport. And that was [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=376.48s)]
*  because my parents were married abroad. And because they were dissidents, they weren't able [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=384.24s)]
*  to register their marriage in Syria. And it's just this administrative issues really. But in order for [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=388.24s)]
*  me to then register as a Syrian, I had to go through a very long process of around three years [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=394.48s)]
*  and went through... I did basically the tour that all Syrians have done by growing up in Syria. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=401.12s)]
*  They compensated me of doing that tour of the intelligence branches across Syria. You have [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=408.72s)]
*  something called the Palestinian branch. It's just a nickname. It's branch, I think, 253, which is [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=415.36s)]
*  in charge of foreign affairs, foreign intelligence affairs. It's a notorious branch. It's called the [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=420.56s)]
*  Palestinian branch because so many Palestinians were tortured in this branch. And I was questioned [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=425.68s)]
*  on a periodic basis, sometimes weekly. Sometimes I would just go in and just sit there for about [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=433.6s)]
*  six hours doing nothing with someone who doesn't even know who I am walking past and saying, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=439.04s)]
*  you're in big trouble. Just that sort of fear, trying to invoke fear in you. But I spent the [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=443.52s)]
*  next three years learning what it meant for someone to grow up in a place like Syria. From all the [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=451.84s)]
*  stuff that I saw, it was a very strange experience for me at such a young age. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=458.96s)]
*  In terms of the Syrian revolution in 2011, so you get the Arab Spring, you get uprisings across [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=467.03999999999996s)]
*  the Arab world, including, of course, against regimes propped up by the West, like in Egypt, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=472.72s)]
*  Tunisia, and in Syria. How do you understand the context then? What was the context and what was [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=478.88000000000005s)]
*  the nature of that uprising? When I was in Damascus, we never even believed that something like that [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=485.84000000000003s)]
*  could happen, right? I was very politically savvy. I enjoyed talking about politics and [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=497.04s)]
*  everyone around me just avoided it totally. Anyone who grew up in Syria, I think this is [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=504.48s)]
*  important to mention. I don't want to go off topic, but I want to say that you have in school, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=510.96000000000004s)]
*  a topic, you have a subject in school called Qawmiya, which is basically, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=518.0799999999999s)]
*  my Arabic is a bit, I don't know what it translates to exactly. But Qawmiya is basically, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=528.4s)]
*  it's them giving you their take on history, right? So like, for example, the 1967 war, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=534.72s)]
*  Harvard Lessard has his own take on what happened in 1967. And this book, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=540.72s)]
*  all students had to memorize this book off by heart. And it involves like all these strange [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=547.44s)]
*  quotes, like, you know, Harvard Lessard until, you know, the end of time, and they would stand [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=552.96s)]
*  there in the square and have to scream this and do something that seems like a Hitler salute. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=557.6s)]
*  It was, so that's the sort of thing people grew up in. And that sort of brainwashes people into [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=563.76s)]
*  this theme where they automatically don't want to talk about politics, they avoid these [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=568.8s)]
*  conversations. And I had, you know, having grown up outside the country, I enjoyed talking about [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=576.16s)]
*  politics. And I would basically find people that were willing to talk just, you know, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=582.16s)]
*  on a casually, if I was in a taxi or something, I would try to start a conversation. You'd have [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=587.76s)]
*  to be careful because, you know, in Syria, it was well known, especially taxi drivers, by the way. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=593.4399999999999s)]
*  It was, you know, common knowledge that they could be part of the security apparatus, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=598.4s)]
*  trying to get info on certain people, etc. And so I had a feel of whether or not people expected [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=603.4399999999999s)]
*  or were preparing for something because I was actively looking for it. And there was no such [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=612.88s)]
*  thing. But when things started in Tunisia, and just as they, you know, just as it moved on to Egypt, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=617.52s)]
*  suddenly, they became this environment in Syria, where it seemed like it was somewhat welcome, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=628.16s)]
*  the idea of there being some sort of opposition to the government. In the early, I think this [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=636.16s)]
*  we're talking about late mid February now, mid February 2011, there were some efforts online, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=642.3199999999999s)]
*  some pages that had been started, it didn't look like anything serious. But towards the end of [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=652.8s)]
*  February, early March, that's when there was like small things happening, like people handing out, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=658.0s)]
*  banging on doors and throwing flyers inside buildings that said, we want freedom, we want [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=663.68s)]
*  freedom of speech, etc. And it didn't feel real. And you know, this is why when we were talking [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=669.04s)]
*  just a few moments ago off camera, and I said that this seems like what's happening right now seems [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=677.0400000000001s)]
*  in somewhat, you know, similar to what happened before is that at the time, I didn't think it was [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=683.6s)]
*  possible that it could happen. But suddenly, on the 15th of March, when the first protest took place [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=688.96s)]
*  in Damascus, it was it was that same feeling of what we felt just, you know, just under two weeks [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=696.5600000000001s)]
*  ago, where is this really happening? Is it does it are people really rising against the government? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=701.44s)]
*  It was just something that no one could even imagine. And one amazing thing in all of this, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=707.12s)]
*  and I think this was the main driver, right? To why people there's an adrenaline in some way [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=713.0400000000001s)]
*  like Syria, if you participate in a protest, the first time I left, you know, I left after Syria, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=718.6400000000001s)]
*  and I took part in a protest outside Syria, I don't want to ruin it for everyone, but I [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=724.08s)]
*  wasn't able to, there wasn't any adrenaline. I don't want to say there was no point to a protest [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=729.28s)]
*  outside, you know, in Europe, but in Syria, it was like, you know, you could lose your life. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=734.16s)]
*  And what was beautiful about that, as dangerous as it sounds, was that the other people that you were [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=739.84s)]
*  meeting for the first time, that were also risking their lives, just in that split second, those [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=746.0799999999999s)]
*  people became closer to you, and meant more to you than most of the people that you know, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=752.88s)]
*  especially the people that you know, that didn't care that, you know, we lived under this oppressive [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=760.64s)]
*  regime, suddenly there was this sort of brotherhood, where people would protect each other. And that's, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=765.04s)]
*  I think, I think that that was the main driver that created this, this, you know, this brotherhood [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=769.6s)]
*  of people that are willing to risk their lives for each other. I think that's how it started. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=776.64s)]
*  Of course, this was in the context in the 2000s, the assets had pushed this policy of privatisation, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=781.52s)]
*  which handed state assets to their cronies, their relatives, to privatising health, education. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=787.12s)]
*  I failed to do the background on that. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=795.76s)]
*  No, no, no, not at all. No, no, no, I just thought it was worth it, because I didn't want to, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=799.52s)]
*  I wanted to talk focus about today, but you know, and of course, there was this policy of rendition, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=803.76s)]
*  where they cooperated with the US, so called war on terror, where so called terror suspects were [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=809.28s)]
*  sent to Syria and were tortured by the Syrian regime, just in terms of, you know, because [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=814.1600000000001s)]
*  without excessive fast forward, because, because obviously, I want to talk about today, but the [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=818.8000000000001s)]
*  context here is so important, because of course, we had in 2011, this uprising, and then the Syrian [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=822.1600000000001s)]
*  regime respond with militarisation, didn't they, they, they just sent in the army, and massacred [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=826.4s)]
*  people. Yes, yes, so, so to be, I mean, so that we, so that we put, you know, everything in the [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=831.6s)]
*  right place. I participated, the first protest that I actually participated in was on the 18th [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=837.76s)]
*  of March. And that was in the Umayyad Mosque in central Damascus. And the reason that we went to [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=843.36s)]
*  the mosque, because, you know, I know how this is perceived, you know, first of all, I'm not Muslim. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=849.36s)]
*  And I went to the mosque, because the mosque was the only place on a Friday that you could gather [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=855.44s)]
*  in large numbers without, you know, them picking you up and saying, what are you doing in this [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=860.56s)]
*  crowd? So in that protest, the first day, I think, it was the first protest on a Friday, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=865.1199999999999s)]
*  after three days after the small protest that had first ignited in Damascus, the response, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=873.76s)]
*  it was obvious that there wasn't a prepared response. And it was very random, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=880.9599999999999s)]
*  not authentic, but a sort of spontaneous response by the government. And I think without orders, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=884.8s)]
*  they arrested people. And then it was, it was, it was, it was not long that these people were [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=895.28s)]
*  released. That also happened the week after, on the 25th. And then after that, it was obvious that [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=901.28s)]
*  something had changed. And when, I mean, you saw this in Damascus, you saw this in Daraa, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=909.2s)]
*  basically, the military was, and not just the military, but something called Chabiha, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=917.0400000000001s)]
*  which are the sort of death squads. These are the, these are basically, they are militias that are [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=921.6800000000001s)]
*  very loyal to the Syrian government, mainly made out of, and we can go into the state, but mainly [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=927.9200000000001s)]
*  made out of the Alawite sect, and very loyal to the government, and very, very ferocious. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=933.76s)]
*  I think people that don't even know how to talk, really, or they do really know how to do with kill [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=943.6s)]
*  and torture people. And this, this sort of apparatus was released onto the Syrian people. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=948.8s)]
*  It was really terrifying, Owen, really terrifying. It's not, it's, I, to this day, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=956.5600000000001s)]
*  to this day, I have reoccurring dreams where, you know, I would be, I would be forgiven for urinating [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=963.04s)]
*  myself. And it's just, the, we, the idea of resisting was just out of the question. The [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=969.84s)]
*  second they came, we were just run off. And anyone they caught, you wouldn't see again. And, you know, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=978.8000000000001s)]
*  even when I came out of Syria in late 2008, and I would tell this, these stories to people, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=986.1600000000001s)]
*  to journalists, I could see in their face that they didn't believe what I was saying. I could see it, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=991.2800000000001s)]
*  you know, they didn't believe that, all right, maybe the sky's over exaggerating a bit. Maybe, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=995.6s)]
*  you know, but the reality was that we, we never came face to face with these death squads, because [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=999.9200000000001s)]
*  the second they would come, they would come in green buses in the beginning and have their weapons, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1007.76s)]
*  you know, waving out the windows. The second they came, we would just run off. And that explains to [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1011.2s)]
*  you why these protests, it was very difficult to see, especially in Damascus, to see these protests [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1015.6s)]
*  become widespread protests, like, like you saw in Tunisia, like you saw, especially in Egypt, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1020.72s)]
*  millions of people protesting. You didn't see that in Damascus, because it was impossible. It was, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1025.76s)]
*  I don't want to reduce what happened in Egypt at all, but it's just a different environment, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1031.92s)]
*  different situation. If, I reckon in Egypt, if someone just went down into the crowd and started [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1037.52s)]
*  just basically, you know, like a machine gun firing at everyone, you wouldn't have anyone in [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1044.32s)]
*  the square. And that was the situation in Damascus. So Assad basically unleashed his killing machine [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1048.96s)]
*  on people across, on the Syrian people across every single city in Syria that was with, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1055.2s)]
*  almost every single city was witnessing protests in Syria. And it was responded to with full [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1061.04s)]
*  brutality. And by, by this year, it seemed as though the consensus seemed to be Assad had won, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1065.76s)]
*  there was normalization taking place, the Italian far right prime minister talking about [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1073.52s)]
*  normalization orders with Assad, so Syrian refugees could be sent back to Syria. And that, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1078.8799999999999s)]
*  as we can see, exceptionally brittle victory in practice was secured, not least, of course, with [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1086.24s)]
*  major role of Russia in terms of the, the, the Russian, the raining down of, of, of barrel bombs, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1093.04s)]
*  and well, the carpet bombing, which we saw in civilian areas, but 300,000 plus civilians alone, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1100.4s)]
*  excluding combatants who were killed, huge, terrible atrocities committed in those 13 years. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1107.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Where do you want me to focus? I don't know, just in terms of, I mean, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1116.72s)]
*  just that sense of the sorts of atrocities that people shouldn't be in a doubt about the level of [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1122.4s)]
*  the horror that the Syrian regime unleashed against its people. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1126.96s)]
*  Yeah, you know, one amazing thing right now, you know, in the environment we're in, and I, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1131.44s)]
*  I seem like I'm just trying to pull you down, back to what's going on right now, but I hope, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1140.4s)]
*  I know, I hope that, you know, it's going to be a different situation now, because what we've been [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1146.08s)]
*  doing for the past 14 years is just trying to explain how bad this, this regime is, just how [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1150.64s)]
*  bad it is. And, and I'll speak firsthand experience. I was arrested in Damascus on the 25th of March. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1157.3600000000001s)]
*  I was taken into a branch where there was, there was a guy who was with us in the, in the, when, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1166.48s)]
*  when we were protesting, we were saying, hurray, hurray, which hurray means freedom, right? We, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1172.3200000000002s)]
*  we were just saying that, and there was this Chilean guy from Chile who was taking pictures [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1177.28s)]
*  in the mosque, he was a tourist, and he saw us doing this, he didn't know what we were doing, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1181.84s)]
*  he just, he just joined us. This guy was arrested with us, right? He was electrocuted [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1186.08s)]
*  to his genitals. He was forced to film, they filmed him and forced him to, to say he was an [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1190.6399999999999s)]
*  agent sent from abroad. He, we heard screams when he was taken down to, in, in, there's a branch [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1197.28s)]
*  called the Umayya branch in, in central Damascus, in the, in the Maysat area. He was taken to, to [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1204.96s)]
*  the lower level, and we'd heard about this lower level, what goes on in there, and the screams that [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1210.96s)]
*  were coming from there just to scare us, right? Just, just so we, an Egyptian, his name's Muhammad [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1215.2s)]
*  Radwan, I think, I think he actually lives in Germany now. He was accused of being, he had an [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1220.56s)]
*  American passport, he was accused of being a U.S. agent. Also, he was tortured, and then, but he, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1227.04s)]
*  he thankfully managed to get out. The Chilean guy, I don't know what happened to him. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1234.56s)]
*  I, I, I mean, I experienced something there, and that was just in the beginning phase. That was, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1239.12s)]
*  that was in the phase that I was just telling you. They, they were still hesitant on, on how to deal [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1245.2s)]
*  with people. After that, after that point in time, anyone who went, anyone who was caught, if you were [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1249.4399999999998s)]
*  a militant, you would get out very soon, you would get out. It would take a week. If, if, if, if [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1257.2s)]
*  someone had arms and they were fighting against, against the government, then they would be released [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1263.2s)]
*  very quickly. If you were involved in free speech or filming what was going on or doing interviews [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1267.92s)]
*  or calling for democracy or written anything of an opinion that seemed somewhat intellectual, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1273.8400000000001s)]
*  or you were asking for, you know, demanding something for the government, these people went [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1280.16s)]
*  to prison and never got out. Never. They just went missing. And this, you know, this, this gives you [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1284.4s)]
*  some idea of how just lethal and disgusting this regime is, is that they would pick those that, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1290.48s)]
*  you know, those who lifted roses to, to soldiers and to police, police officers. And to, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1298.3200000000002s)]
*  one example is here is Riaz Mottar, a famous activist who was in Darya in the suburbs of [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1305.44s)]
*  Damascus. Famous and, and, and someone that, you know, everyone in, in, in the Syrian uprising [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1310.88s)]
*  considered a hero and was very proud of because he basically went down to the soldiers and gave [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1318.64s)]
*  them roses. They, they arrested this guy and tortured him to death, gave his body to his mum. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1324.16s)]
*  And, and that was sort of a message to, you know, this is what we'll do to anyone who will [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1330.0800000000002s)]
*  revolt peacefully against us. And if you raise arms against us and we don't kill you, but we, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1336.48s)]
*  we get a hold of you, we'll release you. Don't worry. You'll just have to go and find another [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1342.0s)]
*  weapon. And it was just, you know, just crazy. So that, that once, this is to sort of say that [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1345.44s)]
*  this opened the way for slowly you move from a civil society that was totally peaceful. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1355.52s)]
*  And then you start going into a militarised opposition. You had people defecting from the [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1361.68s)]
*  army and within about four to five months, it became a militarised, not, I'm not going to say [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1365.76s)]
*  largely militarised opposition, but it was, it was significant. There was a large number of people [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1373.1999999999998s)]
*  that were willing to fight against the government. And at this stage, this is when the government [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1379.28s)]
*  had, let's say the government had its excuse to, to begin carpet bombing cities, destroying all [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1385.36s)]
*  of them, just, you know, as long as they had one image of one guy with a gun, then that was their [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1391.36s)]
*  sort of means to bomb an entire city. And we saw this in homes, the whole city was leveled to the [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1398.64s)]
*  ground. And the excuse was that, you know, we have a few people with guns, so we're going to destroy [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1404.72s)]
*  this whole city. Today, lots of people will listen to you and go, we hear what you're saying. It [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1413.36s)]
*  sounds unbelievably horrific, but HTS, the main force, the Islamists, people look, you know, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1421.68s)]
*  the origins in Al-Qaeda, they remember the experience of ISIS and the rise of ISIS, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1429.52s)]
*  which ruled 40% of Syria at one point. And they'll be, they'll think about back to Afghanistan, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1434.0800000000002s)]
*  the Mujahideen of the 80s and what happened there. You're not a Syrian Muslim. You're someone who is [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1441.52s)]
*  celebrating what's happened. How would you respond to those people who, and the fear of [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1447.92s)]
*  what will happen to minorities, like Christian Syrians, for example? [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1452.96s)]
*  First of all, you know, some, if you don't really know what's going on in Syria, I mean, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1458.72s)]
*  it's totally just a vitally worried. I totally understand that. What I can say is that you can [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1464.16s)]
*  look at the example of people like James Foley, who was executed by ISIS. You can look at the [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1470.88s)]
*  example of Steven Sotloff, also executed by ISIS. The example of Austin Tice, who's missing right [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1478.0800000000002s)]
*  now, where I'm hoping that they're going to find him now in somewhere in Damascus, because he was [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1486.88s)]
*  taken by the Syrian regime. And I think Remy Opchik, who was killed in Bab Amr, Marie Colvin, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1492.88s)]
*  all these people I'm mentioning, first of all, their own stances, they had seen the situation [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1502.4s)]
*  on the ground. They had, you can even say mingled and filmed in areas where these extremist factions [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1507.8400000000001s)]
*  could be seen, were there. And even their families now, after some of them have been executed by [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1514.72s)]
*  ISIS, if you listen to their statements, do I take, you know, they have a lot of background [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1521.2s)]
*  in Syria, they all blame Assad, every single one of them. And there's a reason for that, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1526.64s)]
*  is that we know that in this situation, there's a chicken and there's an egg. And the egg is, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1533.6000000000001s)]
*  the chicken is Assad, and the egg is what Assad is, basically these factions that Assad has [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1540.56s)]
*  created the environment for. It's our- [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1546.96s)]
*  And nurtured, didn't he actively nurture them as well? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1549.8400000000001s)]
*  Yes, definitely. Definitely. You had prisons that were basically anyone with an extremist ideology, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1552.0s)]
*  they were released from these prisons, this is all documented. There are many of the officers, sorry, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1558.72s)]
*  of the leaders in the Islamic State that came from Assad's prisons, they were released in 2013 and [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1565.28s)]
*  2012 and joined the ranks. And it was, you know, the regime's intention to create this fundamentalist [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1572.08s)]
*  Islamic opposition that it could then focus the attention on, especially in the media. But all [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1582.32s)]
*  right, I mean, let's ignore all that. Let's just say that Assad, all right, he created this [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1587.36s)]
*  environment and now you have this really bad environment and it's very dangerous. I genuinely [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1591.04s)]
*  believe, and I've seen this myself, I've been to these areas as someone who's not a Muslim, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1597.44s)]
*  everyone knew that I was not a Muslim. I spent time with groups that were extremist factions [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1603.44s)]
*  as a journalist, and I spoke openly about who I was, about how I thought that I wanted democracy [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1611.52s)]
*  in Syria. And I did not see the sort of thing, neither the accusations or the stuff that was [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1618.48s)]
*  being produced from, let's say, the media wing of ISIS about these fear campaigns that were created [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1626.48s)]
*  by, I'm not comparing ISIS to the US military or anything like that, but just as any military [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1635.6s)]
*  wants to show its might, the way that ISIS tried to do this was by putting these videos together [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1642.96s)]
*  of how they executed people. Obviously, it's horrific, but what I'm trying to say is that [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1649.52s)]
*  these people, try to take the image out of your head of this guy cutting someone's head off. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1655.44s)]
*  The rest of the fighters, we're talking about just the ordinary fighters that were somehow, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1661.68s)]
*  were in this vacuum situation because there wasn't much support going to the more moderate [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1667.04s)]
*  groups that were fighting against the Assad regime. There was this vacuum situation where [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1673.76s)]
*  everyone then diverted to these groups because these groups had resources, because these groups [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1678.48s)]
*  weren't being attacked. I'm talking about ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra, the groups that were linked [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1684.08s)]
*  to al-Qaeda. They weren't being attacked by the Syrian government. One example is ISIS's headquarters [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1687.52s)]
*  in the very center of Raqqa city, which had floodlights on it. At times when there's no [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1696.1599999999999s)]
*  electricity in the city, they had generators with floodlights. This headquarters is basically the [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1704.3999999999999s)]
*  size of Trafalgar Square. The Syrian raging flights and the Russian flights would just fly on by [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1710.72s)]
*  and they were never targeted, never. But schools were targeted, hospitals were targeted, civilian [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1717.52s)]
*  homes were targeted, everywhere else, but ISIS's own headquarters wasn't targeted. They were [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1725.04s)]
*  basically given a free pass to take territory. As you mentioned, they took a very large segment of [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1732.16s)]
*  territory in Syria and that was allowed to happen by the Syrian government. What this meant was [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1736.56s)]
*  the Syrian government would be fighting with opposition forces, weakening the moderate rebels, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1743.84s)]
*  and then you would have ISIS come in and take these areas. Because of this environment, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1750.8799999999999s)]
*  these Islamic hardline groups started to attract Syrian fighters. A lot of people like to say that [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1755.9199999999998s)]
*  they're all foreign fighters. A lot of them were foreign fighters, but a lot of them were Syrians. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1766.32s)]
*  It was because first of all, they would be safer on the battlefield. They would be safer. They had [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1770.8799999999999s)]
*  more weapons. They seemed stronger. They had more money. That's why that was the case. Today in Syria, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1776.8s)]
*  when you look at the Jolani, who used to be linked to ISIS, in fact, Jolani was in Iraq, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1786.4s)]
*  right? And Baghdadi, obviously killed, who was the head of ISIS, sent him to Syria to set up [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1797.3600000000001s)]
*  and establish the Islamic State in Syria. Then what Jolani did was he started working on his [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1808.6399999999999s)]
*  own group, which was Jabhat al-Nusra. He was warned by, I think a message was sent from someone called [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1815.9199999999998s)]
*  Abu Maria al-Qahtani. He was sent a message saying from Baghdadi that you're not allowed to do this. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1823.44s)]
*  Then he defected from ISIS, Jolani. When he was under threat from ISIS, he went and pledged [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1828.8s)]
*  allegiance to Jabhat al-Nusra. That was a sort of protection. Then speed forward, two years later, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1836.24s)]
*  he then disconnected. He then went his own way from Jabhat al-Nusra, from al-Qahtani. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1846.0s)]
*  The reason I mention this to say is that this man is a very pragmatic person. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1855.44s)]
*  Not necessarily, I'm not saying he doesn't hold that Islamic ideology, but what I do know is that [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1860.08s)]
*  most of these leaders in these extremist groups were not themselves extremists. They were people [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1866.7199999999998s)]
*  that wanted power, and they knew that they could take advantage of the large influx of jihadists [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1873.28s)]
*  that had come into Syria, foreign fighters, and take advantage of the fact that there was an [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1878.08s)]
*  environment where people needed support, and they were under terrible conditions, and they [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1884.08s)]
*  took advantage of that. As long as those conditions are not there, I don't think there's anything to [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1890.48s)]
*  take advantage of. What do you say to those who say this is actually a huge victory for [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1896.0s)]
*  Western imperialism? That Assad was a fighter against Western imperialism, a dedicated supporter [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1902.72s)]
*  of the Palestinian cause, and that this is a huge strategic victory as a result for [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1911.6s)]
*  both Israel and the United States? No, let's unpack that. Look at this idea that Assad was [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1918.56s)]
*  resisting. First of all, 1973, I think, I'm getting up, the 1973 agreement which Netanyahu just [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1925.76s)]
*  dropped. It's basically an admission that Syria was a guarantor for the protection of Israel. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1935.92s)]
*  Not one bullet has been fired at the Jolan Heights, which is Syrian occupied territory [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1944.3200000000002s)]
*  that Israel occupies. In fact, in 2011, when the protests began in Syria, Palestinians [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1950.24s)]
*  weren't even allowed, who wanted to protest against Israel and taking out Syrian land back. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1958.08s)]
*  They weren't allowed to do that. A state that prevents its own citizens and Palestinians from [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1964.08s)]
*  speaking out against Israelis. This agreement on the border is basically Syria guaranteeing [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1970.8799999999999s)]
*  that nothing is going to happen to Israel. It's a state that's not going to be able to do that. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1976.8s)]
*  Basically, Syria is guaranteeing that nothing is going to happen on the border between Syria and [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1983.84s)]
*  Israel. The moment it's dropped is the moment that Assad is gone, because they know that Assad can [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1988.8s)]
*  no longer provide those guarantees. They're supposedly worried that the opposition are not [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=1994.7199999999998s)]
*  going to provide those guarantees. In Syria, at no stage did I ever feel in Syria that I was allowed [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2000.1599999999999s)]
*  to voice support for Palestinians in any genuine fashion. This has always been an excuse by the [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2009.04s)]
*  government to govern the people with oppression, to control the narrative. Any opposition that you [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2017.28s)]
*  have to the government on how it treats its civilians or how the country is being run or [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2024.72s)]
*  the fact that so much money goes to the military, supposedly. The answer is that we're a resisting [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2030.0s)]
*  country fighting against foreign forces that are trying to occupy our lands, that we want to free [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2036.72s)]
*  Palestine. These are just things that are said, but not things that are actually put into practice. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2042.08s)]
*  Any Syrian, you ask, even those that support the government, you could just take a small tour and [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2049.12s)]
*  actually have a conversation with people who actually support Assad, Syrians who support Assad. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2056.08s)]
*  They don't know where Palestine is on the map, even though it's just next door. They really don't [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2061.52s)]
*  know where it is on the map. There is not this culture in the Assadist circles of any support [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2066.48s)]
*  for Palestine. If you go on pro-raging channels, Facebook pages, Twitter accounts, I'm talking [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2073.6s)]
*  about pro-raging accounts that are inside Syria, you won't even find mention of Palestine, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2079.04s)]
*  literally. But you find these anti-impeachists, extreme, I don't know, outside the country, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2086.2400000000002s)]
*  who supposedly, I say supposedly support Palestinians. The reason I say this, I find it [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2096.08s)]
*  highly contradictory that you could defend children being killed in one situation, but somehow be [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2105.12s)]
*  cheering it in another situation. So I don't trust any of these people, honestly. I don't know what [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2113.7599999999998s)]
*  their thinking process is. I mean, some of them have occasionally accidentally used videos of [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2121.28s)]
*  atrocities committed by the Assad regime, thinking it was atrocities committed by Israel and Gaza, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2128.2400000000002s)]
*  as if there isn't a lack of video footage of atrocities committed by Israel and Gaza. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2133.84s)]
*  It's unbelievable. I've seen so much of that. By the way, a lot of that, when that happens, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2137.6000000000004s)]
*  I didn't used to really call those things out. I used to actually message people and say that [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2147.2799999999997s)]
*  you're using the wrong picture because in the end, these things are happening in Gaza anyway. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2151.84s)]
*  But yes, that was the case. And what's funny is that when we started seeing them [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2157.7599999999998s)]
*  basically cheering the civil defense, rightfully, right, cheering the civil defense in Gaza, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2164.24s)]
*  the same very people like Eder Bartlett and I forget these names, I shouldn't really be [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2171.04s)]
*  helping them out. But they would basically be cheering on the civil defense in Gaza and [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2179.12s)]
*  calling the civil defense in Syria Al-Qaeda. And it's just crazy. I don't get it. So Syria, [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2186.64s)]
*  the government being considered an anti-imperialist country fighting against [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2195.92s)]
*  imperialism has always been basically siding with another imperialism. Syria is exposed to Iran, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2203.76s)]
*  exposed to Russia. If you go to Syria now and you go to Syria more than two weeks ago, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2212.96s)]
*  you would realize that Syria is basically a shared, Syria used to be basically shared territory [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2221.44s)]
*  of Iran and Russia and even Lebanese factions such as Hezbollah. There is no such thing as a [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2228.4s)]
*  Syrian identity in Syria, nothing. It's not even existent. And yes, you will find many supporters, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2235.36s)]
*  Assad supporters, but if you really do your digging to find out where these supporters are from, [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2243.04s)]
*  you will find they're from neighboring countries. They're Iranians, they're Lebanese, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2248.4s)]
*  and it's because they have a foothold in the country. They have an interest in the country. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2253.92s)]
*  I've seen the sentiment amongst Palestinians towards what's going on in Syria. And I don't [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2259.92s)]
*  blame Palestinians. This is an ongoing discussion that I have with many fellow Syrians. Some Syrians [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2265.6800000000003s)]
*  feel a bit resentment towards some of the Palestinians. We're talking about ordinary [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2272.6400000000003s)]
*  Palestinians here who are quiet to the atrocities of the Assad regime towards Syrians. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2276.96s)]
*  I don't blame them. I know Palestinians are in a situation that is very unique. They don't have [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2283.12s)]
*  really any support, any real meaningful support from anyone. So if Assad supposedly makes it [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2289.84s)]
*  easier for Hezbollah to get weapons from Iran that can then be used against the Assad regime, [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2297.44s)]
*  if there's a one, sorry, against the Israelis, if there's a 1% chance that that's actually [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2304.24s)]
*  happening, 1%, just 1% chance. And I was in Gaza, then I would find it hard, and my children were [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2311.4399999999996s)]
*  there, I would find it hard not to be happy that support was coming in of any form from whoever it [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2318.3199999999997s)]
*  was coming from. Although it's interesting because the polling found, including by Palestinian [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2324.24s)]
*  organizations, that 83% of Palestinians backed the Syrian revolution. The years after it happened, [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2328.64s)]
*  just 9% backed Assad. More recent polls show a very unfavorable opinion of Assad, particularly [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2337.6s)]
*  in Gaza. Indeed, more hostility towards him than almost any foreign leader. He was ranked down [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2343.12s)]
*  alongside Joe Biden by Palestinians, according to that polling, which is why Hamas were actually [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2348.96s)]
*  kicked out of Damascus, because they clearly had to reflect to some degree what Palestinians in Gaza [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2355.68s)]
*  themselves felt, because they refused to back the Assad regime and then overtly backs the uprising. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2364.24s)]
*  And they issued a statement now supporting the revolution. And again, that's not surprising, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2371.8399999999997s)]
*  given they would be completely and utterly out of sync with the Palestinian people. I mean, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2376.8799999999997s)]
*  thousands of Palestinians were massacred, weren't they? I mean, the action group for Palestinians [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2380.3999999999996s)]
*  of Syria found that of the thousands killed by the Assad regime, the Palestinians I'm talking about, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2384.72s)]
*  at least 631 Palestinian refugees were tortured to death, they say, among the minors and elderly [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2389.8399999999997s)]
*  people. And hundreds of Palestinian prisoners are now being released. Just quickly on that, [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2396.16s)]
*  on the question of Israel, I was going to ask, because Craig Murray, who's a former British [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2401.4399999999996s)]
*  ambassador turned, I don't know, maverick of some description, he says, two astonishing things. One, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2405.2s)]
*  Israel has just annexed hundreds more square kilometres of Syria and launched hundreds of [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2411.76s)]
*  bombing attacks on Syria's military and civilian infrastructure without the new regime in Syria [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2415.1200000000003s)]
*  firing one single shot against Israel. Two, in the UK, liberal democrats like Owen Jones, it's funny [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2419.6000000000004s)]
*  because he's actually a former liberal democrat and I'm a lifelong socialist, and Salafists, [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2424.96s)]
*  and then mentions Five Pillars UK, still refuse to accept that the coup was organised by Israel [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2429.76s)]
*  and the USA despite overwhelming evidence. I mean, that last point is just so silly, because clearly [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2434.1600000000003s)]
*  there was mass support for the overthrow of Assad, it's just too ridiculous. But that point there, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2439.04s)]
*  I mean, he doesn't see it so contradictory, because he says, he's correct, I mean, Israel has invaded [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2442.4s)]
*  Syria. It's literally invaded Syria, the justification being to defend the Golan Heights, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2448.32s)]
*  which is annexed territory, Syrian territory, which is against international law that Israel's [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2452.72s)]
*  even there in the first place. And he's correct, they are bombing Syria. But I mean, Israel's bombed [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2456.56s)]
*  Syria over and over and over and over again, and Assad's never flied back, let alone fought against [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2462.08s)]
*  to take back the Golan Heights. And it's notable they're firing now, aren't they? They're firing now [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2468.08s)]
*  on these military targets, because they're scared of them falling into the hands of the rebels. So [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2475.92s)]
*  I don't know that what he's saying there is weird cognitive dissonance, because I don't understand [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2478.8s)]
*  how it justifies his argument. Yeah, see, the Assad regime hasn't lifted a finger against Israel. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2482.08s)]
*  It was literally a guarantor to Israel, literally. I think the only maybe point of fear for Israel [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2493.28s)]
*  was Assad's balancing act relationship that he had with Iran. And I think that was problematic, [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2502.6400000000003s)]
*  not just for Israel, but also problematic for Putin, and also problematic for Iran and for [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2510.1600000000003s)]
*  the Emirates. And Assad had played this balancing act between them. And I think if there's any genius [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2518.24s)]
*  to Assad, if we're going to give him any credit, and I'm talking about his system here, not [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2525.52s)]
*  necessarily him personally, but if there's any genius to the Assad system, that maybe the cards [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2530.16s)]
*  that were laid down for this were done so by his father, then it is this balancing act that Syria [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2536.3999999999996s)]
*  has been able to play. And that's what's kept him in power for awfully so long. But Syria [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2541.2s)]
*  does not have any, I mean, you know, for me, it just feels a bit annoying to have to even address [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2550.7999999999997s)]
*  the idea that Assad is somewhat considered a resistance to Israel. It's just totally ridiculous. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2559.8399999999997s)]
*  It's pathetic. The whole topic is pathetic, to be honest. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2567.76s)]
*  But just on Assad, just a few final things I just wanted to just reply. I mean, one of them is about [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2570.8s)]
*  Assad himself now in Moscow with his family. I mean, do you fear he'll never get justice? I mean, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2576.32s)]
*  partly it's in the interest of the Russian regime now to give Assad a cosseted life, [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2582.4s)]
*  because otherwise, all the clients of Russia will go, well, you know, as soon as it went a bit south [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2586.5600000000004s)]
*  for Assad, then Russia abandoned them, and therefore we can't trust Russia. So there's a [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2592.7200000000003s)]
*  kind of incentive there. So is your fear that basically he'll live, well, we don't know, [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2596.88s)]
*  because as we can see, there is a general rule that tyrannies tend to fall eventually. If I [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2601.6800000000003s)]
*  repeat, I would bet my life on him surviving forever. But I mean, what's your thoughts on that? [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2606.48s)]
*  Will Assad just indefinitely, do you fear he'll never get justice? [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2611.28s)]
*  Do you know, what I want to say on this might not be very popular, but I think the best thing that [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2615.76s)]
*  happened was that he got away. I think this is the best case scenario. I mean, look at Saddam [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2622.0s)]
*  Hussein, right? Whether this is public sentiment or not, you have a large segment of the Arab world [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2628.16s)]
*  that see him as a hero. And it's because of the fashion of what happened, the way... I totally [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2635.76s)]
*  agree with what happened to Saddam Hussein, just to be clear. I think it should have happened much [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2645.12s)]
*  quicker. I think his trial should have been a much swifter trial. But with the amount of misinformation [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2649.12s)]
*  that you have today and the tools that people have at their hands to distort information and play with [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2656.24s)]
*  people's feelings, Assad would have been turned into a hero had he been caught. The people that [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2662.88s)]
*  Assad supposedly... Supposedly, Assad was the protector of minorities in Syria. He... [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2670.88s)]
*  What has become clearly obvious to them was that he was not willing to stay and fight and to protect [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2677.92s)]
*  them. And he left them. And that is the exact contrary... That is contrary to the image that [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2683.44s)]
*  has been built for Assad, that he's a hero, that he protects these communities, that he's going to [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2689.84s)]
*  stay and fight to the very last moment. But the reality was that when Iran and Russia weren't there, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2694.96s)]
*  he wasn't able to face... The fighting force that's on the ground now, something that I think a lot of [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2701.28s)]
*  people won't know, the opposition groups, they were much larger in 2013 and 2014. There were [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2708.48s)]
*  considerably larger numbers of people fighting against Assad. So it was really the support of [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2716.08s)]
*  Russia and Iran that helped Assad win the war. And at this stage, I think him fleeing and not... [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2721.44s)]
*  There are some downsides of him not facing justice. Don't get me wrong. Obviously, this opens the door [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2732.2400000000002s)]
*  for other people to assume that they can commit these crimes and get away with it. But I think [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2737.92s)]
*  that here, the pros outweigh the cons, really. I really do. I think that had he stayed and had he [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2744.72s)]
*  gotten arrested or had he died, he would have been labeled a hero. It would have kept a portion of [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2751.3599999999997s)]
*  society still rallying on that memory. And I think now what you see in Syria, from just [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2759.12s)]
*  what I... First-hand things that I'm seeing, I've been speaking to people who used to support the [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2765.52s)]
*  regime, and suddenly they have a different perspective. Suddenly they're saying other stuff. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2771.04s)]
*  Suddenly they have an excuse to say, we didn't know he would do this to us. We didn't know that [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2775.52s)]
*  there were these prisons. We didn't know that this was happening. And I think Assad running away has [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2780.16s)]
*  given an opportunity for Syrians to reconciliation, and it's given them an opportunity for hope. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2785.04s)]
*  So I see the downside, but I think that the fact that he got away [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2791.44s)]
*  has definitely been a positive. Definitely. Just before I ask the final question about the [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2799.28s)]
*  future of Syria, you've been so active online talking about Israel's genocide against the [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2805.04s)]
*  Palestinian people. I mean, do you think... I actually said... I mean, we talked a lot about [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2811.68s)]
*  the interests of Israel and what happens now. And you can actually sense a huge amount of nervousness, [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2816.64s)]
*  because actually those in the know, and analysts have been making this clear, but you can see this [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2821.6s)]
*  actually by Israeli analysts coming out and saying it is Israel's preference was the status quo, [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2826.4s)]
*  which was a weakened Assad regime. That's what they preferred. He did his rhetoric and all the [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2833.04s)]
*  rest of it. Didn't lift a finger in practice. Syria was weakened, didn't offer any threat. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2838.0800000000004s)]
*  And now this offers a massive uncertainty. That's why they're bombing Syria. If they thought this [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2844.56s)]
*  was... Why would they need to go around bombing everything on their own terms and invade Syria? [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2850.96s)]
*  Obviously, they see the hope of expanding territory, the satelit-colonial regime. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2856.24s)]
*  But do you actually see this could be... I mean, I've seen some Palestinians expressing hope that [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2861.6s)]
*  this will help the Palestinian cause in some ways, and it impulses the idea that, I suppose, [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2867.52s)]
*  in part, all tyrannies come to an end. I think, yeah, from that point of view, I agree. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2872.88s)]
*  I think that Syria, in the state that it's in now, I don't think that any promises should be made [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2879.44s)]
*  to Palestinians in any shape or form. And I don't think... If I put myself in the position of a [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2887.52s)]
*  Palestinian, I would say that what we had was false hopes with the Assad regime. It was fake. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2896.72s)]
*  It wasn't real. And the sooner this form of fake resistance is eliminated, I think then you face [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2904.64s)]
*  the music and realize what's really going on. I don't see that Palestine gained anything from [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2915.3599999999997s)]
*  Assad being a so-called ally at all. There's nothing to demonstrate that other than the fact [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2924.7999999999997s)]
*  that territory was used to transport equipment to Hezbollah in Lebanon. We saw Hezbollah [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2931.12s)]
*  basically willing to stop its aggression against Israel. No dictatorship should be a means. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2938.7999999999997s)]
*  No justified cause should depend on a dictatorship. It just doesn't make sense. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2948.4s)]
*  You can't call for freedom in Palestine and derive that from support from a dictator. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2955.04s)]
*  I'm not just using morals here and saying that I genuinely believe that Palestine gains nothing [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2963.12s)]
*  from these sort of alliances at all. It's an excuse for Israel to continue doing what it's doing. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2969.2s)]
*  Israel has managed to accuse Palestinians of being terrorists. I know that the majority of people [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2975.44s)]
*  will never accept this narrative. But the point is that Israel uses such support as that from [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2981.44s)]
*  Assad to basically accuse Palestinians of not being a righteous cause. So I see it as a stain [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2990.2400000000002s)]
*  on any Palestinian that thinks that Assad is an ally. I don't see it helpful in any way. But [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=2997.12s)]
*  is there any hope that a new Syria can form some sort of hope for Palestine? I think [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3003.44s)]
*  it's going to take time. It's going to take a lot of time. Right now, we have a very messy situation [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3016.16s)]
*  in Damascus. It's not tomorrow that people are going to come out and express the aspirations [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3021.68s)]
*  of all Syrians. When I say all Syrians, I mean the vast majority of Syrians support Palestinians. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3029.2799999999997s)]
*  The vast majority. Contrary to what these lies that are made about Syrians, especially those [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3036.0s)]
*  that oppose Assad, I'm not unique at all. What is hard in Syria is the ability to basically [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3043.8399999999997s)]
*  rally on the same side as someone, as a group like Hezbollah, rallying on the same side as Iran. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3054.72s)]
*  These have been obstacles for many Syrians to be able to speak out and really show support for [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3061.52s)]
*  Palestine. And I think that's why you see a slightly low voice coming out of Syrians who [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3067.76s)]
*  oppose Assad for Palestine. But in general, the vast majority of Syrians support the Palestinian [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3072.8s)]
*  cause. But how long it's going to take for that to translate into policy in Syria, [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3079.28s)]
*  we're still at the stage of actually forming a government that represents Syrians. This is not [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3084.5600000000004s)]
*  going to happen tomorrow. That's my final question. What do you think will happen next? Not just your [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3089.44s)]
*  hopes, but what do you think will happen? Some will say, well, look, what happened in Libya, [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3094.4s)]
*  different. It was direct military intervention, which is what happened there. But the chaos, [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3099.6000000000004s)]
*  Libya has not been a functioning state since that happened. What do you think will happen? [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3105.6s)]
*  I think that we have to be very cautious at this stage. And I'm a bit cynical because the thing is, [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3111.6s)]
*  we've heard some very promising statements from Joe Lani, very promising statements. He's even [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3122.32s)]
*  suggested the idea of dissolving HTS. And if he were to do this and to hand over power to a [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3129.2s)]
*  transitional government, and this transitional government begin preparations for bringing in [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3140.08s)]
*  and sheltering the entire opposition outside the country, then I feel that this could be promising. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3147.3599999999997s)]
*  But one issue that we're going to have to grapple with is the need that many sides have for revenge [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3154.8s)]
*  on the ground. This is going to be the next phase. There are many people that have committed crimes. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3164.5600000000004s)]
*  I mean, Syrians know who these people are. It's not like these people have all fled the country. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3171.1200000000003s)]
*  All you have is maybe, let's say, a group of 500, 1,000 people who have managed to leave the country [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3178.2400000000002s)]
*  who are in top positions. However, the murderer and the victim are going to be walking on the [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3184.24s)]
*  same road, basically. And so the next phase is really self-restraint and deciding where is that [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3191.4399999999996s)]
*  threshold of where transitional justice is applied. Let's call it a pyramid of a society that has [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3199.9199999999996s)]
*  committed crimes. Can you implement justice against everyone? Unfortunately, in a situation [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3210.4s)]
*  like Syria where you want to implement transitional justice, it can't be with everyone. I think we're [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3220.08s)]
*  going to have a very bumpy ride. I think we're going to have conflict between secularism or those [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3225.76s)]
*  who aspire for secularism like myself and the hardline Islamists. I think that there are a lot [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3233.52s)]
*  of possibilities of this going the wrong way. But I think that at the same time, Syrians in this past [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3242.3199999999997s)]
*  14 years have learned to be cautious. And this is a phase where I think the next 10 or 15 days are [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3248.08s)]
*  really going to tell us what cards we have on the table. It's still not even clear how this all [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3260.4s)]
*  happened. It's still not even clear who's involved in making this happen. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3265.52s)]
*  Rami, it must be a very emotional, surreal time for you, given what you've experienced, [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3272.7200000000003s)]
*  the horrors you've witnessed, and the knowledge of the mass slaughter that your fellow people [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3279.28s)]
*  have suffered. But you've spoken so eloquently and you've educated me and I'm sure you've educated [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3289.12s)]
*  you've certainly educated all of us about the context and what's happened. You've been an [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3294.4s)]
*  invaluable voice, as I've said, all the time. I've followed you on social media. So for those [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3300.88s)]
*  watching, do share this video, send it to your friends, send it around. But I want to say something [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3306.48s)]
*  before you. Honestly, very few people have shown the consistency that you show. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3311.6s)]
*  I'm talking about people in your position. Very few people have done that. I'm saying this for [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3319.6s)]
*  your audience. It's not easy because to get clicks, you can't be right on every topic. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3325.44s)]
*  You can't maintain a huge audience if you just want to say the things that make your audience [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3333.92s)]
*  happy, especially if you have different topics, opposing topics. If you want to always say the [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3341.8399999999997s)]
*  right thing, it's not easy and I commend you for doing that. I hadn't known before a long time [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3348.32s)]
*  back. I didn't know what your stance was on Syria. You surprised me and I'm really grateful that you [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3354.7200000000003s)]
*  have that consistency. I think that you being here and your voice, I think you play a major role. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3362.7200000000003s)]
*  Thank you. Well, it means a lot. But I just, in a way, I think it's those who don't have more [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3367.76s)]
*  consistency, deserve to be damned more than those who do to be celebrated. But I'd never be able to [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3372.96s)]
*  look myself in the mirror if I didn't try and have that more consistency. But the one thing I'd always [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3379.84s)]
*  say to my, I suppose my critics is that I only say what I think. There's no ulterior motive, [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3383.68s)]
*  not thinking of my career or my various handlers. Although of course the juicy checks I get from [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3389.44s)]
*  very security services do make it a little bit easier. But I only say what I think even when I [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3394.8s)]
*  make mistakes, which I do make mistakes, but I try and put my hands up when I do. But I learn [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3401.68s)]
*  from people like you, that's the key point. And what I've tried to do with this channel [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3406.56s)]
*  all the way from the start is to be educated by the voices that I think we need to hear from. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3410.3199999999997s)]
*  And I hope the moral consistency that I try and aspire to have, I hope that I learn that from [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3417.6s)]
*  people like yourself, I always have voices who are actually in the know, who have lived experiences. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3424.48s)]
*  So I really hope that the people who listen, who watch these videos, listen to these [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3430.64s)]
*  on podcasts or whatever, I hope the same effect. So thank you is what I'm trying to say. And thank [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3435.92s)]
*  you to all the people that I've, on this channel for teaching me. Press like and subscribe, [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3441.12s)]
*  leave comments. That's all good for the algorithm. So more people can hear this [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3446.96s)]
*  brilliant moral consistency from people like Rami. It's been a big honour. Thank you so much. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3449.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3s3l8Z3a-U&t=3454.72s)]
