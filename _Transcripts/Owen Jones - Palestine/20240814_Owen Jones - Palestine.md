# Media's VILE Coverage Of Twin Babies Butchered By Israel
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [August 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRA5aHVhTps)
*  Here is a sickening atrocity, yet another unspeakable crime committed by Israel which
*  is so revealing in so many ways. Mohamed Abu al-Khomsan is a Palestinian man in Gaza,
*  who along with his wife, a doctor, had been displaced from their homes in Gaza City,
*  of course like the vast majority of the Palestinian people in Gaza.
*  She'd just given birth to two twins, one a boy, one a girl, and they were just three days old.
*  He went to register their birth to collect a birth certificate. While he left their home in Deir
*  al-Bala, the Israeli military bombed the apartment. Both his two newborn babies, his wife and her
*  mother, the twins' grandmother, were killed. Their birth certificates and then their death certificates
*  all on the same day. This was too much for him to bear.
*  How any human being can contain that much pain,
*  I mean, that for me is just beyond my imagination.
*  These are babies who only lived for three days, surrounded by hideous violence before
*  their frail little bodies were buried in the debris of their home as a missile collided into it.
*  Now, just before this hideous slaughter, in Facebook posts, this now dead mother
*  was congratulated by many people, including many people in western countries who'd been following
*  her. She had a large following. I've looked. In fact, on my Facebook, I've got three friends
*  in common with her. She's congratulated by someone who starts their message,
*  congratulations, beautiful mama, who asks if there's anything that they can do to help pass
*  on a love to her and her wonderful new babies and asking, girl, boy, and she replies, oh my god,
*  I feel like it was a miracle. And she says what says translated English, praise be to God.
*  And she says, sister, everything is going well. And sure, we'll always need your support. Thanks
*  from deepest heart. She says they're a boy and a girl. I will share you their pick in direct
*  messages. And then she ends with two emojis. That's just one example of the replies.
*  According to the official statistics, 115 babies who were born after Israel's onslaught began last
*  October have been killed, born into a genocidal onslaught and then killed by it. Now let's listen
*  to this testimony from the grieving father.
*  So they were at home?
*  Yes.
*  I'm on the phone with my brother. I'm on the phone with my brother. I'm on the phone with my brother.
*  I'm on the phone with my brother. I'm on the phone with my brother. I'm on the phone with my brother.

I'm on the phone with my brother. I'm on the phone with my brother. I'm on the phone with my brother. I'm on the phone with my brother. I'm on the phone
*  with my brother. I'm on the phone with my brother. I'm on the phone with my brother, And it was the same same answer.
*  My story is different. Let's take a look, My story plays the story is different. Let's see how fun it is.
*  My story plays the story is different. Let's see how fun it is.
*  My story plays the story is different. Let's take a look.
*  My story plays the story is different.
*  My story plays the story is different.
*  killed in Russian strike in Kharkiv Hotel and adds that BBC News has no problem in attributing
*  killing in headlines when it comes to reporting on a Russian strike killing a baby in Ukraine
*  but can't seem to do the same when an Israeli strike kills two babies in Gaza.
*  Let's be clear about this and I hate having to make this comparison all the time but if
*  this had been a Hamas attack and the victims were Israelis can you imagine?
*  Seriously, can you imagine?
*  Can you imagine?
*  It would be very correctly presented as an absolutely abominable atrocity.
*  It would lead to the news, it would be condemned by senior Western leaders in the most emotive
*  terms possible.
*  Not so here because the perpetrator was the Israeli military and the victims were Palestinians.
*  It makes the news but the headlines can't even identify the perpetrator.
*  It's not presented and framed as illustrative of an absolutely obscene military onslaught
*  which if, for example, this was Ukraine, it would be correctly.
*  Now note how this was a direct hit on the apartment.
*  We're told this is one of the most sophisticated military machines on earth and according to
*  Plus 972 magazine their computers know exactly who is in each target before they hit.
*  So what was the justification for this specific attack?
*  A targeted missile attack.
*  Israel is either flying blind with this attack so it isn't.
*  Which is it?
*  Tens of thousands of people slaughtered like this.
*  Here's an example by the way of genocidal mania.
*  In a functioning society the knowledge that the military had slaughtered these two little
*  twins and their mum and their grandmother so close to where people live.
*  I mean this is just a few miles away from where many Israelis live.
*  But in Gaza thousands upon thousands of children including babies and toddlers as well as teenagers
*  have been violently slaughtered, buried, burned alive, shot to death including sniper bullets
*  to the head.
*  In one telegram group of Israeli settlers with 132,000 followers someone posted an image
*  of these two little babies and the weeping man, their father clutching the birth certificates
*  with the text, his wife and twin children were eliminated it really touches me.
*  Followed by yay to the trash.
*  Beneath it our emoji celebrating 327 champagne bottles uncorking 33 are applauding 29 are
*  grinning we could go on you get the picture.
*  This week the brilliant Israeli American historian of genocide Omar Bartov wrote a
*  stunning long piece in the Guardian newspaper following a recent visit to Israel.
*  He writes about the utter inability of Israeli society today to feel any empathy for the
*  population of Gaza.
*  He adds, the majority it seems do not even want to know what is happening in Gaza and
*  this desire is reflected in TV coverage.
*  Israeli television news these days usually begins with reports on the funerals of soldiers
*  invariably described as heroes fallen in the fighting in Gaza.
*  Followed by estimates of how many Hamas fighters were in quotes liquidated.
*  References to Palestinian civilian deaths are rare and normally presented as part of
*  enemy propaganda or as a cause for unwelcome international pressure.
*  In the face of so much death this deafening silence now seems like its own form of vengefulness.
*  He goes on, the way people's eyes glaze over whenever one mentions the suffering of
*  Palestinian civilians and the deaths of thousands of children and women and elderly people is
*  deeply unsettling.
*  Now let's be clear, a genocide of mentality has gripped hold of Israeli society which either
*  means enthusiastic support for mass slaughter or simply indifference.
*  A lack of emotion.
*  However extreme and barbaric the atrocity committed.
*  Now these atrocities, some of the worst atrocities committed in our age are being facilitated
*  directly by our governments not least the US administration which has just released
*  a vast sum of arms of weapons for Israel to continue committing these horrors.
*  Now US spokesperson Vedant Patel was asked about this atrocity.
*  Department in the US issued certain statements mourning the loss of life from some of these
*  killings and you talk about deterrence.
*  Just hours ago two twins who were newborn were killed in Gaza with their mother and
*  grandmother as their father went to collect their birth certificates.
*  They were four days old, born into war, experienced only war, killed by war.
*  How is the US responding to this instance given, again this comes a day after the US
*  celebrated the human death?
*  So I'm not going to speak to specific instances and incidents that happen.
*  I will let the IDF speak to any operations they can take.
*  I will say just hearing this from your reporting this is obviously incredibly heartbreaking
*  and again Israel has every moral and strategic imperative to minimize civilian loss but I
*  don't have any of the other contours surrounding this operation and I will let the IDF speak to that.
*  Just contemptible stuff.
*  Listen to how he defers the IDF which is responsible for these atrocities.
*  Let's just be clear, I'm going to be very clear about something.
*  It's not going to be possible to contain the consequences of what we're discussing here.
*  These crimes are simply too grave, too extreme, too perverse, too shameless, too unapologetic.
*  A bitter harvest has been sowed before our eyes.
*  The seeds are being planted.
*  That grieving father will surely never forgive those guilty of this
*  heinous crime.
*  But that goes for so many others all over the world who have seen this atrocity and have watched
*  every single day for months and months and months as atrocity after atrocity after atrocity
*  is committed with the full complicity and involvement of our governments.
*  Do you know what though?
*  You know what?
*  You didn't need to know the context.
*  You didn't need to know the dynamics.
*  You didn't even need to know the history.
*  You just needed to see Palestinians as human beings, let alone as human beings with equal
*  worth.
*  That should have been enough.
*  I've said it many times, but I will say it again.
*  Those who facilitated this hideous slaughter, whether by directly legitimising it or by
*  staying silent when they had the platform despite knowing full well what was happening,
*  they must never be forgiven.
*  They must be held to account for what they held made possible to the day they die.
