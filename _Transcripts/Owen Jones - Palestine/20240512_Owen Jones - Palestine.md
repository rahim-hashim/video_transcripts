# Cops Crush Gaza Encampment At UPenn - Where Are Free Speech Warriors Now?
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55U-mMJIsRM)
*  So over the last few weeks, we've seen across the United States, but also elsewhere, student
*  encampments protesting against Israel's genocidal onslaught against Gaza. I'm actually here in
*  Dublin and I was here at an encampment which was victorious, Trinity College Dublin. They demanded
*  that the university authorities divest from Israeli companies, including those directly
*  linked, I should say, to the illegal settlements in the West Bank. After five days of that encampment,
*  the authorities gave in and accepted the demands. Now, in the United States, this was a point the
*  protest leaders here in Dublin made. We've seen brutal repression, both a combination of police
*  attacks on these encampments, as well as pro-Israel thugs, which in, for example,
*  in Los Angeles came in brutally and basically rioted whilst the police looked on and attacked
*  students. Now, one of these encampments is at UPenn, which is obviously an extremely prestigious
*  university in the United States. Their encampment was set up on the 25th of April. Now, yesterday,
*  in the early hours, they were subjected to the police, including riot cops in riot gear,
*  and storming in, engaging in a mass arrest. Let's just see a clip now from what happened at UPenn.
*  I'm really delighted to be joined by Dagmari, who is a faculty member, and Eliana, who is a
*  sophomore young undergraduate member, as I suppose we would say in the British context. Anyways,
*  we're delighted to speak to you both. How are you both doing? Great. We're doing well, as well as
*  we're going to be under these circumstances. So you're in a hotel lobby just near where the
*  encampment was over in the glorious state of Pennsylvania. Okay, let's just talk about it.
*  Firstly, this encampment. Let's just go back to basics here. Why are these student encampments
*  important? Yeah, so we began the encampment and we have three demands that have remained
*  throughout the entirety. One, to disclose investments from the University of Pennsylvania.
*  Two, to divest from companies profiting off of Israelis' genocide in Gaza. And three, to defend
*  Palestinian scholarship, to defend pro-Palestinian speech on campus. We had set up the encampment
*  with the goal to get these demands met. And as we've seen, the university has met us with violence
*  and aggression. And it is a real travesty that that's not met. Dagmari, I mean, you're a faculty
*  member and obviously we've seen faculty members involved and supportive of the action students
*  have taken at campuses both in the United States and elsewhere. From your perspective, why is this
*  so important? Well, it's crucial on the one hand, I mean personally, to speak out when a genocide is
*  taking place. I don't want my silence to translate into complicity. That's one. And secondly,
*  universities are places where critical substantive conversation takes place. And the university
*  after October 7th, but even before that, has suppressed speech having to do with Palestine.
*  It's taken numerous actions. So as faculty members, we thought as an academic university,
*  it has to meet the obligation where critical honest conversation can happen and there cannot be a
*  moratorium on Palestine, right? The Palestinian exception to free speech. That's one. And secondly,
*  it is to support our students who are part of the encampment engaged in an enormous effort to educate
*  the campus when the university failed to do so and actually was taking an active role in suppressing
*  speech. So that's why many of us as faculty fully supported our students.
*  It's interesting. There's just been a study by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Projects
*  as an independent non-profit. They track political violence or protests around the world.
*  They found 97% of campus demonstrations over the war in Gaza in the US since mid-April have been
*  peaceful. And by the way, not to denigrate their research, but there's a bit of complation there
*  because they're actually including property damage, which many wouldn't actually... That's
*  not violence against humans, is it? So what they're talking about there is interpersonal violence or
*  property damage. But at the same time, they say there's been at least 70 instances of forceful
*  police intervention against US campus protests. We also saw the hideous scenes in LA when you saw
*  just pro-Israel thugs rioting in the most brutal fashion. Yeah, just interesting that because
*  I've interviewed, actually for example, I interviewed a Jewish faculty member in Columbia
*  who just emphasized just like if you actually saw the encampment and the way it's portrayed in the
*  media, the gap is deranged. She was just like... Because obviously she was the... For her,
*  Jewish safety was obviously very important in Paramount, but obviously we have this narrative of
*  the threats to the safety of particularly Jewish students. And she pointed out that obviously Jewish
*  students often point and center in many of this process. Yeah, just in terms of the way this is
*  portrayed, your encampment and the way... What it actually was, I'm just interested in you live
*  through it and then you see how it's reported. What's your sense? Yeah, my biggest understanding
*  of what the encampment was, especially us being in a university, it was literally a classroom. It
*  was a space where Palestinian scholarship was embraced. It was a space that we students, faculty,
*  community members created in an environment where the university has actively suppressed it.
*  It was a space of learning, of a lot of art, a lot of music, and so much community that
*  just thinking about it makes me very, very wistful even. Yeah, absolutely. I think that's... It's a
*  very important point that you're making Owen because there's a way in which university
*  administrators have kind of framed the narrative of the encampment, initially started blaming the
*  students, then disparaging them, then demonizing them, and in effect provided the rationale then
*  to unleash police onto a university campus. Now, it's as if they are top officials, right? So the
*  university president, the university provost, the intrepresident, the provost never set a foot
*  on the encampment. If one was there, you would see it was a place of interfaith services taking
*  place. There was a wonderful Passover Seder that was there. I mean, the number of scholars,
*  including leading preeminent Jewish scholars who are experts in Holocaust and genocide states who
*  came in to talk to students, right? The de-escalation sessions that these students held. So the space
*  actually was one of enormous inclusivity, right? I remember a refrain, just to give you one example,
*  a refrain that I heard again and again was, among the chants was, you know, when counter protesters
*  and hecklers would try to interrupt, we would say, paid no mind. And someone would explain,
*  this is actually something that Marsha P. Johnson, one of the great activists, trans activists who
*  helped to launch the Stonewall Rebellion would say, right? So in terms of queer students,
*  Jewish students, because that's something that the university tried to say,
*  talk about our Jewish community as one monolith, right? So the number of Jewish students who are
*  also part of the encampment and faculty, Jewish faculty, would support them. So a deliberate
*  mischaracterization of the encampment in order to demonize the students. And maybe one other point
*  I would add, because they kept on saying it's a safety risk, right? They're outside forces,
*  it's not just the students. And, you know, all these code words, right, that they were using,
*  that's a different way of saying this is actually a coalition, a Philadelphia coalition of University
*  of Pennsylvania students, Drexel students, Temple students, right? If you present it that way, then
*  the public would actually have a very different kind of response. Yeah. Yeah. And they throw out
*  the words outside agitators to characterize the people in the community that we have built as
*  inherently dangerous. And to that I say come to the encampment. If you had actually been there,
*  if you had actually seen the food that we had, the spaces that we shared, the music we created,
*  yeah, it would have convinced you that we're nothing but peaceful.
*  I mean, on that, you know, I've found it really interesting since the October, because for a long
*  time we had this kind of the cancel culture narrative. I would note not many people talking
*  about cancel culture anymore, because people often talking about cancel culture before,
*  we're talking about basically the right to say very inflammatory and big things about
*  marginalized minorities who didn't really have a platform. And how if they, if anyone basically
*  pushed back, then they've been canceled. That was the gist. And, you know, in the U.S., because
*  there is the free speech, you know, kind of, obviously, that's supposed to be in the Constitution.
*  But, you know, which we don't have in the U.K. But it's just quite interesting because a lot of
*  people pushing them out of cancel culture, the people trying to literally cancel and silence people,
*  which is why they stopped talking about it. And I just think just in this, because, you know,
*  you also get you what you're talking about is free speech and the right to be able to just say
*  facts. And, you know, I don't I don't quite bench a pair often. A right-wing agitator.
*  He's a phrase he often said to kind of like troll the left was,
*  facts don't care about your feelings. And what we've seen is this really interesting narrative of
*  this is what you're saying is inflammatory and dangerous and hurtful. And when we talk and
*  obviously an attempt to end any demarcation between the Israeli state and Jewish people
*  generally, when in the US, we see a whole generation of younger Jewish people in particular,
*  really taking a stand in the great tradition of the Jewish left. I just think about that.
*  It's just, you know, cancel culture, free speech. And yet here we are peaceful protest, people
*  exercising the right to freedom, expression and assembly and that riot police are sending to mass
*  arrest them. Yeah, I can speak on that specifically in terms of the university and the ways that they've
*  treated their own students who have taken a public stance to protesting genocide. I and five other
*  students have been taken, been forced to take a mandatory leave of absence. But what that means,
*  it's a ban on campus. And in the letter that I received, it said in extraordinary circumstances,
*  when a student's presence has been deemed a threat to the order, health and safety and conduct of the
*  university, they will essentially be asked to leave campus. And I am 19 years old, I live in a student
*  dorm. And what that ban meant was that I couldn't access my on campus housing, I've been locked out
*  of my dorm, I'm not allowed to access any dining hall, the library. And what's the basic, what's
*  the basic thing? What's the rationale there? I still don't know. I received it at 11am, I think
*  two days ago now. And that was directly in response to our encampment, I think, expanding
*  to take more of the college green that we were currently on. The next day I received an email,
*  in the email it said, in it, they will aim to give a hearing to allow students to to have the
*  opportunity to vouch for themselves. Something along those lines, none of the six got that
*  hearing. We woke up one day and were banned from campus. And you see that in that them characterizing
*  us as threats to campus safety, health and order is a deliberate characterization of us as dangerous.
*  We are not dangerous. Well, I can see you're very intimidating and aggressive. I can definitely see
*  that. And we're all taking a stance against genocide. But the choice to characterize us as a
*  threat makes me wonder what are we a threat to? What are we threatening to? Are we threatening to
*  the systems of oppression that have allowed this genocide to continue? Are we a threat to the donors
*  who feel uncomfortable with how much we have shaken the foundation of the institution?
*  Are we a threat to the change and to the opposition to change? Yeah. And I mean, I would just add,
*  I mean, one, these students are exercising their First Amendment protected rights to free speech.
*  That's one. Right. And secondly, the university has been making these very specious arguments
*  of how the encampment is violating open expression policies and other university guidelines.
*  Initially, actually, the interim president said, this is great. We welcome it. Right. And then
*  immediately started backtracking. But it goes back to our earlier point about if you
*  disparage these students enough, right, if you mischaracterize what they've been doing,
*  then you can come up, you can weaponize your own university policies to take these incredibly
*  extreme punitive actions. The other thing I would say is the university is engaged in a
*  practice of institutional amnesia, right, because student protests in the American Academy is
*  fundamental. Right. When we think about the anti-war campaign and what University of Pennsylvania
*  students actually did to ensure the university is not complicit in that war and obviously the
*  anti-apartheid divestment campaign. In fact, fields in this university that we take for granted,
*  be it Africana studies, women and gender and sexuality studies, these came because students
*  protested. Now these are kind of foundational to our intellectual enterprise in the US Academy.
*  So it seems the university is thinking in a vacuum and practicing amnesia when all it needs to do is
*  actually look at its own history. Yeah. And something I do want to add is that the university
*  actively celebrates the winds of these protest movements. So we are in a place called College
*  Hall. Two buildings behind is a old building called Houston Hall and in it is a massive wall
*  that showcases the progress that the university has made. And on it we have the Women's Center,
*  which was won through protest. We have the African American Studies Program, the Africana Studies
*  Program, which was won through protest. The Asian American Studies Program won through protest.
*  The LGBT Center won through protest. And it makes me want to beg the institution,
*  remember that you actively pride yourself on this. In 50 years, who would like-
*  It's interesting. There's a viral tweet which probably sums this up. A liberalist someone who
*  opposes every war except the current war and supports all civil rights movements except the
*  one that's going on right now. Yeah, because obviously now, I wrote about this last week
*  as at the Dublin encampment and everyone looks back at the Vietnam protest now and you think,
*  well, obviously, people, I think it lies. I think they look back and go, well, obviously,
*  the students were more right than the people up against them. But obviously at the time that
*  they were demonized viciously, I would say, because you get some people now going, well,
*  it was not the same. The Vietnam War protest, it's like, well, they were really, really demonized,
*  actually more than the current ones, I would say, in terms of because public opinion was very hostile
*  in a way, was more hostile than today. The other is, I mean, civil rights movement, I mean,
*  Martin Luther King was, he's a secular saint now, but he was really hated in the 60s. Yeah,
*  I mean, it's just, you know, and again, anti-apartheid movement. You know, I was on TV,
*  you know, this against his pro-Israeli policy and he was just like reeling out the kind of like
*  red baiting stuff. I was like, yeah, they did this, then they'll say, I mean, it's just,
*  they're not, people aren't aware, they're just repeating the same lines. This strikes me as more,
*  I just, I guess that's the point. I'm just interested in that kind of like,
*  I think the reason, do you see the reason they're acting like this though? What was different from
*  before is, look, when it comes to Israel, if you look at polling, it's been very hard in the US to
*  actually for a long time be even critical of Israel. But now more Americans do not think
*  genocide has been committed, including a large majority of democratic voters and Americans under
*  45. That's a big shift. And I just think there seems to be a panic here, which is
*  the argument's been won, notwithstanding the horror being meted out to Palestinians on a daily
*  basis. They've lost the argument and they know that, and this is just desperately flailing around.
*  I don't know, what do you think? Well, I mean, it's so easy to rake credit, right?
*  It kind of retroactively, right? This is Eliana's point. And that's certainly the case,
*  you mentioned Nelson Mandela, you mentioned Dr. King, we can go on, Desmond Tutu, who actually
*  came to speak at a certain hour in the 1980s. Mandela was, and members of the NC, terrorist at
*  a certain hour. Now we celebrate Mandela to be a kind of noble state.
*  Noble state.
*  So no doubt about it. But I mean, oh, and this is the thing I want to say, though.
*  There's something particular with what's been happening at UPenn, because the kind of
*  repression and demonization began well before October 7. So we had a Palestine
*  Rights Literary Festival at the end of September. And there was so much, and this is a literary
*  festival, mind you, at an academic institution. And donors, including very wealthy donors,
*  including trustees, put so much pressure to shut that down, an academic event. And in reaction,
*  students actually began to engage in also other demonstrations. So they started what they called
*  a freedom school. And bear in mind, our previous university president, Liz McGill, was forced to
*  resign. So too was the head of the board of trustees. These are people with immense amount of power
*  because of the kind of collusion of right-wing politicians, but also elite donors who are trying
*  to suppress speech around anything around Palestine. So the students actually began their
*  activism protest before October 7. So the encampment was really an extension of something
*  that was happening early in the fall. Yeah. And it's something I want to add on to that. That was
*  very, very well explained, is that you can see this physical manifestation of this power imbalance,
*  particularly from donors throughout, I think, last semester, our Walnut Street and Spruce Street,
*  the two streets that kind of surround campus. There were these trucks that had people's faces,
*  Liz McGill's face on it. And you see this abuse, this imbalance of power and money through these
*  trucks that kind of paraded around campus and showed us what is okay to talk about,
*  but what is not okay to talk about. Yeah. Students who are doxxed, right? So we have these
*  kind of mobile billboards. These are all we know, intimidation tactics by outside forces who have
*  a lot of power. But the problem is the institution, like the university is also
*  trafficking in its own forms of intimidation, using and abusing university policies,
*  right? And not coming to the aid of very vulnerable population of our community,
*  our students. The other thing I want to say too is what these students have taught us,
*  they've actually gone back and looked at university archives to see what their students
*  of the past have done to ensure the university remains faithful to its mission, right? Faithful
*  to its ideals. So in terms of the education, like they've educated us in the encampment,
*  for instance, during the Vietnam War, Penn was invested in Dow Chemicals, which was
*  engaged in like napalm and other mass destruction. They forced the university to
*  withdraw funding, right? From engaging or investing in a company engaged in that kind of
*  mass atrocity, right? So, I mean, I credit them again, when the university is trying to impose
*  all these repressive tactics, they are saying, can we also look at our own history as a university?
*  Right? And yeah, and follow that lead, right? Our own institutional past.
*  Yeah, talking about institutional past, I remember we were doing research about divestment
*  and the history of that and that Penn in particular was very slow to divest from South Africa and
*  apartheid. In fact, they only divested from one company, particularly near the end wave of the
*  whole movement to divest. But you can still see these students decades before I was born
*  advocating for the same things, but that we're advocating for just in different formats. But
*  it's the idea that students for many, many decades and many, many movements have been on the
*  forefront of this change. Amen. Amen. To me, that gives me a lot of hope.
*  Yeah. And so many of us as faculty who've now had a chance over the last two weeks,
*  but really over the course of the year to work closely with these students and to support them,
*  right? To be faculty advocates. And I have seen, I've been teaching in a university setting for the
*  last 18 years. These are among the finest students I have encountered in the past seven years of
*  teaching at the University of Pennsylvania, before that at Cornell University. Some of the finest,
*  right? The most accomplished, the most brilliant students. If this one, if Eliana would tell you
*  the number of student groups that she's engaged in, right? The ways in which she actually carries
*  as an ambassador of the university. So to paint these students as somehow, you know, rabble
*  rousers or all these ways, it's just so false. And let's say what it is. It's egregious.
*  Beyond doubt. Look, what I would just wrap up by saying is I think the courage of all of you,
*  the students, the US elsewhere, I think is, you know, is something I'm in awe of. And I just think
*  what makes this movement undefeatable is the moral clarity. The evil we're up against is so obvious
*  and blatant. It's clear we're going to win. The question is how much suffering on that route
*  is going to be made possible. And we're in a race against time. But these student cameras, you know,
*  my last video had included a speech from the Palestine ambassador in which he spoke proudly
*  of the Palestine flag waving above Columbia University. And these protests, and they speak
*  to Palestinians in Gaza, including in Rafah and elsewhere, and it means the world to them.
*  It's giving them hope. So yeah, go on. I was just going to say, you know, we are a university. This
*  is in a corporate entity, right? This isn't a hedge fund. This isn't a private equity shop.
*  This is a university. And we have a different kind of responsibility when all the universities
*  in Gaza have been destroyed. Exactly. Right? When over 100 professors have been killed,
*  where over 7,000 students, that's comparable to our entire undergraduate population,
*  has been killed. They've been killed. As a university, we have a moral duty,
*  right? When scholastics have to speak up. So I want to just underline that.
*  Everyone, please get this video out. It's so important these videos get out, partly because
*  there's an attempt to intimidate and harass people by making look at what happens that
*  Ben and think, oh, no, I don't want to speak out in case this happens to us.
*  They're not giving up. We can't give up. So please like and subscribe. Do leave your comments. Do
*  share this video. But thank you both to Damarai and Eliyalla. You give me hope and everyone
*  listening hope. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much.
