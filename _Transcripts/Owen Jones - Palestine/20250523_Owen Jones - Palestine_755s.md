# HALF of Israelis back EXTERMINATING ALL PALESTINIANS
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg)
*  Around half of Jewish Israelis support killing all Palestinians in Gaza cities captured by the so [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=0.0s)]
*  called Israel Defence Forces. That's according to a new poll which has been conducted by Penn State [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=7.2s)]
*  University of Israeli citizens and the findings overall are deeply disturbing. Testament to the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=12.8s)]
*  genocidal mania which defines Israeli society and underlines how this genocide can only be stopped [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=20.32s)]
*  externally not least through the Palestinian led boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=28.16s)]
*  and mass movements which are starting to show results thanks to people like you. Now the poll [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=33.52s)]
*  results are in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. The question asked is do you support the claim [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=40.0s)]
*  that the IDF in conquering an enemy city should act in a manner similar to the way the Israelites [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=46.64s)]
*  did when they conquered Jericho under the leadership of Joshua i.e. to kill all its inhabitants? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=52.48s)]
*  47% of all respondents said yes. Now you have to just bear into account that's the people who are [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=59.599999999999994s)]
*  willing to say it. To actually openly admit that you want to kill all Palestinians in Gaza including [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=68.8s)]
*  babies, toddlers, elderly people, well that is quite something isn't it? You would imagine that there [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=75.19999999999999s)]
*  is another cohort who also agree with it but don't want to openly admit to it. The polling also shows [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=79.84s)]
*  that 65% believe there is a current incarnation of Amalek. This is important, we'll come back to it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=86.08s)]
*  As a quick summary this refers to the biblical story of the nation of Amalek who attacked the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=92.48s)]
*  Israelites. God orders the Israelites in response to spare no one but kill alike men and women, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=99.04s)]
*  infants and sucklings, oxen and sheep, camels and asses. Of those 65% who believe there is a [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=104.64s)]
*  current incarnation of Amalek, 93% believe that the mitzvah, that is religious commandment, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=110.64s)]
*  to erase the memory of Amalek is also relevant to the contemporary Amalek. It gets so much worse. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=117.76s)]
*  82% of those surveyed expressed support for the forced deportation of the residents of Gaza. This [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  itself to be clear is a genocidal act as genocide scholars have said. When towards the beginning of [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=132.64s)]
*  the genocide I interviewed Omar Bartov, the Israeli-American professor of genocide and [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=137.51999999999998s)]
*  Holocaust studies, one of the preeminent experts on the Holocaust incidentally. He said that ethnic [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=142.23999999999998s)]
*  cleansing often becomes genocide because the people you wish to remove do not wish to go. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=147.44s)]
*  Now the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, which [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=152.48s)]
*  Israel is a signatory to, as is Britain, as is the United States, defines genocide as a series [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=157.36s)]
*  of acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=163.44000000000003s)]
*  group. In other words, the polling results show that overwhelmingly Israeli society seeks to end [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=170.0s)]
*  the existence of the Palestinian people of Gaza. That's what an overwhelming number support. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=176.24s)]
*  It continues. 56% of Jewish Israelis support the forced deportation of the Arab citizens of Israel. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=181.92s)]
*  In other words, this refers to 20% of Israeli society who are Palestinian. They are the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=188.16s)]
*  descendants of the small minority of Palestinians who are not driven permanently from their homes [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=192.88s)]
*  in the Nakba in the catastrophe of 1948. That's not referring to Palestinians in Gaza or the West [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=197.67999999999998s)]
*  Bank, but in Israel itself. That is the official Israeli borders, who are not, it should be noted, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=204.39999999999998s)]
*  treated as is, as having equal rights by any stretch to third, fourth class citizens, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=210.16s)]
*  and from whose ranks has emerged no meaningful resistance to the Israeli state. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=215.92s)]
*  Here's a really important point. These polls reflect, of course, what Israeli society is at. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=220.4s)]
*  And that Israeli society includes the soldiers, that is those who have guns and missiles and [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=225.12s)]
*  bombs at their disposal, those who are doing the killing. Israel has a conscript army, it has an [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=228.72s)]
*  army, you would expect to be representative of Israeli society, so you'd expect half of Israeli [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=233.92s)]
*  soldiers at least to be openly committed to killing all Palestinians in Gaza, let alone those [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=239.12s)]
*  who secretly think this. In fact, all the evidence we have about armies generally is that they are [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=243.68s)]
*  more likely to dehumanize the people subject to their occupation. These are the people [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=248.4s)]
*  doing the murdering, doing the slaughtering. These are the people who have the capacity to [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=255.76s)]
*  decide who lives and who dies. And we know a vast number of them, a huge number of them, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=258.8s)]
*  believe in killing all Palestinians in Gaza. None of this should be a surprise. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=264.32s)]
*  Or none of this should be, well, yeah, not it shouldn't be a surprise. Shocking? Oh, it should [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=269.12s)]
*  be. Never stop being shocked. Never stop being shocked. But it shouldn't be a surprise. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=273.44s)]
*  Before we discuss the incitement and intent in the statements of Israeli leaders and officials, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=279.6s)]
*  polling has consistently shown the genocidal mania within Israeli society. In January 2024, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=284.08s)]
*  50.2% of Jewish Israelis thought an appropriate use of force has been used in Gaza. That force [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  already by then had destroyed Gaza and butchered vast numbers of innocent people. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=295.36s)]
*  That force meant apocalyptic conditions, but it gets so much worse. Another 43.4% thought that [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=299.44s)]
*  Israel was using too little force. So they saw that Gaza was being wiped from the face of the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=305.2s)]
*  earth and they decided that wasn't enough. Can you even imagine what more firepower would have [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=309.6s)]
*  actually looked like? Presumably in line with the polling I read out, it just means immediate mass [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=313.92s)]
*  extermination. What else could it mean? In another poll on Israel's channel 13 days ago, when I [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=318.72s)]
*  asked does Israel have to let in humanitarian aid to Gaza, 53% of Israeli survey said no, 34% said [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=325.12s)]
*  yes with 13% settling on don't know. Bear in mind again that 20% of Israeli citizens are Palestinians [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=332.08s)]
*  who overwhelmingly have different views and will account for much of the 34%. And let's not pretend [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=337.68s)]
*  these sentiments just appeared in the aftermath of 7th October because of misdirected trauma. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=343.84000000000003s)]
*  In a poll conducted between October 2014 and May 2015, nearly half of Jewish Israelis believe that [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=347.92s)]
*  Arabs should be expelled or transferred from Israel. 79% believe that Jews in Israel should be [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=354.32s)]
*  given preferential treatment. We've got a word for that, it's apartheid. 61% believe Israel was [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=359.2s)]
*  given by God to the Jewish people, a nonsense religious justification for land theft. Here's [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=364.8s)]
*  a really important point. These poll results have nothing to do with the respondents being Jewish. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=369.28s)]
*  Indeed, there are nearly as many Jews in the US, or around as many Jews, maybe more, as there are [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=374.08s)]
*  in Israel. As long ago as a year ago, around a third of Jewish Americans thought Israel was [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=378.71999999999997s)]
*  committing genocide in Gaza. That rose to nearly 4 in 10 Jewish Americans under 44. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=383.04s)]
*  This is about the dynamics of settler colonialism, which is in no way unique to Israel historically, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=388.72s)]
*  but has had genocidal implications in the Americas, Africa and so on. It's very [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=394.0s)]
*  straightforward. In settler colonialism, you have to justify stealing the land of other people. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=398.72s)]
*  And you do it through dehumanisation. You cannot believe you're victims of people like you, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=403.28000000000003s)]
*  otherwise your emotional faculties, unless you're sociopathic, would stop you from [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=407.68s)]
*  accepting such an injustice. You have to justify it by saying, these people are backward, they're [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=411.2s)]
*  inferior, indeed they're not really human. And when your victims inevitably resort to various [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=416.47999999999996s)]
*  forms of violence, you then respond by seeing that as evidence they're an existential threat to you. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=420.56s)]
*  That they are the inherent barbarians, even though you are the ones doing the violence of stealing [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=425.36s)]
*  their land and expelling them with all the physical violence that involves. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=430.15999999999997s)]
*  From the very beginning, Israeli leaders tapped into, exploited, inflamed, justified [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=433.44s)]
*  the genocidal sentiments we can all see, which exist in Israeli society. Israeli President [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=438.32s)]
*  Isaac Herzog said at the beginning, it's an entire nation out there that's responsible. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=443.92s)]
*  This rhetoric about civilians not aware, not involved, it's not true, they could have risen [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=448.0s)]
*  up, fought against that evil regime. Defense Minister Yoav Galan declared at the beginning, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=452.15999999999997s)]
*  Israel was imposing a complete siege on Gaza, no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=456.56s)]
*  everything is closed. We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=460.96s)]
*  Israeli General Ghassan Alian declared, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=465.28s)]
*  Hamas became ISIS and the citizens of Gaza are celebrating instead of being horrified. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=467.59999999999997s)]
*  Human animals dealt with accordingly. Israel has imposed a total blockade in Gaza, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=472.47999999999996s)]
*  no electricity, no water, just damage. You wanted hell, you will get hell. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=476.56s)]
*  An-Nyahu said, both in an address to the Israeli people and then directly to the Israeli soldiers, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=480.96s)]
*  you must remember what Amalek has done to you, says our holy Bible. He was referring to that [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=485.84s)]
*  biblical story where God ordered the Israelites to murder every last Amalekite, men, women, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=490.4s)]
*  children and livestock. And as the polling shows, two thirds of Israeli society see the Palestinians [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=495.28s)]
*  as Amalek. Yoav Galan, the opposition leader who has backed Israel's onslaught and never previously [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=500.32s)]
*  objected to this horror, to the treatment of the Palestinians during this horror, and indeed [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=505.28s)]
*  fantasized about the disappearance of all Palestinians, he declared that the Israeli [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=510.71999999999997s)]
*  defence forces was killing babies as a hobby. This genocidal incitement and evidence of intent [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=514.72s)]
*  has been relentless. Just this week, Nisam Vattery, the deputy speaker of the Knesset, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=521.2s)]
*  the Israeli parliament and a member of Netanyahu's Likud party, declared that Israel must separate [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=525.9200000000001s)]
*  women and children en masse and then execute all of the men in Gaza. This is exactly what the [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=531.28s)]
*  Bosnian Serb army did at Srebrenica in 1995, which has been judged to be genocide. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=538.08s)]
*  Note that it is illegal under the Genocide Convention and Israeli law to publicly incite [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=544.4s)]
*  genocide and the International Court of Justice has ordered Israel to take legal action against [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=549.76s)]
*  the public incitement of genocide. No action if any description has been taken. They'd have to [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=554.8000000000001s)]
*  arrest pretty much their entire political and media establishments. History will look back at [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=559.12s)]
*  this and go, of course this is genocide. History will declare, how can everyone not have seen the [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=564.32s)]
*  genocidal intent from day one based on what Israeli leaders and officials said in public [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=571.44s)]
*  over and over again with no subtlety. And history will be repulsed that there was even a debate [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=578.5600000000001s)]
*  about whether this is genocide. And do you know what? History is going to be right. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=584.4000000000001s)]
*  I know I speak for many of you watching when I say this has changed so many of us forever. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=589.36s)]
*  We've watched our political and media elites facilitate a genocide. A genocide that has been [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=593.6s)]
*  live streamed for 19 months. A genocide in which the perpetrators have boasted to the world [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=598.08s)]
*  over and over again about their genocidal intent with no subtlety. A genocide in which every [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=602.96s)]
*  possible crime has been committed. The mass slaughter of civilians, babies, toddlers, children, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=607.2800000000001s)]
*  men, women, the elderly, the infirm, the butchery of medics, journalists, aid workers, the mass [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=612.48s)]
*  destruction of all civilian infrastructure, homes, hospitals, schools, libraries, universities, mosques, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=617.5200000000001s)]
*  churches, repeated violent displacement, deliberate starvation, the destruction of agriculture, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=622.08s)]
*  livestock, food production, a siege on all the other essentials of life like medicine and fuel, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=627.76s)]
*  mass incarceration of innocent civilians, every possible form of torture, and yes, over and over [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=632.3199999999999s)]
*  again, rape, including Palestinians, literally raped to death. There's no coming back from this. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=636.8s)]
*  How can you possibly argue that a political elite and a media elite, which has systematically lied [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ARnepbehg&t=642.24s)]
