# Charlotte Church SMEARED For Palestine Solidarity - She Tells Me The Truth
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [February 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY)
*  Over 38,000 Palestinians have been killed, over 14,000 of them children. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=0.0s)]
*  Most of Gaza raised to the ground, its medical system destroyed, much of it completely uninhabitable. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=4.4s)]
*  Gaza is now a different colour and texture when looked at from space. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=10.08s)]
*  Now you might think those who have supported and cheered on this grave crime would be the ones with [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=14.24s)]
*  serious questions to answer, being attacked, scrutinised, driven from public life. Not so. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  In fact, it's the people who've opposed this crime who have themselves come under attack and [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=25.76s)]
*  there's been far too few with a public platform. There are exceptions. One of them is speaking to [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=31.44s)]
*  me now, the brilliant Charlotte Church, a hugely accomplished and beloved singer and one of the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  all too few musicians, let's just say it, using their platform to speak out against the horror [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=42.16s)]
*  being unleashed against the people of Gaza. Hi, how are you doing? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=48.24s)]
*  Hi Eoin. How am I? I'm a little bit wounded, I think, in terms of I'm not used to this sort of [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=51.92s)]
*  press intrusion anymore. I sort of took myself out and I knew it was coming. I knew it would [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=65.84s)]
*  have been coming for speaking up about what's happening in Palestine. But it's still quite, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=74.32s)]
*  it's just not nice. I deeply care about humanity and I hate the idea that there are lots of people [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=84.55999999999999s)]
*  who genuinely think that I am anti-Semitic. Yeah, because I'll ask about the concert, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  because you released a statement in January saying I have my heart broken every day [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=100.16s)]
*  watching videos from Palestine and in tears daily. I keep bearing witness as it fuels me to keep [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=103.6s)]
*  doing all I can, pushes me to do more to organise, resist, oppose, fight like a lioness for their [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=108.08s)]
*  liberation. Please, please, to those who are silent, not taking part in the activism, please join us [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  better late than never. We need you now to be brave. And you have been brave. Well, I'll ask [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=115.91999999999999s)]
*  about that. Tell me about the concert. So I did a call out a couple of months ago, maybe. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=120.08s)]
*  I just wanted to use what I know is an incredibly powerful tool of togetherness and transformation [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  and emotion, which is singing. So I called together a choir so that we could have a big sing for Gaza. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=135.76s)]
*  And lots of people responded. So we had a choir of about, maybe about 100, 120 people. And we had a [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=144.88s)]
*  couple of rehearsals. I did it in conjunction with a wonderful Welsh choir called Cor Cochion, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=152.96s)]
*  which means the red choir. They have been singing for liberation for decades. They started in the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=159.84s)]
*  80s. And so I did it in conjunction with them. And me and Cor Cochion worked with this bigger group, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=164.96s)]
*  with this bigger choir to sing these amazing songs of liberation, songs from South Africa, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  Arabic songs, Welsh songs, songs that some of these women and some of these people in Cor Cochion [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=179.52s)]
*  have been singing for decades. Songs in Welsh about the Palestinian struggle, absolutely [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=185.76000000000002s)]
*  glorious. And then also we improvised some songs. I sang Rafat Al-Ariya's poem, If I Must Die, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  over the choir. I mean, it was so deeply moving. It was in Bedwys Workman's Hall in the valleys, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=202.32000000000002s)]
*  which has got a great long lineage of activism and solidarity. It was built by the miners. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=209.76000000000002s)]
*  And it was amazing. It was an intergenerational choir, all different faiths. It was just, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  it was so beautiful. It was such a beautiful event. And yeah, so we will be releasing videos [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=224.48s)]
*  and stuff from it over the next couple of weeks, but we were taking our time and making it beautiful. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  But obviously, like the press have gone pretty extreme on the, we also improvised From the River [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  to the Sea, Palestine Will Be Free, the chant that's been sung a lot or chanted a lot in this [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=251.12s)]
*  country all over the world. I suppose trying to turn what was actually a very humble, beautiful [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=257.6s)]
*  longing, you know, a cry, a beautiful song of freedom for Palestine and press peoples all over [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=267.12s)]
*  the world and trying to sort of twist it and make it into something that is toxic and terrible, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=276.08s)]
*  which feels terrible. You know, it doesn't feel great. But [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=282.32s)]
*  so by which we mean, so I suppose just to unpack those who support Israel's onslaught against [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=287.68s)]
*  Gaza, those, you know, obviously we live in a country where politicians of both Labour and [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  the Conservatives, most media outlets have supported or justified rationalised what's [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=301.28s)]
*  happened. So those are the sorts of people you're talking about? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. And I think it's, you know, I think for a lot of us, it just feels so [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=311.76s)]
*  almost out of body, so bizarre that to be calling for an end to this slaughter of civilians [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=319.76s)]
*  of children, that they, we are in some way terrible humans or anti-Semitic for [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=331.67999999999995s)]
*  suggesting that a ceasefire is a good idea. So it feels like a really mirrored world currently. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=344.08s)]
*  There's something so like, I don't know, like, I can't really make head nor tail of it, to be [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=354.32s)]
*  honest, in a way. And so. So with that chant, from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=361.68s)]
*  which has been zoned in unfocused on a lot over the last few months of horror. What's your [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=368.88s)]
*  understanding? What does that phrase mean to you? And how would you, when people say that's [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=375.2s)]
*  anti-Semitic, people say genocide. What's your response in terms of what it actually means to [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=378.4s)]
*  you? What it means to me and the way that I always hear it sang or chanted in any of the [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=383.68s)]
*  protests or any of the events that I'm a part of, is that it's always about calling for equality. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=390.88s)]
*  It's about Palestinians having freedom, having the same rights as everybody else who is inhabiting [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=397.6s)]
*  Palestine. And yeah, essentially being allowed the same rights. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=410.96000000000004s)]
*  That it's just a call for equality, essentially, for all inhabitants of Palestine and Israel. And [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=420.8s)]
*  there should be, yeah, I just don't understand why there would be, or why people will interpret it [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=430.08000000000004s)]
*  in any sort of different way. I just haven't at all ever interpreted it as having any sort of [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=440.08s)]
*  genocidal intent towards Israelis or that that was ever encompassed in that sentiment. It's just [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=449.28000000000003s)]
*  never been my understanding of how that phrase has ever been used. How do you feel being in the [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=457.52s)]
*  middle of a storm about that phrase, when, for example, in the founding charter of Likud, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=463.12s)]
*  the ruling party of Israel, it talks about one state, Israel, between the river and the sea. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=467.36s)]
*  The Israeli ambassador to the United Kingdom, Zipi Hoteveli, has also said one state between [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=472.56s)]
*  the river and the sea. And what they mean in practice is one state where the Palestinians, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=478.0s)]
*  obviously, of the West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem, will have no equal rights at all, by definition. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=482.8s)]
*  So that is just apartheid. So we know what that means in practice. You don't get a firestorm [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=489.04s)]
*  about that. But if you, and you just explain what you mean, equal rights, whether people are [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=493.12s)]
*  Palestinian, Israeli, the basis of equality and justice, but you're in the middle of a firestorm, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=498.16s)]
*  even though the people actually in charge of Israel and sending their ambassadors to Britain [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=503.2s)]
*  use the phrase to mean what can only be interpreted as apartheid. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=507.04s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. This is what I mean by this. There's so much going on, which just feels so mirrored, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=510.88s)]
*  almost. So, I mean, all I'm trying to do as a human being is to create more unity, create healing [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=518.96s)]
*  through what I know, which is, you know, singing and community building and understanding, really. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=535.76s)]
*  And I'm calling, I'm really trying, like really just like diligently [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=545.8399999999999s)]
*  trying to help everybody to understand that a liberation for all is this, it's utopian. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=555.36s)]
*  It's utopian. It's possible. It isn't threatening. It doesn't mean that, you know, this person or [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=565.4399999999999s)]
*  this group of people are going to be any worse off. Like for some of us to be free and some of [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=574.32s)]
*  us to not be free or for some of us to be oppressed, it really, in a more deeply spiritual sense, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=580.32s)]
*  you know, we are all interconnected really. And so a crime against one is a crime against all. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=586.48s)]
*  So really like the, to not trying to get too sort of deeply philosophical on it, but the liberation [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=594.4000000000001s)]
*  of all really means that, the liberation of all. Like truly the, like we aren't free in the UK. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=602.48s)]
*  People who are living in Israel with what is happening currently with what their extremist [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=614.4s)]
*  government is enacting in Gaza, they aren't free. Like until everybody on earth can [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=622.4s)]
*  enjoy very basic human rights, it deeply affects the whole of us. We really are [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=633.6s)]
*  an interconnected ecosystem. And so I feel so passionate about trying to do my bit to help [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=641.1999999999999s)]
*  people understand that, that this isn't something that is trying to be oppositional even in a way. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=649.92s)]
*  It's about unity and it's about understanding that a crime against one is a crime against all. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=658.24s)]
*  Like it's self-harm. What's happening? Like it's what we're doing and what the IDF are doing. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=667.8399999999999s)]
*  It's self-harm for all humans on earth because we are all deeply connected not to get too philosophical. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=677.92s)]
*  I mean what you're making there is a statement in support of humanity and common shared humanity and [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=685.04s)]
*  how humanity is corrupted by oppression. And I've got just a couple of final things. I mean, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=689.68s)]
*  you know, it was interesting the piece that what you tweeted out, I thought was very diplomatic. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=694.8s)]
*  You said, please, please, please for those who are silent, not taking part in any activism, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=699.44s)]
*  please join us better now than ever. We need you now be brave. That was over a month ago [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=703.04s)]
*  you wrote that. A lot more people have been killed since then. Israel is on trial for [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=706.64s)]
*  alleged genocide at the highest court on earth. I can't help but feel a little bit angry about it, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=710.96s)]
*  if I'm honest Charlotte, about people who have a public platform who know what's happening is [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=716.88s)]
*  horrific. There's people like yourself, I've seen Paloma Faith, brilliant, wonderful musician speaking [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=721.12s)]
*  out as well. There is a history of obviously musicians speaking out. You mentioned South Africa [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=725.6s)]
*  against apartheid, Paul Robeson, the great left wing African American singer who came to Wales and [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=730.4s)]
*  sang with the miners. Great histories there, but there's not that many of you. And I kind of feel [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=736.9599999999999s)]
*  a bit like what the hell's going on there? Why aren't people speaking out? Are they basically [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=742.64s)]
*  just scared? And I suppose they can see the punishment beating you've just been dealt. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=745.92s)]
*  So maybe is that part of it? I think so. I think that people feel like there's too much to lose. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=749.28s)]
*  You know, they feel like for whatever that might be, it might be good favor, it might be money, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=758.8000000000001s)]
*  it might be influence, whatever it is. I think people feel that there's too much to lose, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=763.84s)]
*  that it's just too much of a hot potato, I suppose. But it isn't. It is literally the spiritual [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=770.4000000000001s)]
*  quest of our times. Like I cannot think of something that has nothing has affected me more [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=779.52s)]
*  in terms of anything that I've seen in my sort of life as an activist. But also just as a human [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=788.56s)]
*  being on earth, there is something that is so... It feels like a hinge point in time more than [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=797.68s)]
*  anything that I've ever experienced. And so I feel the same way as you are when I feel frustrated [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=807.76s)]
*  that there aren't more people speaking out, that there aren't more people with more influence, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=814.64s)]
*  with more power, with more of a platform. And I understand that there's differentiation here. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=818.4799999999999s)]
*  People are doing their activism in different ways. For some people, it's deep prayer. For some people, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=827.12s)]
*  it's getting out on those streets. For some people, it's like really being as politically [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=834.24s)]
*  savvy as they possibly can to try and affect the outcome. For me, it's as much as I can possibly do. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=839.68s)]
*  Like every day, I'm thinking to myself, what can I do today? What can I do that's more? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=849.1999999999999s)]
*  What ideas do I have? What time can I give to Gaza this week? And how can I be most effective? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=856.3199999999999s)]
*  And I suppose being reflective in that process as well. Am I creating more division? How can I be [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=866.4s)]
*  the most effective and ergonomic, but also understand that this is complex and there is [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=878.88s)]
*  deep, deep, deep healing, deep healing that needs to be a part of this whole process. And so, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=884.08s)]
*  yes, I'm frustrated with other people not speaking out. For me personally, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=893.2s)]
*  sure, it's a risk. Sure, being in this position today is not comfortable. I hate the idea of [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=899.6800000000001s)]
*  people thinking that I'm antisemitic. I am deeply invested in all humans, every creed, color, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=905.5200000000001s)]
*  sexuality, gender, all of it. However, what I also do deeply understand is that this is deeply [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=914.96s)]
*  political and the powers that be have a lot to lose at this moment in time. And so, I know I'm [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=924.88s)]
*  on the right track. Just finally on that, in terms of talking about basically the world turns upside [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=932.48s)]
*  down, where you can be someone with a public platform in politics, the media, who supports [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=939.28s)]
*  what is a horrific slaughter, where you have Israeli leaders, army officers, et cetera, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=946.0s)]
*  saying overtly genocidal things, Israeli soldiers just posting war crimes on TikTok for comic [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=953.28s)]
*  amusement. The people who don't speak out about that will try and jump on you for saying something [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=958.24s)]
*  which you perfectly have explained you mean as equality for all, whether that be people [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=964.88s)]
*  who are Israeli or Palestinian in historic Palestine. I mean, because what it does is it [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=970.16s)]
*  shifts, it's a way of deflecting from those people the actual horror that people of Palestine are [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=975.36s)]
*  suffering, isn't it? It becomes instead, they're like, no, no, no, we're not the real extremists, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=980.56s)]
*  even though we support this horrific college which killed over 14,000 children. The real extremists [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=984.88s)]
*  are the musician, Charlotte Church, for doing a peace concert in which she calls for equal [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=991.04s)]
*  civil rights for everybody. Yeah, of course. I mean, it's a classic look over there, isn't it? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=998.0s)]
*  It's a complete distraction tactic. And so all we can do against that is just [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=1003.52s)]
*  as lovingly and as open-heartedly diligently keep working, diligently keep, you know, open, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=1009.4399999999999s)]
*  with an open heart and an open mind, we're trying our best, well, this is at least for me, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=1020.3199999999999s)]
*  this is at least for me to not be divisive or oppositional, to work towards liberation. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=1029.52s)]
*  And yeah, it is quite topsy-turvy right now, but I will never ever stop. And I did for a while as [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=1040.1599999999999s)]
*  an activist, I did get a little bit scared into or beat into submission somewhat because [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=1053.2s)]
*  it was difficult. And also I had a baby and life moved in a different way in a way. And so, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=1064.24s)]
*  and I just started sort of saying, oh, you know, I'm just going to do grassroots things because I [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=1068.72s)]
*  set up a free to attend democratic school, I set up an amazing retreat center, healing retreat center. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=1074.88s)]
*  And so that was sort of like, I'm going to actually make something grassroots where I'm [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=1081.36s)]
*  building community. But Gaza has absolutely, absolutely, like, completely taken my heart. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=1085.6s)]
*  And I will literally never ever stop again in terms of just raising my voice, doing whatever [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=1101.12s)]
*  I can to, until the people of Palestine can live in their own country without oppression and apartheid. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=1110.88s)]
*  And I will do everything in my power to keep calling for a ceasefire for what can only be [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=1123.68s)]
*  described as a hell on earth that these poor people and specifically children are having to [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=1134.24s)]
*  live through. And afterwards, afterwards, when the war is over, which it will be, then as many of us [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=1145.52s)]
*  thinkers and designers and, you know, the most brilliant minds in the world, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=1157.04s)]
*  we need to come together to rebuild a heaven on earth for those people who have experienced [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=1165.84s)]
*  a hell on earth and create a utopia, you know, and that is what I'm holding, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=1173.76s)]
*  like, right at the center of everything that I'm doing. When I feel completely deflated, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=1182.96s)]
*  when I feel absolutely broken hearted as a mother seeing these images that are coming out of Gaza, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=1189.92s)]
*  that is what I hold strong to. I just think that the place that will be co-created [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=1197.68s)]
*  will, I hope, be the most heavenly, utopian place on earth. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=1205.6s)]
*  Amen. Well, I think your humanity really shines through there and I'm glad you've [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=1213.6s)]
*  made it clear you're not going to give an inch to McCarthyism. It is McCarthyism and the [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=1217.28s)]
*  answer to McCarthyism isn't you give an inch because the whole point is they're not seeking [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=1221.84s)]
*  to act in good faith. They're seeking to crush anyone who speaks out against what is one of the [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=1227.84s)]
*  great crimes of our age. So thank you for your courage. I hope other people follow in your steps [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=1235.04s)]
*  and realize that you shouldn't be silent or cowed, you should speak out against oppression, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=1241.28s)]
*  whoever is responsible. So do share this video, get the message out, what Charlotte said so [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=1245.4399999999998s)]
*  beautifully and wonderfully from the heart. Please like, subscribe, but Charlotte, thank you so much [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=1250.3999999999999s)]
*  and well done. Thank you so much, Owen. Lovely to speak to you. You too. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaAAeArvAmY&t=1253.52s)]
