# I'm Voting For Sadiq Khan For London Mayor
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v_zN25vrjg)
*  So, I'm a Londoner, having abandoned my Northern roots, plastic Northerner, and in the coming
*  election for Mayor of London, I'm going to be voting for Sadiq Khan, the Labour Mayor,
*  and I'm going to vote Green in the Greater London Assembly elections.
*  Just FYI.
*  Now, a few weeks ago, I quit the Labour Party, which I joined when I really did look like
*  Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone 1 back in the 90s.
*  I did so because they're going to win by our landslide anyway, because of their lack
*  of answers to say the least of the country's problems, and their refusal to take a stand
*  against Israel's genocidal onslaught against the Palestinian people.
*  That brings me to the Labour Mayor, Sadiq Khan, and do you know what guys?
*  I think it's just this basic moral test in life.
*  It goes something like this.
*  Don't support a murderous onslaught against civilians, which slaughters huge numbers of
*  innocent people, including vast numbers of kids, which involves wanton and deliberate
*  destruction of civilian infrastructure, not least the healthcare system, and which includes
*  deliberate famine.
*  Now personally, I don't think that's a particularly hard test to flunk.
*  Boy was I wrong.
*  Lots of people with power in politics, in the media, flunked that basic moral test.
*  And for me, I judge someone based on whether they passed that test or they failed that
*  test.
*  I don't think I'm asking for the moon on a stick here.
*  Don't line up behind monstrous war crimes and mass murder.
*  I know what a deranged extremist I really am.
*  Now Sadiq Khan, Mayor of London, passed that test, and to do so, he had to stand against
*  pressure.
*  He came out early and back to ceasefire.
*  Back in mid-October, towards the beginning of this unspeakable horror, he condemned what
*  he described as disproportionate force used by the Israeli government, adding, I think,
*  is collective punishment.
*  Now some might go, come on Owen, he's Mayor of London, he's not Foreign Secretary, that's
*  not his beat.
*  Well, more than most people, as the person in the country, Sadiq Khan, with the biggest
*  personal mandate in the UK, he's got a position of power and influence over what I regard
*  as the defining moral issue of our time, and that speaks to who someone is.
*  I think that's pretty important if you're voting for someone.
*  Now there's undoubtedly issues where I think to myself, I want more radicalism from this
*  guy, but frankly, within the limitations of the powers the Mayor of London has, I think
*  he's done a lot of things which are, for me, political priorities.
*  Now above all else, that's the housing crisis, building more council homes in London than
*  any time since the 70s, tenfold increase since 2016, committing to 40,000 new council
*  homes by the end of the decade.
*  Housing, for me, has always been big, big, big policy priority.
*  That means a huge amount of what a politician does or doesn't do.
*  He's also demanding for a long time a rent freeze, but also crucially promising to deliver
*  new rent control homes.
*  Also powers for tenants to take on landlords, which is really important because everything's
*  so rigged in favour, of course, of private landlords, as I'm sure many of you in London
*  know, with much bitterness.
*  He's also quadrupled funding and support to take on the social evil of homelessness
*  and the housing crisis nationally made worse by the Tories.
*  Well, that's obviously pretty important, isn't it?
*  Providing feed-school meals for all primary school kids.
*  You know, I grew up in a primary school in Stockport, plastic Northern, as I say, Kale
*  Green Primary School, to be specific, with kids with families who struggle to feed them.
*  I remember that very well.
*  It had a huge impact on their education, but it also, I mean, that hugely influenced my
*  own politics and how I see the world, growing up with kids who had that just level of hardship.
*  So that point about universal free school meals, that's a big deal for me.
*  Freezing TFL fares during an epic cost of living crisis in one of the most expensive
*  cities on earth, upgrading the bus network, work on taking on the massive pandemic of
*  violence against girls and women, male violence against girls and women, using powers to take
*  on the climate emergency, not least zero emission buses, planting half a million trees.
*  I'm very pro-tree, even though I live in the least green constituency in the United
*  Kingdom.
*  So we maybe have some more trees here.
*  But in the face also of huge bad faith opposition, this is something I spoke about a lot of the
*  time, introducing the ultra low emission zone, which took real courage.
*  It wasn't just the Tories, it was labour people piling in on that one.
*  Obviously very important for people's health.
*  I think that'll save lives.
*  More policies, he's promising, emissions buses.
*  Having a very courageous stance in support of LGBTQ people and LGBT rights, which he's
*  done for a very long time and got a lot, a lot of backlash and stick for it.
*  That's important because there was a anti-LGBTQ backlash and having been on the receiving
*  end of homophobic violence myself in London, having a mayor who takes that stand is really
*  important, not least as well for our trans siblings.
*  And also, if I'm honest, the candidate is uppercase, the conservative candidate Susan
*  Hall is so bad, I don't even know where to start.
*  Like there's things like voting against free school meals, that she kind of usual
*  pantomime baddie Tory stuff.
*  What do we want?
*  Not free school meals for kids.
*  We've all got priorities in life.
*  She was a big Liz Truss fan, which went extraordinarily well, cheering on the economic policies,
*  which caused, as you probably remember, just a minor bit of devastation.
*  She egged on a victory for Donald Trump.
*  She said the dangerous, in her words, Notting Hill carnival should be moved, claimed there
*  was a problem with crime in the black community, called Sorella Bravaman her ideal home secretary,
*  supported the hideous Rwanda plan, promoted horrible Islamophobia on social media, including
*  using the term Londonistan.
*  That term is just used as this conspiracy theory term about Muslims taking over.
*  She's praising Aunt Powel.
*  She said she doesn't see herself as a feminist.
*  She called Gemma Collins a stupid fat blonde woman.
*  Terrible views on the climate crisis.
*  Look, she's the anti-London, really, isn't she?
*  She's like the mirror image of what London should be about.
*  I know the polling looks great for Sadiq Khan.
*  A lot of you probably think, come on, he's got this in the bag.
*  What's this all about?
*  Well, that's the problem you see, because I worry that a lot of particularly younger
*  people won't vote.
*  It's not like a general election, because in the general election, a large majority
*  of people will vote.
*  So you can look at the polling and feel reassured about how things will pan out.
*  If there's a massive Labour lead in the polling for the general election, you can trust that.
*  The problem is, in London, the mayoral election, the turnout is a lot lower.
*  So everything hinges on turnout.
*  And that's why last time around, the election was significantly closer than the polling
*  suggested.
*  And what the Tories have done is changed the electoral system.
*  You really can't make it up with these people, can you?
*  Before you could rank candidates and order a preference, but now you only get one vote.
*  So if we get a really low turnout election, and a lot of people who clearly don't want
*  Susan Hall to win don't come out and vote, or opt for another candidate thinking, well,
*  what's the risk?
*  I just worry we'd end up with Susan Hall as mayor of London for the next four years.
*  Which is so dystopian and disturbing, I wanted to do a video about it.
*  So here I am, guys.
*  I'm still going to vote green in the GLA elections.
*  I'm not voting Labour in the next general election.
*  And I want to send a message to Labour.
*  I want to keep Ziddiq on his toes as well.
*  Which is what I think a green presence will do.
*  I want them to be more radical.
*  So that'll piss off everyone.
*  Seriously, if you're in London, just make sure you vote in this election.
*  Vote for Ziddiq Khan.
*  Let's not piss around with this.
*  We're on way too much at stake.
*  I'll continue to vote for candidates on a case by case basis.
*  I mean, it's up to you, whether you care or not.
*  I'm just some guy at the end of the day.
*  But in this case, I think this is important.
*  Spread the word.
*  Make sure you WhatsApp or text everyone you know.
*  Ring them.
*  Harass them.
*  Run after them in the street.
*  Maybe don't do that unless you know them.
*  But yeah, let's vote Ziddiq Khan if you're in London.
*  Lots of love.
