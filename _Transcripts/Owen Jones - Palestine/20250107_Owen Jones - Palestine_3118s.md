# Is Owen Jones An ISRAELI STOOGE? He Responds To Some Critics
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0)
*  Ok, buckling guys, because this is going to be a loooong video. Now, first of all, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=0.0s)]
*  here's what I want to talk about on this channel. Right now, above all else, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  I want to talk about Israel's genocide against the Palestinian people, which is being enabled, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=9.28s)]
*  indeed facilitated, by Western governments. I want to talk about the rise of fascism in the West [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=14.08s)]
*  and beyond. I want to talk about other injustices, and I want to platform more compelling voices than [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=20.8s)]
*  my own who are otherwise erased by the mainstream media. Here's what I don't want to talk about. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=26.64s)]
*  Me. I'm not that interesting, and it's a distraction from all of that, but alas, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  sometimes it's necessary, and sometimes it's useful, and indeed clarifying, so please indulge [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=38.72s)]
*  me. Now there are, let's put it this way, some criticisms about my record on the question of [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=45.44s)]
*  Palestine which are circulating, so what I'm going to do is state the facts about that record. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=50.72s)]
*  And look, first of all, it's really important for me to state this. I should be criticised. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=57.36s)]
*  I should be scrutinised. I get things wrong. I make mistakes, sometimes big mistakes. I've been [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=63.36s)]
*  around as a writer with a public platform since I was in my mid-twenties. I'm now a geriatric [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=69.2s)]
*  millennial who is 40, so when I learn, make mistakes, go on journeys, I do all that in public. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=76.08s)]
*  That said, the critique I'm going to take head on is that I am some sort of raging Zionist, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=82.32s)]
*  a champion of Israel, someone who doesn't really support the Palestinian cause and has no record [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=89.44s)]
*  of doing so. One particularly colourful influencer has been in touch to suggest that I have made a [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=96.4s)]
*  career from shilling for Zionism, that I helped cause the genocide and that I am specifically [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=102.48s)]
*  responsible for the mass slaughter of Palestinian children. Well, as you will see, to put it mildly, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=109.44s)]
*  I believe this is a straightforward erasure of the truth and of history. And as I'll show, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=118.48s)]
*  this critique comes from the sort of people who lie by omission, who raise the work I've done, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=126.08000000000001s)]
*  twist what I say, take things out of context or just make stuff up. As I'll show, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=131.83999999999997s)]
*  I have a record there of consistency. Many of the things you hear me say now in 2025, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  in the worst possible timeline, are the exact same things I was saying when I first started [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=145.67999999999998s)]
*  writing in newspapers and going on television a decade and a half ago. Indeed, since my public [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=150.39999999999998s)]
*  career for want of a better term began in 2011, I've had the following consistent positions [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=156.8s)]
*  on Palestine. Opposition to Israel's brutal occupation, to the barbaric siege of Gaza, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=162.4s)]
*  to the illegal settlements. I've consistently supported sanctions, including a total arms embargo [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=168.24s)]
*  on Israel. I've supported specific boycotts. I've called out the criminal complicity of [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=174.24s)]
*  Western leaders and consistently challenged the role of our diabolical Western media. I've [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=179.52s)]
*  consistently opposed the claim that this is a conflict or a war, given its asymmetrical nature, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=185.76s)]
*  an occupier backed and armed to the teeth by the West, versus a besieged occupied people subjected [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  to extreme deprivation. I've consistently not just advocated, obviously, for an independent homeland [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=198.88s)]
*  for the Palestinian people, but I have even proposed to a mass audience a one state solution [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=205.84s)]
*  based on democracy and equal rights for all citizens who live in Palestine. Have my positions [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=212.96s)]
*  firmed up? Absolutely, as I'll discuss. But as I will show, it is a lie to suggest that I've ever [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=219.04000000000002s)]
*  used my platform for anything else other than support, unequivocal support for the Palestinian [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=225.60000000000002s)]
*  cause. Let's start back in 2012, when I was 28 years old. As you'll see, twig death is real. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  Now, I became known for my commentary on British politics in particular. My first two books were [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=237.28s)]
*  Chavs, the Demonisation of the Working Class and The Establishment and How They Get Away with It, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=242.4s)]
*  both of which were attempts to communicate class politics to a mass audience. That's always been [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=247.04s)]
*  my shtick, if you like. That's been my aim. Socialism for normies. I don't use normies in [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=252.23999999999998s)]
*  a pejorative sense. I mean, loser weirdos. Nonetheless, the first appearance I had on [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=256.32s)]
*  television, which went viral, was over Gaza. It was on BBC's Question Time, which is the BBC's flagship [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=262.0s)]
*  political debate programme. And back then, at least, it had millions of viewers. It was during [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=269.6s)]
*  Israel's 2012 onslaught against Gaza. As you listen to what I say, you will hear me making [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=274.96000000000004s)]
*  the same exact arguments I make today. I began by taking on the now late liberal Democrat leader, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=280.56s)]
*  Charles Kennedy, who had made his name opposing the invasion of Iraq, but had given a dire [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=286.16s)]
*  platitudinous response when it came to Israel's war crimes. Owen Jones. I'm actually disappointed [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=292.0s)]
*  by that response, Charles, in all honesty. Let's be absolutely clear about what happened. Firstly, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=298.88s)]
*  this whole idea that Gaza, that Hamas broke the ceasefire, is just not true. In fact, it was [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=307.12s)]
*  broken after, in October, Israel killed 15 Palestinian fighters. They shot dead a mentally [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=313.12s)]
*  disabled Palestinian. They killed another 13-year-old in an intrusion. And when there was an [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=319.2s)]
*  attempt to actually get a ceasefire, negotiations were ongoing. That is when they assassinated Ahmed [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=324.16s)]
*  Jabari, at completely ending those ceasefire talks. Now, it is often said, and Barack Obama made this [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=329.52000000000004s)]
*  point, he said, what country on earth would tolerate rockets being fired at them? I ask you this. What [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=334.8s)]
*  people on earth would tolerate a siege which stops basic supplies getting in, an occupation, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=341.12s)]
*  a 45-year-old occupation, a brutal occupation at that, illegal settlements all over the West Bank, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=349.44s)]
*  which are in total violation of international law, and what we've seen in the course of this onslaught [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=357.04s)]
*  are the deaths of 158 Palestinians, at least 30 of Hema Childers. Now, we all want a secure [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=364.8s)]
*  and lasting peace. When we have Israeli ministers, like the interior minister, calling for Gaza to be [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=371.6s)]
*  sent back to the Middle Ages, when in the last offensive we had another minister calling for a [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=376.88s)]
*  Holocaust to be inflicted on Gaza, when we have the son of Ariel Sharon, who wrote in the Jerusalem [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=381.52s)]
*  Post talking about how Nagasaki and Hiroshima were solutions, possible solutions to be inflicted, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=389.92s)]
*  when we have those people, we won't get a secure peace. But the way we will get it, for Arabs and [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=396.64s)]
*  Jews alike, to end the occupation, end the siege of Gaza, and dismantle the illegal settlements, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=400.48s)]
*  and finally have a just settlement for the Palestinian people, ensuring peace for Arabs and [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=406.64s)]
*  Jews and the region as a whole. As you can hear, what I tried to do is shift the conversation [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=411.36s)]
*  from the perspective of Israel, where the media was focusing, and politicians, to the perspective [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=419.84s)]
*  of the Palestinian people, to set their suffering, to emphasize the genocidal rhetoric emanating from [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=426.4s)]
*  Israel, and to conclude that there would never be peace unless Israel's oppression of the [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=432.0s)]
*  Palestinian people was dismantled. I then made the case for a one state solution based on equal [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=436.64s)]
*  rights for all. That's always been my preferred personal solution, we'll come on to that, but you [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=442.16s)]
*  can listen to me making the case here. The crucial point you're making is about the existence of [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=446.4s)]
*  those settlements, and I have to say, what other country on earth would be allowed to flout [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=450.48s)]
*  international law in the way that Israel has done for decades? Answer her question. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=454.56s)]
*  Her question. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=458.56s)]
*  Behind what she said, which was that the number of people who have now settled in West Bank make [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=461.28000000000003s)]
*  the two states practically impossible. There are two possible solutions. One is to have a federal [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=465.6s)]
*  solution where you have equal rights for both Arabs and Jews. That seems to many people obviously [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=470.08s)]
*  far-fetched, but they did say that about South Africa back in the day. Otherwise you have to [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=474.24s)]
*  dismantle the settlements, enforce international law, but what has to happen, because the point is [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=479.2s)]
*  Britain supports, as other Western countries do, they've supported and armed Israel to the teeth, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=484.96s)]
*  they're not acting as honest brokers, they have to use their pressure to force Israel to give in [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=490.96s)]
*  and give justice to the Palestinian people. What I tried to do there was take on the sense that a [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=495.76s)]
*  single state solution based on democracy and equal rights was somehow extreme or utopian by [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=501.2s)]
*  pointing to the precedent of South Africa and the end of apartheid. Again, that's what I've always [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=507.36s)]
*  tried to do, to try and make ideas which are seen as extreme or out there or far-fetched as [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=513.52s)]
*  palatable to reach an audience that they wouldn't otherwise be, I guess, wouldn't be listening to [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=519.4399999999999s)]
*  that. Let me just be frank, at the time during Israel's onslaught against Gaza, very few people [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=525.68s)]
*  were making these arguments on television. When I say very few, I mean almost no one. It was even [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=530.72s)]
*  worse than it was today in so many ways. You certainly didn't get people making the case for [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=536.3199999999999s)]
*  a single democratic state, which was even more light years outside of the Overton window than [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=541.68s)]
*  today. Now, I should say that's not to say there were far more compelling voices than myself, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=548.4s)]
*  far more experienced, not least Palestinian people who were barred and remain largely barred [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=553.92s)]
*  from television. That's a really important caveat for me to add. Now, inevitably, I came under [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=560.7199999999999s)]
*  attack because of this performance, including from Douglas Murray in the hard right Spectator [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=565.8399999999999s)]
*  magazine. This became something of a theme, as you're going to see. When Israel unleashed its [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=570.24s)]
*  murderous onslaught against Gaza in 2014, I similarly used my platform in The Guardian just [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=576.72s)]
*  after I joined the newspaper. Some of you may know about my recent expose of the BBC's coverage of [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=582.48s)]
*  Israel's genocide, which I wrote for DropSight News. Well, I was continuing there, a theme I've [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=589.04s)]
*  stuck at for a very long time. The article was written the morning after Israel's murderous onslaught [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=596.4s)]
*  began against Gaza. Now, to pull the curtain back a bit, I had to fight to write that. The view was [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=603.36s)]
*  that my beat was domestic British politics, and I had to fight hard to keep my central arguments [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=609.36s)]
*  intact. One of the main reasons I launched this YouTube channel in November 2020 was because I [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=614.64s)]
*  wanted to have total editorial control over what I wrote about. Now, the article opened with [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=620.08s)]
*  Israel under renewed Hamas attack. This was last night's BBC headline on the escalating bloodshed [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=626.48s)]
*  in Gaza. It is as perverse as Mike Tyson punching a toddler, followed by a headline claiming that [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=633.6s)]
*  the child spat at him. As I wrote in the article, the macabre truth is that Israeli life is deemed [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=641.6s)]
*  by the Western media to be worth more than a Palestinian life. Here is the hierarchy of death [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=649.6s)]
*  at work. According to the Israeli human rights organisation, B'Tselem, 565 Palestinians have [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=655.76s)]
*  been killed by Israeli security forces since January 2009, while 28 Israeli civilians and 10 [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=662.72s)]
*  Israeli security personnel have been killed. The asymmetry of this so-called conflict is reflected [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=669.36s)]
*  in the death toll, but it is not reflected in the coverage. I noted how the Western media erased [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=675.84s)]
*  Israel's killing of six Palestinians, one of them a child in the West Bank. I then dissected [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=682.0s)]
*  Israel's lies about why they killed those Palestinians, and I concluded the BBC is a public [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=686.8000000000001s)]
*  broadcaster duty-bound to provide balanced reports that accurately reflect the reality on the ground. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=692.1600000000001s)]
*  It is failing to do so, and it is up to licensed payers to whom it is accountable [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=698.8000000000001s)]
*  to the demand it does. So in other words, the long investigative expose I just published about [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=703.6800000000001s)]
*  the BBC's coverage of Israel and Palestine built on a critique that I have pushed for a long, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=709.44s)]
*  long time. During Israel's 2014 onslaught against Gaza, I actively took part in the protest and [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=714.96s)]
*  again used my platform to make the exact same arguments that you've heard me make during this [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=720.64s)]
*  genocide over and over again. This was July 2014, take a listen. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=725.6s)]
*  And then I spoke again at the PSC's. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=755.6s)]
*  Palestine protest in August 2014, and you will hear me again make the exact same arguments that [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=784.2399999999999s)]
*  I make today. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=790.9599999999999s)]
*  But here is the key point to make. Here is the key point. Our governments fund, arm and support [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=844.64s)]
*  Israel. They are complicit with every single Israeli attack, with every single maiming, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=854.2399999999999s)]
*  with every single death. And we will march until our governments stop [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=863.68s)]
*  arming and supporting the Israeli occupation. That is why we are here. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=871.12s)]
*  Now friends, remember, remember apartheid in South Africa. Remember how strong it seemed. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=877.52s)]
*  Remember how well armed. Remember how invincible. Did apartheid not fall? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=887.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=896.5600000000001s)]
*  As apartheid fell, the occupation of Palestine will fall as well. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=897.9200000000001s)]
*  Because all oppression, no matter how strong, how well armed, or how invincible it seems, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=908.72s)]
*  will fall. Now friends, this is our message to the Palestinian people. Yes, you're up against [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=915.2s)]
*  the military superpower, armed to the teeth, with everything up to including nuclear bombs. Yes, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=921.84s)]
*  you have the support of Western governments, the Israel. But the difference is this. The Palestinian [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=928.24s)]
*  people have the hearts of billions of us across the world. And just to finish it, these are our [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=936.1600000000001s)]
*  commands. The West must stop arming Israel. The siege of Gaza must end. Every soldier must leave. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=944.48s)]
*  The arguments again I made in support of Palestine led to further attack from Douglas Murray, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=956.48s)]
*  for example, in The Spectator, who wrote an article in August 2014 entitled, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=961.12s)]
*  Owen Jones is lying about Israel, plain and simple. He denounced me for suggesting that the [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=964.96s)]
*  real threat of antisemitism came from the far right, the major threat of antisemitism. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=970.32s)]
*  He said it was spearheaded instead by young Muslims in particular. And he said, outrageously, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=976.0s)]
*  that I continued to condemn antisemitism at the same time, assiduously feeding it. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=981.36s)]
*  Cynically conflating critique of Israel's crimes and antisemitism, obviously, as we know, a very [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=987.44s)]
*  well-worn attack line, excuse me, of painting the background against which acts of violence against [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=992.0s)]
*  Jews took place, pointing, for example, to how I condemned Israel for the massacre of children, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=998.72s)]
*  declaring that I've revealed the moral sickness of a portion of the left. Clearly, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1004.32s)]
*  this sort of attack you get from Israel's apologists when you oppose terrible crimes against [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1007.84s)]
*  the Palestinian people, the shameful, in my view, conflation of antisemitism with the critiquing of [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1012.24s)]
*  Israel's crimes, which is completely irresponsible given the very real danger of antisemitism. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1017.6800000000001s)]
*  But those attacks are attacks I've always had because of my position. Now, in September 2014, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1022.72s)]
*  I took part in a debate organized by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, again, about that well-worn [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1026.96s)]
*  theme of mine, the BBC's Diet coverage of Palestine, alongside Ken Loach. Again, that theme, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1032.16s)]
*  which I keep returning to about the BBC's coverage. Unfortunately, the videos of that discussion [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1037.8400000000001s)]
*  aren't available, which is a shame. I carry on using my platform to support the Palestine [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1043.28s)]
*  Solidarity Campaign, who do crucial work, of course, in Britain in fighting for the liberation [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1048.96s)]
*  of Palestine, speaking alongside Omar Barghouti, the co-founder of the Boycott, Divestment and [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1054.16s)]
*  Sanctions Movement in March 2015. Now, later that year, Jeremy Corbyn stood to be leader of the [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1058.8000000000002s)]
*  Labour Party. There are legitimate criticisms of my position in the Corbyn era. I'll come on to that. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1065.0400000000002s)]
*  But when he stood to be leader in 2015, I campaigned for him, writing my column for [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1071.28s)]
*  The Guardian the day he launched his leadership bid with a peace headline, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1075.92s)]
*  Jeremy Corbyn is in the Labour leadership race. The real debate starts here. And indeed, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1079.9199999999998s)]
*  I recommended him, partly on the grounds he was, and I quote, a proponent of peace [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1086.8799999999999s)]
*  and a staunch internationalist. I spoke at rallies in support of his campaign all over the country. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1092.72s)]
*  All of us will play our role in getting Jeremy Corbyn elected as Labour leader and beginning [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1109.84s)]
*  the campaign for a different sort of country. And indeed, I went on television during that [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1115.6799999999998s)]
*  leadership campaign to make the case for him over and over and over again, essentially one of the [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1120.24s)]
*  only commentators in the country who did. I don't think it's a protest vote. I think it's, I think [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1127.04s)]
*  it patronises people to suggest it is. I think the reason he's doing very well is because he has an [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1130.48s)]
*  optimistic vision, unlike many of his rivals. He took a lot of unpopular calls in the 1980s, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1135.12s)]
*  he ended up being vindicated in the end. I can't for the life we think, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1140.6399999999999s)]
*  while you're espousing, that should be the way to go. Owen, Owen, Mark too. The point I was making [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1143.4399999999998s)]
*  was that actually what really resonated. Well, you are older than me, so yes, Mark. Oh, blimey, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1147.6s)]
*  okay. All right, all right. Some age better than others. I think the reason Jeremy Corbyn is doing [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1151.12s)]
*  so well and his opponents on the back foot is he has an optimistic vision. He's offering policies [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1156.1599999999999s)]
*  which I think resonate with people. In that summer of 2015, a smear campaign was directed at [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1161.76s)]
*  him. Now I wrote a piece for the New Statesman in August, which was in fact headlined if Jeremy [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1166.48s)]
*  Corbyn wins, prepare for a firestorm. But I specifically defended Corbyn over attacks over [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1170.96s)]
*  his campaigning on Palestine. In August 2015, writing a Guardian column headlined, Stand By [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1177.04s)]
*  for more attacks on Corbyn's principles from policy stance, noting he was vindicated over the Iraq [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1183.76s)]
*  War. Here he was coming under attack because he'd spoken at pro-Palestine events where he'd met or [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1189.44s)]
*  shared a platform with a Holocaust denier. Now, very important point to make, as I did make at the [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1195.1200000000001s)]
*  point, the point I made at the time, obviously, Jeremy Corbyn abhors those sorts of hateful views. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1201.3600000000001s)]
*  He had no idea, obviously, about this man's hateful views and anyone who knows anything about [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1208.64s)]
*  Jeremy Corbyn knows that's just a fact. As I wrote in the piece, as someone who spends a lot of [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1213.44s)]
*  time speaking at events ranging from conferences to protests, though nowhere near as much as Corbyn [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1219.52s)]
*  has over several decades, I know how absurdly impractical it would be to research the background [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1224.0800000000002s)]
*  of every other participant. Corbyn himself abhors anti-Semitism, and anti-racism is central [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1228.72s)]
*  to his political DNA, and added the minority or anti-Semites like this individual were not [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1235.44s)]
*  representative of the Palestinian justice movement and had to be unequivocally challenged and driven [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1240.8s)]
*  out, which is of course absolutely true. In 2016, I wrote a column in support of boycotts against [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1245.9199999999998s)]
*  Israel's occupation for the Guardian newspaper and against attempts by the conservatives to [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1251.9199999999998s)]
*  criminalise those boycotts. Headlined, boycotts are vital to democracy, so that's why the Tories [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1256.6399999999999s)]
*  will ban them, in which I quoted a Jewish peace activist opposing the conflation of Israel [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1262.56s)]
*  and the Jewish people, in which I added, he is surely right in believing that the government [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1268.0s)]
*  is using the deadly serious issue of anti-Semitism to close down activism centred on the policies [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1272.88s)]
*  of Israel's government. Now, I'll come on to the scrutiny that is valid, but what became known as, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1281.92s)]
*  in inverted quotes, as the anti-Semitism crisis really came into its own in 2018, and this was [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1287.76s)]
*  a devastating onslaught against the Labour leadership and anyone seen to be supportive [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1294.56s)]
*  of the leadership, which of course included myself. The position I took, I summed up at the time, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1298.32s)]
*  as walking and chewing gum, which is to say that JB Corbyn and the Labour leadership and the vast [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1304.48s)]
*  majority of the Labour membership abhorred anti-Semitism, that anti-Semitism is real and [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1309.6s)]
*  in evil, and existed in society, and on a fringe of the left, which of course needed to be opposed. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1314.1599999999999s)]
*  Now, I don't apologise for that position because I believe it. It was correct, and that meant I [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1320.48s)]
*  went on television to repeatedly defend JB Corbyn's leadership against these smears, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1325.6s)]
*  including such a smear in the Murdoch press, which attacked staffers in the Labour leadership office [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1332.56s)]
*  who were in a massive Facebook page or group. Just have a listen. Firstly, those in the Labour [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1340.64s)]
*  party, including the Labour leadership, anti-racism was one of their defining causes. In the 1980s, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1348.32s)]
*  they were portrayed as the loony left politically correct, shutting down free speech because of [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1353.68s)]
*  that anti-racism. What does that got to do with the anti-Semitism? It's to do with the fact that [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1358.72s)]
*  there's an attempt to link the minority, the despicable minority, who will be drummed out [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1362.16s)]
*  of the Labour movement and the left, the anti-Semites, the bigots, who have nothing to do [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1366.48s)]
*  with socialism, to link that to the Labour leadership. You know what's happening, you know [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1370.72s)]
*  what that front page splash is all about. I'll give you an example, that Sunday Times splash, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1374.16s)]
*  because you were leading on it the last hour. I did watch, by the way. I'm not disputing what [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1377.28s)]
*  might have been done earlier. What I'm saying to you is, can I... Presumably if the Sunday Times [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1381.68s)]
*  had found any evidence that linked an individual to it, they would have gone on that. They didn't [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1386.08s)]
*  find that. What they did, is went on Facebook groups with tens of thousands of members, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1390.3999999999999s)]
*  with hundreds of thousands of posts, millions probably of comments, culminatively, found [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1394.16s)]
*  despicable racist and anti-Semitic comments, then tried to link that to the fact that there were [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1398.56s)]
*  people within the leaders office who are the most committed anti-racist I've probably ever met. Look, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1402.16s)]
*  I've got an example here, just to show how these splashes work, this so-called journalism. Okay, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1405.76s)]
*  where's your camera? This is conservatives against the EU. It's a Facebook group. It is full of the [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1409.92s)]
*  most despicable racists. Presumably the Conservative Party would reject it. About Gina Miller, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1415.52s)]
*  for example, f off you foreigner, telling them to go back to your homeland for the most despicable [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1421.52s)]
*  racists. You're not making that. Why isn't that? Because presumably Labour is the story at the [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1426.96s)]
*  moment. Now, as you can see, I abandoned the usual media etiquette to defend the then Labour [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1432.24s)]
*  leadership against these attacks. Not something you do, incidentally, if it's your media career [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1436.08s)]
*  you're interested in. Indeed, I got attacked as a consequence in right-wing media outlets, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1440.48s)]
*  like the Sun newspaper, a gutter rag, which of course drips with racism. It wrote, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1445.1200000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Sun can reveal lefty cheerleader Owen Jones accused enemies of Mr Corbyn of [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1450.88s)]
*  weaponizing anti-Semitism in an astonishing rant posted online. Speaking at a hard left [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1455.76s)]
*  momentum rally in Portsmouth on Thursday night, the mouthy Guardian writer said only a minority [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1460.96s)]
*  of people on the left hated Jews. He said there was a minority of people on the left who were [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1467.1200000000001s)]
*  anti-Semitic. There were also people using that and weaponizing that issue to portray the whole [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1470.88s)]
*  left as anti-Semitic. And that's false. I presume that's some sort of attempt to paraphrase what I [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1474.88s)]
*  said. But obviously the essence of what I said there is absolutely true. Now, the most notorious [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1479.68s)]
*  attack in this period was so-called Wreath Gate, in which Jamie Corbyn came under attack for laying [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1487.1999999999998s)]
*  a wreath in Tunisia in 2014 to remember the victims of the Israeli attack on the PLO's headquarters, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1492.3999999999999s)]
*  the Palestine Liberation Organisation, in 1985 because he was pictured near the graves of two [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1498.0s)]
*  senior PLO figures, one of whom was one of the architects of the Munich massacre of 1972. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1503.4399999999998s)]
*  As I wrote, the smear campaign against Jamie Corbyn over the 2014 visit to Tunis is complete [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1509.4399999999998s)]
*  and utter bullshit. And here is why. And I wrote an entire column, that's what that linked to, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1515.76s)]
*  expanding on that headline, The Corbyn Wreath Scandal is Just an Exercise in Hypocrisy. Other [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1521.2s)]
*  columns I wrote at the time included one headline, Saudi Arabia and Israel are Killing Civilians and [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1528.8s)]
*  Britain is Complicit, with a subheading, The Slaughter in Yemen and the Palestinian Territories [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1533.6000000000001s)]
*  is Happening with British Arms and Media Silence. Now, when Labour was pushed to adopt the so-called [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1538.32s)]
*  International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of anti-Semitism, criticised for [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1547.36s)]
*  including examples which conflated legitimate critiques of Israel with anti-Semitism, and we've [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1551.76s)]
*  seen it either repeatedly since used to silence and suffocate discussion and to silence, of course, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1556.8s)]
*  critics of Israeli war crimes, I promoted the alternative new code of conduct which was instead [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1566.24s)]
*  backed by the Labour leadership at the time. And crucially, I did a Guardian video interviewing a [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1572.16s)]
*  British Palestinian lawyer who set out the objections to IRA on the grounds, and the reason I [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1578.32s)]
*  did this video is because Palestinian voices were being erased from the discussion. Let's be clear [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1584.56s)]
*  about what the IHRA is. It is a document which has a definition of anti-Semitism, then it has 11 [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1589.2s)]
*  examples of what are anti-Semitic depending on the context. Which examples are problematic? [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1595.6s)]
*  From the Palestinian perspective, it really is just two of these so-called illustrative examples [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1601.76s)]
*  of anti-Semitism that we take issue with, and I'm just going to read the text of them because [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1606.6399999999999s)]
*  it's easier that way. So the first is denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1611.9199999999998s)]
*  e.g. by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavour. By saying that [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1616.9599999999998s)]
*  claiming a state of Israel is a racist endeavour is a kind of anti-Semitism we fear will descend [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1622.6399999999999s)]
*  into prohibiting people from being able to talk about the state of Israel and why or how it is a [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1628.48s)]
*  racist endeavour. I was using my platform as best I could to challenge IRA, but crucially to platform [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1634.24s)]
*  the voices we needed to hear, which the media were erasing, which were Palestinian voices. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1641.44s)]
*  Nobody else was doing that. Again. Not again, right, just sing my praises. There are lots of [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1646.96s)]
*  people who would do that. They're not in the mainstream media. I'm not denying that. What I'm [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1652.96s)]
*  talking about is the positions I took using that platform. Now that same year, I kept plugging away [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1657.44s)]
*  my betnoir. You guessed it, the BBC's outrageous coverage of Palestine, not least how the BBC [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1664.48s)]
*  website framed the massacre of Palestinian protesters by the Israeli state in Gaza during [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1669.92s)]
*  the great march of return. In 2019, I went on BBC Ready at Five and said the idea that in any sense, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1676.3200000000002s)]
*  Jamie Corbyn is anti-Semitic or racist is an astonishing, outrageous smear. I couldn't find [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1684.48s)]
*  the clip, but BBC Five Live helpfully have still kept up the image with a quote of what I said. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1689.76s)]
*  Talked about things I disagreed with Jamie Corbyn on at the time I was pushing things [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1698.0800000000002s)]
*  just FYI and things like wealth taxes, suggesting Labour could be more radical on economic policy. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1701.6000000000001s)]
*  Anyway, and that year when BBC Panorama did an entire documentary suggesting Labour was [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1707.2s)]
*  anti-Semitic under Jamie Corbyn, I called it a travesty complete with sinister music and camera [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1712.0s)]
*  work. I noted how it failed to discuss basic details like how by the summer of 2016, most [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1718.48s)]
*  anti-Semitism cases predated Jamie Corbyn even becoming leader. And I criticised it for what I [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1724.16s)]
*  believed were its distortions. And I specifically again went on television to defend the leadership [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1730.64s)]
*  from these attacks and made that case. So it shouldn't have been broadcast? I think it should [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1737.76s)]
*  have been a balanced broadcast. It should have had a range of voices. It shouldn't have edited [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1741.76s)]
*  emails. Why edit an email to make it look like the exact opposite? Don't listen to me on this. People [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1746.16s)]
*  go, well, you would say that you're lefty and all the rest of it. No, no, no, no, this isn't. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1750.96s)]
*  I have to say the reason I find some of the harsh criticisms I get about this period, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1755.92s)]
*  sometimes difficult to stomach, is to be blunt during these moments. Why was on television? [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1759.92s)]
*  I'll tell you why I was on television. Because actual shadow cabinet members on the left did not [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1765.28s)]
*  want to do it. And I get it. Not exactly enjoyable. You get smeared, your career gets menaced, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1771.44s)]
*  you get a ton of death threats. But I think batting for the truth is important. But I was [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1777.12s)]
*  filling a vacuum because actual left-wing MPs didn't want to go and do it. I'm just being [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1781.76s)]
*  honest there. Now, some of the criticisms I've had is that I backed action taken against anti-Semitism [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1787.1999999999998s)]
*  by Jeremy Corbyn's leadership and his ally, Jenny Formby, who became general secretary of [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1793.52s)]
*  Labour, including suspending and removing members. Well, yeah, I'm not apologetic about that. And [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1797.4399999999998s)]
*  indeed, one of the defences I made in this period and since is that Jeremy Corbyn's leadership [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1801.76s)]
*  accelerated such action because when the right wing of the Labour Party were in charge of the [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1807.2s)]
*  party machine, they weren't taking proper action, which is what's so ludicrous. The whole narrative [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1813.2s)]
*  was upside down. I mean, it was just ridiculous gaslighting. Anyway, I was trying to tell the [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1818.8s)]
*  truth. I was trying to push the reality. And that's what actually happened. And this isn't to say, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1824.4s)]
*  by the way, there aren't valid criticisms to make of me in the Corbyn era. There absolutely are. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1829.28s)]
*  During his second 2016 leadership bid, when there was a tempted coup against him by Labour MPs, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1835.44s)]
*  yes, I voted for him as leader, but I was very critical. Those critiques focused on communication. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1842.3999999999999s)]
*  Before the 2017 general election was called, I said those communication failures in particular [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1848.16s)]
*  risked a terrible election defeat for which the left would be blamed. This came after [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1853.52s)]
*  defeats in by-elections and labour with catastrophic polling. And I suggested publicly [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1859.92s)]
*  that Jeremy Corbyn should be replaced with someone else with the same politics. And some people, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1864.56s)]
*  very understandably, to be honest, were very, very angry about it. Some still are. I get that. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1870.08s)]
*  It was a big mistake on my part. And I would say without hesitation that criticism is justified [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1876.72s)]
*  because the view of people was, look, we don't have representation in the media. Basically, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1883.52s)]
*  we're the only people we've got. And we expect you to go out unequivocally and fight for [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1889.36s)]
*  left-wing ideas. And on this, the view was that I failed. And I did. Absolutely right. And as it [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1896.3999999999999s)]
*  happened, when the election was called, and I threw everything into that general election at [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1904.48s)]
*  the time, by the way, for example, again, going on television to defend Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1908.72s)]
*  for example, when it very correctly made the case that the hideous terrorist bombings, for example, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1914.88s)]
*  in the Manchester Arena should be placed in the context of British foreign policy. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1920.3200000000002s)]
*  But thanks to the transformative policies, which were finally put front and centre [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1928.16s)]
*  in that general election in 2017, Labour support surged and the Tories lost their majority. Labour [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1936.0s)]
*  got 40% of the vote. Now, I was proven wrong, thankfully. You know, sometimes I joke that I [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1941.44s)]
*  was saved by the Conservative Prime Minister, Theresa May, who called that election. Politically, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1947.3600000000001s)]
*  I was definitely going melty, for want of a better word. And that election, thanks to my beloved [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1951.68s)]
*  Theresa May, led me to firm up my politics, which is why when Labour was defeated, catastrophically [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1956.0s)]
*  in 2019, I stood, as I think you can see, consistently by my socialist politics. I haven't [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1960.0s)]
*  given a inch. If anything, I'm probably more radical than I was in 2019. And, you know, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1966.48s)]
*  I didn't shape shift like a political opportunist, like to be blunt, others have done. Life would be [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1973.52s)]
*  easier in lots of ways. But, you know, I learned a lesson, which is important. But I'm saying all of [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1977.68s)]
*  this, none of that had anything to do with Palestine, or indeed the conflation of anti-Semitism, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1984.64s)]
*  an extremely real evil with the question of Palestine. But some specific criticisms have [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1988.24s)]
*  come up, which again, deliberately strip out of context, what I think and what I did. Let's start [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1992.96s)]
*  with this one. One is I spoke at a meeting of the Jewish Labour movement in 2017. That's Labour's [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=1998.96s)]
*  only affiliated Jewish organisation. The basis for this critique comes from the fact, not that it's [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2005.2800000000002s)]
*  a Jewish organisation, I'm sure people wouldn't, I'd hope, criticise me for that, but that its [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2010.56s)]
*  constitution states that one of its values is to promote the centrality of Israel in Jewish life. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2014.8799999999999s)]
*  Why did I speak there? Very straightforward answer. The father of my best friend, I was the best man [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2021.6s)]
*  at his wedding, he was the best man at mine, died. His father died. JLM asked me to do a lecture there [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2026.08s)]
*  in his father's memory, which after consulting the family, I did. I'd note the same year, Jamie [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2032.8799999999999s)]
*  Corbyn also spoke at a JLM meeting. Now, when I came under attack for doing so, I wrote one post, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2039.44s)]
*  which stated, I'm a passionate supporter of Palestinian justice. My views on Palestine haven't [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2045.92s)]
*  changed one jot. I wrote, Palestine currently languishes under brutal occupation and is deprived [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2052.56s)]
*  of one of the most fundamental rights, the right to national self-determination. Israel's hard [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2060.32s)]
*  right government is expanding illegal settlements. The Israeli government has subjected Gaza to [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2064.96s)]
*  brutal sieges and military offensives, which have killed hundreds of Palestinian civilians. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2069.92s)]
*  My opposition to these horrors hasn't weakened one bit. And added that I supported a just peace [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2074.2400000000002s)]
*  for both Arabs and Jews, which I stand by as well as my opposition to anti-Semitism. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2080.16s)]
*  In the lecture itself, I did a pitch at, I guess you would say, middle of the road, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2086.2400000000002s)]
*  Jewish Brits. You have committed, for example, anti-Zionist Jewish Brits. You have diehard [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2090.2400000000002s)]
*  right-wing Zionists. And I was pitching at those who were neither to try and win them over to the [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2096.8s)]
*  Palestinian cause. That was my thinking. That's what was going on in my head, if you will. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2104.16s)]
*  Now, I wrote up this pitch and it's been presented as if I was presenting this pitch as being the [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2109.76s)]
*  core strategy of the Palestinian Solidarity Movement, which would be in itself extremely [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2116.48s)]
*  arrogant, rather than a very specific pitch towards Jewish Brits at a Jewish Labour Movement [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2120.64s)]
*  meeting. So that included talking about the specific horror of the Shoah, in which 6 million [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2128.2400000000002s)]
*  European Jews, of course, were murdered by the Nazis. Listening to the lived experience of Jewish [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2135.12s)]
*  people when they talked about anti-Semitism. Building a Palestinian Solidarity Movement, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2139.36s)]
*  where British Jews who are genuinely committed to the end of the occupation and settlements feel [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2143.44s)]
*  welcome, and then demanding the immediate end of the occupation of Palestinian land. The end of the [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2147.2000000000003s)]
*  blockade of Gaza. The dismantling of all settlements. Boycotts of products made in illegal [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2154.2400000000002s)]
*  settlements of Palestinian land. I'll come on to that. An arms embargo against Israel and other [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2159.28s)]
*  human rights abusing states. Solidarity with those Israeli peace activists fighting for [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2164.88s)]
*  Palestinian justice. The latter is something you've seen me do on this channel repeatedly [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2171.04s)]
*  by platforming such voices. Now, I'm currently coming under attack for this specifically, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2177.12s)]
*  which I'll be honest, I think is wild. It's also been amusing because I was actually heckled at [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2181.36s)]
*  the lecture over the case I made for Palestinian liberation. But I don't think there's anything [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2185.36s)]
*  wrong with pitching arguments in support of Palestinian liberation to what could be described [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2190.56s)]
*  as floating Jewish voters. Again, what I've always tried to do is try and pitch to the [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2196.16s)]
*  unpersuaded and the unconvinced. And look, I know that works. I know that works because I read my [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2203.04s)]
*  correspondence. I read the comments. You know? You know, there's a Jimmy the Giant, look him up. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2209.12s)]
*  He's a brilliant YouTuber. He used to be on the alt-right. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2217.2s)]
*  I stumbled across a geezer called Owen Jones. And watch hows argue. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2221.52s)]
*  And yeah, I mean, again, that sounds extremely African of mine, but he did a whole video [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2227.28s)]
*  in which he cited in part my influence in shifting into the left. That's the whole point. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2232.32s)]
*  That's what I'm trying to do. That's my project. You know? Why do you think I'm doing this? [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2237.52s)]
*  It's nice to talk partly to people who already agree. And I'm trying to spur, you know, people [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2243.52s)]
*  who agree into action. I'm trying to spread information regardless. But I want to persuade [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2248.64s)]
*  people. You know? I read the comments and the best comments I read at People Who Talk or the [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2253.7599999999998s)]
*  comments I get are people who've changed their mind. The critique I would make reading back, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2258.64s)]
*  though, is, for example, I wrote in that pitch about being committed to the objective of [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2265.2s)]
*  Palestinian liberation and freedom with a two-state solution guaranteeing peace and stability for all. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2270.4s)]
*  Now, to be honest, other than question time in 2012, I almost always steered away from the [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2275.6s)]
*  question of an end stay on the pragmatic grounds it should be decided on the basis of negotiation, [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2280.56s)]
*  as long as, for example, the occupation, settlements, the siege and so on ended. I don't [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2286.64s)]
*  think, I still don't think, and me as a white Brit should be dictating these things. At the time, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2291.44s)]
*  it had been put to me that there was very little meaningful support for one-state solution, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2296.08s)]
*  um, a democratic one-state solution in the polling of either Palestinians or Jewish Israelis. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2300.1600000000003s)]
*  And to be honest, Jeremy Corbyn then and since has made the case for a two-state solution. I'm [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2305.6800000000003s)]
*  not sure where he's currently at, haven't asked him, but I would say he's one of the most courageous [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2312.6400000000003s)]
*  and principled champions of Palestinian liberation. I don't think him having argued that position [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2317.76s)]
*  contradicts that. Now, my own personal preference caveat as someone who is a white Brit in a country [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2323.92s)]
*  which, let's be honest, is, its elites have caused so many of the world's problems, including in [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2329.6s)]
*  this particular area, is what I argued for on question time, a single democratic state with [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2336.64s)]
*  equal rights for all, like South Africa, is my preference. However hard that might be to achieve, [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2342.08s)]
*  by the way, you know, we shouldn't be naive about that. That's certainly where I am now. That's [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2345.52s)]
*  something I've firmed up on. The other criticism I get refers to an interview I did at the time [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2349.52s)]
*  with the Jewish Chronicle. And I'm not going to lie, that interview was a big mistake. From what [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2355.2799999999997s)]
*  I remember, extremely leading questions in which I was tripped up, not least on the question of [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2358.72s)]
*  boycotts, which I'd written about in The Guardian, and indeed it omitted my answers, chopped them up. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2364.16s)]
*  It wasn't a good, an accurate representation of the things that I've argued for, as you can see, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2370.9599999999996s)]
*  over many years. I mean, there was some stupid criticism. Well, I'll give you an example, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2378.16s)]
*  actually. So, for example, in it, it said about how I was looking forward, I think, to go to Israel [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2381.2799999999997s)]
*  and the Palestinian territories. I was talking about how I'd been invited by a pro-Palestinian [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2384.96s)]
*  group to go to the occupied, to occupied Palestinian lands. I mean, and then this was betrayed as I was, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2388.48s)]
*  I don't know, going to go with, what, I don't know, Israeli lobbyists? I don't know what the criticism [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2398.0s)]
*  is, but that's, again, one of the things which has come up, which is just not true. You know, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2402.2400000000002s)]
*  I'd always backed, as you can see, sanctions, boycotts, and written about that in The Guardian. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2407.12s)]
*  There was certainly a trunk in there with leading questions about boycotts, which ended up just, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2411.8399999999997s)]
*  just awfully represented. I used my platform to properly back the boycott, divestment, [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2418.7999999999997s)]
*  and sanctions movement in The Guardian in 2021 in a piece headlined, Denied a State, [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2424.64s)]
*  Palestinians are now denied a say in their own future. And earlier that same year, I published [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2430.48s)]
*  a video on my channel entitled, The Case for Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions. I definitely [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2437.04s)]
*  should have come out earlier in support of BDS, and I completely accept that's a mistake. That's [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2444.32s)]
*  a completely legitimate critique. Again, I don't think I'm the only one who's gone on a journey [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2448.96s)]
*  there. I think those journeys are important. I want more people to go on that journey. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2453.12s)]
*  I mean, JB Corbyn was asked about this in 2017, and he didn't back BDS. I bet he does now. Again, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2456.8s)]
*  it doesn't stop the fact he is and was and will always be a very eloquent champion of the [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2462.08s)]
*  Palestinian people, far more eloquent and courageous than myself. And he was partly vilified [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2467.52s)]
*  for that. There's no question about that. Now, the final critique, which keeps coming up focuses [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2474.24s)]
*  on a book I wrote about the Labour left called, This Land, The Struggle for the Left. This for me [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2479.12s)]
*  really is the most frustrating criticism. You see, there's a chapter in which I do a pot in history [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2484.0s)]
*  of the left's changing relationship with Israel and Palestine. It wasn't a chapter about my [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2488.56s)]
*  personal views. It was supposed to be a detached academic history, semi-academic, whatever, of how [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2492.4s)]
*  the left went from a pretty slavish pro-Israel perspective, I would say, to champion the [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2497.68s)]
*  Palestinian cause. It's not a good history, by the way, in terms of the history of what the left has [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2502.48s)]
*  done. You know, the left was not in a good place originally at all. It's quite shameful history in [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2507.36s)]
*  lots of ways which lots of people don't know about. You see, the official communist movement [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2514.8s)]
*  in 1948 backed Israel's foundation. The Soviet Union was the first country to de jure recognise [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2519.6000000000004s)]
*  Israel and leading luminaries of the Labour left supported it. People may remember, for example, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2526.0800000000004s)]
*  Eric Heffer. He was the stalwart left-wing Labour MP, famously walked off the stage when [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2531.84s)]
*  Neil Kinnick denounced militant in 1985, committed Zionist. Tony Benn used to be in Labour Friends of [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2536.8s)]
*  Israel, which, you know, he ended up obviously an incredibly committed champion of the Palestinian [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2543.28s)]
*  people. Now, the book, this section of that chapter looked at why. Why was the left originally in this [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2549.6000000000004s)]
*  place and why did it change? And I wrote about how they originally saw it as a socialist project, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2557.1200000000003s)]
*  which then overtly became a state which never claimed any such thing, and how the left's views [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2561.92s)]
*  changed because of the aftermath of the occupation of the West Bank in Gaza from 1967 onwards, [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2568.2400000000002s)]
*  when they then linked it to how they saw colonialism in the rest of the world, [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2572.56s)]
*  which they didn't before. Now, that doesn't mean I personally thought it was a socialist project. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2578.72s)]
*  You can't have socialism and ethnically cleanse people and deprive and occupied people of their [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2582.88s)]
*  freedoms. Obviously, Israel was never any sort of socialist endeavour. So, for example, people who [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2587.04s)]
*  quote from this chapter, as though I said there was an incontestable, I said there was an incontestable [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2592.24s)]
*  need for a Jewish state in 1948. What I was actually writing about was why did Zionism [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2598.56s)]
*  become a minority, go from a minority strain amongst Jewish people to dominant strain after [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2603.2799999999997s)]
*  the Holocaust. We're talking about how it seemed to them that there was an incontestable need. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2608.48s)]
*  That's not my view. It's not my position. I was discussing what happened. Again, it's not a summary [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2614.32s)]
*  of my opinions. I also discussed how it differed from other settler colonial projects which planted [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2620.08s)]
*  the flag down of the country they were from. But again, I wasn't disputing that Israel is [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2624.96s)]
*  a settler colonial project, which of course it is. Settler colonialism takes many different forms. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2630.08s)]
*  Now, you can discuss those different or the different rationales, if you like, which is [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2635.52s)]
*  what I was talking about, the rationales for settler colonialism and how it differed. But that [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2639.44s)]
*  doesn't stop settler colonialism being a terrible injustice. You can discuss the different rationales [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2643.44s)]
*  and how they come about. But it doesn't mean settler colonialism as it is felt, as it is suffered [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2650.16s)]
*  by those who are colonised, is anything other than a terrible injustice. So this has been a long [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2657.2799999999997s)]
*  video. But it is important to speak the truth about my record, about my position. I've consistently [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2663.8399999999997s)]
*  used my platform, as you can see from the evidence, to support the struggle for Palestinian [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2670.0s)]
*  liberation. I've consistently fought against the deliberate conflation of that struggle with the [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2674.16s)]
*  genuine evil of anti-Semitism, which I've consistently opposed and will always do. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2679.04s)]
*  That's why that demarcation is so important. The attempt to trash the demarcation is irresponsible, [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2684.24s)]
*  to say the least. It doesn't mean I've always got it right. It doesn't mean the language I use is [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2690.16s)]
*  always right. But claims circulating and some that I'm pro-Israel, anti-Palestinian stooge are, [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2695.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm just going to say it deranged. The context I've given you is why, as soon as the genocide began, [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2700.96s)]
*  as soon as the genocide began, I made a pact with myself to use my platform as best I could [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2708.16s)]
*  to oppose what I knew from the very beginning would be an abominable crime. I took the view [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2717.04s)]
*  and the pact I made myself is, do not waver on that, whatever the consequences. I'll give you [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2725.8399999999997s)]
*  an example. On the 10th of October 2023, I was pre-booked to go on Sky News. I'd been booked to [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2731.92s)]
*  go on that before 7th of October had happened. And I was booked to go on with the right-wing [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2739.84s)]
*  Labour MP, Margaret Hodge. I was the first British journalist to go on television and make these [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2744.56s)]
*  arguments and you can listen to what happened. Already, the Israeli government, which is a [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2752.08s)]
*  far-right government, have made clear that they will institute a policy of collective punishment. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2757.68s)]
*  The defence minister said, I've ordered a complete siege in the Gaza Strip. There will be no electricity, [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2762.8799999999997s)]
*  no food, no fuel, everything is closed. We are fighting human animals and we act accordingly. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2766.8799999999997s)]
*  That is the language of war crimes. It is illegal under international law to impose collective [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2772.96s)]
*  punishment on the people. I'd let you speak. You're going to respond. 80% of those [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2779.9199999999996s)]
*  who live in Gaza, which is an open-air prison, depend on humanitarian aid. But you're not acknowledging, [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2787.68s)]
*  Owen. 50%? 50%? Margaret, I'd let you speak at the very length. I tell you what I can't stand, [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2794.08s)]
*  is that you're using the horrors that we've experienced in the last three days to bang the [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2800.72s)]
*  drum about an issue that you've been banging the drum on for ever. No, I'm not. And what I think [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2805.9199999999996s)]
*  you should really think about is how the people of Israel who have now been there for, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2809.44s)]
*  you know, have nowhere else to go. Margaret. They have nowhere else to go. Is it possible for me to [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2816.96s)]
*  respond? Right now, Palestinian children whose life is as sacred as a child in Israel are being [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2822.08s)]
*  slaughtered. They are dying, OK? Now, 50% of the... Please let me finish. I'll let you come in. 50% [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2830.2400000000002s)]
*  of the population of the Gaza Strip are children. And those children are being bombed by a government [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2838.08s)]
*  which has said that we are fighting human animals and we act accordingly. Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2843.76s)]
*  demanded the civilians of Gaza Strip leave. You cannot leave the Gaza Strip. It is under blockade [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2849.44s)]
*  by air, sea and land. Now, 96%... Please let me finish. Yeah, I will finish. 96%, because Margaret [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2855.44s)]
*  spoke at length, 96% of those who have died in the last 15 years are Palestinians. No one, no one [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2861.6800000000003s)]
*  speaks out about Palestine because they think it's good for their career unless they are completely [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2869.44s)]
*  delusional. Which is why, as you may have noticed, I've been blacklisted from almost every TV channel. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2873.52s)]
*  It used to be a regular on several TV programs. That's no longer true. So what? So what? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2879.6s)]
*  Palestinian journalists are being slaughtered in the biggest massacre of journalists in the history [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2885.12s)]
*  of human civilization. What I have tried to do with this channel and my platform is consistently [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2890.4s)]
*  oppose this genocide, consistently take on the role of the Western media and our rulers, and to [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2896.0s)]
*  platform, crucially, voices that other media outlets erase. That doesn't mean I shouldn't be [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2901.92s)]
*  scrutinized. It doesn't mean I shouldn't be critiqued. It doesn't mean that I don't get things wrong. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2907.36s)]
*  But I just want to end by saying this, and this I think is important. There are two strategies [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2913.28s)]
*  if you're someone who supports any struggle for justice. You can do your best to speak to as many [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2918.48s)]
*  people as you can to win over the unbesuaded, to build support without watering down what you think, [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2925.44s)]
*  that's been the aim of this channel. And since this genocide began, literally millions of people [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2932.0s)]
*  have watched these videos, whether that be on YouTube, on Instagram, on Twitter, and so on, [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2938.16s)]
*  crucially, people who otherwise were not watching those sorts of videos. And obviously you've all [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2944.16s)]
*  made that possible. For those who regard me as beyond the pale, presumably they feel it would [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2950.96s)]
*  be better for this cause if my channel no longer existed and wasn't putting out content opposed [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2956.4s)]
*  to the genocide. Well, I think that's sad, but if you really think this content is what's [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2962.7200000000003s)]
*  secretly helpful to the Israeli state, go and speak to their apologists because that's certainly [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2967.44s)]
*  news to them. Or there's a second strategy. Only speak to those who are already persuaded. Only speak [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2971.6800000000003s)]
*  to the most radical who are already persuaded. Denounce those who just aren't pure enough. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2977.04s)]
*  Decide instead that you want to shrink the movement as long as you can be a louder voice [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2983.6s)]
*  in a smaller movement, not convincing or persuading a single person. Well, I'm going to be honest, [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2989.44s)]
*  I think that's self-indulgent. And I think it's self-indulgent to say the least. I actually think [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2994.88s)]
*  when it comes to fighting genocide, that approach is unforgivable. If there are those who want to [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=2999.6s)]
*  denounce me as a raging Zionist, a suit of Israel and all the rest, can't stop me. But even if you [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=3004.8s)]
*  disagree with me, I think you can see that I've used my platform as long as I've had it as best I [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=3010.24s)]
*  can to support policy liberation, including at times when obviously that's not what it's never [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=3016.08s)]
*  the fashionable thing to do, is it? That's the reality of the world in which we live. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=3021.7599999999998s)]
*  Have my views become firmer? Yes, absolutely. But I've always been on this side. And to conclude, [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=3027.3599999999997s)]
*  and I hope this sets the record straight, and I'm sorry this is self-indulgent and wasting time and [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=3032.3199999999997s)]
*  energy, I'm not that interesting. And I'm actually not that complicated. I don't have a [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=3036.4s)]
*  load of secret ulterior motives. I'm just doing my best to use my platform as effectively as I can [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=3041.44s)]
*  in what is, I'm sorry to say, a very dark period in human history and a period which is, I'm afraid, [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=3048.0s)]
*  only going to get darker still. Now, my commitment is to keep doing everything I can with my platform, [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=3056.88s)]
*  as long as I have it, to oppose one of the worst crimes of our age. And all I'd say is, [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=3063.92s)]
*  I hope that should be the focus of everybody here as a platform right now. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=3070.64s)]

*  learn that way. Just think things, you know, people can be reasonable as well, but you can [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=3086.7200000000003s)]
*  be unreasonable, is your call. Do share the video, including to those who obviously think I'm a [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASRAkacrM0&t=3093.2s)]
