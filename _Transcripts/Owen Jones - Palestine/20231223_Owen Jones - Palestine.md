# Palestinian Christian Exposes Israeli Lies And Atrocities
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [December 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsyYQtBTvnA)
*  Hello, I am particularly delighted today to be joined by Hamam Farah. Hamam is a Palestinian
*  Christian who is based in Toronto. He's a psychotherapist, but he's an activist. He's
*  been an activist now for 20 years. His family are currently sheltering the Holy Church in
*  Gaza, which has come under assault from Israeli forces, murderously so. And firstly, Hamam,
*  I'm just really delighted and honoured that you can join us because you're going through
*  a huge trauma at the moment that very few people listening or watching this can fully
*  appreciate. And I can't imagine how hard this is for you at the moment. And my love and
*  solidarity goes to you. And I know that I'm speaking to all of those watching and listening
*  this. So thank you so much. Thank you. Thanks for having me on. I just want to begin with
*  a claim which was made. And I'll show the clip for the benefit of those watching. And
*  this was the deputy mayor of Jerusalem. People might have seen him on the media round. She's
*  called Fleur Hassan Nahum. She's previously made outrageous claims, including the despicable
*  lie that Palestinian grieving parents are faking their own babies deaths by using dolls.
*  But she made this claim about there being no Christians in Gaza. Let's just listen to
*  the clip.
*  Why is it necessary? It is reported to start shooting, having snipers outside a church.
*  I don't. I saw the report this morning. The church, there are no churches in Gaza, so
*  I'm not quite sure where the report is talking about. There's a Catholic church in there,
*  isn't there? That is. Yeah, unfortunately, there are no Christians because they were
*  driven out by some. There are, respectfully, there are Christians because I spoke to an
*  MP yesterday who has family members in the church who are Christians. Well, I don't know
*  what happened. I don't know who was attacked. I didn't see the report. What's your response
*  when you listen to that?
*  Well, it's absolutely ridiculous. It's a ridiculous statement. It's a propaganda statement. And
*  I think that, you know, it's a Israel benefits from trying to erase and obscure the existence
*  of Palestinian Christians in general, not only in Gaza, but it's much easier for them
*  to do in Gaza because our numbers are so small in the territory. So, I mean, I exist, my
*  family exists. They're there right now sheltering at the church from the bombs that the that
*  it's the deputy mayor of Jerusalem, I believe, who made those comments that she supports.
*  And I've had family members killed by her and the government that she serves. Palestinian
*  Christians make up 15 to 20 percent of the population, historically speaking, many of
*  them left over the years and were previously in 1948. Many of us were expelled from our
*  lands and from our homes, just like Palestinian Muslims. We have a shared a shared experience
*  of oppression, injustice and occupation and ethnic cleansing. So it's and that's a large
*  minority, 15 to 20 percent of the population. That's a large minority. So we have a prominent
*  presence. We have a prominent voice. Historically, we've had we've had a loud voice and
*  participation in the struggle and in the resistance for freedom, justice and equality.
*  Palestinian Christians have been leaders in in in the struggle as well. For example, we had
*  George Habash, who was a Palestinian Christian who led armed resistance against the Israeli
*  army against Israel. Back in the day, we had Naif Hawatmi, who was himself as a Jordanian,
*  but was very involved as a leader, took a leadership role in the PLO. We had we have
*  Hanan Ashrawi, who was a former spokesperson for the PLO. Shreen Abu Akhli, the journalist
*  who was assassinated by by an Israeli sniper in 2022 that Israel has been at first they
*  denied that she was murdered. And then there was an independent investigation. Israel itself
*  refuses to investigate her death. And there was a global outcry and a lot of what do you
*  call it, pressure, international pressure on Israel to to investigate this matter. And finally,
*  the Israeli government shifted its its its line on on Shreen Abu Akhli's murder. So, you know,
*  Israel has a has a propensity to be like the boy who cried wolf. They'll they'll make these
*  denials and statements denying their crimes. And then later on, under international scrutiny and
*  pressure, they'll they'll shift that line, maybe a little bit, maybe the whole way. You don't know.
*  But we've seen this happen throughout this genocide that's been taking place since October,
*  you know, with the 40 beheaded babies and other stories that have come out of the Israeli Israeli
*  propaganda machine. And that's why a lot of people now around the world have a hard time believing
*  statements that come out of there. But just to bring it back to to the issue of Palestinian
*  Christians in Gaza before the blockade, the illegal blockade in 2007, we made up we were
*  three thousand people, the population of Palestinian Christians in Gaza was around three thousand. Now
*  that's that's a small number. Many of us have left before throughout the occupation. But
*  it even got a lot smaller throughout the blockade by by October of this year. We were down to one
*  thousand, possibly eight hundred Palestinian Christians in Gaza left. So we're at the at the
*  brink right now. We're at the under threat of extinction as a community in Palestine, in Gaza.
*  We're facing the threat of extinction. And that's you know, we've been very anxious to to see what
*  transpires out of this horror that the community is going through and the larger population is
*  going through being bombarded, killed, massacred and displaced. Once again, displacement has been
*  such a big part of our of our modern history as a people. And now we don't know, you know,
*  who's going to live, who's going to die. We don't know who's going to make it out and who's going.
*  And even those who make it out, whether they'll ever be allowed to return for us Palestinians and
*  not just Christians, we have mixed feelings about the refugee issue, about us being able to leave
*  to safety from Israeli bombardment. Of course, now safety is the top priority and I want my family
*  to be able to get to safety. And if they're able to leave Gaza right now, it would be best for their
*  safety, I would imagine. But at the same time, we have mixed feelings about it because we know
*  Israel has a history of denying Palestinian refugees to return home. And so like my aunt,
*  for example, is sheltering at the Holy Family Catholic Church now and she's having arguments
*  with her husband about it. She said, I'm out of here, the first opportunity. And he's apparently,
*  I'm hearing that he's saying we, you know, we're Palestinians. We have to, you know, what happens
*  if we leave, we'll never be able to come back. We will lose everything. And so, you know, he's
*  trying to argue for remaining put until this horror show is over. But I don't know how
*  optimistic he can be about that. In terms of that plight, generally, of Christians, I mean,
*  many will be familiar with this concept of pink washing, which is often used to justify Israel's
*  occupation and apartheid as defined by Human Rights Watch Amnesty International, the Israeli
*  human rights organization, Bethlehem, whereby defenders of Israel will say, well, look at
*  LGBTQ rights in Israel, and they will talk about gay people being oppressed, for example, in Gaza.
*  And there's a similar phenomenon with the Christians in Gaza, that you've seen those
*  supporting Israel's occupation, its murderous assault on Gaza, talking about the plight of
*  Christians as being oppressed, and that being something to justify, essentially, the assault
*  on Gaza. What's your response when you hear that? Yeah, I hear it. I hear it often. I even hear,
*  you know, those who support the Israeli government have accused me of lying about being Christian.
*  I've been accused of lying in the past about being Christian. They say that I'm a Muslim
*  extremist who is pretending to be Christian. It's such a ridiculous statement from people who don't
*  know how to defend their position, because their position is indefensible, ultimately.
*  But it disgusts me to have to hear that and to have to go through that. It's not only
*  racist against me, it's also Islamophobic, obviously. But when I hear these things
*  for Christians in Palestine and in Gaza, we've been going through the same
*  oppressions and the same injustice that all Palestinians have gone through. And I think
*  that Israel benefits from erasing and denying our existence, because they would rather
*  the so-called West, North America, and Europe not find out that there are Palestinian Christians
*  who are Christian like them, who are being massacred and expelled from their homeland.
*  And the stories of the churches being bombed over the years, this isn't the first time
*  that churches were bombed, like we had in October when the St. Porphyrios Orthodox Church was bombed.
*  Historically, too, churches were bombed and demolished by Israeli bulldozers back in 1948,
*  when 750,000 Palestinians were expelled in what we call the Nakba, or the Palestinian catastrophe.
*  That's our national tragedy that the Israeli state was founded upon. But
*  we faced the same issues, and throughout the years, the Christian priests and clergy have
*  been arrested, detained, they've lost their homes, they've lost land. One of the leaders of the
*  Christian community in the West Bank, his name is Father Atallah Hanna, and he's quite outspoken.
*  He's a spokesperson for the Orthodox Church in Jerusalem, and he's been quite outspoken about
*  these issues. And a lot of people, a lot of Palestinians in general look up to him as one of
*  our national icons, as a matter of fact. But the Israeli army has also, and the illegal settlers
*  in the West Bank, they're quite known for their anti-Christian views, and they're quite known for
*  whenever they walk by the churches and the nuns are standing there, they spit on the nuns. It's
*  actually a well-known tradition of Israeli settlers spitting on nuns. I've been hearing about
*  those kinds of stories since I was a kid, so this is not a new phenomenon by any means.
*  And back in 2002, there was an altar boy in the West Bank, Johnny Faljie. His story has now been
*  forgotten, largely forgotten, but I've been keeping up with some of these murders, and he was sniped
*  in the chest by an Israeli soldier in the West Bank in 2002, during the second Intifada. And I
*  can remember the community raising his coffin, just like all the other martyrs who've been
*  killed by the Israeli army, and raising his coffin along with the cross and marching
*  through the West Bank with it in procession and mourning and protest at the murder,
*  the injustice that's being committed against both Palestinian Christians and Muslims.
*  Will Barron Can you tell me a bit about your family?
*  This is now on the eve of the most important date in the Christian calendar, of course,
*  celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ not far from Gaza in Bethlehem. Can you just tell me
*  about your family members in the church and tell me what they've endured, what they've gone through,
*  what you've been speaking to them, what you've heard from what must be an unbelievably hellish,
*  unimaginable experience for the vast majority of people?
*  Yes, so my family's story, I have almost my entire extended family in Gaza, and I used to
*  visit there every summer. And then eventually I was prevented and just wasn't allowed to go back
*  when Israel had sealed the borders. And this was before the blockade. And then after the blockade,
*  the siege of Gaza, it just became too difficult and dangerous to go. But they endured, my family
*  endured the illegal blockade and the siege since 2007 for 16 years now. And then when the October
*  7 events happened and the announcement was made by the Israeli army for the evacuation of the North,
*  they quickly went down to the churches, which are also in the North. But they assumed that this is
*  going to be one of the safe places that Israel would probably stay away from the churches, which
*  we know is not true. And then on October 19, at the Saint Porphyrios Orthodox Church, Israel
*  did an airstrike and the church was bombed. And my family in particular was sleeping on the second
*  floor, and that's the floor that was bombed. And the ceiling collapsed on them. And they,
*  when they got up, they found out that 18 people were killed. And that included my cousin.
*  He's dead. He was 35 years old. His name is Sulaiman. So Sulaiman was 35 and his wife,
*  Lily, sustained heavy injuries. She has a broken back, a broken jaw and a broken hip.
*  And she couldn't move and there's currently no medical equipment to operate on her.
*  And then when the people came to pull him out of the rubble, he was still holding on to his son.
*  Now they have two little boys, I believe five and six years old, and he was holding on to one of his
*  sons. And they took his son from his arms to safety. And then when they turned around to help him
*  out from where he was trapped, the floor beneath him collapsed and he fell into the first floor
*  and the rocks fell on top of him. So he was still alive. And when he was still alive,
*  he died because when the floor collapsed from beneath him. I have a hard time imagining what
*  his son might go through and the trauma that he's going to have to deal with now and when he gets
*  older potentially, if he was conscious and he was conscious of the fact that he was still alive.
*  If he was conscious and saw his father perish in that way plunging to his death.
*  And as a therapist, I think about that. I think about how he's going to carry those wounds
*  into adulthood and process them and their effects. So that's Sulaiman's story.
*  And 17 other people were killed in that attack. And I was telling my mother that this is,
*  I'm not surprised and this is nowhere safe in Gaza. And this time in particular,
*  because of the intensity of the aggression and the intensity of the assault, I don't feel like
*  our family is going to come out of this without losses.
*  And then they had a funeral at the church itself and that was recorded and shared on social media
*  the priest giving the morning ceremony in the church courtyard with other people there. And
*  I remember that video and I saw there were relatives there as well and family friends.
*  We know all the Christian families in Gaza because we're such a small community. We're
*  familiar with each other and familiar with the last names. My parents know everyone there.
*  And so it was very disturbing just to see what's happening to our family.
*  And after October 19,
*  then fast forward to November 12, this is when my great aunt, her name was Ilham,
*  Ilham Fera. Ilham was 84 years old. She was quite popular, quite well known in the community and
*  in Gaza as a whole. She was quite an independent person and a music teacher,
*  known to be the first music teacher in Gaza. And she
*  couldn't stand being sheltered at the church for too long. So she left. My family at that point
*  was moved from St. Porfiryos Orthodox Church to the Holy Family Catholic Church
*  after the ceiling collapsed on them. So when they were moved there, she couldn't take it anymore.
*  So she decided to go back to her house. And she was told that it's too dangerous. You should stay.
*  She didn't leave. She didn't listen. I don't know if she snuck out on her own in the end,
*  but she found somebody to give her a ride back to her house.
*  And the person refused to continue all the way to her house. He got scared and said,
*  it's too dangerous. I'm not going to keep going. You're on your own from here.
*  So she got out of the car and she started walking back towards, she started walking to her house
*  the rest of the way. And then she was shot by an Israeli sniper. And the sniper shot her beneath
*  the knee, like in the leg under the knee. And so we believe that she had a chance at survival at
*  that point. She was still conscious. She called our relatives back at the Holy Family Church
*  and they told her that they're going to be, they're going to try to send help as soon as possible and
*  told her to hang in there. And my relatives called the Red Cross and asked them to intervene.
*  The Red Cross said they would try to contact the Israeli army to ask if they could go and help
*  my great aunt Ilham. And there was no response from the Israeli military. And she was laying
*  there for hours and hours. And then the neighbors said that they could see her on the road, but they
*  weren't able, no one was able to go out and get to her because they're afraid of the snipers in the
*  area. And she had told, she spoke to my mother as well over her cell phone and she told my mother
*  she could see the tanks. There were tanks and there were snipers positioned in the neighborhood.
*  And so then I know that she also called the priest back at the church and asked him to
*  pray for her, the prayer of death. So she was quite aware, I believe, that she was dying
*  and that this was the end for her. The next morning, I know we were, my family was still hopeful.
*  I really wasn't, you know, just because of my knowledge of how these things have taken
*  place in the past and how the Israeli army behaves, I wasn't optimistic that the Red Cross
*  would be permitted to get to her. And then, indeed, the next morning I get the call that she had passed,
*  passed away. And they said that she had bled out, bled out to death. Another thing I heard,
*  I had also heard that when snipers shoot people below the knee, it's a deliberate,
*  it's a deliberate spot to shoot because they want to keep the person alive for a while. And the idea,
*  the idea militarily is that they want,
*  militarily is that they want people and particularly fighters to come out from the ground
*  to try to rescue the civilian. And then they would pick at them, as they come out to rescue
*  the civilian, they would shoot them. And that's one of the tactics that has been used in the past
*  by the Israeli military. And so essentially, if that's the case, then she was used as bait.
*  And that was very concerning, very disturbing for me to hear.
*  And there was an outpouring of support when I announced her passing. A lot of people around
*  the world were sharing their support over social media. A lot of people knew her and knew of her
*  and were sharing her story. People that I don't even know, she was more popular and more known
*  and more loved than we had even known here in Canada. So that was really nice to see and very
*  sad at the same time. There was a whole, a vigil that was held for Gaza here and a speech that was
*  said for her here from Toronto. But such a tragic story. And there's one more part to this story
*  that I just found out a few days ago, actually, Owen, and this may be a little bit disturbing
*  for some of your viewers. But during the time of the humanitarian pause that took place for about
*  four days, I believe, two of the assistants of the priest at the church were sent to try to
*  collect her body. And when they went and located, went to the location, they only found
*  an arm and a leg, I believe. The rest of her body was flattened by a tank.
*  The tank had run over her. And they only told a few family members about this, and that's why I only
*  found out a few days ago. They didn't want the whole family to find out that she was flattened
*  and that they weren't able to collect her body whole. But yeah, I mean, we'll continue to take
*  that with us and we have to process this grief as it comes along.
*  So that was my great aunt Ilham's story. She's my mother's aunt.
*  Then we move to what happened at the Catholic church recently that a lot of people
*  know about from the media now with Nahida and her daughter, Samar Anton.
*  Now they were family friends of ours, and this was a mother and her daughter who tried to
*  go to the bathroom. And unfortunately, the only bathroom in the church is not in the main hall,
*  it's outside at the sisters' convent, the sisters of Mother Teresa convent. And so they were making
*  their way there. And this was the day before I got the news that snipers and Israeli tanks
*  had surrounded the church. And so we were very much on our nerves at that time,
*  not knowing what's going to happen to our family and why they surrounded the church.
*  There were no reports of armed resistance coming out of the church itself. So why shoot into the
*  church? There were shots fired into the church that smashed through the windows.
*  Seven people were shot, seven others were shot, and Nahida and her daughter, Samar,
*  were shot by snipers as they were going to the bathroom.
*  And I believe the mother Nahida fell first, and then Samar tried to carry her body to rescue her
*  and then she was shot. And they were both killed in cold blood.
*  My family in the church then huddled as far back as possible,
*  from the windows. And there was, of course, a lot of panic and fear. And we were panicked. We were scared.
*  And we didn't think anyone can help us at this point.
*  And then the news and the media reported on this. And then the pope even,
*  because we made a plea to the pope, the Red Cross sent a request to the pope for urgent intervention
*  here. This church belongs to you, ultimately, at the end of the day. So he made a speech,
*  as the viewers saw, and he called the attack, the Israeli attack, terrorism.
*  And I think that had some sway over the Israeli military's actions after that.
*  Now, I heard there were denials from the Israeli military about murdering Nahida and Samar.
*  And then the tanks and the soldiers eventually withdrew to another area.
*  But at the same time, now we haven't been able to reach our relatives for a while. I believe there's
*  currently a communications blackout. And the other day, then after that, the Rimal neighborhood,
*  there was a huge explosion and quite a post-apocalyptic picture that was shared
*  about showing that explosion. And I don't know, I heard different things that it was a bombing or
*  it was a detonation of some kind. And this was done in the center of Gaza in the Rimal neighborhood.
*  And this is our neighborhood, the Rimal neighborhood. And I still have, my father's
*  sister is still there in that area. And we haven't been able to reach her for a week now.
*  I don't know if she was affected. I mean, I'm sure she was affected, but I don't know if
*  she's alive. I'll just say it straight. I don't know if she's alive.
*  And I try to call every day now and there's no signal, no way to reach them.
*  S1 001
*  Yeah. What you've said is, there are many words in the English language to describe the horror of
*  what you've spoken about, about what your family have gone through, about what your community
*  specifically have gone through and also Palestinians in general in Gaza and of course beyond. These are
*  unimaginable horrors. And the fact is, these are of course horrors backed and legitimized by
*  Western states who arm and support Israel. So when we talk about these atrocities, atrocities
*  happen in other places in the world, but the fact is these are directly aided and abetted by
*  Western states. It's just so important that we hear what those atrocities actually are in full
*  horror. It's not easy to listen to, but it's certainly a lot harder for you to endure.
*  And it's just so important that we talk about this. I mean, the last thing I wanted to ask
*  you about was, given your family's history in Palestine, your grandfather was expelled
*  in the Nakba in 1948. I know I've read about how your family's orchards were previously bulldozed
*  by the Israeli occupation forces. Just for those, there's been an attempt by some, by cheerleaders
*  of Israel's horrendous, murderous onslaught on Gaza to start the clock on October the 7th
*  and erase that history. And I'm just wondering, bearing in mind your family's own history in
*  Palestine and what they've suffered over generations, what your response to that and
*  why there will never be a lasting peace unless that history is properly understood, recognized
*  and acted upon?
*  Yeah, so our families, our people were expelled in 1948, as you said. My family lost
*  my father's side of the family. So my father's side of the family is from Gaza as well. We are
*  the original inhabitants of Gaza. As you know, the majority of people, Palestinians in Gaza,
*  are not from Gaza. They're from cities and towns that were depopulated from what became
*  Israel. And they are refugees who were expelled from those areas and went into Gaza. And that's
*  why it's such a densely populated area of the world, one of the most densely populated areas
*  of the world, is because of that history. And a lot of people, unfortunately, don't know about
*  this, don't know why that's the case. So Gazans, most of them are not from Gaza. And in fact,
*  when Hamas members are firing rockets into those bordering towns, those lands used
*  to be the lands that belonged to those members' families and were stolen from them in 1948.
*  And I think this is context that really needs to be told. These Palestinian families who lost land
*  and lost their family members as they were being expelled by the Zionist forces that
*  established the state of Israel in 1948. And they went to Gaza and set up, the UN set up
*  the refugee camps there. And as I always say, Gaza is a collection of refugee camps and Gaza City,
*  the center, which is, I don't know if I would even call it a city, it's more of a ghetto,
*  a very impoverished slum-like conditions in Gaza, as I remember it as well personally,
*  in my own personal experience of it being there. And so we have to contend with that history.
*  The refugee issue dating back to 1948, the UN passed a resolution, General Assembly Resolution
*  194 in 1949 saying that refugees who wish to return home should be permitted to do so at the
*  earliest practicable date. And until today, Israel has denied and rejected that UN resolution.
*  But in fact, the refugee issue is the core of the Palestinian, the Palestinian-Israel conflict,
*  is at the core of it. And the Nakba is at the core of it. These expulsions,
*  the ethnic cleansing of Palestine, as we call it. So my grandfather from my father's side,
*  he moved out of Gaza and into a city called Beer Saba. And then in 1948, the Haganah,
*  the pre-state forces that became the IDF, they bombed my grandfather's house in Beer Saba.
*  And he had to go back to Gaza with his family. And then they confiscated that land. And they
*  renamed Beer Saba. It's today what's called Beer Sheva, what Israelis call Beer Sheva.
*  And so my family had to live through the Nakba and live through that. And then, you know,
*  that history has to be recognized for there to be a lasting peace in the region. And despite that,
*  Palestinians have, through the PLO, accepted the two-state solution. And unfortunately,
*  we haven't seen an Israeli will to do the same. And so we have to see what transpires out of this.
*  And right now, I can't even think about what's the solution going to be. Is it two states,
*  one state? Everyone should be equal at the end of the day, where Palestinians are calling for
*  equality at the end of the day, whatever political solution that comes to be. But right now,
*  this is an emergency moment. And we're hanging on to our lives back in Gaza. And
*  we're hoping for the best. And it's not very optimistic. But, you know, we're worried that
*  Israel is going to maintain an occupation of these parts of Gaza after this, and that they're not
*  going to leave. And of course, that they're not going to allow Palestinians to return home.
*  And this is the biggest fear and stressor right now. So this is an emergency moment. We're not
*  calling for, right now, for, you don't see us calling for boycotting Israel. You see us calling
*  for a ceasefire right now because of how dire the situation is. We need a ceasefire. And yes,
*  we need boycotts, but we need a ceasefire immediately. That's the immediate demand.
*  And we're hoping for the best.
*  And again, I'm just so beyond appreciative that you're able to speak so fluently about,
*  as I've said, just unspeakable horror that's happening. And it's so important people are
*  aware of just the utter depravity of what is currently taking place. And underpinning that
*  has been always the dehumanization of the Palestinian people, which mainstream media
*  outlets and also large sections of the political elites in Western countries have directly aided
*  and abetted and encouraged. And it's so important that we hear about this raw humanity.
*  The lived experiences of Palestinians, be they Christians or Muslims, not just
*  in this particular onslaught, but in the many generations leading up to this particular point.
*  So I just can't appreciate, I can't say how much I appreciate enough you joining us. And I know,
*  as I said, I think this will have a profound emotional impact on people watching and listening
*  to this. And I hope it does redouble people's or helps redouble people's efforts to build up pressure,
*  to end what should be regarded as one of the great crimes of our time. So, yeah, finally,
*  Hamad, I just want to say thank you so, so much. I'll be thinking of you. I know many of this will
*  be over this Christmas, thinking of you and your family, the Christians, and also the general
*  population. So just thank you so, so much. You know, I just want to also say that,
*  because I get asked this a lot as well, coping with the situation, try not to isolate,
*  be with community. There are people out there. There's a, you know, the majority of people of
*  the world do support human rights for everyone and for Palestinian liberation and freedom.
*  And so, you know, stay connected to others. This feeling of persecution,
*  it's felt more acutely when we isolate and don't reach out and stay connected with others around us.
*  So that's what I would encourage people to do at this dire time. Thanks, Owen. Thanks for having me.
*  Not at all. And I think that's a really appropriate Christmas message to remember as we see the
*  terrible persecution of the Christians and Palestinians generally in Gaza. But thank you
*  so, so much. Do share this video. Make sure to press like and share the video. And thanks again, Hamad.
*  Thank you.
