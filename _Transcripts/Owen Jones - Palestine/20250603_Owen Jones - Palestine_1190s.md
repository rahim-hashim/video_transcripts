# BBC Spreads Israel Gaza MASSACRE LIES
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4)
*  Here is a hideous example of how the Western media, including the BBC, helps facilitate [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel's genocide of the Palestinian people in Gaza. Now, the Israeli state is repeatedly [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=6.0s)]
*  massacring starving Palestinians who are desperately trying to get aid for them and their families. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=11.44s)]
*  That's what's currently happening at the moment. The Western media's refusal to spell out those [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=16.16s)]
*  facts and its collaboration with Israel's propaganda has enabled these atrocities to happen [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=20.8s)]
*  again and again and again. Now, as a little recap here, Israel instituted a total blockade [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=27.12s)]
*  on anything and everything from getting into Gaza on the 2nd of March. The consequence of this is [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=33.760000000000005s)]
*  that 100% of Gaza's population is now at risk of famine, according to the United Nations. Israel [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=38.96s)]
*  then set up something called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a shadowy US Israeli front whose [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=44.64s)]
*  funders are hidden, which all aid agencies who actually have experience of distributing [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=50.24s)]
*  aid at scale condemned, as violating the very basics of humanitarianism, for example, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=54.8s)]
*  independence. Indeed, the US Marine appointed to head the Foundation himself resigned, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=59.919999999999995s)]
*  stating it violated the necessary principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=66.39999999999999s)]
*  Indeed, Israel's finance minister Bezelal Smortrich has publicly declared this is a [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=72.72s)]
*  ruse so Israel can deflect claims of deliberate starvation and, to use his words, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=77.36s)]
*  prevent the world from stopping us. By stopping us, of course, he means completing the genocide. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=82.72s)]
*  In practice, this so-called foundation is just another stage in Israel's genocide. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=87.6s)]
*  It has only set up a handful of sites in the south of Gaza in an attempt to force Gaza's population [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=91.84s)]
*  to all move to a confined space where they can be enclosed in a concentration camp and then the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=98.4s)]
*  survivors expelled, that is, those who survive. Very important point because in practice this [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=104.08s)]
*  will mean huge numbers of even more Palestinians being killed with the survivors removed. Now, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=111.92s)]
*  the aid being provided is much too little and indeed is often not usable, for example, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  flour and dried pasta when there isn't the means to cook them because Israel has blocked those [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=123.84s)]
*  means from entering Gaza. It is also based on a lie that Hamas is stealing aid, the justification [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=128.48s)]
*  for the siege, when the likes of Cindy McCain, the widow of late staunchly pro-Israel, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=133.84s)]
*  Republican hawkish Senator John McCain, she's the head of the World Food Program, amongst others, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=139.92s)]
*  have said this is not happening, this isn't true, this whole rationale. Now, we know that the so-called [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=146.23999999999998s)]
*  Israel Defense Forces, the army responsible for executing the genocide of the Palestinian people, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=152.64s)]
*  is in charge of the system because they just went out and said it. This is the idea of spokesperson [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=157.27999999999997s)]
*  Effie Daffrin. I'm here in the city of Rafah. Right behind me you can see one of the distribution [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=162.16s)]
*  centers we opened in the last few days. So far we opened four distribution centers. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=168.48s)]
*  Very clearly he's stating that we, that is the IDF, are in charge of these centers. Now, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=174.16s)]
*  allowing small amounts of aid to enter a territory with a starving population is just asking for [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  looting, not least because of criminal gangs who are operating under the nose of the Israeli state, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=184.39999999999998s)]
*  who all the evidence shows are cooperating with the Israeli army, and because the Israeli state [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=189.51999999999998s)]
*  keeps murdering local security personnel, whose job includes guarding aid, allowing safe passage. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=193.52s)]
*  On the 27th of May, the Israeli army opened fire at Palestinians queuing for food in these [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=199.36s)]
*  circumstances. In that case, they actually, there, the security, the army and the US mercenaries had [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=204.88s)]
*  to flee. I mean, the whole system is a joke, not funny joke. In any case, the aid points in practice [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=212.08s)]
*  mean cramming Palestinians into fence camps manned by Israeli soldiers and thuggish American [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=220.08s)]
*  mercenaries with images of those reminiscent of the hideous horrors of our past. Crucially, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=224.96s)]
*  the Israeli army keeps massacring Palestinians at these aid points. Much of the Western media [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=230.56s)]
*  simply fail to spell out the inarguable facts that the Israeli state is massacring these starving [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=234.4s)]
*  Palestinians. On the 1st of June, dozens of Palestinians were slaughtered and hundreds [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=240.32000000000002s)]
*  more injured as they waited for food at the so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation distribution [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=245.6s)]
*  centers in Rafeh. We have footage from Palestinians there of being shot at by Israeli machine guns. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=251.12s)]
*  We have this testimony from, for example, Dr. Victoria Rose. We have lots of testimonies of [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=257.2s)]
*  doctors. She's a British surgeon, the only remaining functioning hospital in the South of Gaza. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=277.36s)]
*  Shooting at the GHF aid distribution center near Rafeh. A lot of the injured people were taken to [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=287.28s)]
*  the local field hospitals. We think to ICRC, but we have had an extortionate amount of people come [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=295.84s)]
*  through the door. At the moment, the locals are quoting anything from 200 to possibly 100 [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=302.15999999999997s)]
*  injured people. These are all gunshot wounds. And as you can see behind me, we've got all the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=310.56s)]
*  bays are full and they're all gunshot wounds. It's absolute carnage here and there are even [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=315.28s)]
*  more people in the main emergency department. The NGO Medecins Sans Frontieres published [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=320.88s)]
*  testimonies from survivors. According to Mansour Sami Abdi, a father of four, people fought over [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=327.28s)]
*  five pallets. They told us to take food, then they fired from every direction. I ran 200 meters before [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=332.64s)]
*  realizing I'd been shot. This is an aid, it's a lie. Are we supposed to go get food for our kids [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=338.0s)]
*  and die? They also published a testimony of Mohammed Baghmeh, a Palestinian man displaced in [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=342.72s)]
*  Al-Qarara, Qarn Younis. He says, I was shot at 310 a.m. As we were trapped, I bled constantly [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=348.48s)]
*  till 5 a.m. There were many other men with me. One of them tried to get me out. He was shot in the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=355.44000000000005s)]
*  head and died on my chest. We'd gone there for nothing but food, just to survive like everyone [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=359.92s)]
*  else. According to the Red Cross, they received the highest number of weapon-ruined people in a [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=365.20000000000005s)]
*  single incident since the hospital was set up a year ago in Gaza. The Israeli army then resorted [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=369.68s)]
*  to their usual tricks when they commit atrocities, a combination of lies, deflection, gaslighting, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=375.12s)]
*  muddying the waters. They issued a statement declaring all aid was distributed today without [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=379.84000000000003s)]
*  incident. No injuries or fatalities, as noted in our daily update sent out earlier. We have heard [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=384.32s)]
*  that these fake reports have been actively fermented by Hamas. They are untrue and fabricated. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=389.04s)]
*  The Israeli authorities then issued footage which they say showed Hamas shooting at civilians in the [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=394.24s)]
*  words of an Israeli minister of foreign affairs spokesperson to prevent them from reaching aid [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=399.6s)]
*  distribution points. So the claim there is they're spitting this claim that Israel is trying to help [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=406.56s)]
*  the Palestinian people. They're trying to stop them from being starved to death. They're not [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=412.40000000000003s)]
*  the problem. They're not the reason why there's famine. But Hamas are preventing the Palestinians [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=415.44s)]
*  from getting the aid that Israel is so generously providing. That's the whole narrative that they're [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=420.32000000000005s)]
*  weaving. Now this was false. Completely false. It's a lie. This wasn't RAFA, this footage where [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=425.36s)]
*  the massacre took place. It was Khan Yunis. And as the Palestinian analyst Mohammed Shahada put it, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=432.56s)]
*  an Israeli backed gang looted seven chocks of flour and sold it to starved people for $30 per bag. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=438.0s)]
*  Anyone that tried to take a bag without paying was shot at or beaten up, all under the surveillance [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=444.32s)]
*  of Israeli drones that did nothing. Israel then changed their story. An IDF official said that [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=449.36s)]
*  Israeli soldiers fired warning shots towards several suspects who advanced towards the troops [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=455.2s)]
*  without saying who the suspects were. The modus operandi of the Israeli state is completely [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=460.0s)]
*  transparent. They carry out these massacres and sow chaos, knowing a subpine Western media will [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=465.12s)]
*  lap it all up and fail to do their job, working out what's true and what's not. And then when it's [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=470.4s)]
*  too late and the attention moves elsewhere, the atrocity they've perpetrated ends up being filed [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=475.52s)]
*  in a box labeled the Fog of War, where everyone's just encouraged to conclude, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=481.76s)]
*  well, we don't know what's really happened, what's really going on. It's all too chaotic. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=485.92s)]
*  And there's so many different claims being fired around. I don't know what to believe. That's what [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=489.28s)]
*  they're trying to do. Despite all the overwhelming evidence of what's actually happened, despite the [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=493.92s)]
*  overwhelming evidence of Israel lying over and over and over again, mainstream Western media [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=498.15999999999997s)]
*  organizations collaborate with Israel's propaganda strategy. Take the BBC. Their report on the massacre [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=503.59999999999997s)]
*  on the 1st of June is a headline Red Cross says at least 21 killed and a dozen shot in Gaza aid [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=509.12s)]
*  incident. Firstly, that's a drastic underestimate, but know how the headline strips away Israeli [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=514.24s)]
*  responsibility. It doesn't say who's on the firing. And I'm afraid that the data shows [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=518.64s)]
*  overwhelmingly people don't repass the headline. Aid incident as well. We're talking about a massacre, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=524.5600000000001s)]
*  incident. If, for example, 21 British civilians were just massacred, mowed down, would they call [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=531.44s)]
*  that an incident? Let's just be serious here. Let me read what the article says. A mass casualty [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=539.2s)]
*  influx, that's in quotes, of people, many with gunshot or shrapnel wounds, was received at a Red [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=545.44s)]
*  Cross field hospital in southern Gaza, the organization said, following disputed reports [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=550.96s)]
*  about an incident near an aid distribution center in Raffa. The International Committee of the Red [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=556.1600000000001s)]
*  Cross said 21 people were declared dead upon arrival while women and children were among 179 [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=560.72s)]
*  cases. The organization's statement came after the Hamas run civil defense agency in Gaza said at [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=566.64s)]
*  least 31 people were killed and many more wounded in the incident, which it blamed on Israeli gunfire [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=572.0s)]
*  targeting civilians. But the Israel Defense Forces said findings from initial inquiry showed its [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=577.44s)]
*  forces had not fired at people while they were near or within the aid center. The IDF also released [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=582.08s)]
*  drone footage, it said, showed armed and mass men throwing stones and shooting at civilians. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=588.8s)]
*  While they collected aid in the nearby city of Karnunis, the BBC could not immediately verify the [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=593.5999999999999s)]
*  footage. Let's begin here. Note that the BBC refuses to present the obvious fact that Israel is [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=598.3199999999999s)]
*  responsible. They use this word disputed. That's what they use. This is the muddy in the water [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=604.0799999999999s)]
*  thing, disputed. He says, she says, who's to know who's right? Who's to know what the truth is? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=611.28s)]
*  Know instead how they refer to Israeli guilt via Hamas, a Hamas statement. They know that undermines [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=617.9200000000001s)]
*  faith in the claim. It becomes, well, Hamas claims one thing. Do you really believe Hamas? That's [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=624.96s)]
*  what that's all about. No, they then just present the Israeli denials of responsibility [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=629.6800000000001s)]
*  after that as credible. That's what they do. They present it as a credible claim. It's back to that [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=634.64s)]
*  quote, isn't it? Again, I keep using this quote. If someone says it's raining outside and someone [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=641.36s)]
*  says it's not raining, your job is to look out the fucking window, not to say one claims this, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=648.72s)]
*  one claims that. But that's what they're doing here. Know how they also include the BBC reference [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=656.16s)]
*  to footage, which is irrelevant. It's completely irrelevant. It's criminal gangs shooting at [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=663.04s)]
*  Palestinians elsewhere. It has nothing to do with this, which they know will encourage readers to [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=667.04s)]
*  believe, for example, that, well, Hamas could really be responsible for the massacre. Instead, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=671.12s)]
*  it's all fog of war. It's all, well, there's lots of shooting going on about, going on around. Who [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=676.0s)]
*  knows what's going on? The BBC does all of this despite the video evidence, despite the witness [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=680.48s)]
*  testimonies, despite the testimonies of doctors, despite overwhelming evidence of Israel relentlessly [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=686.56s)]
*  lying about its atrocities, despite so many other previous comparable massacres. I'll come onto that. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=693.6s)]
*  And despite, crucially, that this is happening in a closed Israeli military zone. This is within their [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=698.16s)]
*  hub, their manning. The BBC is suggesting it's somehow plausible that Hamas could be freely [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=704.72s)]
*  operating within a hub manned by Israeli soldiers. That is insane. It's completely insane. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=709.0400000000001s)]
*  Let's come on now to Sky News. Their headline, IDF issues denial after reports of at least 31 [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=714.4s)]
*  people killed in Israeli attack near a distribution site. Note how they foreground the denial. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=720.08s)]
*  Do they just print any old denial and treat that as credible? When you get this sort of massacre, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=725.76s)]
*  Vladimir Putin, North Korea, Assad, when he was in power? No, they don't. Now at length, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=731.76s)]
*  it gives space to Israeli denials, including the deputy minister of foreign affairs saying the [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=736.1600000000001s)]
*  attack could be Hamas propaganda. Just nonsense. The evidence shows the attack has happened. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=739.9200000000001s)]
*  We know that this is happening and we know that it's not possible for anyone else to be responsible. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=746.5600000000001s)]
*  They quote the foundation, which is an Israeli front. So now just treating it as that, oh, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=753.6s)]
*  here's this independent foundation. It's not, it's just the IDF. They quote its statement saying, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=757.6800000000001s)]
*  all aid was distributed today without incident. No injuries or fatalities as noted in our daily [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=763.84s)]
*  updates sent out earlier. We've heard these fake reports have been actively fermented by Hamas. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=768.08s)]
*  They are untrue and fabricated. What, the BBC can start printing, well, a new statement's come out [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=772.56s)]
*  saying the earth's flat. Just going to just uncritically print the earth is flat. This is where [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=778.4s)]
*  we're at here. That's obviously not true. It's not the job of journalists to just print immediately, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=784.2399999999999s)]
*  obviously, through really wrong statements. These are all lies and Sky News should not be [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=794.0799999999999s)]
*  amplifying these lies and treating them as credible. For context, on the 29th of February, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=799.92s)]
*  2024, Israeli forces massacred over a hundred Palestinians waiting for food in the so-called [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=804.88s)]
*  Flower Massacre. The Israeli state played all the same tunes that they've played here, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=809.68s)]
*  all the same games. Then about six weeks later, CNN did a detailed rebuttal of all the Israeli [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=814.7199999999999s)]
*  lies about the massacre. But before you give CNN credit, it was too late. It did not have [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=821.5999999999999s)]
*  anywhere near the prominence of the original Israeli claims, the lies, and attention had moved [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=827.2s)]
*  on. This is the strategy deployed over and over again. For example, when the Israeli military [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=832.0s)]
*  massacred 16 Palestinian paramedics and first responders earlier this year and buried them in [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=836.96s)]
*  a mass grave, which they lied through their teeth about, even when footage of what actually happened [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=842.08s)]
*  was released and the media, including the BBC, again, went along with these Israeli ruses. This [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=847.0400000000001s)]
*  has happened over and over and over again. Eventually, you get, as I've said, some cases [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=851.92s)]
*  where they go, well, they deconstruct the lies, but it's then completely divorced from the wider [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=856.7199999999999s)]
*  reporting. It's siloed. It's orphaned. It's like Groundhog Day. They don't then treat subsequent [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=860.4799999999999s)]
*  Israeli claims as obviously completely impossible. They don't know the history of statements by [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=871.52s)]
*  Israel which are wrong. These are the same people who weave in as standard Hamas run [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=878.24s)]
*  health ministry in order to sow doubt in the official death statistics, which we know actually, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=883.52s)]
*  according to all the independent research, are drastic underestimates of the death toll. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=888.08s)]
*  They don't put in a standard, previous Israeli statements have been proven, have been found to be [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=892.4s)]
*  false, including, for example, about relevant massacres of people trying to get aid. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=896.72s)]
*  Now, once again today, the Israelis have done another massacre at a so-called aid site, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=901.36s)]
*  killing dozens of Palestinians. We can hear from one of the surviving [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=905.2s)]
*  Palestinian journalists, Hind Kandri, who is a brilliant journalist, about what happened, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=908.4000000000001s)]
*  doing the job the BBC and other organizations have failed to do. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=913.76s)]
*  Well, the same exact thing that happened in the past four days. Palestinians were waiting and [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=917.76s)]
*  moving up, approaching towards this distribution point to collect food. What we need to know is [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=923.12s)]
*  the death toll rose to 27, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. We're talking [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=929.9200000000001s)]
*  about please 90 Palestinians injured. Now, all of these people were walking towards the distribution [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=934.96s)]
*  point collecting food. Now, we heard from eyewitnesses that there are some people that were [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=941.44s)]
*  able to collect a little bit of food. What we also knew from the eyewitnesses is it's more of [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=947.76s)]
*  a chaos. There's no process. There's no system. You just need to run first and to grab food [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=954.5600000000001s)]
*  to be able to get the food. And this is why this is making a lot of chaos. The Israeli forces just [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=961.28s)]
*  opens fire automatically, randomly, shooting Palestinians in their upper parts of their bodies, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=968.64s)]
*  using quad captures and live ammunition. And Palestinians are very desperate to get food. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=976.1600000000001s)]
*  That is why they're going there. According to a doctor at NASA hospital, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=981.76s)]
*  most of the victims are children aged between 10 and 13, many with gunshot wounds to the head [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=985.84s)]
*  and chest. The idea that Israeli snipers do not know they're shooting little children in the head [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=991.36s)]
*  and chest is a fantasy. One of the most advanced militaries on earth is we're constantly told what [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=994.96s)]
*  they're just accidentally shooting Israeli gunmen. They're just accidentally shooting [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=999.76s)]
*  children in the head and chest. That's interesting, isn't it? How they manage to [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=1005.2800000000001s)]
*  specifically end up shooting them in the head and chest. Not on the arm, not on the legs, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=1011.36s)]
*  not elsewhere in the torso, head and chest. That's what a sniper is deliberately doing to [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=1018.56s)]
*  kill people. And they can see who they're shooting. And we know this because, again, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=1024.8799999999999s)]
*  dozens of US-based medics who served in Gaza reported, as even the New York Times was forced [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=1030.96s)]
*  to print, that they were dealing overwhelmingly with children who had been sniped and shot in the [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=1036.88s)]
*  head and chest, often repeatedly. The Israeli state knows it can keep massacring Palestinians [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=1040.88s)]
*  because the BBC and other media outlets will collaborate with them in practice to deflect [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=1044.64s)]
*  responsibility. Now listen to how the BBC has covered the latest massacre. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=1048.88s)]
*  The state of this, the state of this. A massacre was a fatal incident. Gaza has now become Hamas [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=1066.72s)]
*  controlled Gaza. And Israeli responsibilities are only attributed to a claim by Hamas immediately [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=1086.88s)]
*  sowing doubt in the claim. This use of Hamas controlled Gaza, this is interesting, not in a [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=1091.68s)]
*  good way, it's not a one-off. The BBC seems to have suddenly introduced Hamas controlled Gaza into [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=1096.72s)]
*  their reporting lexicon. It also features in an online report today from the BBC journalist [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=1102.0s)]
*  Barbara Usher in a report which, again, does not establish Israeli blame and includes past [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=1107.68s)]
*  Israeli deniers as credible. Hamas controlled Gaza has got all sorts of implications, not least [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=1112.72s)]
*  deflecting from the reality that Israel is the occupier with all the legal responsibilities [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=1117.6s)]
*  that come with that. For example, ensuring access to humanitarian aid. Now today the BBC finally [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=1122.24s)]
*  assigns blame to Israel in their headline, but this is too little too late. This is an example, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=1129.28s)]
*  horrible example, of how the Western media collaborates with the Israeli propaganda [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=1135.28s)]
*  campaign. Israel's genocide would not be possible without Western states arming and supporting it. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=1139.52s)]
*  If the Western media actually did their job, it would be politically impossible for Western [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=1143.76s)]
*  governments to continue facilitating genocide. Mainstream media organisations are complicit in [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQevRYb0lu4&t=1148.56s)]
