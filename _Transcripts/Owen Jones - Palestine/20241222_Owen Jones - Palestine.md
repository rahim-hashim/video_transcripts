# Beginning of End For Zionism - Israeli Historian w. Ilan Pappé
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [December 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s)
*  Now, Ilan Pape, the celebrated Israeli historian, has been long one of the most important voices [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=0.0s)]
*  that we have when it comes to talking about Israel and Palestine. And since the current genocide began, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=6.08s)]
*  of course, his voice has become even more important than ever. Ilan, it's such an honor to be able to [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=14.48s)]
*  speak to you belatedly. I should have done this a long time ago. So I'm glad we're finally communicating [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=20.64s)]
*  on video and I know my audience will be delighted. Great to speak to you. How are you doing? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=26.48s)]
*  I'm fine. Thank you. Thank you so much for having me. Yes, we already planned that long time ago. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=30.72s)]
*  I'm glad it unfolded eventually. It's finally happened. So look, let's just actually begin. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=36.32s)]
*  We're coming to the end now of 2024. And already I remember thinking about to the end of 2023 [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=43.84s)]
*  and thinking about the horror being unleashed against the people of Gaza. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=50.720000000000006s)]
*  And I have to say, if I knew, maybe I wouldn't be shocked, but knew a year later that we'd be [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=56.160000000000004s)]
*  discussing still the apparently limitless amount of depravity being unleashed against the people of [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  Gaza, I think I'd be pretty chilled by that, to be honest. And here we are. I want to ask you, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=67.36s)]
*  you're a historian of Israel and Palestine. Historical context is always on your mind. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=75.6s)]
*  What have you learned since October 2023? How's anything changed in the way you look at this? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=83.19999999999999s)]
*  Yes, I think in two ways, something, I think two aspects became a bit clearer compared to all of [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=91.36s)]
*  ours, more immediate reactions. And immediate reactions are sometimes a bit [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=100.96s)]
*  amiss because it makes sense. You don't have a perspective and you don't really know how things [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=108.0s)]
*  develop. But I think now we have a better sense. So one thing that is clear to me, although I [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=114.32s)]
*  already felt this was true even a few months after the 7th of October, that contrary to what [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=120.72s)]
*  some people say, we are not at the beginning of the worst chapter in the history of Palestine and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=127.6s)]
*  the Palestinians in general, and that of Gaza, of course, in particular, I think we are in the end [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=135.92s)]
*  of that chapter. So I think that this kind of chapter in history that began in the Nakba in [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=141.76s)]
*  1948, some people rightly would say maybe even earlier, but definitely with the ethnic cleansing [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=148.88s)]
*  of 1948 and the Palestinians call this whole historical chapter the ongoing Nakba in Arabic, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=154.8s)]
*  al-Nakba al-Mustamirra. This is now reached an apex undoubtedly of brutality, of ruthlessness, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=160.96s)]
*  ethnic cleansing has turned into genocide. All this is true, but I don't think it's an indication [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=169.44s)]
*  that now a long chapter of destruction is continuing. I really think that this is going to be [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=175.60000000000002s)]
*  the beginning of the end of the Zionist colonialist project in Palestine, exactly because it is so [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=183.84s)]
*  ruthless and because we may elaborate about it a bit later, but that's one kind of analysis that I [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=190.72s)]
*  hesitated to present at the very beginning of the events and now I'm much more confident about it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=199.28s)]
*  The second one, and this is still for me the greatest surprise if you want, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=208.16s)]
*  the bewilderment of what happened. I mean, I was not surprised by the level of violence the Hamas [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=213.28s)]
*  performed on the 7th of October, and I'm afraid to say that I was not surprised by the level of [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=220.72s)]
*  the brutality and inhumanity of the Israeli reaction. I was surprised by the total indifference [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=226.24s)]
*  of the West and in particular of the European West. This is still something that I don't, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=233.36s)]
*  I can provide some partial explanation for why this indifference to the most televised [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=240.08s)]
*  daily genocide we've ever had since the beginning of the end of the Second World War, but I still [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=247.28s)]
*  find it beyond comprehension. And that is a process that has to my mind [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=254.32s)]
*  impact beyond the question of Gaza or Palestine. I think that impacts the whole issue of the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=261.84s)]
*  international legal system, the whole issue of what are universal values and the face of the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=267.68s)]
*  global South in anything that the global North or global West will put forward as universal [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=273.6s)]
*  principles for running the world or the order in the world. So I think that's a huge crisis of [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  confidence in international institutions and laws that will have far-reaching impact on all of us, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=288.15999999999997s)]
*  wherever we are in years to come. I mean, before I ask you about the first part, which is very, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=297.59999999999997s)]
*  very challenging, I think a lot of people listening to that, particularly in the here and now, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=304.4s)]
*  would definitely obviously want me to ask you to expand on that. So I will. But before I do, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=308.8s)]
*  I mean, that second point, you talk about the indifference, because I think, I mean, one thing [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=313.04s)]
*  I've always said is never stop being shocked, even if you understand the dynamics at play. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=316.64000000000004s)]
*  You can understand the dynamics at play, but you should never be numb. But it is about that, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=320.08000000000004s)]
*  which is I wrote a piece last month where I just, the reason I was really struck by what you said [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=324.88s)]
*  is I tried to put that in words. And I wrote about an apparently invisible fortress, the West [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=330.96000000000004s)]
*  official narrative of Israel's onslaught against Gaza. And what I was trying to look at is it [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=336.4s)]
*  didn't matter how depraved the atrocity or how overwhelming the evidence or how confessed to the [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=343.12s)]
*  crime, because as Raz Segal, the Israeli-American associate professor of Holocaust and genocide [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=347.35999999999996s)]
*  study puts it, it's very rare for intent actually to be so explicit in these cases. And we've seen [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=353.2s)]
*  that from the very start. But it doesn't matter the narrative always, the official respectable [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=358.15999999999997s)]
*  narrative always survives. When you and I talk about, say, genocide or even war crimes, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=362.96s)]
*  that almost puts a badgerness as outside of the official respectable narrative. We're extreme, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=367.76s)]
*  we're radicals, we're dangerous. Do you see what I mean? I'm interested in that. It's almost though [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=373.03999999999996s)]
*  there's no level of depravity or confession to depravity. That narrative has remained titanium [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=378.96s)]
*  protected. Nothing seems to budge it in respectable circles. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=386.32s)]
*  Yeah, well, definitely. First of all, it's a fair analysis. I think very few people can argue with [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=389.76s)]
*  you that this is the situation. Now, let's see if we can at least unpack it a bit and see if we can [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=394.72s)]
*  explain it. My, maybe it's the historian in me, but I do think there is an historical context for [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=401.52000000000004s)]
*  that kind of immunity, that kind of exceptionalism. This kind of gap between the reality, the stark [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=407.52000000000004s)]
*  reality on the ground and the false language and vocabulary used to describe it by people who [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=416.16s)]
*  definitely are not idiots. And one cannot suspect that they are not educated or knowledgeable. And [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=422.96000000000004s)]
*  yet they do it maybe even knowingly or maybe unconsciously. I don't know. But I do think it's [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=428.64000000000004s)]
*  especially in Europe. Let's put the Americans aside for a moment. That was a good idea. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=435.20000000000005s)]
*  Yes. The Europeans, I think, still treat this whole issue of Israel and Palestine [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=441.44s)]
*  as something that they are part of. And their part in it is not a pleasant one. It's almost like a [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=451.52000000000004s)]
*  complicity. Zionism, in the end of the day, was a European solution for European problems. The [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=458.64s)]
*  problem was the way Europe treated its Jews through racism and eventually through genocide. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=466.16s)]
*  And Zionism, whoever conceived it, provided this easy way out by saying we'll build a European [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=473.68s)]
*  Jewish state at the heart of the Arab world, at the heart of the Muslim world. We'll impose it on [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=482.64000000000004s)]
*  the indigenous people of Palestine. And by that, we can forget about it. But it seems that it doesn't [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=487.36s)]
*  work. And therefore, I think, in order not to fully appreciate and accept the consequences of [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=494.4s)]
*  this impracticable, immoral project that was sustained through force, not through moral validity, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=504.0s)]
*  only through force, I think this is where there's still a hope that maybe with language they can kind [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=512.24s)]
*  of launder at the fact that the solution for this European problem was the destruction of [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=518.64s)]
*  Palestine and the Palestinians, not only saving the Jews, but actually destroying other people. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=525.6s)]
*  And all these European jugglery saying it's a small injustice to rectify a bigger one, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=532.0s)]
*  after the last year, you cannot even say that sentence in any serious manner. And I think that [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=541.92s)]
*  is really the issue here. As long as the Israeli oppression was incremental, here and there [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=548.24s)]
*  justified, or could be covered up as part of self-defense and part of an attempt to sustain [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=554.88s)]
*  the so-called peace process, fine, it worked. But what Israel did in Gaza did not allow any [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=562.16s)]
*  such maneuvering or manipulations. And I think that's part. It's a partial explanation. I don't [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=571.04s)]
*  think it's the only one and our Marxist friends rightly would add some economic [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=576.5600000000001s)]
*  interest into that. But I think that's a very important psychological infrastructure [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=582.8000000000001s)]
*  for that kind of incomprehensible indifference to the suffering of people, which is daily screened [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=590.32s)]
*  on our phones and television and so on. I mean, it's the live streaming, as you said, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=600.16s)]
*  I mean, obviously the work of Palestinian journalists, he suffered the biggest thoughts [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=607.76s)]
*  of journalists in recorded history often alongside their family, their children. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=611.52s)]
*  But that point about intent, about confession, which I've tried to raise over and over again, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=616.7199999999999s)]
*  but it's almost like it's compartmentalized in a parallel universe in that you'll get Israeli [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=622.48s)]
*  leaders and officials who say one thing to their local audiences. And then they have their [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=627.28s)]
*  spokespeople who come on Western media outlets to claim they're binding my international law and [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=635.04s)]
*  not attacking civilians, which they don't say actually to them, if you listen to what they say [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=639.4399999999999s)]
*  at home in Hebrew. I mean, that's almost it. That's what's happened is it's almost, you know, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=645.1999999999999s)]
*  Western media coverage didn't frame itself around that intent. I often give this [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=651.76s)]
*  hideous example, to be honest, right at the beginning. And this was the Israeli general [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=657.2s)]
*  in charge of Kogat, which is for those who don't know these civilian affairs. And he said, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=665.36s)]
*  Hamas became ISIS and the citizens of Gaza are celebrating instead of being horrified. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=669.76s)]
*  Human animals are dealt with accordingly. Israel has imposed a total blockade on Gaza, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=673.84s)]
*  no electricity, no water, just damage. You wanted hell, you'll get hell. That was in a [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=678.08s)]
*  tree addressed to both Hamas and the residents of Gaza. So there's no pretence there, but that was [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=682.5600000000001s)]
*  almost not covered in any single Western media outlet. Do you see what I mean? It's a different [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=688.08s)]
*  universe. That's how it has to, you just have to just pretend it's not being said or done. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=692.0s)]
*  Absolutely. You know, sometimes I think the Israelis treat Hebrew as a secret language. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=698.48s)]
*  And therefore they allow themselves to say things that they think that afterwards nobody would [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=703.6800000000001s)]
*  hear. And it's just for domestic consumption. And then they're really surprised when it turns [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=708.08s)]
*  out that some people who speak Hebrew are horrified by what they said and translated [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=712.8000000000001s)]
*  to other languages. And if you look at the dossier that South Africa presented to the ICJ, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=718.4000000000001s)]
*  it's definitely, I don't think all the people who were in this delegation knows Hebrew, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=726.5600000000001s)]
*  but they have enough people who helped them to translate into English these clear [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=730.32s)]
*  manifestation of intent by senior politicians, senior military officers. And if you go even [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=738.1600000000001s)]
*  deeper into this, to the orders that were issued by brigade commanders on the eve of the entry [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=746.08s)]
*  to Gaza, you will find this language of an intentional genocide all over it, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=754.48s)]
*  including the references to biblical chapters of, you know, genociding the Amalekites and so on. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=762.4s)]
*  I mean, this is, unfortunately, it's a very easy case, I would say, for anyone who takes the [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=771.04s)]
*  the most known definition of genocide in the United Nations charter and checks whether this [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=780.08s)]
*  definition fits the case study of the Israeli intent, rightly as you say, not only the [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=786.88s)]
*  manifestations or the application of that policy on the ground. I would go even further, and this [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=793.52s)]
*  is something that really we have to take into account because I do believe, as I said in my [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=801.68s)]
*  first point, that the Israelis are facing really a moment of truth in the whole history of the [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=808.48s)]
*  state. I'll come back to it in a minute. I just want to say that because of that, the only solution [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=817.12s)]
*  that the current Israeli politicians who run the country see, I'm not saying they're not aware of [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=822.72s)]
*  it, but they believe they have a window of opportunity to prevent it. And the only way to [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=828.24s)]
*  prevent it is a total destruction of the Palestinians, not just as people, but as an idea, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=833.12s)]
*  as a concept. This is why they're taking UNRWA, and this is why they're working now in Syria and [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=841.28s)]
*  other places to kind of create a region, an Arab world, that has put the Palestine issue behind it. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=846.96s)]
*  And I don't think they will succeed, by the way, but I do believe that they can, you know, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=855.36s)]
*  wreak a lot of havoc and carnage before the failure would become clear. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=860.24s)]
*  I mean, that's what I want to ask you about, of course, that very challenging argument that [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=867.84s)]
*  actually this could be the beginning of the end for that project. And a lot of people will go, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=872.32s)]
*  I mean, you know, the Israeli state might just respond in a very triumphalist way. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=877.52s)]
*  Gaza wipes off the face of the earth. The West Bank, I mean, they've got away with a pogrom there, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=882.4s)]
*  essentially. Palestinian existence, they're becoming ever more unbearable. Southern Lebanon [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=887.68s)]
*  reduced large parts of it to rubble. Hezbollah smashed. Iran hobbled. Obviously now, the Assad [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=895.76s)]
*  regime, even though in practice it's claimed to be, you know, actively support the Palestinian [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=904.8s)]
*  people, I mean, we can talk about it elsewhere, but, you know, I think they're risable. But [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=910.2399999999999s)]
*  nonetheless, you can look at that and go, well, actually things have gone. Yeah, sure, if you [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=914.56s)]
*  don't like mass murder, if you don't like war crimes, boo hoo hoo for you, they might say. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=918.3199999999999s)]
*  But things are going pretty well for us. We're smashing our enemies, we're smashing our opponents, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=924.3199999999999s)]
*  and now we've got Donald Trump in the White House and a load of pro-Israel zealots. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=929.52s)]
*  Things are looking pretty good for that project. That's what they would say, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=933.92s)]
*  would you say? Yeah, of course. And there are two [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=936.56s)]
*  immediate points one can respond to. One is there's a huge number of Israelis who don't fancy [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=938.4s)]
*  living in a country that this is its future. This is its vision, to be constantly using military [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=944.48s)]
*  force in order to exist and military force that has to be more and more brutal and ruthless, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=952.64s)]
*  not only towards army, but also towards the population. We don't know the exact number of [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=958.48s)]
*  Israelis who left after 7th of October. Some journalists in Israel put it around 700,000, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=963.76s)]
*  others talk about half a million. It's not only the numbers, it is the [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=971.5200000000001s)]
*  kind of characteristic of that group that has left. And it shows you that what they understand, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=976.96s)]
*  and this is not out of any particular solidarity with the Palestinian suffering, what they [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=982.6400000000001s)]
*  understand is that in order to survive in the state for them, their children and their grandchildren, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=987.9200000000001s)]
*  Israel would always have to have this upper hand in military and security means. Now, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=995.76s)]
*  for a normal person that would like some stability in life, some peace in one's own normal life, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1002.0799999999999s)]
*  this is not the place to be in, undoubtedly. Even if, yes, the last four weeks were successful [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1011.52s)]
*  from a military point of view, will the next four weeks be successful? Will it happen again? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1018.48s)]
*  And it will happen again, of course. There will be another Palestinian uprising. There will be [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1026.24s)]
*  another 7th of October. That's very clear. And things can change in the Arab world. But that [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1030.72s)]
*  means your only future is all the time in making sure that your military budget is the most important [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1037.3600000000001s)]
*  element in your state's budget, economically, not to mention psychologically and mentally. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1045.6s)]
*  So that's one point, the point that this is not a vision that is shared by a large number of [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1054.32s)]
*  Israelis. I mean, some of them would say there's no other choice, unfortunately, because they can't [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1061.04s)]
*  see any options. But those who can afford it economically and because they have dual nationalities [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1065.9199999999998s)]
*  and so on and reignite their professions elsewhere are already leaving. So there's something very [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1074.8s)]
*  hollow here. There's kind of a social implosion from the inside. There's a domestic price to be [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1081.6s)]
*  paid for this supposedly the resurgence of the idea of the invincibility of the Israeli army, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1087.28s)]
*  which I'm still doubting. I mean, they defeated two guerrilla movements. In the end of the day, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1096.1599999999999s)]
*  that's what they did. Guerrilla movements who had no air force, had no tanks, and so on. So to put it [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1101.68s)]
*  in perspective, it's quite important as well. But the second point is also very important. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1109.28s)]
*  This kind of vision from an economic point of view would need a very strong global alliance [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1116.4s)]
*  led by the United States. They would not only support Israel diplomatically and politically, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1128.6399999999999s)]
*  but materially. We already know the expenditure that this success has produced beyond anything [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1134.8s)]
*  Israel has ever spent on military issues. And you think about even someone like Donald Trump [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1142.56s)]
*  and any other isolationist politician that would come from the Republican Party or the [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1152.0s)]
*  Democratic Party. I wonder whether in five, six, seven years they would regard Israel as such an [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1157.36s)]
*  asset when they will have to pay for all of this because the Israelis don't have that many resources [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1164.3999999999999s)]
*  to pay for themselves. So there are these kinds of immediate responses, but there's something more [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1169.52s)]
*  profound going on here. Unless you believe that the world cannot change, then yes, maybe it's too [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1176.08s)]
*  early to say it's the beginning of the end. But if you have even a modicum of belief [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1184.64s)]
*  that the political system we live in, whether it's in Britain or in Israel or in the United States [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1190.96s)]
*  in Turkey, it doesn't matter. But if you even have a modicum of belief that the current political [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1198.4s)]
*  situation or constellation is not forever, you don't think it's a terminus view. And you think [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1207.04s)]
*  about more positive alternatives to the existing political system. Any positive alternative, even [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1212.88s)]
*  a slight move towards such an alternative model would bring the end of the Zionist project closer. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1221.7600000000002s)]
*  Because the way you can sustain Israel is only in a world that is ruled by populist leaders, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1231.6000000000001s)]
*  right-wing neo-fascist parties, dictators in the Arab world, a democratic Arab world, a more [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1239.2s)]
*  democratic and liberal even, West and Global South, would not tolerate the kind of state that Israel [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1247.44s)]
*  has become. I mean, I don't say part about the illusion of every age is that it will last forever, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1256.4s)]
*  and I agree with you. But I guess in the here and now, one might look at the position Israel's in. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1263.52s)]
*  I mean, you say, for example, another October 7 could happen. But I mean, some might go, well, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1271.12s)]
*  there was only one seventh of October that ever happened in the history of Israel. And that was [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1280.8799999999999s)]
*  because the Israeli military, they saw Gaza as a sealed tomb from which nobody would ever emerge [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1285.12s)]
*  anyway. And they didn't have their military in place to prevent what happened, including, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1290.88s)]
*  of course, the killing of Israeli civilians. But they wouldn't make that mistake ever again. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1295.7600000000002s)]
*  I mean, what do you think? They can just basically insulate Israel from anything. And if there's any [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1300.24s)]
*  attack on them, they just wipe out southern Lebanon. They were surprised when the first [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1307.7600000000002s)]
*  Antifada broke out. They were surprised when the second one broke out. Israel needs to employ, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1313.84s)]
*  I don't know of any other country, maybe some like North Korea is a good example for that. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1322.9599999999998s)]
*  I think even North Korea is not as bad in that respect. Israel needs to employ hundreds of [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1329.4399999999998s)]
*  thousands of its own people to police the Palestinians so that the Palestinians [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1335.6s)]
*  would reconcile with living in mega prisons such as West Bank or in a ghetto like Gaza [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1342.32s)]
*  or in a parted state which is experienced by the Palestinian citizens of Israel. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1349.12s)]
*  How long can they really do this? I mean, how much is it really a secure policy for the future [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1355.04s)]
*  if you have millions of people now reaching a number that is equal to your own citizens [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1364.32s)]
*  who are not willing to go away, are resisting, are resilient, and are not going to give up? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1370.8s)]
*  Not to mention the millions of the same people and nation who are on Israel borders and the fact [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1379.6s)]
*  that so many people in the civil society, in the Arab world and the Muslim world, support them. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1386.48s)]
*  You have to take into account this constellation. Yes, admittedly, to simplify, we can say there's [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1392.0s)]
*  a global Israel and global Palestine. So yes, right now, global Israel, which is made of [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1400.08s)]
*  Israel supporters, mostly populist leaders, right-wing governments, maybe even industrial [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1405.6s)]
*  military complexes and multinational corporations, fine, very, very powerful alliance. I don't doubt [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1414.8799999999999s)]
*  it. But there's a global Palestine, the one that is supported by so many people in civil society, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1421.6s)]
*  which the global South, look at the position of some of the Latin American countries. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1429.52s)]
*  Look at the changes in some countries like like Estonia and so on. This is an incremental process [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1434.32s)]
*  of isolating Israel, of turning it into a rogue state. I know people are very unhappy in Palestine [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1441.36s)]
*  about the ICC and the ICC. And I can see why, because it was the rulings are not translated [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1449.28s)]
*  yet into an effective action. But I think it's a very fundamental change in the way the world [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1456.0s)]
*  relates to Israel and Palestine. The ICC and ICC are not just an organic part of the civil society. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1462.32s)]
*  They're kind of the medium between the civil society and the corridors of power. And I think [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1468.6399999999999s)]
*  that is very significant in the long run. So, you know, we can add to this the attitude of the [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1476.24s)]
*  young Jewish generation, including in the United States. So many Jews do not want to be associated [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1481.68s)]
*  with Israel. Now we can all say that doesn't matter. They don't have brigades. They don't [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1487.92s)]
*  have political power. They don't have a cloud in the Congress and so on. But this is a still [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1492.4s)]
*  picture what we're talking about. We're not talking about the video here. The video is, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1499.36s)]
*  shows the changes. Very slow, too slow for the people of Gaza. And I'm afraid maybe even too [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1504.8s)]
*  slow for the people of the West Bank if we are right in our apprehension that Israel would move [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1511.12s)]
*  with the same model to the West Bank. I fully agree. But in the long run, I see this as this [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1517.1999999999998s)]
*  ruthless Israel as burying its own hole in terms of international standing, legitimacy. And you can [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1523.6s)]
*  buy the Arab regimes, but you cannot buy the Arab people. And Israel is still a minority in the Arab [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1533.6799999999998s)]
*  world. I mean, Israel is not part of Europe. It wants to be maybe part of Europe. But it is in the [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1540.3999999999999s)]
*  heart of the Arab world and the Muslim world that since the 2011 is undergoing its own revolution, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1546.1599999999999s)]
*  there is now counterrevolution. But this is not over. And this whole project does not fit [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1552.56s)]
*  the aspiration of people in this part of the world and other parts of the world [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1560.24s)]
*  for a different world. And if you are in that situation, only force and more force would [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1564.32s)]
*  sustain you. And I wonder from my historical experience whether this is a long-term business. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1572.4799999999998s)]
*  Well, I suppose, yeah, with that cap on, the historical context cap on in terms of looking [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1579.36s)]
*  as, you know, a guide, using it as the guide for the future. Because that point you made about, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1584.0s)]
*  I mean, essentially Israel's position is the Palestinian population represent an existential [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1588.32s)]
*  problem and they work backwards from that. Which is why you talk about an idea. I mean, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1593.2s)]
*  that's why you often have cheerleaders to Israeli states say there's no such thing as the Palestinians. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1598.1599999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's been a perennial claim because their fears, the very identity, the sense of [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1602.32s)]
*  identity that Palestinians have poses an existential threat to the Israeli project. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1606.72s)]
*  And as you note, the attack on UNRWA, the refugee agency for Palestinians, is they hate that because [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1611.9199999999998s)]
*  it's this idea, it sustains the idea that Palestinians are refugees who'd be kicked from [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1617.84s)]
*  those. But couldn't they just thought, you know, when Smotrich, the Israeli finance minister talks [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1621.4399999999998s)]
*  about thinning out Gaza's population by half in two years. Under Trump, my point is, could they [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1629.4399999999998s)]
*  just not do that? They could just gradually, people through death, through what they call [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1635.6s)]
*  voluntary migration, you make Gaza uninhabitable, obviously, which they have. And then you just, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1640.8s)]
*  under humanitarian garbs, you just start exporting the population, maybe do a deal with Sisi in Egypt, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1645.52s)]
*  sort of some description, he's a Western-backed dictator, in the West Bank, just gradually again, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1651.6s)]
*  asphyxiate Palestinian existence so people just leave. Do you see what I mean? I mean, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1656.16s)]
*  couldn't they just get away with just getting rid of the Palestinian population from Gaza and the [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1660.24s)]
*  West Bank over a period of time? They could get away in the short run, but they cannot get away [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1665.92s)]
*  in the long run. You know, I don't want to mention names, but there were other regimes in history [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1671.76s)]
*  that two or three years after they came into power, the world seemed to be unable to stop them from [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1677.84s)]
*  any plans, whether it was occupying other nations, whether it was genociding them, and so on. And it [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1684.56s)]
*  seemed like nobody would ever be able to stop them. Five, six years later, they were stopped, eventually. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1691.12s)]
*  So yes, I mean, they could do all these things. And unfortunately, they want to do all these things. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1698.0s)]
*  And of course, I'm not just an historian, I'm also an activist. So I'm not just an onlooker and an [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1704.8s)]
*  analyst. I'm also part of a movement that will do all they can to stop it. But beyond that, let's say [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1711.76s)]
*  that we unfortunately are not that powerful right now to stop it, which is an unfortunate possibility. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1719.1200000000001s)]
*  Nonetheless, the success of that is, to me, from an historical perspective, another factor that would [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1727.3600000000001s)]
*  bring it down. I think that you have to look at the more liberal forces that were part of this [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1737.0400000000002s)]
*  global Israel alliance. What they benefited from was the kind of double talk that you referred to [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1745.1200000000001s)]
*  before, that the Israelis were kind of conveying, you know, we are actually the only democracy in [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1752.64s)]
*  the Middle East. We are part of the social democratic world, in fact, even more than just [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1758.48s)]
*  the democratic world. Yes, we have enemies, we have problems, but all in all, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1764.24s)]
*  this is our aspiration is for peace, and so on. This discourse has disappeared from the Israeli [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1769.6000000000001s)]
*  political scene. So I think it would be more and more difficult for the politicians in the West [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1774.96s)]
*  that are not populist, that are not part of the fascist neo-right, to continue and do it. They [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1783.92s)]
*  still do it. There's a strong lobby. There is still fear and timidity, because politicians, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1790.0s)]
*  especially of this generation, are thinking of the next election and not of any moral values. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1796.64s)]
*  But here and there, we can see the signs that the lobby was successfully destroying, but [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1802.16s)]
*  these signs will increase, like someone like Corbyn, someone like Bernie Sanders. I mean, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1809.8400000000001s)]
*  these are not going to be exceptions of the rule that are going to disappear. We won't hear about [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1814.96s)]
*  them again. These are just trailblazers. This is going to change, and therefore, I'm looking, [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1821.44s)]
*  I wish I had the formula, how to narrow the gap between the very slow process that I think is [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1831.84s)]
*  positive as far as the Palestinians are concerned, regionally and globally, and the very quick [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1839.2s)]
*  process of destruction on the ground. And how to narrow the gap is our biggest mission in this [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1845.04s)]
*  lifetime, for sure, because you're absolutely right in the way you analyzed the Israeli intentions [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1855.12s)]
*  and possibilities under Trump. By the way, not only under Trump, but don't just give it to Trump. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1860.24s)]
*  Yeah, of course. Yeah, you're right. There are other political forces in the globe that help it. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1865.28s)]
*  But the Palestinians are not alone. That is important. These global forces are not only [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1874.48s)]
*  representing carte blanche for Israel to do what he wants. They also represent injustices in many [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1880.24s)]
*  other fields, including in their own countries. So there is a potential for a much stronger alliance [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1887.76s)]
*  that Palestine just epitomizes it, but it's not alone. Because you alluded to that, the Israeli [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1894.48s)]
*  propaganda presentation of the only democracy in the Middle East. I interviewed Arthur Kassif, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1902.08s)]
*  who is a very courageous Jewish Israeli politician in Hadash. Of course, I know you've been involved [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1908.16s)]
*  in, you've stood for election under the Hadash banner. They're the leftist alliance of Jewish and [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1912.88s)]
*  Arab Palestinian citizens of Israel. But I mean, I want to put one this by, I mean, in terms of [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1919.5200000000002s)]
*  where Israel is heading and see what you think about this, because he was talking about fascism. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1925.2s)]
*  He just talked about fascism. He fears for his life. He says, you know, he talks about [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1928.5600000000002s)]
*  the possibility of having to flee Israel. That's what he talked about with me. But I wonder in [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1933.44s)]
*  terms of this, if this is almost what you're alluding to, and see if this analogy works at [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1938.64s)]
*  all. Because in climate science, there's this idea of a hot house effect, where temperature rises, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1944.24s)]
*  get to a point where it becomes exponential. There's a theory that's what happened to Venus. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1949.6000000000001s)]
*  Venus is this hot house where it's possibly hot, the atmosphere is so thick. Now, I'm wondering [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1955.1200000000001s)]
*  if that's the process, the analogous process with the Israeli state, that you get this process of [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1961.2s)]
*  radicalization, where it gets more and more, there's the internal dynamic with nothing to stop it, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1966.64s)]
*  radicalizes and radicalizes and radicalizes it until it consumes the whole project and that it [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1973.1200000000001s)]
*  collapses and becomes completely and utterly unsustainable. I mean, is that what it is? Is [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1978.64s)]
*  there a hot house effect of fascist radicalization happening in Israel at the moment? [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1982.0800000000002s)]
*  Yes, and I think it is. And like Ofir, I also fear for my life, but I'm 70 years old, so I'm going to [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1987.2800000000002s)]
*  stay where I want to stay. But I would say that this is exactly what characterizes such a fascist [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=1995.76s)]
*  regime in the making, or maybe is already there, is Ofir claims, that everybody becomes an enemy. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2007.2s)]
*  Not just the Palestinians, the secular Jews become the enemy. The reform Jews become the enemy. I [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2015.76s)]
*  mean, they're going to swallow and consume everyone apart from those who they think are totally [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2023.68s)]
*  supporting their messianic neo-Zionist vision of a fascist Israel that is feared by its neighbors [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2031.76s)]
*  and has put, has expunged the whole Palestinian issue out of history and out of geography. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2039.52s)]
*  And this is not going to work. This is not going to work because there is a limit to how far you [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2046.72s)]
*  can go, especially with the origins of this project, that at least its founders believe that [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2053.68s)]
*  had material help is not enough, that you need moral legitimacy for its existence. Now, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2062.16s)]
*  this moral legitimacy has been seriously eroded. These particular politicians and leaders do not [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2068.88s)]
*  think moral legitimacy, international moral legitimacy, is important anymore. That is true, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2076.7999999999997s)]
*  and that's why they have no inhibitions in what they're going to do. I'm not sure that this is [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2083.68s)]
*  the zeitgeist that we live in, that really you can totally ignore that kind of thing. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2089.6s)]
*  After all, there are other rogue states in the world, and we tend to forget that some of these [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2096.72s)]
*  rogue states do suffer from sanctions, do suffer from isolation. And we are not sure that this is [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2103.28s)]
*  going to be something sustainable just because there is this belief that you don't care about [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2112.1600000000003s)]
*  the moral legitimacy or because there are, as we talked before, this kind of political movements [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2118.7200000000003s)]
*  and leaders in the world who don't care about moral validity as well. I do agree that they exist, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2124.2400000000002s)]
*  and they are probably preventing us from finishing this project sooner rather than later. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2131.12s)]
*  But in the end of the world, I do believe and I feel connected to so many movements [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2138.3199999999997s)]
*  of change in the world, especially among the younger generation, that I refuse to accept [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2146.56s)]
*  that the current situation is fatalistic, that there's nothing we can do. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2154.4s)]
*  If we believe that we can do something, then we can do something about Palestine as well. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2161.3599999999997s)]
*  This is closely connected. I mean, if you want a better Britain in terms of your universal values, [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2165.52s)]
*  your economic, social, cultural values, if you believe that it could be more just Britain and [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2173.7599999999998s)]
*  so on, if you think the Labour Party is not really representing these values as much as one hoped for, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2180.3199999999997s)]
*  then you should be also hopeful about Palestine. Things are interconnected. They're very [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2187.44s)]
*  interconnected. Sometimes it's more complex, but on the other hand, it shows you that even if you, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2192.32s)]
*  Palestinians understandably, would feel totally alone and isolated, they're much less alone and [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2199.44s)]
*  isolated than maybe they can realize in this terrible condition in which they experience right now. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2205.28s)]
*  I mean, we will end on hope, by the way, I promise. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2211.52s)]
*  Okay, great. So many of these conversations end with despair. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2215.84s)]
*  I know exactly, and that has happened a lot. I even managed to get in Levin the other week [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2221.7599999999998s)]
*  and I managed him to say some hopeful things, so maybe there is hope after all. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2226.32s)]
*  That's unique because he's exactly the pessimist. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2229.7599999999998s)]
*  Obviously a huge fan of his, but it was heartening to hear him talking about hopeful things. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2235.52s)]
*  Before I do that, I guess, you know, genocidal fervour, I'm not quite sure, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2241.2s)]
*  genocidal mania, I'm often described it. I'm interested in this in a historical context and [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2247.8399999999997s)]
*  how many precedents there are for it. I interview so many courageous Jewish-Israeli [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2251.7599999999998s)]
*  figures on this channel and we'll keep doing so. You're courageous because you're at present [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2259.6s)]
*  isolated and the polling is bleak, if I'm honest. I mean, you know, some polls show [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2264.96s)]
*  about half, you know, there's a 50-50 split amongst Jewish-Israelis between those who think [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2270.2400000000002s)]
*  enough firepower has been used in Gaza and the other half think not enough has been used, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2275.04s)]
*  about 60% consistently opposing all humanitarian aid being allowed into Gaza, which would mean [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2280.08s)]
*  everybody dying in brutal terms. What I'm interested in is, I guess, the ingredients here, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2285.2s)]
*  I often think about Serb nationalism in Bosnia as one parallel because Serbs were victims in the [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2293.7599999999998s)]
*  war. They were the victims of genocide. The StarSeeder Croatian collaborators, I mean, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2299.7599999999998s)]
*  the Nazis thought they were too extreme in some ways. And they also suffered atrocities in the [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2305.6s)]
*  Bosnian war. And they fused that sense of victimhood, which had a basis, it wasn't fictional, [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2311.6s)]
*  with a sense of superiority as well, that they were superior to the Bosniaks, for example. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2316.56s)]
*  Now, I mean, in this situation, you have that, you know, because Jewish people have been for [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2321.3599999999997s)]
*  2000 years persecuted, culminating within living memory, of course, of the Shoah, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2325.8399999999997s)]
*  the extermination of six million Jews, two-thirds of Europe's population in a very [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2330.0s)]
*  short space of time. So that victimhood is real. And then you have the settler colonialism and [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2334.3999999999996s)]
*  the mentality settler colonialism generates in many different contexts. You have, as well, [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2342.24s)]
*  you have impunity, I suppose, which is an extra, maybe a different... The Bosnian Serbs didn't have [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2350.48s)]
*  impunity, did they? Actually, you know, I mean, there was military intervention. Is that... What [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2356.64s)]
*  do you think? I mean, I'm just interested in how... Are those the kind of unique ingredients which [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2362.56s)]
*  have conspired to create the grounds for what are, you know, because only 2% of any society [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2366.88s)]
*  of sociopaths, it's not like most people have this power of empathy, which is eliminated by [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2374.3199999999997s)]
*  dehumanization. And that dehumanization of Palestinians is extremely widespread. I'm wondering, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2380.56s)]
*  is it... How unprecedented is that, what we're looking at in Israel? And is it actually, do you [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2385.04s)]
*  think it's impunity added in to those different other ingredients which you have seen in other [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2389.6s)]
*  societies? I think that the phenomenon itself of dehumanization in Israel is not unique. No. I mean, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2394.56s)]
*  it's an extreme example because it is kind of a double dose of dehumanization. It's a fusion of [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2403.52s)]
*  romantic nationalism, which is always a variant of nationalism that totally dehumanizes anyone who [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2411.44s)]
*  does not belong to the nation ever since this kind of brand of nationalism emerged in Europe in the [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2417.36s)]
*  mid-90s century, together with settler colonialism, which, of course, dehumanizes from the very [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2423.36s)]
*  beginning of its encounter with any indigenous native population. The native population is part [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2429.12s)]
*  of its wish to displace and replace the local people. So you have kind of a double dose here, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2434.7999999999997s)]
*  if you want, of dehumanization. I think what is unique is not so much the dehumanization itself, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2440.7999999999997s)]
*  and which is reflected, as you rightly said, in the polls of support for the war, or even the [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2447.3599999999997s)]
*  wish to stop the war not because it is a dehumanized war, but because they believe it might [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2454.08s)]
*  lead to the release of the hostages, or they don't want to see many more soldiers killed or whatever. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2460.16s)]
*  But the main motive is not the suffering of the Palestinians here. I think what is unique, and I [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2466.64s)]
*  cannot find an example, and actually comes out in your attempt to compare it to Bosnia, is the [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2472.7200000000003s)]
*  international exceptionalism, that dehumanization. You know, you hear philosophers of morality, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2481.68s)]
*  especially in places like France, the United States, and Germany, people who I have known for [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2489.68s)]
*  years, and I really respected their writing, their contribution to articulating what is humanity, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2494.96s)]
*  what is morality, and so on. And they forget their own value system, their own preachings when they [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2503.76s)]
*  talk about Israel. It's quite remarkable. It's like they become total idiots when they talk about [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2512.48s)]
*  Israel and Palestine, as if anything they themselves have written about, preached about, is not [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2518.1600000000003s)]
*  relevant to the case of Israel, as if they fear to say the word Jewish racism, for instance, in this [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2524.32s)]
*  connection. And I think that kind of immunity for the dehumanization is unique, is very unique, and [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2532.24s)]
*  of course it contributes to the dehumanization itself, because if you are not condemned for you [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2542.24s)]
*  dehumanizing the Palestinians, there's very little incentive to stop it. And I think that was a great [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2548.56s)]
*  shock for the Israelis, what happened in the ICJ and the ICC. And still, if you read the Israeli [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2556.56s)]
*  analysis of the ICJ and the ICC, they say this is nothing new. This is part of this new anti-Semitism, [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2562.88s)]
*  which luckily we have powerful friends from the United States to Britain and other places [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2572.56s)]
*  that would make sure that this is an insignificant development. And of course, when the United States [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2579.68s)]
*  threatens the ICC, in particular after it issued the arrest warrant for Netanyahu, they feel [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2586.96s)]
*  that this is validated in their approach. So the dehumanization itself was there, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2593.68s)]
*  maybe hidden because of this international exceptionalism. But those of us who were born [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2602.0s)]
*  here, like myself, who were part of the educational system here, we're always aware of it, that this is [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2608.32s)]
*  the way every generation of Israeli graduates from the mainstream school system can only have [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2614.96s)]
*  this kind of perspective on Palestinians, totally dehumanization. And when these young people go [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2624.8s)]
*  through the army, it increases even because you have the power to translate dehumanization [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2633.44s)]
*  into actual killing and elimination, actual elimination. And that's what we have seen, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2641.12s)]
*  not only in Gaza, we keep forgetting how many young people and children and women were killed [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2646.56s)]
*  by the Israelis in the West Bank, how many of them were killed during the Nakba and so on. So [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2652.4s)]
*  it has been there for 76 years. It just became more extreme. And yet again, the most important [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2658.08s)]
*  part of it is the Western attitude towards it rather than the essence of it. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2666.4s)]
*  Let's talk about hope. And you talked before actually about what we could almost describe [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2673.92s)]
*  as a great divergence going on in the global Jewish community, because there are as many [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2680.1600000000003s)]
*  Jewish people in the United States around as there are in Israel. I mean, they've got almost the same [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2686.7200000000003s)]
*  Jewish population, obviously, it's not concentrated in the Israelis, but you see what I mean. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2691.92s)]
*  And you alluded to this in the polling. The polling six months ago found 30% of Jewish Americans [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2698.8s)]
*  think Israel is committing genocide. And it found 40% of Jewish Americans under the age of 45 [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2705.6800000000003s)]
*  thought that Israel was committing genocide. And even polling with even younger Jewish Americans [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2713.28s)]
*  also finds even more damning results. We've seen Jewish Americans at the forefront of solidarity [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2718.72s)]
*  movements with Palestine. I mean, do you think that's, I mean, it's interesting, isn't it? [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2724.7999999999997s)]
*  Because what's happened, I mean, traditionally, Jewish Americans have always been a very [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2728.64s)]
*  relatively progressive demographic. I'm not saying the Democrats are obviously left-wing party, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2731.8399999999997s)]
*  but they've consistently rejected the Republicans in every election. After World War II, there was [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2736.16s)]
*  the leftist candidate, they were the most likely then again to support that particular candidate. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2742.08s)]
*  So there's always been this Jewish progressive tradition in the United States, which has always [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2747.04s)]
*  existed. But do you think this is significant in that, you know, because obviously amongst [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2750.64s)]
*  younger Jewish Americans, they're having a different perspective, because often older [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2754.48s)]
*  American, Jewish Americans kind of have this progressive view of Israel, don't they? They [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2759.68s)]
*  still hark back to that idea. I mean, do you think that's a potential existential threat? Because I [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2765.2s)]
*  think Gideon Levy, for example, when I speak to him, the hope he often thinks is that something's [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2770.4s)]
*  got to give American public opinion shifting, but notably Jewish American public opinion shifting, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2775.36s)]
*  and that's what matters. I think it's, you know, I look at this whole process of what I call the [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2780.08s)]
*  beginning of the end, as a process that has discrete processes, that some of them have not [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2786.7200000000003s)]
*  much in common, but one day, I think will fuse into a very powerful, transformative event. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2794.48s)]
*  And I talk about these processes like cracks, extensive cracks in the foundation of the building. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2800.96s)]
*  One of these extensive cracks is what you have just described about the Jewish community. It's [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2807.44s)]
*  not the only one. I don't think you can bring down a set of colonial projects, but just one of these [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2812.64s)]
*  processes. These processes have to meet together in one historical, has happened in South Africa, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2818.8s)]
*  in one historical moment, that some of the circumstances of that moment have nothing to do [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2824.88s)]
*  with your activism. Sometimes things happen that seem unrelated and happen. So that's just in [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2830.0s)]
*  general. But yeah, more focus. Indeed, it is very important. And I would say something to these polls [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2835.2s)]
*  and statistics. I think sometimes they hide an important fact, not by intention, but because [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2841.68s)]
*  the nature of this profession. When you have these high numbers, you have to understand that this is [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2847.36s)]
*  not just 40% and 30%. Most people who are American Jews do not deal with political issues in the [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2853.92s)]
*  public domain. It means that if you had an ability to find out what is the percentage among Jews [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2862.4s)]
*  who are willing not just to take care of their own life, who really think that there is some bigger [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2870.48s)]
*  causes in their own life, for which they are willing to be a part of, willing even to sacrifice [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2875.44s)]
*  a career, connection with a family in the community, want to be active in it, I think the [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2882.56s)]
*  percentage is far higher. I mean, if you take it, whoever is willing to be an activist under the age [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2889.52s)]
*  of 45, among the American Jews, you know, 50, definitely 30 years ago, the vast majority would [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2895.12s)]
*  do it on behalf of Israel. Today, the vast majority of them would do it on behalf of Palestine. And [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2903.6s)]
*  that's a fundamental change. And some of these people might be the senators and the representatives [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2909.44s)]
*  or the mainstream journalists of the future. We don't know. We don't know what happens to them [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2917.04s)]
*  when they enjoy the corridors of power. But there is a big potential here. But as I said, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2921.2000000000003s)]
*  by itself, this is not enough. I think the isolation in the community, the internal implosion [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2929.44s)]
*  of Israel from within economically and socially, I'm still not convinced about the invincibility of [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2937.44s)]
*  the Israeli armies. Everybody is now. And I'm not sure that we have seen the end of the revolutionary [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2943.52s)]
*  forces in the Arab world. And all of that together with a possibility of a new generation of [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2951.12s)]
*  Palestinians who would lead the Palestinian liberation movement in a more unified, a more [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2957.92s)]
*  representative, a more democratic way, which is a very, there's a good possibility for that happening [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2964.88s)]
*  as well. If you look at the younger generation, all these together, I think, means that this dark [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2971.04s)]
*  moment, Palestinians may find it difficult to believe, but I think they are, as I said in the [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2977.84s)]
*  beginning of our conversation, they are at the end of the worst chapter in their history that [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2983.92s)]
*  began in 1948. And I think we are reaching the beginning of a better chapter, but we are not [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2989.76s)]
*  there yet. Undoubtedly, we're not there yet. And we are all not onlookers on that. We can each, [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=2997.76s)]
*  individually and collectively, contribute to that new chapter beginning sooner rather than later. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3003.6800000000003s)]
*  My final question actually is linked to that. And it could be hopeful or despairing, I suppose, [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3010.8s)]
*  depending on how you look at it. Is that for me, it was actually said by the US service personnel [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3016.32s)]
*  who self-immolated early this year, Aaron Bushell. And he said, many of us like to ask ourselves, [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3024.0s)]
*  what would I do if I was alive during slavery or the Jim Crow South or apartheid? What would I do [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3034.7200000000003s)]
*  if my country was committing genocide? The answer is, you're doing it right now. And for me, part of [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3039.2000000000003s)]
*  me thinks, well, look, this crime is so obscene, so depraved, just so confessed to, so evidenced [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3045.12s)]
*  that I've never lived through something talking about the complicity of the West, because obviously [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3053.52s)]
*  lots of other crimes have happened in my life, but they've been accepted as crimes. I mean, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3060.24s)]
*  Rwanda is accepted as it is, it's not the same. But to go through where Western fingerprints are [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3064.72s)]
*  all over it, it's so obvious to me that surely this has to go down in history as just a great [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3069.6s)]
*  one of the great crimes of our age. But then I think, well, that's either we're going to have [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3074.72s)]
*  that and if we don't, it's because the future of the West is fascist barbarism. And in which [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3083.12s)]
*  ways we've got bigger things as well, I'm afraid, to worry about. And I'm just wondering what you [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3089.12s)]
*  think about that, because part of me thinks this could just be a foreshadow, actually. I mean, [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3093.2799999999997s)]
*  some people worry about that. And that's why the far right look at Israel actually as something [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3098.24s)]
*  to aspire to. They see it as the front line of Western civilization against the Muslim [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3103.6s)]
*  hordes and barbarians. You see the exporting of technology, by the way, elsewhere and the rise of [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3109.2s)]
*  various right-wing authoritarian movies. I just wonder what you think about that in terms of where [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3114.56s)]
*  we're heading, because it seems so obvious that, I mean, from a historical perspective, you kind of [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3117.8399999999997s)]
*  think, well, obviously history has to record it for what it is. But what's your sense of what, [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3122.16s)]
*  you know, that's an open-ended question. Interpret as you wish. Yeah, I think there are two aspects [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3127.04s)]
*  I can kind of respond to. One, when we think about Bushmel and people like himself, I think what was [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3132.48s)]
*  very characteristic of him was that he did not get his information on what was going on in Palestine [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3139.2s)]
*  from the main American media. That he needed the alternative media as a source of information [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3146.24s)]
*  that helped him to form the very desperate but courageous moral position, which is an important [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3153.84s)]
*  aspect to think about, the role of the alternative media and the lack of confidence. And you've just [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3161.6s)]
*  written a brilliant article on this on the BBC. There is a great crisis of confidence [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3166.96s)]
*  in the mainstream media in the West, which I think we're still not appreciating how it will [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3175.84s)]
*  play out in the future. But it will play out in the future when people would say, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3182.8s)]
*  we don't trust them on Palestine, and we don't trust them also on other issues. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3187.12s)]
*  And that is something very important that, of course, can play a very positive role in it. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3191.8399999999997s)]
*  As for the right-wing part of what I call the Global Israel Alliance, or the alliance of [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3199.2799999999997s)]
*  maintaining the political system as they are today, I don't know, from an historical perspective, [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3205.92s)]
*  the right was always strong when the left was unable to unite. The right by itself, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3212.4s)]
*  I don't think is that strong, as people put it. It is always strong when the left is [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3218.48s)]
*  not talking in a clear voice, forgets its own universal values, and it tends to be purist, [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3226.4s)]
*  and forgets about pragmatism in order to create powerful alliances. Look at Kamala Harris, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3235.92s)]
*  was an example of the first one. Not very clear what is the alternative and so on. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3242.4s)]
*  She had no chance against a populist leader. I think Bernie Sanders would have done much better [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3248.8s)]
*  than Kamala Harris in America. Secondly, look at the second round of the French elections. What [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3254.48s)]
*  happened when the left had put aside, unfortunately for not too long, but had put aside its descent [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3263.04s)]
*  and defeated the extreme right in France. I think this is a lesson for us all that when we are [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3272.56s)]
*  dealing with existential issues, and the issue in Palestine is existential, and as I say, I don't [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3280.88s)]
*  think it's just existential for the Palestinians. It's existential for many other people. We need [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3286.48s)]
*  to be able to create the alliances that, by the way, I saw in the demonstration in London when I [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3292.48s)]
*  joined another one million people. You have the Muslim community, you have the left, you have the [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3299.6s)]
*  liberals, all united under this one issue. And of course, they have their own disagreements on some [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3305.12s)]
*  issues, which I don't underrate and don't regard as unimportant, but they knew the demonstration was [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3312.7999999999997s)]
*  a manifestation of what is important and what is less important right now. And I think that kind of [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3321.68s)]
*  alliances that work so well in the solidarity movement in the streets should now be part of the [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3328.72s)]
*  action in politics from above as well in order to be able to deal with this, because with these kinds [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3335.44s)]
*  of alliances, you will find out, and that's my assessment, that populism, fascism, and extreme [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3345.2799999999997s)]
*  right-wing politics are not as attractive as we believe it is because they just enter a void [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3351.52s)]
*  that someone else can still fill. So I think there's a lot of thinking to be done about how do we deal [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3360.64s)]
*  with the essence of politics and what is the new role of the left in turning the struggle against [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3366.96s)]
*  the essence of politics into a more effective struggle that would have also, of course, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3373.52s)]
*  implications for the situation in Palestine. I have to say, it was surprisingly heart-wrenching. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3379.68s)]
*  I wasn't expecting that. But also full of nuance, full of wisdom. Obviously, your [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3385.8399999999997s)]
*  encyclopaedic knowledge of this whole area shines through as ever, and it's been such an honour. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3391.9199999999996s)]
*  I know, I can anticipate the responses we'll get. People will be so appreciative of what you have [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3398.3999999999996s)]
*  to say and provocative in the best possible way as well. So for those who are watching, please do [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3404.08s)]
*  share this video. Press like, press subscribe, leave your comments. Good for the algorithm. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3408.64s)]
*  More people watch and engage and listen, which is the point, of course. Bitilan, honestly, [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3411.68s)]
*  such an honour. And thanks as ever for your incredible insight. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3416.72s)]
*  Thank you, Owen. I really enjoyed this conversation. Thank you very much for having me. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16EjsiOyb_s&t=3419.52s)]
