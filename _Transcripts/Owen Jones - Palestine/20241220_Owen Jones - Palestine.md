# BBC In CIVIL WAR Over Gaza Exclusive
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [December 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM)
*  The BBC is in civil war over its coverage of Israel and Palestine, with journalists [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=0.0s)]
*  there at breaking point because of their outrage at what they regard as systematic pro-Israel [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=5.68s)]
*  propaganda at the corporation. That's a finding of my new detailed investigation into the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=12.08s)]
*  BBC for the brilliant drop site news. It's based on the testimony of 13 BBC journalists [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=17.28s)]
*  on a huge amount of research and the crucial work of two data journalists who I worked [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=24.02s)]
*  with. Do go read the piece at dropsitenews.com. Fundamentally, the BBC journalists emphasised [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=29.5s)]
*  this is a systemic problem. At one editorial meeting in November 2023, when there were [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=39.54s)]
*  lively heated disagreements in an effort to regain control, Deborah Turness, the CEO of [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=43.78s)]
*  BBC News, declared, we've got to all remember this all started on the 7th of October. That [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=48.74s)]
*  was a furious response from BBC staff. Lillian Lander, the former head of the BBC World Service, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=55.900000000000006s)]
*  disagreed, pointing to the decades of Israeli occupation before the 7th of October. She [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=61.260000000000005s)]
*  said, no, I'm going to have to say that's not the case and I'm sure that's not how [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=66.62s)]
*  you meant to phrase it. I know all this happened because it was corroborated by more than one [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=70.9s)]
*  BBC journalist who was present. Now, as I was working on the piece, more examples kept [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=74.84s)]
*  coming up. I was leaked to the WhatsApp conversation of multiple BBC correspondents and producers [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=80.94s)]
*  and editors in the Middle East. They're known as the big dogs by BBC management. When the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=88.98s)]
*  Amnesty report concluded Israel had committed genocide, when that was released, not only [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=95.06s)]
*  the beginning of this month, one of those correspondents noted how the strapline on [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=101.1s)]
*  the BBC was, Israel rejects fabricated claims of genocide. One journalist there said, FFS, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=105.22s)]
*  it's an open goal for those who say we're fritz of upsetting the Israelis and keep on [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=112.82s)]
*  couching our stories in an Israel says narrative. Fritz means afraid. As one BBC journalist [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=116.9s)]
*  put it to me, these are established senior correspondents and it's even bothering them. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=122.66s)]
*  Now the BBC came back to me and said, we take feedback on our coverage seriously, but criticism [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=127.82s)]
*  of BBC output based on a single screenshot taken during a few seconds of coverage or [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=132.04s)]
*  on false assertions that topics haven't been covered when they have is invalid and disingenuous. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=136.84s)]
*  It's quite funny. Their correspondence there disingenuous. Now there was another strapline [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=141.32s)]
*  news that day Amnesty International accuses Israel of genocide, but the BBC kept the report [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=146.76s)]
*  from its main programmes. It was on radio stations, but journalists note the report [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=152.04s)]
*  was not covered at all on the BBC's flagship news programmes. BBC One's News at One, News [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=156.0s)]
*  at Six, News at Ten, Newsnight, the flagship current affairs programme on BBC Two. Now [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=161.04s)]
*  according to broadcast regulator Ofcom, BBC One is the most frequented news source in [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=166.67999999999998s)]
*  Britain. On the 5th of December, the day the Amnesty report was released, 3.7 million viewers [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=172.2s)]
*  tuned into the BBC News at Six alone. The news channel attracts only a small fraction [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=177.32s)]
*  of the audience. So the vast majority of BBC viewers just would not have come across the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=182.23999999999998s)]
*  report. And on the BBC website itself, the report only appeared 12 hours after the embargo [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=185.36s)]
*  was lifted as the seventh item in order of importance. But then the BBC failed to put [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=191.24s)]
*  it in the Israel Gaza tab at the top of the website. That's always there for people to [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=196.16000000000003s)]
*  click on. And that meant the traffic was massively reduced. The BBC tell me that was a mistake. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=199.36s)]
*  Well, an unfortunate mistake. One BBC journalist said that was desperate, by the way. I want [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=204.56s)]
*  to explain how this piece came about. I was first contacted by a BBC journalist about [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=209.32000000000002s)]
*  the killing of Mohammed Baha in July. He was a 24 year old Palestinian man with Down [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=213.12s)]
*  syndrome and autism. He needed round the clock care from his family. He was terrified and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=217.88s)]
*  traumatised by an Israeli onslaught he didn't understand. On 3rd of July, the Israeli military [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=222.52s)]
*  raided his home and as the family begged for mercy, the Israeli army set their dog on this [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=227.6s)]
*  24 year old man with Down syndrome and autism as he begged for it to stop. This injured [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=232.8s)]
*  young man was put in a separate room and locked away while the family were driven away at [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=237.96s)]
*  gunpoint. They eventually returned a week later. They found his decomposing body. Now [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=242.0s)]
*  the Middle East I correctly headline this Palestinian with Down syndrome left to die [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=248.32s)]
*  by Israeli soldiers after combat dog attack. The Independent covered it with Gaza man with [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=252.88s)]
*  Down syndrome mauled by Israeli attack dog and left to die, family says. The BBC's [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=258.84s)]
*  original headline, the lonely death of Gaza man with Down syndrome. What the BBC journalist [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=264.24s)]
*  talked me through was a constant framing of stories on terms favourable to Israel. When [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=270.0s)]
*  the IDF killed a 16 year old Palestinian girl, it was all framed in pro-Israel terms. The headline, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=275.36s)]
*  Israel says likely killed Palestinian girl in error. The first paragraph, Israel says its forces [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=279.76s)]
*  appear to have unintentionally killed a 16 year old Palestinian girl amid a gun battle with [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=286.08s)]
*  militants in the Occupy West Bank. Can you imagine if it was the other way around? Can you imagine a [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=290.92s)]
*  16 year old Israeli girl who'd been killed by Palestinian militants? What do you think they [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=295.92s)]
*  frame the headline? Palestinian militants say they likely killed Israeli girl in error. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=300.24s)]
*  Palestinian militants say their forces appear to have unintentionally killed a 16 year old [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=305.6s)]
*  Israeli girl. Oh, come on. Obviously, you know that wouldn't happen. It didn't even feature a picture [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=310.8s)]
*  of the victim like say stories about young Israelis being killed. Correctly, you should humanise [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=314.8s)]
*  victims, but they didn't. Why? When a far right Israeli rally marched through Jerusalem, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=319.52s)]
*  chants such as deaths to Arabs in Meir Villageburn were deleted from the coverage [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=324.72s)]
*  until an outcry forced them to be reinstated. When it comes, for example, to the famine in Gaza, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=329.68s)]
*  the BBC routinely strips away how Israel has deliberately blocked aid from getting in. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=334.72s)]
*  When, for example, NASA hospital was stormed, it was again framed in pro-Israel terms, which presented [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=339.44000000000005s)]
*  it as some sort of anti-terror operation that was an Israeli narrative that was foregrounded. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=345.28000000000003s)]
*  Now, the fact is the evidence backs up the assertions. There's so many examples, by the way, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=349.92s)]
*  the brilliant data journalist Dana Najjar and Jan Litava, who I worked with, found that there [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=354.0s)]
*  was far more coverage proportionally for Israeli deaths than Palestinian deaths. Their graph found [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=358.72s)]
*  one major spike of mentions for Palestinian deaths in early April this year. The reasons for this are [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=363.68s)]
*  absolutely chilling. On the 1st of April, Israeli drones targeted a three car convoy belonging to [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=368.8s)]
*  the NGO World Central Kitchen, which was transferring food to a warehouse in northern Gaza after [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=374.64s)]
*  coordinating its movements with Israeli military authorities. Because six of the seven slain aid [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=379.92s)]
*  workers were Westerners, their killings received widespread Western media attention. The seventh [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=384.8s)]
*  worker killed in the attack was a Palestinian driver named Safeddin Abu Taha. In each of the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=389.68s)]
*  numerous BBC articles about the killing of the group, he's referred to as their Palestinian colleague [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=395.36s)]
*  or the Palestinian driver. Because of this, mentions of Palestinian deaths surged. As the [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  researchers told me, it's the single largest spike in the whole period in terms of the mentions of [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=406.32s)]
*  the deaths of Palestinians. Even then, Safeddin Abu Taha is very rarely mentioned directly, often [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=410.71999999999997s)]
*  only in association with the Western majority white group. Now there's a huge amount in the piece, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=416.71999999999997s)]
*  including about allegations made by staff about the, as I mentioned before, the BBC's online Middle [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=421.76s)]
*  East editor, Rafi Berg. And the BBC came back and said, the allegations you've made fundamentally [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=426.88s)]
*  misdescribed this person's role and misunderstand the way the BBC works. More broadly, we reject any [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=432.16s)]
*  suggestion of a lenient stance towards either side in this conflict. The Israel-Gaza conflict [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=438.88000000000005s)]
*  is a challenging and polarizing subject to cover, but when asked to choose the one provider they [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=443.76000000000005s)]
*  would turn to for impartial reporting on this story. Three times as many picked the BBC as choose our [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=447.84000000000003s)]
*  closest competitor. The BBC remains the world's most trusted international news source. Well, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=452.48s)]
*  you have to read the piece to see what the allegations are and why the BBC staff reject them. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=457.76s)]
*  The BBC argument is that basically I'm overstating, in the case of Rafi Berg, his role and his [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=463.03999999999996s)]
*  influence. That's his claim. The claim of the BBC, that's what they say. Now what I would say is I [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=467.2s)]
*  put in a vast amount of work and time. I spoke to obviously 13 BBC staff, overwhelmingly still there. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=472.0s)]
*  They corroborated their accounts. I saw the evidence. Obviously it all got legalled by a [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=478.56s)]
*  lawyer I hired and then by drop site news lawyers. You have to be completely [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=482.24s)]
*  above board in these situations. That's why it's taken so many months and sleepless nights. I want [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=487.68s)]
*  to do more of these investigations, obviously, but obviously it's time and resources. Before I end, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=492.56s)]
*  I just want to say one thing. This is one of the worst crimes of our age. The depravity, the sheer [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=497.68s)]
*  level of suffering, death, which has been deliberately consciously created with Western support [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=503.76s)]
*  and complicity and facilitation. Few crimes in history have been so confessed to as this. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=510.72s)]
*  No crime has been so documented as it actually happened. Now I know there are many journalists [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=516.1600000000001s)]
*  or the media outlets who are angry about the coverage that their outlets offer. They think [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=521.12s)]
*  it's a disgrace. They're right to think it's a disgrace. But I'd ask you to follow the example [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=526.32s)]
*  of these BBC journalists. Because do you want to be complicit in this crime? Because Western media [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=530.64s)]
*  outlets as a whole share the blame for what's happening. Given Israel is a client state of the [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=535.28s)]
*  West, if the Western media actually described this atrocity for what it actually is, it would stop. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=540.24s)]
*  So I'd ask this to all the Western journalists. Do you want to be complicit? Do you want to live [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=546.24s)]
*  with the shame for the rest of your life of knowing that you played a role in this barbarism by your [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=550.48s)]
*  failure to speak out? Because you'll never ever be able to scrub that shame away. I'll be blunt. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=554.5600000000001s)]
*  You will regret it in many cases of that, I'm sure. But that regret will be much too late. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=559.92s)]
*  Do something. Do something now. You might be scared of the consequences. Not like I haven't [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=564.5600000000001s)]
*  considered that. I'm not a robot. I'm tougher than I look, sure. Low bar. But it's not like [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=570.0s)]
*  I don't worry about these things. But do you know what? Do you know what? I'm not a Palestinian [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=574.88s)]
*  journalist trying to report on the truth of this historic abomination, knowing that any day, any [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=579.04s)]
*  minute could be my last, that I could be exterminated indeed alongside my entire family. That has been [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=583.04s)]
*  the fate of so many Palestinian journalists in the biggest slaughter of journalists in any conflict [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=588.16s)]
*  ever recorded. That's not the risk I'm facing. Whatever risks we face, it's nothing compared to [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=594.24s)]
*  what these Palestinian journalists are going through as they live through an unimaginable hell [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=600.9599999999999s)]
*  in an apocalyptic wasteland that Gaza's been reduced to. We have a privilege. We can speak out [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=606.56s)]
*  without desperately scrabbling for whatever food there is. No healthcare. The essentials of life [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=616.64s)]
*  deprived of us, having to grieve for so many, constantly in terror for our loved ones and [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6cqfMCCWuM&t=622.48s)]
