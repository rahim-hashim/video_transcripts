# UK LIES About Israel Arms Sales EXPOSED - w/. Dearbhla Minogue
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM)
*  So here's a really critical point. The British government continues to allow the sale of crucial [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=0.0s)]
*  components for F-35 jets, which are raining death and destruction on the people of Gaza, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=5.28s)]
*  and therefore that remains a key element of the genocide being perpetrated against the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=11.28s)]
*  Palestinian people in Gaza. Now, there is a crucial court case about this at the moment, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=17.6s)]
*  because the British government is basically playing every trick possible to deflect from [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=23.12s)]
*  their criminal liability, their criminal complicity in this genocide, and coming up with excuses for [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  why they can't stop. For example, providing components for those F-35 jets. It should be [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=37.44s)]
*  noted they only suspended 8% of arms deals a few months ago, which they did in the most apologetic [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=42.32s)]
*  way possible, and they're still emphasizing that Israel remains, to quote one minister, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=48.56s)]
*  a friend and an ally. Now, I'm really pleased, really very, very pleased indeed, to be joined [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  by Derville Minogue, who is a lawyer who is working with Global Legal Action Network and Bindmans [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=58.72s)]
*  on a court case. So the British government are being taken to court over these components for [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=65.44s)]
*  F-35 jets. And honestly, the excuses and circular logic they are resorting to is frankly ridiculous, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=72.24s)]
*  and honestly, you're going to have to just brace yourself for this. Derville, firstly, thanks so [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=81.52s)]
*  much for joining us. How you doing? I'm good, thank you. Thanks so much for having me. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=86.16s)]
*  I just want to start by doing a little clip of our beloved Prime Minister Sikhi Astama in the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=90.32s)]
*  House of Commons when he was challenged about these components for F-35 jets. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=96.56s)]
*  If the Prime Minister agrees that the Israeli government starving children to death is monstrous, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=103.28s)]
*  why does he think it's okay for the UK to continue to sell Israel the equipment for the fighter jets [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=109.12s)]
*  to drop bombs on these starving children? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=116.0s)]
*  The, what we contribute into a pot is parts for fighter jets. And if we were to stop that, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=122.64s)]
*  they couldn't be used by other countries in the other conflicts, including those in which we are [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=132.72s)]
*  involved. Doesn't know the detail at all. They're not sold directly, they go into a pot. If we were [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=138.64s)]
*  to stop that, they wouldn't then be available to others around the world who desperately need them [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=145.6s)]
*  in the conflicts they're engaged in. And that's why we won't do it. So basically, Keir Starmer is [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=150.0s)]
*  calling everyone thick for not understanding the complexities and why the government can't [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=154.79999999999998s)]
*  stop because of this pool. Can you just explain what was he talking about? And [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  does he have any point Keir Starmer? Absolutely. So what he's talking about is what's referred to [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=166.16s)]
*  as the F-35 carve out. So back in September 2024, the government was forced to accept that there [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=172.32s)]
*  was a clear risk that any weapons transferred from the UK to Israel would be used, or might be used [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=179.12s)]
*  to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law. That was what [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=185.84s)]
*  forced them to suspend the previous 30 licenses where the weapons in question were being transferred [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=191.2s)]
*  directly to Israel from companies in the UK. But they said that they needed to make an exception [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=196.88s)]
*  for F-35 parts which go into a global pool, which is run by the US government via two private [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=203.2s)]
*  companies. The reason they say they had to make an exception for the F-35 parts is because they, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=211.2s)]
*  the UK doesn't have any control over where those parts go and who they go to. So their essential [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=217.84s)]
*  argument is that if they stop supplying spare parts into the pool, it will mean that other NATO [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=224.24s)]
*  allies can't draw on the spare parts pool either and that F-35 jets globally will be grounded. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=229.68s)]
*  And therefore there's a massive risk to UK peace and security. There are a couple of major problems [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=236.48000000000002s)]
*  with this. First of all, the international legal conventions in question, the Genocide Convention, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=243.20000000000002s)]
*  the Geneva Convention, don't have a caveat which says unless you need to comply with an international [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=250.16s)]
*  supply chain, they say you can't facilitate war crimes and genocide full stop. If there was a [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=257.52s)]
*  national security exemption, you know, they wouldn't be worth the paper they're written on. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=263.36s)]
*  Another major problem is that the US government could separate out the parts if the UK government [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=268.88s)]
*  applied some leverage and said actually we're going to stop supplying this spare parts pool [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=277.28s)]
*  unless you can guarantee us that the parts are not going to go to Israel. They can go to anyone else, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=282.0s)]
*  just not Israel. They haven't done that. The US government is obviously a huge supporter of Israel. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=286.56s)]
*  So the supposed bind that the UK government is in is that they're weighing up this supply [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=295.12s)]
*  chain against essentially genocide of Palestinians. Can you explain the court case? What is the court [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=301.52s)]
*  case about the F-35 jets and where do things stand? Absolutely. So the strategic export licensing [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=306.64s)]
*  criteria are the national rules which govern when arms licenses can be granted. And it's unlawful [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=315.03999999999996s)]
*  under those rules to grant a license where there's a clear risk of a serious violation of IHL. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=321.76s)]
*  The government assessed that there was such a clear risk in the case of Israel because they had [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=327.84000000000003s)]
*  to accept that Israel was not committed to complying with IHL. So they decided that for [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=331.84000000000003s)]
*  the purposes of the F-35 carve out, they had to depart from the policy, the policy being the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=338.0s)]
*  criteria. The test under national law is whether there's a good reason to depart from the policy. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=344.0s)]
*  So they're essentially saying we've weighed up the risks to national peace and security and [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=351.2s)]
*  international peace and security against the risks to Palestinians. And we've said that [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=356.16s)]
*  international peace and security wins out. So one of the major issues is that the government [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=360.40000000000003s)]
*  hasn't actually calibrated and assessed the degree of risk to Palestinians. They've just said, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=366.32000000000005s)]
*  oh, there's a clear risk and we've weighed it all up and in the balance is better to keep NATO [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=371.36s)]
*  running essentially. Whereas actually, if they looked at all the evidence properly, they'd see [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=376.24s)]
*  that it's not just a risk, it's a certainty and it's not just violations of IHL, it's genocide. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=381.12s)]
*  So we've said you have to assess all of that and you haven't done so. Another major component is [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=386.08s)]
*  the fact that they say these transfers actually comply with international law, i.e. the genocide [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=392.24s)]
*  convention and the Geneva Conventions. And we say that's completely wrong. And finally, we have a [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=397.92s)]
*  ground of challenge which says actually it's unlawful as a matter of domestic law because [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=405.04s)]
*  what you're doing is facilitating crime under domestic law because individuals in the UK are [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=409.92s)]
*  transferring parts in the knowledge that the recipient is not committed to complying with [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=415.28000000000003s)]
*  international law. Just on that, let's just interrogate a bit more by throwing in the [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=421.04s)]
*  contribution of David Lammy, the Foreign Secretary, who suddenly had a shift in general tone, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=430.64s)]
*  suddenly describing Israel's behaviour as intolerable. But Zahra Sultana, who was a [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=435.12s)]
*  Labour MP but has had the whip suspended and not returned, in large part, I would say, because of [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=442.4s)]
*  speaking out about Palestine, she made the point that the government continues to arm Israel and [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=449.04s)]
*  actually its claims on that were not true. So let's just listen to that exchange. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=456.0s)]
*  Between October, December 2024, the government approved over £127 million in export licenses [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=461.28000000000003s)]
*  to Israel, exceeding the combined total under the Tories for 2020 to 2023. These licenses granted [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=468.56s)]
*  after the government's so-called temporary suspension include components for legal lethal [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=475.92s)]
*  F-35 fighter jets. Jets Israel is now flying at five times the usual rates, decimating Gaza. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=481.52s)]
*  Children are starving, families have been wiped out, hospitals destroyed. Yet the government in [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=488.56s)]
*  court claims that there is no evidence Israel targets civilians. The Foreign Secretary is [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=493.36s)]
*  personally responsible and refuses to ban all arms sales to this genocidal state. So like many [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=498.4s)]
*  across Britain, I have to ask the Foreign Secretary, how do you sleep at night? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=504.16s)]
*  Well, the Honourable Lady has raised figures that I don't recognise. She's raised once again the [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=508.32s)]
*  issue of arms sales to Israel. I banned arms sales that could be used in Gaza. I know that the Honourable [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=521.04s)]
*  Lady is keen on clickbait, but I'm not going to be banished from this dispatch box. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=531.12s)]
*  What do you make of what David Lammy said there in terms of responding about this being a clickbait [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=538.0s)]
*  and so on? I think it's really, really, it's a really bad faith move on the part of David Lammy [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=542.64s)]
*  because that is exactly the government's defence in this case when it comes to genocide, but also [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=549.92s)]
*  when it comes to findings of international humanitarian law breach. They have concocted [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=555.84s)]
*  this absolutely absurd methodology, which I mean, anybody who understands this methodology when [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=563.6s)]
*  it's explained to them can't actually believe that the government has come to court and said this. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=572.88s)]
*  What they say is that IHL, international humanitarian law, is not, you don't judge whether [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=577.68s)]
*  a violation of IHL has happened by looking at the consequences. So if you look at the consequences [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=586.8s)]
*  of an attack and you say this has killed 30 children, I don't know what Israel was aiming [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=592.9599999999999s)]
*  for in this attack. They could have been aiming for the head of Hamas and because I don't know that, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=598.3199999999999s)]
*  I can't know whether this is even a possible violation of IHL. And so that theoretically [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=604.96s)]
*  is correct because IHL is assessed from the point of view of the attacker. But if you then have a [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=612.16s)]
*  case of hundreds of thousands of attacks, which all have the same characteristics, killing children, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=617.76s)]
*  killing civilians, destroying all of the infrastructure in the entirety of Gaza, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=624.56s)]
*  all of the essential infrastructure, coupled with all of the statements being made by Israeli [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=630.08s)]
*  officials and soldiers, it's absolutely absurd to say, oh, well, we don't know what Israel's [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=635.12s)]
*  side of the story is for each individual incident, so we can't come to a conclusion on any of them. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=640.24s)]
*  And that's what they've said. They said they essentially have no conclusions on any single [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=646.32s)]
*  incident. And that includes incidents in which children, small children have been sniped in the [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=651.76s)]
*  head by Israeli snipers, old women being sniped in the head, demolitions of UNRWA [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=656.72s)]
*  facilities, demolitions of hospitals, all of these things. They just have no idea whether they even [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=663.6800000000001s)]
*  might have violated IHL. Not only that, but they have stacked their genocide assessment on top of [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=668.72s)]
*  that. So they've said, we don't agree with anybody who says there's a genocide going on. In fact, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=676.8000000000001s)]
*  Israel can't have genocidal intent because we don't have any evidence of them deliberately [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=683.44s)]
*  attacking civilians. And the reason they don't have evidence of them deliberately attacking [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=688.08s)]
*  civilians is because they don't know what Israel was thinking when it shot a two-year-old toddler [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=692.08s)]
*  in the head. So, and that is genuinely not any exaggeration on my part. That's their defense in [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=697.9200000000001s)]
*  this case. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=704.96s)]
*  I mean, just in terms of intent, because early on, I interviewed Raz Sigal, who is an Israeli [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=707.2s)]
*  American associate professor of genocide and Holocaust studies. And he said to me right [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=715.12s)]
*  towards the beginning, and this interview caused a big forore because Gary Lineker shared it, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=720.88s)]
*  in which Raz Sigal told me that it's extremely rare for intent to be so explicitly spoken, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=728.0s)]
*  that usually states committing grievous war crimes when the genocide go to great lengths to cover up [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=733.52s)]
*  their intent and issue denials. And you basically end up having to pull through documents and so [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=739.52s)]
*  on afterwards to try and work out intent because intent is the hardest element of genocide to [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=744.0799999999999s)]
*  establish everyone. You're the lawyer, you know that. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=748.48s)]
*  9th of October, 2023, Major General Ghassan Allian, an Israeli general who's in charge of the IDF's [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=751.52s)]
*  civilian arm, Kogat. They're in charge of, for example, in theory, humanitarian aid, that [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=759.76s)]
*  kind of thing. He said, Hamas became ISIS and the citizens of Gaza are celebrating instead of being [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=763.92s)]
*  horrified. Human animals are dealt with accordingly. Israel has imposed a toll blockade on Gaza, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=768.96s)]
*  no electricity, no water, just damage. You wanted hell, you will get hell. That was a video posted [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=774.48s)]
*  on Twitter and it was addressed to Hamas and the residents of Gaza. There's no pretense there. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=780.96s)]
*  The relevant Israeli general, he's made clear there's no demarcation between the civilian [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=789.92s)]
*  population and those they deem to be military targets. He's explicitly made clear that there [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=794.3199999999999s)]
*  will be collective punishment and that Israel will impose the withdrawal of the means of life [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=800.3199999999999s)]
*  on the Palestinian population for the means of obtaining vengeance. Hell, you will get hell. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=809.1999999999999s)]
*  There's so many of these statements, that's the problem, isn't there? Netanyahu's official position [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=816.8000000000001s)]
*  is Gaza will be empty to Palestinians. That's the official position of the Israeli government. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=822.32s)]
*  He said, for example, earlier this month, we're destroying more and more homes and [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=825.9200000000001s)]
*  Gazans have nowhere to return to. The only inevitable outcome will be the wish of [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=830.0s)]
*  Gazans to emigrate outside the Gaza Strip. He said that to the Foreign Affairs and Defense [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=834.8000000000001s)]
*  Committee, the Knesset, the Israeli government. As a lawyer, because lots of us think we're going [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=838.64s)]
*  mad going through this, because you just watch the most confessed and documented crime in history [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=843.04s)]
*  unfold live streamed. How is it possible legally for the British government to suggest they cannot [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=847.68s)]
*  work out the criminal and genocide intended by the Israeli government? How is it possible? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=857.28s)]
*  It feels like being gaslit. They're gaslighting the public and the claimant al-Haq in this case. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=864.48s)]
*  Their version of their analysis is that those statements, so if you look at the conduct, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=873.04s)]
*  you can't tell because each individual incident might have been justified or it could have been [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=878.0799999999999s)]
*  a mistake. With one exception, which was the World Central Kitchen attack, by the way, the only attack [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=882.24s)]
*  that killed white people in the entire genocide. That was a possible violation, the only one. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=888.3199999999999s)]
*  So individual attacks, they don't know and they have asked Israel in the beginning, and Israel said [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=894.0799999999999s)]
*  we're not going to tell you and they were okay with that as well. So that's all put to one side. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=899.28s)]
*  When it comes to the statements, so we said, okay, well, if you're not going to assess these [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=903.92s)]
*  individual incidents, then look at the statements where they say they're going to commit genocide. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=908.64s)]
*  They say they're going to commit war crimes. They're the most explicit statements you could [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=912.3199999999999s)]
*  possibly concoct. These are textbook genocidal statements. If you were teaching a class of law [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=916.4s)]
*  students and you were to say, hmm, what's an example of a genocidal statement? You'd say human [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=921.92s)]
*  animals. You'd say there's no uninvolved civilians. The Israeli president, just so people know that's [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=927.44s)]
*  the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, at the very beginning. Yeah. So the government says it's difficult [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=934.08s)]
*  to distinguish between statements that were essentially rhetoric for a domestic audience [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=942.0s)]
*  with ones that are reflective of Israeli policy on the ground. So they say, we just don't know if [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=947.2800000000001s)]
*  they really mean these statements. And they won't pair them with what Israel is actually doing on [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=953.44s)]
*  the ground either, because they can't really look at what Israel is doing on the ground because of [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=959.5200000000001s)]
*  this sort of black hole of theoretical IHL justification. And they say that also those [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=963.44s)]
*  statements weren't made necessarily by people with roles in what used to be the war cabinet. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=970.32s)]
*  So their argument is essentially those people don't have decision-making power who are making [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=976.4000000000001s)]
*  these problematic statements. But we filed in our case hundreds of pages of statements at all levels. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=981.04s)]
*  So all the way from Netanyahu up here to battalion commanders, brigade commanders, all the way [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=987.8399999999999s)]
*  down to foot soldiers in Gaza, all mirroring the exact same language, all conducting the exact same [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=994.56s)]
*  types of war crimes that are sort of signalled by these top level statements. And I agree with you [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1000.9599999999999s)]
*  that I can't think of a clearer case of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, where it's [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1007.2s)]
*  been so explicit from the beginning. But the government is using this goalpost shifting. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1012.88s)]
*  I've never seen anything like it. I mean, they began with the Yemen defence of the [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1020.1600000000001s)]
*  licences to Yemen, and they've just absolutely ramped it up to a scale. That's just, it doesn't [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1026.24s)]
*  make any sense whatsoever. I mean, because I mean, the South Africa case at the ICJ, the International [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1031.68s)]
*  Court of Justice, I mean, they went to great lengths to marry the rhetoric at the top and the soldiers [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1037.68s)]
*  at the bottom. So you mentioned that Isaac Herzog, the Israeli president at the beginning, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1043.52s)]
*  said there was no uninvolved civilians, a nation out there is to blame, or something along those lines. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1047.68s)]
*  And then you had Israeli soldiers on the ground singing there were no uninvolved civilians. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1054.24s)]
*  I mean, that's the other point, isn't it? I mean, the finance minister Smotra says we are [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1059.4399999999998s)]
*  disassembling Gaza and leaving it as piles of rubble with total destruction, which has no precedent [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1063.28s)]
*  globally and the world isn't stopping us, which you can marry to the facts on the ground, which is [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1066.8s)]
*  the apocalyptic ruin of Gaza and the destruction of homes, schools, hospitals, mosques, churches, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1072.3999999999999s)]
*  libraries, universities, museums, all the pillars of civic life, agriculture, food production, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1079.4399999999998s)]
*  plant life, livestock. I mean, this is where it's like entering a parallel universe, because [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1086.16s)]
*  they can't just go, well, they're just playing to the gallery. I mean, that's what's happened. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1093.1200000000001s)]
*  It's not Smotra's decision exactly. They said what they're going to do, they've done it. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1100.4s)]
*  There's no ambiguity whatsoever. Is there any way legally that, I mean, you just think [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1106.0s)]
*  it's so absurd and so kind of on a collision with reality that surely some legal sense has to [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1111.28s)]
*  prevail because it's just so insane, frankly. Yeah. So our arguments in this case are just that. So [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1121.28s)]
*  the rationality standard in judicial review is a decision that's so absurd that no reasonable [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1132.64s)]
*  decision maker could have come to it. And we have argued that this methodology is irrational. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1138.48s)]
*  The sort of procedural problem is that because the government accepted that there was a clear [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1144.8799999999999s)]
*  risk back in September, we've been debarred from challenging that methodology itself because they've [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1150.8s)]
*  essentially said, well, it doesn't matter because we've accepted clear risk because of what they [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1157.04s)]
*  term mistreatment of detainees and insufficient humanitarian aid. So they've said while we weren't [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1161.92s)]
*  able to come to any conclusions on conduct of hostilities, i.e. attacks, we have assessed as a [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1168.8000000000002s)]
*  clear risk and therefore you don't need to worry about the methodology. So we were debarred in a [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1174.72s)]
*  judgment in January from arguing that. However, the government has then gone on to spend a whole [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1179.1200000000001s)]
*  day in court talking about the methodology, this issue of we just don't know. And then there's [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1185.04s)]
*  still defending their finding that there's no risk of genocide on that methodology. So we've asked [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1191.6s)]
*  the court to consider this and we've said in terms that it's irrational. It doesn't make any sense. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1198.8s)]
*  And I hope the court will be with us. But I think what it really needs is a public inquiry, actually. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1206.8799999999999s)]
*  Jason Williams Just finally on this, I mean, do you think it's possible there could be criminal [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1214.32s)]
*  liability for individual ministers? And I asked this actually in reference to a conservative MP, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1223.12s)]
*  a more likely voice, I have to say, oh, I was surprised by him, Kit Malthouse, who is better [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1228.08s)]
*  known as a Tory Brexiteer who pushed a Brexit compromise in a different age. And he challenged [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1233.9199999999998s)]
*  Hamish Faulkner, the Middle East minister, to say, has he taken any legal advice, both for his own [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1242.24s)]
*  liability? And he said the liability of the prime minister, the foreign secretary, other ministers [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1250.0800000000002s)]
*  and other past ministers, he's actually talking about his own colleagues there. He said for the [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1256.16s)]
*  coming reckoning. That's what he said, the coming reckoning, there will be reckoning. What do you [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1260.48s)]
*  think about that? I mean, a lot of people think these people just always get away with it. But [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1265.92s)]
*  some others would go this crime is just too big and too extreme and too unapologetic. What do you [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1270.88s)]
*  think about the likelihood of criminal liability, including personal liability here? [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1275.44s)]
*  Kate Malthouse I totally agree that there will be criminal liability. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1279.76s)]
*  Glenn, Al Haqq, all our allies are not going to stop until there is criminal accountability. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1285.76s)]
*  Under the legal system here, the thing that prevents prosecutions is political interference. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1293.2s)]
*  So in the case of war crimes, prosecutions, genocide prosecutions and crimes against humanity [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1299.92s)]
*  prosecutions and torture, the consent of the director of public prosecutions and the attorney [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1306.3200000000002s)]
*  general has to be given. If the political party that committed the crime is still in power, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1312.88s)]
*  they'll probably find a way to say, no, we don't give our consent. That decision is probably [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1319.04s)]
*  subject to judicial review. So this is going to be tested. However, even if the current government [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1324.4s)]
*  manages to let themselves get away with it, if there's another government in power that [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1332.4s)]
*  agrees with us that this is an absolute atrocity that the UK politicians facilitated, they're not [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1340.0s)]
*  going to block a prosecution. So there's no statute of limitations on war crimes, genocide crimes [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1347.3600000000001s)]
*  against humanity. So people are going to be waiting, even if it's 20 years, people are going [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1352.4s)]
*  to be waiting. In terms of the substantive criminal liability, this is classic aiding and abetting. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1358.96s)]
*  If you just map it onto the standards for aiding and abetting by selling somebody a weapon, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1366.0800000000002s)]
*  they know what they're going to do. They've been told what they're going to do. They've supplied [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1371.92s)]
*  the weapon anyway. They've said, oh, peace and security. Domestic criminal law doesn't have a [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1375.6000000000001s)]
*  carve out for national security. And they'd be given all this video footage of what the criminal [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1380.32s)]
*  is doing and you supply them the weapon. Yeah, you supply them the weapon. And also, that methodology [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1386.08s)]
*  I mentioned where they say, we just don't know because we haven't asked Israel, that's so [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1392.48s)]
*  ridiculous that a jury would see through it. So you might be able to say, sort of shift the goalpost [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1397.4399999999998s)]
*  depending on who you're talking to and bury this stuff and just answer a parliamentary question [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1404.72s)]
*  and then sit down and then avoid scrutiny. But if you're in a criminal trial, a jury is going to [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1411.44s)]
*  say, wait, you knew what they were doing. It's a fact. It's a question of fact. Absolutely. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1418.0s)]
*  So there's a very well established principle in English criminal law, which says ignorance of the [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1424.16s)]
*  defence to a crime. So they're hiding behind this sort of quasi legal methodology, which says, oh, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1430.24s)]
*  I'm not sure what Israel was intending to do. And again, I'm not exaggerating by saying when they [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1437.04s)]
*  snipe a baby, they don't know what they were intending to do. So you can't sit there and say, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1442.3200000000002s)]
*  oh, we just didn't know what they were intending to do. It's clear what they are intending to do. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1448.0s)]
*  And you helped them to do it. Absolutely. I think, again, as many people have pointed out, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1452.72s)]
*  the most confessed to crime as it actually happened and the most documented crime as it [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1458.56s)]
*  actually happened, it is called the first live stream genocide in history for a very good reason. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1464.3999999999999s)]
*  And obviously, thanks to the courageous work of Palestinian journalists who suffered the biggest [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1470.56s)]
*  slaughter of journalists in recorded history, we know what happened from day one. And we also have [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL2eUOIDDCM&t=1475.76s)]
