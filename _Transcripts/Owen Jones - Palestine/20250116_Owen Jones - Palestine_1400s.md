# Police SHUT DOWN BBC Gaza Protest - But New Revelations Will Shock You w. Ben Jamal
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg)
*  They're trying to ban a protest about Israel's genocide in Gaza this Saturday from outside the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=0.0s)]
*  BBC. By they, I mean London's Metropolitan Police. Why a protest outside the BBC first of all? Well, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=6.48s)]
*  as many of you will know, including those who've followed my recent work on this, the BBC stands [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=12.8s)]
*  accused of, for example, systematic pro-Israel bias, erasing the real horror of what is being [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=18.0s)]
*  unleashed against the Palestinian people, failing to provide accurate context. We really could go on. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=22.64s)]
*  These are allegations, by the way, which come from the BBC's own journalists, including 13 [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=28.4s)]
*  whistleblowers who spoke to me and over 100 members of BBC staff who signed a letter condemning their [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=32.4s)]
*  own employers. Now, the original reason given by the Metropolitan Police for preventing a protest [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=39.12s)]
*  this Saturday outside of BBC is because of alleged disruption to Jewish Londoners, specifically [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=45.36s)]
*  because of a particular synagogue, part criminal that thousands of Jews have marched through [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=50.72s)]
*  London streets against the genocide. And they'll be marching again this Saturday. And that the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=57.12s)]
*  arrest rate at these protests is lower than the Glassamy Music Festival. The synagogue isn't on [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=62.08s)]
*  the route to the protest. The argument being presented is that it's near the BBC. I mean, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=66.64s)]
*  there's no synagogue is on the route, in any proposed route. And there have been no evidence [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=72.24s)]
*  provided of the protest causing any threats to synagogues since this all began. Well, we've got [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=77.84s)]
*  some developments to discuss. One of those developments concerns the publicly expressed [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=85.36s)]
*  political views of the rabbi of the synagogue who has publicly claimed that the protests have [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=89.6s)]
*  damaged the synagogue's ability to function. He's made, therefore, public representations [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=95.44s)]
*  about these protests. What we'll tell you for full transparency, the views he has expressed [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=100.96s)]
*  publicly, which many of you will consider to be extreme on the question of Israel and Palestine. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=106.08s)]
*  And it is legitimate to thereby question how much do those political views [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=112.96s)]
*  have to do with any objections to protests taking place on this issue. The other developments [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=120.08s)]
*  concern the increasingly desperate arguments being made by the Metropolitan Police as they seek to [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=127.52s)]
*  stop people protesting outside the BBC this Saturday. So Saturday, of course, the day of [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=131.68s)]
*  national protests for many reasons, work, family, travel. In practice, this is stopping [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=137.12s)]
*  national protests about the BBC, which is a national and international public broadcaster. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=143.44s)]
*  And it's unbelievably influential coverage about the genocide. Now, I chatted to the wonderful Ben [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=148.16s)]
*  Jamal. He's the director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, absolutely, of course, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=153.44s)]
*  instrumental in the whole movement against the genocide long before that, apartheid, occupation, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=157.36s)]
*  the oppression of the Palestinian people. I started by asking him about the latest developments [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=163.04s)]
*  with the police. Yeah, I'm hoping I think probably most of your viewers, and if they saw the previous [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=167.6s)]
*  interview, we'll be up to speed with the agreement we reached with the police, the announcement of [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=171.92s)]
*  the demonstration, and then the police imposing orders saying, effectively, you cannot go to the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=178.16s)]
*  BBC anytime on Saturday. What we then did, and we wrote to the police, we publicly announced this, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=183.68s)]
*  we reversed the rule. And we said, Okay, we'll go from Whitehall and finish at the BBC. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=190.08s)]
*  Part of that, to be honest, was what we want to do is rally, assemble a march, it's easier to do [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=197.76s)]
*  that in Whitehall. And it doesn't matter to us politically, whether we end or start the BBC, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  we want to incorporate it as part of it. So we sent that proposal to the police, we got a letter [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=210.4s)]
*  back saying that they would, they refuse this, but they would meet with us. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=215.68s)]
*  Now, when we went into that meeting, what we said to the police was our intention is to assemble in [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=222.08s)]
*  Whitehall, march to the BBC, we will arrive at the BBC about three o'clock, we do not accept any of [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=226.96s)]
*  the arguments that there is disruption to synagogues. There's no evidence of that. However, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=234.08s)]
*  here's the reality. We will be arriving at three o'clock, the service in the synagogue, the main [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=239.92s)]
*  Saturday service finishes at one o'clock. So we will be arriving two hours after the service is [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=245.92s)]
*  finished. There will be no service taking place during the time we're at the BBC. Do you accept [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=251.2s)]
*  that? They said, Yes, we think that's correct. So on what basis is that disruptive? Then the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=256.08s)]
*  conversation took another turn. So they said, Well, you can't hold a rally where you want to [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=261.76s)]
*  outside the BBC, because you're going to have a very big crowd in a very small space. And we think [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=266.56s)]
*  there are health and safety issues. So we said, Okay, we all of those are manageable, we've managed [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=271.2s)]
*  them in the past. So a lot of people protesting outside the BBC, but that's fine. We can shift [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=277.76s)]
*  the location of the stage, we'll go to the top of Portland Place. Anyone who knows the geography of [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=283.04s)]
*  the area knows there's a long road up Portland Place. And therefore, you've got a long place for [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=288.0s)]
*  a long place for people to sort of assemble and gather in front of a stage. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=294.24s)]
*  No, you can't do that. Why not? That would disrupt people's ability to have access to their cars. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=299.36s)]
*  The residents of Portland Place, we'd have to close the road. Now we said this is nonsensical [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=306.8s)]
*  for two reasons. One, anywhere we march in London, you have to close the roads. So on any major march, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=311.04s)]
*  people don't get access to their cars during the duration of the march. That's just a reality. But [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=318.8s)]
*  also you're saying to us, you keep reiterating, we can protest at the BBC any other day of the week, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=323.6s)]
*  not a Saturday. So tell me why your argument is residents are not disturbed by not having access [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=330.0s)]
*  to their cars with a big demonstration Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday or Sunday, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=336.88s)]
*  but magically are on a Saturday, they didn't have any answer to that. So there is no answer. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=341.36s)]
*  So then we said, Okay, let's be as flexible as we can be. We don't actually have to have [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=348.32000000000005s)]
*  a rally at the BBC. We'll do the rally at Whitehall. So we'll have all of our main [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=353.52s)]
*  speeches at Whitehall, but then we will finish at the BBC. And we will have a couple of speeches, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=359.03999999999996s)]
*  we want two journalists to speak one to speak, we had a candidate in mind, one to speak about [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=364.0s)]
*  the bias of the BBC, someone who's informed about that. Someone with the initials OJ speak possibly. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=370.47999999999996s)]
*  And we will have a Palestinian journalist who will speak about the fact that Palestinian [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=377.44s)]
*  journalists are being killed. And they are journalists in Gaza, they are Palestinian [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=383.52s)]
*  journalists, and they're being killed. The biggest slaughter of journalists in recorded history. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=387.68s)]
*  And then we will invite people to lay flowers, children's toys as a mark of the BBC's failure [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=393.2s)]
*  to report on the devastating impact of this genocide, particularly upon children, we will [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=398.96s)]
*  be gone, we will be there from three to 430. There is no service. There is therefore no longer [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=404.0s)]
*  any disruption to people further up Portland Place. The police said, Okay, we'll go away and [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=409.04s)]
*  consider that for an hour and a half. We thought we had some movement. We came back an hour and [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=413.92s)]
*  a half later, they said, No, the in, you know, the orders are in place, we're not going to shift them. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=418.16s)]
*  Any demonstration by you at any time on a Saturday is disrupted to the Jewish community. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=424.8s)]
*  So what we said was, so we're absolutely crystal clear, your position now, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=429.68s)]
*  it's no longer about disrupting services. Because we're all agreed, we're not going to be there [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=434.32s)]
*  during a service, your position is people who want to protest for Palestinian rights, can no longer [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=439.44s)]
*  do that on a Saturday at the BBC, because that would disrupt the Jewish community, whether they're [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=446.48s)]
*  in synagogue or not, it will just disrupt them. If I want to hold any other sort of protest at the BBC, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=451.2s)]
*  I can do it on Saturday. If I want to organise a pro Israel protest on a Saturday, the BBC, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=457.6s)]
*  I can do that. Is that your position? They said, Yes, that's the position. So effectively, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=462.24s)]
*  that's where we're at. We are still calling on the BBC, the Met Police to drop these conditions. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=468.08000000000004s)]
*  But our intention on Saturday is to assemble at Whitehall, hold a rally, and then we will march [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=474.16s)]
*  and we will march as far as we're able to towards the BBC. But we call upon the Met Police, this is [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=479.12s)]
*  absolutely grotesque, unjustified, and we need as much public pressure as possible for them to lift [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=486.32s)]
*  these conditions. Because there is no space anymore for anybody to argue you're disrupting [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=492.0s)]
*  a synagogue service. However spurious the arguments were about threats to synagogues, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=498.88s)]
*  there's not a service going on at the time we're proposing to be there. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=504.0s)]
*  It should be noted for those who aren't aware, or everyone should be aware, there's a higher rate [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=507.76s)]
*  of arrests at Glastonbury than there are at these protests. Anyone who goes to these protests, see, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=514.32s)]
*  they bring together a whole range of different communities. Not least, of course, thousands of [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=519.36s)]
*  Jewish Brits and Jews from all over the world have joined these demonstrations. They march in terms [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=525.2s)]
*  of celebrating their Jewishness, in their placards, wearing kippah, all the rest of it. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=532.56s)]
*  The fact that there aren't these incidents, despite the likes of Srela Bravman calling them [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=539.28s)]
*  hate marches, led then to really disturbing conspiracy theories by the likes of Srela Bravman [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=544.4s)]
*  saying this is because Islamists are in charge of Britain. That's where we ended up, because they [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=551.28s)]
*  had to square the failure or the lack of arrests at these demonstrations with their claim these are [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=555.68s)]
*  hate marches. They claim that the Metropolitan Police are under the thumb of Islamists. It should [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=562.08s)]
*  be noted that if there's any threat to community cohesion, the Metropolitan Police was found by a [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=567.2800000000001s)]
*  government inquiry to be institutionally racist, sexist and misogynistic and homophobic. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=571.44s)]
*  Now, the Rabbi at the synagogue in question has made public arguments against protests [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=576.96s)]
*  about Israel's genocide of the Palestinian people, arguing that they have caused disruption to his [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=583.84s)]
*  synagogue, for example. We don't know what private representations he's made to the police. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=589.04s)]
*  We know the police say they've had a variety of representations. What we do know are his publicly [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=592.7199999999999s)]
*  expressed views about Israel and Palestine, which are, I'll put it this way, trenchant and passionate, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=599.28s)]
*  as you will see. That's certainly euphemistic, because I personally regard them as extremely [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=603.5999999999999s)]
*  objectionable. I'll let you decide what you think about them. The synagogue has apparently attempted [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=608.88s)]
*  to erase these views from public scrutiny. You'll see what I mean by that. Now, I just want to be [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=614.24s)]
*  clear. I approached the synagogue this morning for comment. Many hours ago, they have not responded. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=618.64s)]
*  Now, everyone's entitled to their political opinions. I'm just going to start by saying that. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=624.24s)]
*  We have the right to critique what are publicly declared. These are in sermons. That's what I'm [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=629.92s)]
*  quoting from. Now, these weren't covered. It should be noted that the synagogue has erased [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=634.08s)]
*  this entire blog with all of the quotes here. These quotes were uncovered. They had been [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=642.08s)]
*  the synagogue's approach for comment. They erased the blog. I've used what's called the [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=649.36s)]
*  way back machine. The internet never forgets, as the adage goes, which shows that until [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=653.9200000000001s)]
*  they were approached, there were page after page after page of blogs, including [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=661.36s)]
*  texts of sermons delivered by the rabbi. They're now all gone. There's only one thing remaining on [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=665.44s)]
*  the blog. It's from 2013. Now, the rabbi has made publicly, he's declared publicly. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=670.32s)]
*  So in front of those, obviously, the synagogue, but obviously then published for the world to [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=678.48s)]
*  read until they were erased, he said the United Nations General Assembly last week voted 124 to [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=683.36s)]
*  14 against Israel's right to defend itself with 43 countries abstaining, including nations like [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=688.96s)]
*  Germany, England, Australia, and Canada. That refers to enforcing international law, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=693.84s)]
*  including the illegal occupation of Palestine. So he's there suggesting that the likes of Germany [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=700.4s)]
*  and the UK, condemning them for just abstaining. He then goes on in another sermon, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=708.96s)]
*  where is the apology from David Lammy, the foreign secretary, on the day of these funerals on World [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=716.72s)]
*  War Five, British citizens are still being held hostage in Gaza, decided to announce the suspension [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=720.8s)]
*  of 30 arms licenses to Israel, accusing Israel of breaching humanitarian law. When as the chief [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=724.8s)]
*  rabbi says, it is in fact going to extraordinary lengths to uphold it. As Brendan O'Neill, for those [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=729.12s)]
*  who don't know, a very right-wing militantly pro-Israel commentator, as Brendan O'Neill wrote, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=734.88s)]
*  in normal times, such a flagrant moral abandonment of our old ally of Israel would be geopolitically [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=740.4799999999999s)]
*  foolish. In the wake of the 7th October pogrom and its unleashing of a global wave of Jew-hate, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=745.1999999999999s)]
*  it was nothing short of sickening. So he's there condemning the British government for having [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=749.44s)]
*  suspended, I should be known, only 8% of arms sales and denouncing the British government for [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=754.08s)]
*  being too extreme in that way. Those are what he said. But the one that I want to just come to you [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=761.9200000000001s)]
*  as well is he quotes the former Israeli prime minister, Golda Meir, and he cites her saying, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=769.44s)]
*  we will only have peace with the Arabs when they love their children more than they hurt us. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=776.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And it's worth emphasizing. Why does all this matter? Because as you said, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=782.64s)]
*  he's entitled to his opinions as grotesque as they are. And they are grotesque, in my view. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=788.64s)]
*  It matters because this is someone that we understand the police are listening to in terms [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=796.88s)]
*  of giving evidence as to why a march a few hundred meters away from his synagogue is harassing to [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=801.6s)]
*  his synagogue and to his congregation. And we have said to the police, look, there's a political [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=813.28s)]
*  agenda here. You need to understand there's a political agenda. Well, this emphasizes that. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=818.5600000000001s)]
*  But in relation to that quote, that's a very notorious quote. And I'll speak, if I can, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=823.0400000000001s)]
*  the moment not just as the director of PSE as a Palestinian, there's only one way of understanding [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=828.1600000000001s)]
*  that quotation. It means Palestinians are barbarians. They're not like normal human [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=833.5200000000001s)]
*  beings. They don't love children. Who doesn't love children? Palestinians don't love children. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=838.72s)]
*  You know, they care more about hatred of the Jewish people. Now I want people to consider this. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=845.6s)]
*  Imagine that an imam had said, we will have peace in the Middle East when Jewish people [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=852.3199999999999s)]
*  love their children more than they hate Arabs. What do you think the response would be? I would [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=858.8s)]
*  envisage a national outcry. I would envisage every newspaper in the country saying this is a disgrace. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=868.08s)]
*  I would imagine calls in parliament for this person to be removed from their office. What [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=875.2s)]
*  categorically would happen, I think everyone would accept, is calls for all Muslim community [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=878.96s)]
*  leaders to disassociate themselves by any stretch of the imagination. They're not his words, but to [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=885.36s)]
*  quote these approvingly, which it seems to be the context. You know, he's not saying Golda Mir said [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=891.44s)]
*  this, isn't it disgraceful? Isn't that appalling? What a way to speak about another people. He's [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=897.6800000000001s)]
*  not saying that at all. He's effectively, the implication is endorsing saying these are good [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=903.36s)]
*  sentiments that should be considered. It's appalling. It's disgraceful. But the material [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=908.4s)]
*  bit of the moment is this is somebody who is effectively providing evidence to the police [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=916.16s)]
*  that they are saying we have to act on. And this is someone with a very clear political agenda. And [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=921.52s)]
*  I would say who is happy to endorse sentiments that are rooted straightforwardly in anti-Palestinian [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=927.04s)]
*  racism. And it should be noted just so we're clear why we are citing the views of this [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=935.12s)]
*  rabbi. He's publicly said, so he's kind of testifying why these process should be prevented [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=940.5600000000001s)]
*  from congregating in this area, which is not outside the synagogue. I need to keep [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=947.92s)]
*  emphasizing, not outside the synagogue. The BBC headquarters is- Nor does anyone assemble on the [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=953.92s)]
*  road. There's no, you know, it's not on the route of assembly. Nobody goes on that road. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=959.76s)]
*  If anybody just knows that area, there was a significant distance between the BBC and the [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=964.0s)]
*  synagogue. And it's not on the route. But he told the Jewish Chronicle that Gaza process had been [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=970.16s)]
*  damaging his synagogue's ability to function with events canceled and congregants being intimidated [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=974.56s)]
*  on the way to worship. He said that he'd reported to the police hearing chants for genocide of Jews [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=978.56s)]
*  from his synagogue, but that the information had been met with a shrug. Well, again, and I need to [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=983.12s)]
*  just keep emphasizing that given the allegations he's made there, what he's saying there is criminal. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=988.0s)]
*  That would be a criminal act and that would be met with arrest. I keep having to emphasize the [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=992.64s)]
*  very low level of arrest at any large gathering, a football match, whatever, people are always [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=999.04s)]
*  arrested. If you get large numbers of people, you're going to get some wrongers in there [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1005.84s)]
*  somewhere. The idea, if that's what he's arguing there is true, there would be massive arrests of [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1009.6s)]
*  people just to be absolutely clear about that. And that hasn't happened because, you know, so [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1015.04s)]
*  he's made that accusation that I think people should consider the counter evidence and also [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1020.56s)]
*  the fact that there's such a large Jewish presence always on these protests. And we should consider [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1027.36s)]
*  that he has very clearly made his political opinions, which I think, you know, if you look [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1034.3999999999999s)]
*  at British public opinion, are very much on the fringes of where most people are at when it comes [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1040.72s)]
*  to Israel and Palestine. Yeah, and look, I would add to this, because the sense I have of what he's [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1046.8s)]
*  talking about there, as it's been communicated to us in our conversations with the police, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1052.3999999999999s)]
*  is, I mean, first of all, I don't know whether, you know, we've only been on this route twice [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1058.08s)]
*  since October 2023. I don't know whether, so as you say, it's a long distance. Is it possible [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1068.08s)]
*  that they could hear from a distance chants coming from the protest? Possibly. I don't know. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1075.2s)]
*  But I do know this person has a very clear political agenda. But what's he talking about? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1084.88s)]
*  Genocidal chants. It's clear what I mean. I know what he's talking about. He's talking about the [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1089.92s)]
*  chant from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free. Now I'm... Well, we don't know, but we can [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1095.1200000000001s)]
*  speculate because that's very commonly presented. That's the sense we've had from the police about [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1099.1200000000001s)]
*  what he's talking about. Now, you know, again, that's a very, I would say, outrageous. I've [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1104.72s)]
*  spoken about this publicly many times. Palestinians have articulated very clearly, what are we saying [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1111.68s)]
*  when we talk about that? And we are talking about what's the nature of the oppression we're subject [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1116.4s)]
*  to? That we live under a system of apartheid, whether in an occupied military territory, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1121.2s)]
*  whether we're Palestinian citizens of the state, whether we're in Gaza, across all of the land, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1126.24s)]
*  from the river to the sea, Palestinians live under a system of apartheid. We will be free [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1130.96s)]
*  when it's ended. To interpret that as a genocidal chant calling for all of the Jewish people to be [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1135.6000000000001s)]
*  killed is to say, don't trust Palestinians. They might say that, but they're really barbarians, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1142.64s)]
*  in my view. That's what it, that's where it rests. So that's whether it could be heard or not. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1147.0400000000002s)]
*  Mm. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1153.76s)]
*  That's what they heard. And he should know that those who chant it have made clear what is the [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1154.1599999999999s)]
*  meaning of their words. I mean, I'm not saying that the rabbis claiming this, but there have been [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1162.8799999999999s)]
*  others who oppose these protests who've argued, for example, that free Palestine is genocide. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1168.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1174.8799999999999s)]
*  Just even- [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1175.36s)]
*  Well, and Sweller Bravmann said, if you're flying the Palestinian flag, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1175.84s)]
*  that should be looked on with suspicion. And as I've said before, we had a police force went to [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1181.68s)]
*  visit somebody's home somewhere up north. And so you've got a Palestine flag in your window. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1185.76s)]
*  That could distress or harass your neighbors. We've had complaints. So where, as I said, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1190.8s)]
*  where do we draw the line? Where, you know, if we say, well, someone feels harassed by displays of [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1196.24s)]
*  national identity with a group that they feel uncomfortable with, or with a political cause that [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1201.6000000000001s)]
*  they find problematic, they can say they're harassed. And now what they're left with is [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1207.68s)]
*  they will take them seriously and stop these demonstrations happening because people are [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1212.4s)]
*  saying they feel this, even though there's no evidence of actual harassment. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1216.88s)]
*  I mean, a notorious example from February 2023 is when a display of artwork by Palestinian children [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1220.0800000000002s)]
*  at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital was removed after UK lawyers for Israel claimed it made [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1226.0800000000002s)]
*  Jewish patients feel vulnerable, harassed and victimized. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1231.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1234.72s)]
*  Ottery plates. And one of the things that they said was distressing was one of the plates [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1236.48s)]
*  had a picture of the Al Aqsa Mosque with a Palestinian flag flying above it. That was [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1243.04s)]
*  distressing. Now, people should recall, where is Al Aqsa located in the old city of Jerusalem? [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1246.72s)]
*  Under all of the international consensus of those who push for two states, it would be part of a [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1253.76s)]
*  Palestinian state. And yet suggesting that Palestinians might have sovereignty in a state [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1258.72s)]
*  of their own, according to the organization that complained is distressing to Jewish people and [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1265.3600000000001s)]
*  harasses them. That's pretty extraordinary. Just finally, what's the plan? What would you say [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1270.4s)]
*  to people watching and listening to this? So the plan is to assemble in Whitehall. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1275.92s)]
*  We're going to hold... What time? What time? [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1280.8000000000002s)]
*  12 o'clock. Assembly at 12 o'clock. We're going to rally there. The police accepted yesterday. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1283.36s)]
*  There are no issues with us assembling in Whitehall. I don't know. We've got all sorts [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1290.8s)]
*  of moving goalposts. Where might they try to stretch this? But our plan is to assemble in [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1294.96s)]
*  Whitehall. That's the plan. We're going to hold a rally there. We are then going to march. We're [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1300.8s)]
*  going to put out today, we're asking people to bring with them flowers, children's toys, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1306.48s)]
*  maybe children's shoes. If the police relent, see sense, we'll finish at the BBC. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1311.28s)]
*  And we will then finish in the way that I've articulated. If they decide somewhere on our [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1318.96s)]
*  march, they're going to stop us. We will retain order. We will be peaceful. But we will at that [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1324.24s)]
*  point lay down the things we've asked people to bring. But we are asserting the right to march [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1330.32s)]
*  and the right to demonstrate, to call for an end to a genocide and the end to the oppression of [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1337.92s)]
*  the Palestinian people. And we hope that we are joined this time, not just by a hundred thousand, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1342.5600000000002s)]
*  but by many, many more than that. Amen. How will history judge a time in which those who tried to [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1347.52s)]
*  march against a genocide and one of the most depraved crimes of our time were portrayed as [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1354.64s)]
*  the real hateful extremists? Whilst those who have of course cheered the hideous onslaught on [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1360.3200000000002s)]
*  masquerade and present themselves as the real moderates, the respectable people in society. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWCVfpdTwDg&t=1366.96s)]
