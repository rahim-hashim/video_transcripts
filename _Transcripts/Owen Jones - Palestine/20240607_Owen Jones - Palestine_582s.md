# Israel Has LOST - And This PROVES It
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [June 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pE7oziodoQQ)
*  What I'm about to explain to you is an undeniable, incontrovertible reality,
*  and that Israel has lost, not just lost, but lost catastrophically. Now, we know,
*  or should know, it's failed in all of its stated objectives, but before I explain exactly,
*  specifically what I'm talking about here, an obvious disclaimer. None of this is to understate
*  the absolute horror of what Israel has done in what should rightly be regarded as a genocidal
*  onslaught against the Palestinian people, overwhelmingly in Gaza, but not confined to
*  Gaza. And that genocidal rampage is going on still every single day. Now, just today, Israeli
*  forces bombed a school. I just watched a video which nobody should ever have to see, and that
*  is a Palestinian man picking up the body parts and remnants of children, kids, blown apart by
*  an Israeli strike on a school. Displaced Palestinians were sheltering in that school, run by UNRWA,
*  the UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees, and Gaza's biggest humanitarian agency, one which Israel
*  has openly committed to destroying, and at least 40 people were killed, including 14 children. Now,
*  according to the Israeli state, it was being used to shelter Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters,
*  but as ever, we have to remember the history of Israel in this horror, but also, more generally,
*  in lying, deflecting, gaslighting the works. And even if it were true, you simply cannot attack
*  a school with no prior warning, knowing it is full of civilians. As UNRWA notes, there were 6,000
*  displaced people sheltering there when it was hit. UNRWA shares the coordinates of all facilities,
*  including the school with the Israeli army. They say they had no information or suspicion that
*  there were Hamas fighters in the school. As the Israeli human rights organisation, BetSlem, say,
*  the Israeli attack on the school in the Anuzrat refugee camp, which housed internally displaced
*  people, is a suspected war crime. If, as Israel claims, Hamas used the school to plan military
*  operations, this action is illegal, but it cannot justify the massive harm to civilians who sought
*  shelter in the school from the horror of prolonged fighting. As demonstrated throughout the war,
*  they say the killing of civilians is an unavoidable result of the character of Israel's military
*  activity in the Gaza Strip. It may seem perverse, then, to talk about Israel losing in any meaningful
*  sense in Gaza. When Gaza is in ruins, tens of thousands have been slaughtered in such barbaric
*  circumstances by the Israeli state, and every single day that remains the reality. That famine,
*  as we know, grips Gaza because of the deliberate starvation policy of Israel. But apart from the
*  stated objective of returning the Israeli hostages to their loved ones through military means,
*  a total failure, far more have been killed by the Israeli state than rescued by military means,
*  Israel keeps retrieving, in fact, the bodies of dead hostages because of its refusal to
*  accept a ceasefire deal which would return the hostages alive in return for Palestinian prisoners
*  and end this obscenity. Israel's stated aim, of course, was also, above all else, in fact,
*  the military defeat of Hamas. Now, to anyone with any sense, with a basic understanding of
*  military history and counterinsurgency, this was always deranged, let's just say it. Hamas
*  had emerged in the first place because of the Palestinian people's burning theory, the colossal
*  injustices imposed upon them by the Israeli state, and a sense that the previously dominant
*  faction, Fatah, had failed to stand up to the occupation and essentially had become
*  corrupt collaborators. That's how the Palestinian people generally felt. I think that's a completely
*  accurate summary. Now, you cannot defeat an idea, and you cannot force an occupied and
*  subjugated people to accept the oppression and the subjugation. You simply will not do that by
*  taking that oppression to the most violent, hideous degree possible, where you make it
*  abundantly clear that you wish to violently destroy that entire people. Hamas retains
*  popularity among many Palestinians simply because it is seen as the main resistance force
*  in town that's viable given what they're up against. None of us have to like that fact,
*  but we do have to accept that fact. This is why the Israeli state has lost. Now,
*  Israel keeps making grand claims. They have destroyed 20 of the 24 Hamas battalions and
*  so many thousands of its militants in the process. But the number who belong to the
*  fighting force of Hamas isn't a static number, and indeed the Israeli claims are themselves
*  widely exaggerated. A couple of weeks ago, there were reports about the US administration's
*  private frustrations, which should have been more widely reported. That's what I'm talking about
*  today. Now, big caveat here, they keep leaking these people, their frustration while arming
*  Israel to the teeth so it can keep on slaughtering innocent Palestinians. They have facilitated this
*  genocide from the get go and none of us must ever forget that. They're clearly leaking this
*  because they think it will sway American voters who are understandably not too happy about a
*  Democratic president facilitating genocide. Nonetheless, this particular briefing was
*  very revealing indeed. Top unnamed officials told Politico that Israel's strategy in Gaza
*  is self-defeating and likely to open the door to Hamas's return. They said, and I quote,
*  Israel's government has failed to hold parts of Gaza after clearing them,
*  have turned the civilian population, the rest of the world against it with widespread bombing and
*  adequate humanitarian aid, no shit, and enabled Hamas to recruit more fighters.
*  Now, I have to say, when I read this particular part, I feel an unbelievable sense of anger.
*  Let me just quote what I'm talking about. In a Tuesday interview with CNN, Netanyahu said,
*  we have to get rid of Hamas, otherwise there's no future for Gaza. But recent US intelligence
*  is fueling a growing out concern that that outcome isn't possible. So let me just say that again.
*  But recent US intelligence is fueling a growing concern that such an outcome is impossible.
*  Are you kidding me? US intelligence has caught up with what we all said eight months ago when
*  this all started. I bet many of you said exactly what you just heard or was that effect from the
*  start, from the get go. You're not highly paid intelligence operatives, unless some of you are
*  watching this, of the world's only superpower, the vast array of highly classified information
*  at your fingertips, are you? No, but you've got some common sense, I'd imagine, which turns out
*  it's actually far more reliable than the supposed expert opinion of this lot who've dedicated their
*  entire lives to so-called intelligence gathering. Let's just listen further. Although Hamas's
*  communications and military abilities have been degraded, only 30 to 35% of its fighters, those
*  who were a part of Hamas before the October 7th attack, have been killed and about 65% of its
*  tunnels are still intact, US intelligence indicates. Right, so Israel has destroyed or severely
*  damaged most civilian infrastructure and killed tens of thousands, including at least 15,000
*  children. And that's their so-called achievement, is it? Goodness me. But this part here, this part
*  made me really angry. Biden officials, they say, have become increasingly concerned that Hamas
*  has been able to recruit during wartime thousands over the last several months. That has allowed
*  the Greek to withstand months of Israeli offensives, according to a person familiar with US intelligence.
*  No shit. No shit. Who could have predicted that? That if you launch a genocidal war against the
*  long-subjugated people, that many of them have lived through picking up the remnants of their
*  slaughtered children and putting them in plastic bags, of their loved ones being burned alive,
*  that some of them might go, indeed many of them might go, I'm going to spend the rest of my life
*  fighting those responsible even if it kills me. Who would have thought it? Oh, anyone with common
*  sense, I'd imagine. You don't just go, oh well, there were 30 to 40,000 Hamas fighters,
*  you just wipe out most of them, job done. What about all the ones who are going to join? You
*  absolute fucking clowns. How dare these people insult our intelligence by leaking the most obvious
*  conclusions imaginable after facilitating one of the great atrocities of our age, which would always
*  obviously fail on its own terms. We were not actually, I'm sorry if some of you think you
*  were geniuses by predicting that this would actually happen. You weren't. You were obviously,
*  you obviously had a general sense of what would inevitably happen.
*  A report in the Guardian this week finds, and listen to this, that analysts believe
*  there may be more Hamas militants in the north of Gaza, which was supposedly cleared by Hamas
*  several months ago, than in Raffa, the southern city which Israel claims is actually Hamas's stronghold.
*  Eight agencies believe that Israel actually already controls about 80 to 85 percent of Raffa,
*  and guess what? Hamas still hasn't been destroyed or anything close. Its leadership remains very
*  much intact. Indeed, it was in Jabalia, as the Guardian note, the second most popular town in
*  northern Gaza, where fighting was described as perhaps the fiercest yet, and that was supposedly
*  cleared of Hamas back in January. Residents of Jabalia now say that Hamas officials are patrolling
*  markets and enforcing price controls of key goods and distributing aid, so in other words,
*  still functioning as a government, not simply as a guerrilla army. Israel has lost. It has lost
*  completely. Yes, it has caused unbelievable sadistic mayhem, and I'm sorry to say there's still so much
*  of that to come. It has turned itself into pariah state. It is a state now widely despised not just
*  in the global south, but in the global north too. Spain, a NATO country, has just joined South Africa's
*  genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice. In the United States, more
*  Americans do not think genocide is being committed by Israel. They're right. The ability of Israel
*  to retain diplomatic and military and political support from Western nations in the long term
*  now has huge question marks above it. And meanwhile, we can see the possibility of war with
*  Hezbollah, which would make Hamas seem like a gentle saunter in the spring in the local park.
*  This is a defeat of historic proportions, which Israel has simply not come to terms with.
*  The task of us in the countries which allow Israel to perpetrate these horrors is to keep building
*  pressure to end this horror for good. Please like and subscribe. Do leave your comments.
