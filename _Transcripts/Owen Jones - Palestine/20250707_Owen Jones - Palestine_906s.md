# JK Rowling’s SILENCE On Gaza’s Murdered Women
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [July 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04)
*  Why is J.K. Rowling, who presents herself as a great champion of women's rights, silent about the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=0.0s)]
*  mass slaughter, the maiming, the torture, the abuse, the dispossession, the bereavement, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=6.48s)]
*  the sexual assault and the rape of Palestinian women? Look, a confession here, I normally try [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=12.16s)]
*  and steer well away from the relentless psychodrama involving this children's author, despite her [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=17.68s)]
*  intimately making random attacks on me, which to be honest, I'm pretty cool with, anything to [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=23.52s)]
*  distract her from, let's put this way, her usual obsessions. This weekend, however, she popped up [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=29.2s)]
*  on the old Twitter.com to respond to my interview last week on Piers Morgan's show, which as you [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=35.28s)]
*  know, was about Israel's genocide against the Palestinian people. Rather than deal with the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=39.92s)]
*  substance of what I was saying, she instead decided to, and I am not exaggerating here, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  promote claims that I had snorted cocaine before my appearance. Someone had tweeted a clip of the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=48.72s)]
*  interview in which they wrote, someone's freely energetic. I mean, okay, that's already in nudge, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=54.56s)]
*  nudge, wink, wink territory. And she quote tweeted it adding, I've never seen film footage before [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=60.080000000000005s)]
*  where only one character has been sped up to 30 times natural speed. Very droll, obviously deciding [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=64.72s)]
*  it was still a little light on a new endo. Someone with destroying wokeness in their bio responded [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=71.04s)]
*  with the secret ingredient must be a white powder and Rowling fired back. Well, he is known as talcum [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  X. Now I would actually hand it to her for this being pretty funny if it wasn't for the fact that [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=81.92s)]
*  I'm afraid to say this is ripped off material. Some activists in the US labeled writer, Sean King, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=87.6s)]
*  talcum X many years ago. That's a label which has been circulating for years as a result. Now, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  I don't want to get panicked here, but you kind of hope a celebrated writer might just come up with [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=98.64s)]
*  their own material, but you know, whatever you do you on the specifics. If I was self-destructive [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=101.6s)]
*  enough to snort cocaine before doing immediate appearance, then I would have an addiction. Now, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=106.48s)]
*  there are people I love who I'm close to who do have addictions. It's not what I'd call classically [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=110.4s)]
*  hilarious. It's had a devastating impact on their lives, on the lives of people they're close to. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=115.36s)]
*  There's a chronic lack of support and services in this country, many other countries. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=120.56s)]
*  We treat this major public health crisis as a criminal issue rather than what it is, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  which is a health issue. Now, there are those who've accused J.K Rowling of cruelty in the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  way she conducts herself. I don't really think myself this is particularly helpful material in [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=134.0s)]
*  her defense. It's up to her, of course, how she decides to behave. Now, as I pointed out in response, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=139.2s)]
*  I was diagnosed with ADHD a couple of years ago. I did a video about it at the time. I take 40 [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=143.92s)]
*  milligrams of L-vents a day. So technically, yes, I did take stimulants before going on air, not KK, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=149.11999999999998s)]
*  but if we're going to get all technical, amphetamines courtesy of the National Health [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=154.0s)]
*  Service. As many of you have noticed over the years, my ADHD means I tend to speak pretty fast. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=157.67999999999998s)]
*  I fidget a lot. You're put up with it. Thanks for your limitless patience. I'm also prone to [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=163.76s)]
*  clumsiness, like knocking over glasses, as I did on Piers Morgan's show. I'm embarrassed to say [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=170.0s)]
*  that in the last few months, I've destroyed two laptops by knocking water over them. What can I [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  say? ADHD is pretty expensive. But my neurodivergence is not the issue here, or shouldn't be. Israel's [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=178.16s)]
*  committing a genocide facilitated by the government, which represents both J.K Rowling and myself. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=183.28s)]
*  That's what I was talking about in the interview she was mocking. That's a genocide which has [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  inflicted on Palestinian women and girls unimaginable apocalyptic suffering. And yet [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=191.76s)]
*  J.K Rowling, the self-professed champion of women's rights, has had more to say about me, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=197.2s)]
*  more say about my ADHD, more to say implying I go on TV whilst high on drugs, than she has to say [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  about the suffering of Palestinian women and girls at the hands of Israel's genocide. And to be fair [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=206.56s)]
*  to her, that's not hard because she said zilch, zero, nada about the suffering of Palestinian women [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=211.28s)]
*  and Palestinian girls. J.K Rowling is one of the biggest platforms on earth. Here's what she could [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=217.84s)]
*  have used the platform to talk about, but chose not to. As Otzfar noted, in the first year Israel's [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=222.8s)]
*  genocide exterminated more women and children in Gaza than in any comparable conflict in the 21st [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=227.6s)]
*  century. J.K Rowling says nothing. Pregnant Palestinian women have been repeatedly murdered [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=234.8s)]
*  by the Israeli military. J.K Rowling says nothing. Palestinian women are having c-sections without [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=239.84s)]
*  painkillers. Girls are using tent scraps as sanitary products. J.K Rowling says nothing. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=245.68s)]
*  In March, the United Nations issued a report detailing Israel's sexual reproductive and [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=252.96s)]
*  other forms of gender-based violence against Palestinian women. Joanne could have used her [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=257.36s)]
*  huge platform to share this hideous report, but J.K Rowling says nothing. Israel's deliberate [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=262.16s)]
*  starvation of Gaza has had a devastating impact on pregnant women. According to the UN report, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=268.48s)]
*  it's led to anemia, pre-eclampsia, hemorrhage, maternal death, newborn death, and premature birth. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=274.0s)]
*  J.K Rowling says nothing. Israel's deliberate starvation of Gaza meant that, as per the UN report, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=280.0s)]
*  among households with lactating mothers, 55% reported health conditions impeding their ability [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=285.92s)]
*  to breastfeed and 99% reported difficulties developing enough breast milk. J.K Rowling [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=290.88s)]
*  says nothing. By October 2024, 16,500 pregnant and lactating women were reported to be [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=297.36s)]
*  in need of treatment for acute malnutrition. J.K Rowling says nothing. Palestinian women are dying [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=303.92s)]
*  of ovarian cervix and breast cancer because of Israel's war on Gaza's healthcare system. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=309.68s)]
*  J.K Rowling says nothing. The number of miscarriages amongst Palestinian women has surged by up to 300% [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=314.0s)]
*  because of Israel's genocide. J.K Rowling says nothing. Israel destroyed maternity wards and an [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=319.44s)]
*  IVF clinic in Gaza, destroying 4,000 embryos and more than 1,000 sperm and egg samples. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=324.64s)]
*  The United Nations rightly called these genocidal acts. But what does J.K Rowling say? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=330.48s)]
*  J.K Rowling says nothing. Israel is blocking baby formula from getting into Gaza, leaving babies to [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=336.16s)]
*  starve. J.K Rowling says nothing. Israeli soldiers reportedly film themselves mocking the underwear [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=341.20000000000005s)]
*  of Palestinian women they've driven from their homes, traumatized, abused, beaten, starved, maimed, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=347.04s)]
*  bereaved, and indeed killed. J.K Rowling says nothing. Palestinian women aren't just being [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=352.8s)]
*  beaten up by Israeli soldiers, they're being sexually abused. The United Nations report details [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=358.24s)]
*  Palestinian women being stripped to their underwear by male soldiers and subjected to male soldiers [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=362.96000000000004s)]
*  touching their bodies with women refusing to do so being assaulted, threatened, and beaten. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=366.96000000000004s)]
*  In one case, a woman reported being filmed in front of male members of the community, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=371.52s)]
*  stripped naked as a means of humiliation, with the soldier showing the woman the video of her [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=375.92s)]
*  and threatening to post it online to shame and stigmatize her before the soldiers punched her [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=380.16s)]
*  in the stomach and because she just had a caesarean section she suffered serious complications. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=383.84s)]
*  Another woman was beaten and groped by male soldiers who threatened her with rape, with one [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=388.08s)]
*  soldier threatening to check if she was still a virgin. In another case, a 14-year-old Palestinian [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=393.2s)]
*  girl was reportedly searched and subjected to sexual violence, with soldiers touching her on the [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=396.96s)]
*  breasts, the neck, the waist, and then slapped by a male soldier who said, you are murderers. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=401.03999999999996s)]
*  Those who claim to be great champions of women's rights could have told you this, but unfortunately, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=406.4s)]
*  JK Rowling says nothing. The Israeli military have not just filmed themselves gang raping [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=411.28s)]
*  Palestinian men on camera, Palestinian women have reported being raped by the Israeli military [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=417.84s)]
*  as another UN report last year detailed. JK Rowling says nothing. We could go on, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=423.11999999999995s)]
*  unfortunately for a very long time. Palestinian women and girls are suffering the most hideous, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=429.11999999999995s)]
*  apocalyptic suffering imaginable. JK Rowling is one of the biggest platformers on Earth. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=434.0s)]
*  You have JK Rowling, one of the world's biggest platforms. That is absolutely true. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=439.36s)]
*  Now she could have listened to Arab feminists like the brilliant Mariam Aldisar who have demanded [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=446.0s)]
*  that the silence over Palestinian women and girls must end. But JK Rowling didn't do that. Why? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=451.84000000000003s)]
*  She's betrayed JK Rowling, the movement for trans rights as a mortal danger to women and girls, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=457.6s)]
*  and completely ignored the greatest crime against women and girls happening right now. That is a [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=461.84000000000003s)]
*  crime perpetrated by her own rulers with weapons and diplomatic and political support offered by [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=467.28s)]
*  our rulers. Yet she's treated more about me than she has about the hideous impact of Israel's [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=472.32s)]
*  genocide since it began 638 days ago. Maybe she thinks me, a clumsy neurodivergent geriatric [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=477.52s)]
*  millennial from Stockport is more of a threat to women than the Israeli military. Is that right? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=484.23999999999995s)]
*  If someone with a platform as huge as JK Rowling used it to speak out about what Israel's doing [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=488.79999999999995s)]
*  to Palestinian women and girls, the impact would be colossal. So that's my challenge to her. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=493.03999999999996s)]
*  End your silence, JK Rowling. Your voice more than your cash would be so important here. Can [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=497.35999999999996s)]
*  you unequivocally denounce the criminal responsibility of Israel for the abominations it's inflicting [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=501.76s)]
*  against Palestinian women and girls? Can you do it without Hamas, our country's army and ally to [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=506.47999999999996s)]
*  Israel? Not Hamas. These crimes against Palestinian women are our crimes. Now, an appeal to so-called [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=511.91999999999996s)]
*  gender critical activists too. Some of you have been in touch to say that while you strongly reject [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=518.24s)]
*  my position on trans rights, you are angry about the silence of leading self-described [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=522.8s)]
*  feminists on Palestinian women and girls. Why not say it publicly? But by the way, it's not actually [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=526.64s)]
*  true that JK Rowling has been completely silent on this genocide. In 2023, she treated in support [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=532.16s)]
*  of a Times article condemning celebrities who signed a letter in support of a ceasefire. These [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=536.8s)]
*  were celebrities trying to use their platform to oppose what they knew would be a great crime, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=541.76s)]
*  a crime that would inflict unimaginable horror and suffering against women and girls. And yet, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=546.08s)]
*  JK Rowling used her platform to condemn opponents of this bloodbath. Now, in response to her latest [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=551.28s)]
*  comments, many Palestinians have spoken up. The brilliant Palestinian analyst, Mohammed Shahada, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=556.32s)]
*  who is from Gaza, who has lost so many loved ones to Israel's genocide, wrote, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=560.48s)]
*  You claim to care for women, yet never said a single word about Israel murdering, maiming, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=564.88s)]
*  starving and abusing Gazan women in numbers unseen anywhere in today's world. And you're mocking one [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=569.2800000000001s)]
*  of the most prominent people doing the very thing you carol from. He has ADHD. Disgraceful. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=574.0s)]
*  Many of my friends and family whom Israel killed in Gaza had believed in this woman, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=578.72s)]

*  Palestinian women and girls? Given her obsession, does Israel need to come out as trance? Shame on [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=614.88s)]
*  those who claim to stand to the rights of women and girls who say nothing as Palestinian women [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=621.36s)]

*  Israel's Western facilitated genocide of the Palestinian people. Now a clip has been widely [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=637.04s)]
*  circulating on Twitter, which has led to uproar amongst Israel's cheerleaders who claim it's the [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=642.56s)]
*  mask off moment which exposes me for who I really am. This is a very revealing episode because it [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=646.88s)]
*  underlines how Israel's cheerleaders only have lies. Here's the clip that they've been circulating. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=652.0799999999999s)]
*  Have a listen. In 2023, 240 Palestinians had been killed that year by the Israeli state, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=660.16s)]
*  including 40 children. What else was Hamas supposed to do on the 7th of October? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=666.48s)]
*  Seems outrageous, doesn't it? It was first shared by a far-right influencer called Basil the Great, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=671.52s)]
*  who wrote, accompanying this clip, what else was Hamas supposed to do on the 7th of October? What [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=676.0s)]
*  is wrong with it? It was then shared by Elon Levy, the former chief propagandist to the war criminal [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=680.8000000000001s)]
*  Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu, and that's before he was fired. He wrote, maybe not massacre [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=686.32s)]
*  Israelis at a music festival, torture and burn families alive in their homes, abducting to 51 [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=691.28s)]
*  hostages including a baby and dozens of kids. Maybe that, Owen. It was also shared by Achmed [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=695.36s)]
*  Feroz Al-Khatib, a senior fellow at the Hawkinsh Atlanta Council, who added, God has cursed the [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=699.04s)]
*  Palestinian people with the stupidest, most unimaginably dumb allies and pro-Palestinian [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=704.72s)]
*  fools that humanity could have ever produced. It was shared by Jake Wallace-Simon, the former [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=708.72s)]
*  editor of the Jewish Chronicle and a leading cheerleader for Israel's genocide, who said, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=712.96s)]
*  it's sad what happens to people. It was shared by pro-Israel online influencer Adam Mannet, who [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=716.96s)]
*  wrote, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=722.24s)]
*  Is this what I actually said? Let's see the full clip. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=737.6800000000001s)]
*  So did Israel have a right to defend itself? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=740.24s)]
*  Again, do you know why I regard this as so offensive to the worth of Palestinian life? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=742.24s)]
*  I'll tell you why. In 2020... [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=748.0s)]
*  Do you think Hamas cared about the lives of Palestinians? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=750.4s)]
*  No, I haven't argued that. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=752.4s)]
*  You know what I think about 7 October. We don't have to, 632 days into genocide, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=754.4s)]
*  have to start going back to, do you condemn Hamas? You know my views on that. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=758.88s)]
*  That wasn't my question. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=762.4s)]
*  I said, do you think Hamas cared about the lives of Palestinians when they launched that attack, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=764.4s)]
*  having built an intricate tunnel system which protected Hamas but exposed the civilians to [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=770.16s)]
*  certain deaths? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=776.0s)]
*  I don't support Hamas is not relevant. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=776.4s)]
*  Of course they're relevant. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=778.4s)]
*  No, it isn't relevant. I'll tell you why it's not relevant. I'll tell you why. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=779.28s)]
*  The masses are relevant. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=781.28s)]
*  No, you would find this question offensive if I put it to you. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=783.28s)]
*  If I had said to you, in 2023, 240 Palestinians had been killed that year by the Israeli state, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=785.28s)]
*  including 40 children, what else was Hamas supposed to do on the 7th October? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=792.56s)]
*  What would you say? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=797.28s)]
*  Are you justifying? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=798.16s)]
*  No, that's the point. I'm saying you would say correctly, there was never any excuse for war crimes. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=799.28s)]
*  This is an outrageous question for you too. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=804.56s)]
*  So in actual fact, I was saying the exact opposite. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=808.16s)]
*  What was challenging here was, as the brilliant maxim goes, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=810.0799999999999s)]
*  everything can be justified by 7th October, but nothing can justify 7th October. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=812.9599999999999s)]
*  Anyone who follows my content knows I passionately oppose all and any war crimes. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=818.4s)]
*  What this underlines is a basic point. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=822.8s)]
*  All Israel's cheerleaders have are lies. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=824.9599999999999s)]
*  It's a central plank, the central plank of their entire strategy. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=827.76s)]
*  Without lies, they've got nothing. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=830.88s)]
*  We in the hand have truth, have justice, have humanity. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=832.16s)]
*  We stand against one of the worst crimes of our age despite knowing we will be vilified, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=834.96s)]
*  threatened and attacked. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=838.8000000000001s)]
*  But it's obvious how this ends. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=840.24s)]
*  It will be forever known as one of the great crimes of our age. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=841.44s)]
*  And those who supported this heinous crime, all stayed silent, will be forever damned. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo-p-Ks9l04&t=844.32s)]
