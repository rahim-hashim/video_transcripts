# He Defeated Starmer Ally - Then Labour Attacked Him Over Gaza. Now He Speaks Out. w. Shockat Adam
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [July 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxxNZe1PeEw)
*  Now, in the 2024 election, of course, not that long ago now, a week and a half ago,
*  there were some pretty stunning results. And amongst them were the, well, there were five
*  independent candidates who were elected. One of them, of course, is J.B. Corbyn, the former
*  leader of the Labour Party who was purged by his successor. But four other independent
*  candidates were also elected. Now, this is quite astonishing. Since 1950, only eight
*  independent candidates have been elected in a competitive election, a general election.
*  I'm excluding Martin Bell. He was an independent candidate. Labour stood down for him.
*  So there were eight in total since 1950, and five of them were elected in this general
*  election. Pretty astonishing. Now, I'm really delighted to be speaking to one of those.
*  I think it's very legitimate to describe a historic victory by Shocker Adam in Leicester
*  South. This was an astonishing result. He overturned the massive whopping majority of
*  Jonathan Ashworth, not any old Labour MP, a shadow cabinet minister, one of Keir Starmer's
*  key allies who expected to get a plum job in the Labour government. In 2017, his majority
*  was over 26,000. He had 73.6% of the vote. In 2019, despite Labour's overall bad overall
*  result, he's still got 67% of the vote. He got 33,500 votes, a majority of 22,675. Not
*  this time, this election, his majority was overturned by Shocker Adams, who got around
*  1,000 more votes than him. He did not see that coming. Shocker, it's a big honour to
*  see you. How are you doing?
*  I'm brilliant. Thank you so much for having me on the show.
*  Now, I'm going to talk about what we'll talk about shortly. I think the stuff that's been
*  thrown at you by Jonathan Ashworth, by Labour figures, by the media. This is a really important
*  opportunity if you'd be able to give your side of the story, what you would say in response to what
*  the likes of Jonathan Ashworth have been saying. First, just tell me about yourself. I'm really
*  interested in just who you are. You're an optician, tell me about that, your profession
*  and you in the community, of course, over in Leicester.
*  Thank you so much for the opportunity. As you can imagine, it's been a baptism of fire for me
*  for the past week. It's been more than a whirlwind. It's been an absolute tornado.
*  Look, I'm a local lad. Leicester is my city. It's a city that took me in as a young child at the
*  age of three from East Africa. I was born in Malawi and I grew up in this country from parents.
*  Similar story for many immigrants that came from Africa who couldn't speak English,
*  but they were committed. This country gave us a home and what has happened, this election victory,
*  is really what is so great about this country, the things that I loved growing up about this
*  country, this underdog given this opportunity. I lived in Leicester virtually all my life. I
*  spent some time abroad and some time away. I studied, as you say, I'm an optometrist,
*  but my passion is fighting racism, bigotry, Islamophobia and all forms of hatred.
*  That is where I found my grounding in the community for over 12, 13 years where as a volunteer,
*  I have worked really, really hard within the community, into faith work, charity work,
*  and making sure that minorities and in particular communities that don't feel part of the system
*  sometimes don't get disenfranchised, work with the government, work with political structures,
*  work with the media to make sure their side of the story is always heard. I live with my family. I've
*  got a business in Leicester South. As I say, I own my own optical practices and it's just been a
*  whirlwind roller coaster. Every adjective you can find a journey in the last six to seven months.
*  – So tell me how it came about that you stood. Because I mean, we've seen other
*  independent candidates, they came forward and there was like, you know, kind of local specific
*  reasons for that. But how did it come about? Why did you put yourself forward? Did you ever
*  imagine you put yourself forward in this way? – No, look, I've never even been a member of
*  a political party in the past. I have, at the very last election, I did support the local candidate
*  for Leicester East and that was the only direct political experience that I have. But saying that,
*  I have always been politically engaged. In fact, as I said in my previous question as well, I've
*  really helped people to understand how the political system works, how the media works,
*  and I've worked so hard within the community so I have this real reputation within the community,
*  completely free of charge, of anything that requires speaking to the MP or speaking to the
*  media or if they've been a victim of any form of hate crime, I would be there to assist them as a
*  caseworker or guide them in the right direction. So just to answer your question then, this has
*  been a series of events. So firstly, for me, what happened during Brexit, I really found that very
*  unprofitable, very uncomfortable, in particular the narrative that was being spun by the media,
*  by the Brexiteers of alienating, of demonising minorities. And as a student of history as well,
*  it was one of my favourite subjects at school and still study it in my part-time, I know where this
*  ends. When you demonise a community, everybody suffers at the end. And Brexit was really,
*  really an eye-opener for me that those that were hidden back, who really didn't say what they
*  thought about people, were now coming out in the open and people being allowed to get away with it
*  as well. The subsequent cost of living crisis, the minorities were always being affected more
*  than anybody else. The poorer got poorer, the richer got richer. And again, this really affected
*  my constituency, my city and people were really, really suffering. And this went on and COVID,
*  I was part of a team during COVID that assisted the community, this is the Muslim community I'm
*  speaking about, to arrange funeral support. And we know while people were practising the COVID rules
*  with dignity and with respect, the government of the time, I don't need to go into, we all know
*  what was happening there. And there seemed to be this real, you know, chasm between those in power
*  and those on the community and those on the ground, those, what we call ordinary people.
*  And when this happened, I mean, what I find that people either become completely disenfranchised
*  from the political system, or they go down a rabbit hole of conspiratorial theories.
*  And this is a really, really dangerous place to be, because this chasm grows between those in power
*  and those on the street. And again, like when racism raises its ugly head, everybody suffers.
*  And then finally Gaza happened. And when Gaza happened, this constituency has a very high
*  majority, very high population of Muslims, and also ethically concerned individuals, over 70%
*  of people wanted a ceasefire. And this seat has been a safe labor seat apart from a year
*  from by election during the Iraq war, where the Lib Dems held it for about a year.
*  And nothing was coming forward, obviously from the government, but nothing was coming forward from
*  the Labour Party. And we had a Labour MP at the time, who remained very, very quiet, very, very
*  quiet for the first three to four weeks after October 7th, with the death of thousands and
*  thousands of Palestinians. And he was at that stage, people were talking about, you know,
*  our votes have been taken for granted in the past. When we needed our MP to say something,
*  nothing was coming forthright, nothing was coming loud and clear. So we must have a candidate to
*  stand in our constituency. I was then selected to be that candidate after a lot of thought,
*  because as I say, I run my optical practices, I have a young family, I have a life that I was
*  leading, I have no political experience. But after much thought and deliberation and conversations,
*  I decided to stand. Now, I'll talk about Gaza shortly, obviously, and it's critical to talk
*  about the genocide being perpetrated by the Israeli state with Western support, including
*  British arms. But I'm interested in Jonathan Ashworth, I guess, as both as him, his loss of
*  the election, but as a kind of case study. I mean, what was the kind of how would you describe the
*  relationship he had before this campaign before Gaza? What how was he seen in the community? Was
*  he well regarded? Did he did he campaign much? Was he visible in the community? How would you describe
*  Jonathan Ashworth as a presence in the constituency? You know, John is was parachuted into one of the
*  safest seats in the country. And as you say, 27 26 and a half thousand in 17, 22,000 in 19.
*  This is the majority I'm talking about, not the number of votes, he had it really comfortable.
*  Unless the South was a was a labor seat apart from that one year during during the Iraq War,
*  there was nothing to be done, really. And John was seen as a figure that was invited to lots of
*  events was respected within the community. It was neither here or neither there, if I'm perfectly
*  honest with you, there was now during the election period, there was a lot of people who were saying
*  that that he was very absent, never seen him before. He wasn't available for for for all
*  constituents. He was seen on national television a lot, but he wasn't grassroots. He wasn't there
*  for the people of Leicester as a tangible as somebody that they can approach somebody they
*  can speak to somebody that was there for them when they really, really needed them. So he wasn't a
*  a reviled figure. He wasn't a revered figure. He was just John Ashworth. It's a labor seat
*  could be anybody there. And that's how he was seen. In terms of Gaza, just let's just talk about the
*  impact that's had because and this is often the kind of narrative on this is very simplistic often.
*  It's not just British Muslim voters who care about the genocide in Gaza, for example,
*  I'm not Muslim. I care passionately about that genocide. Muslim voters also care about many,
*  many other issues, including many of the same issues that everybody else obviously cares about.
*  But there's no question, of course, there's beyond doubt that given there are so many
*  Palestinian Muslims, although some Christians have also been killed by Israel, that this has
*  a naturally a bigger impact in Muslim communities. So I'm just interested in that impact,
*  the impacts of Gaza in the last few months, and not just the conservative position on it,
*  but labor's position. And I'm interested, for example, in very big moments like when Keir Starmer
*  said to LBC that Israel had the right to cut off water and energy to a civilian population,
*  and then was backed by various labor shadow cabinet ministers. And then two weeks later claimed he'd
*  never said what he had actually said. He denied that he believed Israel ever had the right to
*  cut off any of the essentials of life. We could hear him. We heard what he said. That was just one
*  example. And I'm just interested what impact that's had amongst people in the constituency.
*  Yeah, as you say, it affected everybody, not just the Muslim community. And I want to make that very,
*  very clear. I was knocking on doors where there was a Muslim majority in wards, and they were
*  asking me about Gaza. And they couldn't believe the silence of the Labor Party in particular,
*  or the lack of clear condemnation of the actions of the Israeli army. And that was across the board.
*  And this is a really, really important point to label this as just a Muslim-centric concern.
*  This is a humanity concern. And everybody was affected by it. And this is a narrative that
*  really, really has to go out there. Did Gaza play a part? Of course it played a part. But as you say,
*  regardless of a presentation I gave about anything, the things that affect people that are
*  concerned about Gaza, they're affected by everything else. Cost of living and housing. Housing was the
*  most important thing. I'm a healthcare professional, national health service. The environment is very
*  important. Nothing for the youth to do. The lack of business opportunities, etc., etc. These were
*  the things that were really, really impacting the community as well. And the constituencies, regardless
*  of creed, color, religion, everybody across the board. Again, Gaza was very, very important.
*  There's no denying this. But I think Gaza was just a microcosm of a bigger issue here. This was 70%
*  of the constituency calling for an immediate ceasefire with no semantics. Let's not even talk
*  about sending Israel to the International Court of Justice or condemning Benjamin Netanyahu or
*  stopping arms sales. At that moment in time, in the beginning, we just wanted somebody to say,
*  immediate ceasefire. Killing must stop. And nothing came forth. And the trajectory from then from
*  Keir Starmer's statement on LBC, his shadow cabinet, a couple of members saying exactly the same
*  thing, waiting two weeks to make a retraction. People were feeling that they were being fooled.
*  And then we had those council elections. And before that, in fact, there was headlights,
*  Keir Starmer can afford to ignore the Muslim vote, etc., etc. When some councilors resigned from up
*  north from the Labour Party and joined independence, etc. And somebody had quoted from the Labour Party
*  that it was like shaking off fleas. Where was the condemnation? Where was the outcry? Where was the
*  this is not acceptable? Who said these comments? Was there any repercussions? No. So the community
*  felt that the Muslim community have been one of the most committed groups of people to the Labour
*  Party. I think according to the Labour Muslim Network, over 70% on block voted for the Labour
*  Party, historically. And now when they felt they really needed a mouthpiece, people are realistic.
*  They know that as a shadow cabinet or a shadow member of parliament, they can't change the world.
*  But the least you can do is echo what the constituency was feeling, what the people wanted.
*  And they were met with silence. And at the end is the silence of your friends and not the words of
*  your enemies that you remember, according to Martin Luther King. On that, because I did,
*  before I ask about the campaign and what Jonathan Ashworth has said, and also because it is so
*  important to say that, as you say, other issues came up and it was voters of different backgrounds
*  who supported you. But this point about Islamophobia and the Labour Party, I mean,
*  in the Batley spend, you mentioned taking off the fleas is just one example. The Batley and spend
*  by-election, which Labour nearly lost, Labour briefed that they had won the old Conservative vote,
*  but they had lost what they call the Conservative Muslim vote because of anti-Semitism and homophobia.
*  And in 2022, the Labour Muslim Network, which you just mentioned there, they did a poll of
*  Labour Muslim members and supporters. And they asked how well Keir Starmer had, since this
*  publication of a report into Islamophobia and the Labour Party, how well has Sir Keir Starmer
*  handled Islamophobia as the Labour Party leader? 4% said very well, 7% said quite well, 20% neither
*  well nor badly, 18% quite badly, very badly, 46%. I mean, that's got barely any coverage in the
*  Western media. I'm sorry, the British media, I'm one of the only British, I mean, this is not me
*  giving myself a cookie. That's the bare minimum who's talked about this. Well, I mean, do you
*  think this is, you know, this lack of kind of like the way the Labour Party is often seen to
*  be treated the Muslim or how Muslim voters feel is voting fodder. That's what you're kind of getting
*  at, isn't it? Voting fodder. And you've read this whole report, Owen, I'm sure you've got faith with
*  it. There is a hierarchy, every form of hatred, racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, you know,
*  that's all entry drugs to all forms of other racism and homophobia, you know, all other
*  homophobias, etc. You know, these people just do these things online, you know, and Islamophobia
*  is the flavour of the month at the moment, but Islamophobia is not taken seriously. What was the
*  results of the Ford report? What has happened? What have they done? To be clear, just so everyone
*  knows, Martin Ford QC is a barrister, one of the most prominent black barristers in Britain, he was
*  commissioned by Keir Starmer after leaked messages suggested abuse by Labour officials
*  and published a report suggesting a hierarchy of racism with, for example, Islamophobia not
*  taken seriously. Yeah, absolutely. So you're absolutely right. And there was this feeling
*  within, you know, that the Labour Party are taking us for granted, they don't listen to us,
*  they just think we're going to always be there for them. But they've never had a tangible alternative.
*  Are they going to vote for the Tories? You know, few of them will, but very unlikely. Are they going
*  to go to reform? No. Can they believe the Lib Dems were going to win? There wasn't really a strong
*  push or a strong candidate in my constituency for them. So then they had an option of the Greens
*  and myself. And because of the work that I have done, because I'm so grassroots, because I'm
*  embedded with businesses and living here virtually all my life and working, there was a tangible
*  option, a tangible alternative. And this is what all members of the community and all constituents
*  took upon themselves. Because I worked extremely hard, extremely hard to reach out to as many
*  communities and many members of the constituency. There was one month, Owen, where I had over 41
*  engagements. And this is whilst I was working. So this just didn't happen overnight. This wasn't a
*  fluke. This wasn't just some disgruntled individuals. This was a proper campaign. And nobody saw it
*  coming. But you know, this was for the first time, people who have traditionally voted for the Labour
*  Party felt, you know what, there is an alternative. And it is for them to understand that you can't
*  ignore the people you're serving.
*  Before, just quickly, what I'll do is show clips just by Jonathan Ashworth, which you can respond
*  to. But I just wanted to raise the point that GARS was important, but actually other issues also came
*  up as well. So I'm interested in, was the general sense of dissatisfaction with Labour's position on
*  other issues? Was it because people were rebelling? Not that, you know, they were angry with the
*  government, but they were saying Labour's not the alternative we need at the moment. That's what they
*  were saying. There was two things. When I was canvassing, there was two clear things that came
*  across. One was complete apathy. They're all the same. There's absolutely no point voting for you
*  guys. You say one thing, you do another thing. And one person said it very colourfully. And I'm
*  going to change the terminology. He said, I'd rather put my hand in a bucket of manure, mate,
*  and clap. Never heard that expression before. But he said it in a very friendly way, rather than
*  vote. And that was across the board. People just from the Afro-Caribbean community, there's no
*  point in voting, mate. There's just nothing changes. You know, the white working class community in
*  particular, from those in our mostly private areas, absolutely no point in voting. Why should I vote?
*  Nothing changes. So there's complete apathy. And we see that in the numbers. We see that in the
*  turnout. And the second thing which I found really, really surprising is maybe because of the way I
*  look, you may not be a Tory, mate. I'm not voting for the Tories. And even more surprisingly,
*  I'm not voting for the Labour Party. You better not be from the Labour Party. And it was these
*  people that I spoke to and said, look, I'm just like you. I'm a guy from the street. I grew up
*  around the corner. I'm a local business owner. And I don't believe the established parties. And I'm
*  standing as an independent. And those are the people that got me through the line. Because
*  there's this disenfranchisement. And they just don't trust the established parties. And now they
*  had an option. So it was those two things that came across loud and clear. No study needs to be
*  done about it. I can tell you exactly how this was won. And that point about turnout, I think,
*  is so key because as a percentage of the overall adult populations, including whether people are
*  registered or not, it was in this election the lowest turnout of any election since the universal
*  suffrage. So I'm just going to show some clips from Jonathan Ashworth. And just want to hear what he
*  said. I've done a video already going through these interviews. But it's far better, obviously,
*  to hear your response. So let me just start with him on Stiney's with Kay Burley.
*  I'm obviously disappointed to have lost my constituency in pretty brutal circumstances.
*  Tell me about it.
*  I've never known a campaign of such vitriol, such bullying, such intimidation. I've never
*  seen a member of parliament, shocker Adam Patel, get elected on the basis of a foul and obnoxious
*  lie that I was responsible for genocide, that I had the blood of guards and children on my hands.
*  This was his campaign. I had his supporters bullying and intimidating myself and my key
*  supporters in the streets. And he refuses to get out. He's actually gone to ground and he's
*  refusing to answer any questions on this. He's very disrespectful to the people of Leicester South
*  that he's disappeared. But look, there should be no place for bullying and intimidation in politics.
*  Some people said, oh, don't speak out. It looks like sour grapes. I'm a Northern lad. I'm from a
*  different bit of Greater Manchester than you. But we were taught to stand up to bullies.
*  And that's what I'll always do.
*  Well, I think we can all see why intensely aggressive and intimidating person you are,
*  shocker Adam. Just what's your response to it? I mean, he said, so basically he said, I mean,
*  he talked about brutal circumstances. I do think when he's particularly talking about Gaza,
*  MPs talking about the brutal circumstances they're going through. It doesn't sit well with me. I'm
*  not going to lie. But I want to hear your thoughts. He said, he talks about brutal circumstances.
*  He says that he was held responsible for genocide, the blood of guards and children on his hands,
*  and that your campaign was guilty of bullying and intimidation. And it was, and yeah,
*  those are his allegations. I just want to hear what was your response to what he said, sir?
*  Look, I may disappoint you. I'm not as combative. I'm not a Northern lad. I'm from Leicester. We
*  sent sit in the middle of the country and my I am much more balanced individual as a reason for that,
*  as a due to that fact. Now, he was in power for 13 years. He enjoyed huge majorities.
*  Okay. He's probably a decent bloke. I mean, I was acquainted to him. I didn't know him personally.
*  He has now lost that election and he didn't see that coming. And that is why he is so resentful
*  and he's so angry. Everybody, as I said to you, nobody expected him to wave a magic wand and peace
*  would prevail over the Middle East. What people wanted was their MP to speak out on their behalf.
*  And there was they were met with silence. And you know what? People are dying in Gaza. As we speak,
*  two days ago, another strike killed over 90 people, innocent men, women and children. They are the
*  real victims. There was no brutality. There was no accusation from myself or my campaign that he had
*  blood on his hands. These are just, you know, simply not true. You know, we fought, we, I was
*  always taught to amplify what you are about. And that's what we did. You know, we talked about the
*  issues that concern the constituency. We talked about how important the situation in Gaza was
*  and somebody to speak out on their behalf. They know that I'm not going to be able to resolve
*  everything over and over a weekend, but they know they now have somebody who will speak truth to
*  power and hold the government accountable and work with as many people. There are good people
*  across the board to make sure that happens at the soonest and the quickest opportunity. That's what
*  it is. And there was no intimidation on our part at all. When you are an MP that is so comfortable
*  sitting on a huge majority who is absent from his constituents, decides to visit an area and
*  individuals, I will never, never condone violent behavior or abusive language or
*  intimidatory behavior, but to get robust questionings. Now I don't want to demean
*  potholes because obviously that's important or parking issues because that's important.
*  These people were angry because they were seeing whether we like it or not. According to all human
*  rights organizations, United Nations, many human rights organizations, United Nations, there is a
*  genocide going on and people have, if they are not going to be rightfully angry at that particular
*  moment in time, when as a humanity are we going to be angry? And this is what we were faced with
*  because he's never faced it before because he's been so, so comfortable. This was robust questioning.
*  I would be the first one to condemn any form of aggressive behavior. It's not who I am and I would
*  not condone it. This was robust questioning. That's all it was. And to have lost, he did not just
*  lose it on that. You don't suddenly go from 23,000 votes to 13,000 something thousand votes over one
*  issue over one incident. And my campaigners and canvases were also faced with issues, but you know
*  what? I'm not going to address them because that doesn't, because they said things that doesn't
*  mean John felt them. These are just people who are making racial comments to my campaigners.
*  So you've got racist comments, that's very important.
*  Yeah, I would never vote for it. I'm voting for John. I would never vote for a P word
*  that John has nothing to do with that. I'm not going to accuse him of anything. These are people
*  that he has no control over. But it's still horrific to hear that.
*  It is, but it's one of the reasons why I stood that we have to become the change that we want to see.
*  And I will be an MP for even that constituent because that's who I am. We have to represent
*  everybody and make that change. Because he made obviously, when there was a bullying
*  intimidation, that's a serious allegation. So just to show as an example, a video was posted by
*  Majid Freeman, who posted, bumped into Labour MP John Ashworth, who's canvassing Leicester,
*  elderly Muslim uncles who previously supported John came out to ask why he abstained from the
*  Palestine CISFA vote. So he resorted to playing victim by saying we were bullying and intimidating.
*  Let's just give an example. This is important because we can see he said bullying intimidation,
*  lots of images then come into people's heads, don't they? So it's useful to be able to see
*  this is what he's talking about. Do you condemn Netanyahu? Yes or no?
*  See, I am not going to have these guys. I'm just a simple question. Do you condemn Netanyahu?
*  I'm not going to have these guys bullying me off the streets. No one's bullying you. It's a simple
*  question. We're asking you why you abstain for the vote. You have to vote for a CISFA. It's a
*  simple question. No one's bullying you. If you can't answer the question, say it. We're not going to
*  have the people intimidate us. No one's intimidating you. It's a simple question. Why did you abstain?
*  Why did you abstain for the vote for Gaza? It's not a vote. So me asking you why you abstain for
*  the Gaza vote is bullying you. How is that bullying you? We have every right to question
*  why you didn't represent us in Parliament. And if you don't, if you want these people to win this
*  election, if you want the bullies... He doesn't want us to ask him why he abstained from the Gaza vote.
*  If you call us asking you why you abstain, why did you abstain from the Gaza vote?
*  Why did you abstain from the Gaza vote? Why? Stop bullying.
*  It carries on like that. I mean, first, it's not your campaign,
*  that's not your campaign. And it's not, just be honest, that's not bullying intimidation.
*  What does it mean by if you want these people? Not quite sure.
*  So yeah, so he was basically, well, that is quite important, isn't it? He basically,
*  because he was being approached by some local Muslim constituents asking about a ceasefire.
*  Local Muslim constituents, they didn't go see him, he went to see them that particular day.
*  So he was in there, that was in their, that's just in their community locally, and they came across him.
*  What do you say? I mean, what do you, I mean, you know, I guess, I mean, people, I just think it's
*  important to, it's so important in politics, because bullying and intimidation is a problem,
*  and it has to be dealt with. And when people say that, you know, they use those terms,
*  they demean the terms. I guess I look, I mean, let's just hear just finally, I think people
*  are sick of hearing about Trump, maybe now maybe, but let's just listen to just him and LBC about
*  this. A campaign was organized nationally by a national organization called The Muslim Vote,
*  whose campaign was clear on their website, punish MPs. That's the words they used.
*  The word was punish, was it? Punish MPs. It wasn't, we want to affect change on a set of
*  policy issues. Like many of the policy issues I've fought on, whether that's calling for a
*  ceasefire, calling for Palestinian statehood, calling for student finance arrangements for
*  Muslim young people in our constituency. Punish MPs is what the national The Muslim Vote
*  organization talked about. What kind of things happened to you? You sound pretty angry about this.
*  I was chased down the street, shouted at and screamed at for 40, 45 minutes, and still I had
*  to seek refuge literally in a vicarage. And they waited for me outside the vicarage. And even when
*  I came out of the vicarage, they were shouting at me with megaphones, leaflets going around,
*  accusing me of being Genocide John, anonymous leaflets, all in the name of the successful
*  Canada, who won't be able to do anything, who will stand exposed and impotent, not able to affect
*  change, accusing me of genocide, fighting blood in my hands, the vitriol.
*  I mean, again, okay, what was your just general thoughts in response to what you said there?
*  You know, as I'm going to reiterate again, he's very, very upset. He did not see this
*  happen coming and he is now throwing everything possible at me. Now for The Muslim Vote, that's
*  an organization that is engaging the minorities and the Muslim community in particular to be part
*  of the political system. And they endorsed many candidates up and down the country and they weren't
*  all Muslims. And I don't know how big or small they are, but they're not a massive organization
*  and they did not overturn a 22,000 majority. It's simply just not true just to accuse one little
*  organization of doing that. When they use the word, they are holding those MPs accountable
*  that didn't vote for a ceasefire. That's what they meant by that term, that they did not hold,
*  they're holding those MPs accountable and they're asking democratically people to vote,
*  which is the cornerstone of Western civilization, right? Let's get people democratically engaged
*  so they don't feel disenfranchised by voting people out on an issue that is very, very important,
*  which is a genocide happening. And I'll quote, just so people are aware, because it's very
*  misleading the way he said, I don't like the intonation, the Muslim voters, it makes it sound
*  sinister, but he said, we're working so that they said, we're working so that MPs who didn't vote
*  for a ceasefire are punished. And they're talking at the ballot box, punish politicians at the ballot
*  box. I mean, that's the standard, isn't it? Yeah. And with a cross next to the name of the person
*  that you want to put it to and how, you know, this is democracy, this is how it works. And as I say,
*  because we've never had that challenge before in Leicester South, we find it very, very difficult.
*  You know, the other personal accusations, you know, I've worked tirelessly as an independent
*  for six and a half months, seven months, I've sacrificed personally, financially, mentally,
*  you can't even imagine how much work this was. I get elected on the morning about four o'clock on
*  the fifth of July. And it's a whirlwind. I'm in parliament at the weekend. I'm being inducted
*  on Sunday, two days after my election. I'm an independent. I'm going in now creating a team
*  because I have to now be effective. I am going to work so hard for my constituents across the board.
*  This is what I am doing. I'm not going to come back and hit John with any rebuttals. I have the
*  constituency to care about. I have parliamentary work to do. And I am going about doing that. I'm
*  setting up my team, setting up my offices. This is just so much work. I'm not going to go in media
*  and demean myself and attack John personally. And he can say what he likes about me on those terms.
*  People can judge him on that. That's not who I am. I will be judged in five years, I mean,
*  on the work that I do. If I don't do a great job, I will be deselected. I won't be voted in. And
*  fair enough. And hopefully I will shake the hand of the person. If hopefully they won't, if somebody
*  beats me, I will shake their hand and say good luck, rather than what happened to me.
*  How did he respond when you won? Well, there was no response whatsoever.
*  My name was called out. I made my speech impromptu, as many of you have seen. And then John took the
*  stage. He wasn't called upon the stage. And he decided to make his own exiting speech, which
*  wasn't protocol at that particular election night. People started booing. I came interjected,
*  saying this individual has served the city of Leicester South for 13 years and he deserves to
*  say his goodbye speech. In that speech, he made a comment about how ineffective I'm going to be as
*  independent. And then he stormed off the stage without saying a word to me at all or shaking my
*  hands, which is fair enough. That's his prerogative. But it's not something that I would do. And
*  hopefully I would have a lot more decorum about it. Just a couple of things. Again, because it
*  strikes me there's a bit of misconstruing by him going on in that what people object to is he didn't
*  vote for a ceasefire in November. Labour only belatedly voted for a ceasefire four months in
*  after tens of thousands had already been killed. But they did so by gutting the SNP motion, which
*  held his role responsible for collective punishment. That would mean actions, not deeds.
*  They got that stripped away. They don't support ending arms sales. They have purged MPs who've
*  spoken out. They have, as you said, described predominantly Muslim councillors leaving us,
*  shaking off the fleas. I could go on. They didn't support the South Africa case at the
*  International Court of Justice and called it unhelpful. When funding to under the main humanitarian
*  agency in Gaza was pulled, they legitimized that. Lisa Nandy did it. I could go on. Do you think
*  there's an issue here? There's a lack of, there's a slight dishonesty there. He's saying,
*  I'm being held responsible because I am committing genocide. But that's not actually,
*  the opposition didn't hold the government to account and allowed the government therefore to
*  give Israel a blank card and a blank cheque. You see what I mean? Absolutely. They weren't robust
*  enough and they weren't echoing the sentiments of the constituents. And this is what people wanted.
*  They wanted a lot more of a robust challenge of what was happening. Not, you know, working with
*  wordings and semantics and flirting around the issue. They wanted clear, clear, clear and concise
*  language. Two weeks ago, three weeks ago on LBC, do you condemn Benjamin Netanyahu? You've seen the
*  interview. There was a, we condemned some cabinet ministers. No, do you condemn? That's what people
*  wanted. They wanted a clear answer. They wanted a clear answer as Keir Starmer gave when somebody
*  put some custard powder on Stonehenge and said these people should be, which should face the
*  full face of the law, full force of the law. They wanted clear answers on exactly the same
*  thing that was happening as a genocide. They wanted somebody to speak clearly and concisely.
*  People don't understand parliamentary language. They want clear language. And this is what was
*  missing. And this is why they didn't vote for the Labour Party in Leicester South.
*  And just finally then, I mean, I'm interested just the disconnect generally that, you know,
*  other, another shadow cabinet minister lost their seat to a Green MP. West Street in the
*  now health section nearly lost his seat to Liam Mohammed, a 23 year old British Palestinian
*  candidate. I went and did, I went there, followed her campaign. I was really struck. There was huge
*  energy there. I thought something was going on. West Street didn't see that coming. He didn't see
*  that at all. He wasn't doing some big campaign in his constituency whatsoever. He nearly lost by 500
*  votes. Again, a very big majority. I'm just interested kind of what that says about MPs
*  being disconnected from their constituency and what you're going to do differently, because he's
*  saying, Jonathan Ashworth keeps saying, you'll be impotent. He keeps, Freud would have a field day
*  with this guy. He keeps saying that he's independent MPs, they'll be impotent. They won't get anything
*  done. Basically suggesting the implication is only a Labour minister, unless you have a Labour
*  minister as your MP is a waste of time. I mean, that's basically his suggestion. So I'm interested
*  in kind of what you think about what Labour MPs, they don't know their own constituency by the
*  looks of things. He didn't see it coming. And, you know, what you think about where he goes, well,
*  you'll be an impotent, you can't do anything. You know, in Parliament now, I'm not the only one
*  where there's five independent MPs. There are some incredible colleagues in the Green Party, the SMP
*  party, the Lib Dems and some good Labour MPs as well. I'm not partisan in that aspect, in the sense
*  that I will work with everybody, anybody for the right causes and together coalesce and in coalition,
*  we will hold the government accountable. And we will make sure I will work not to save my position
*  in the cabinet, not to please my leader, my only answerable to the constituents of the city of
*  Leicester. And look, nobody thought I could win. And before that, you know, it was I was suspect,
*  I was just that optician, you know, who's going to win this. We made this happen. I support Leicester
*  City. I'm a season ticket holder. The first game I went to, Gary Lineker was on the bench, I might
*  just give my age away there. Yeah. And we all know what Leicester City did. You know, miracles of all
*  miracle winning the Premier League. Judge me by my actions and I will work extremely hard. I'm going
*  to be accessible. I'm going to be visible and I'm going to be a constituent MP and I will hold the
*  government accountable in Westminster and I will be accountable to my constituents in the city of
*  Leicester South. Chuck, that's been a big honour. I think you've given very clear direct answers. And,
*  you know, I hope people can see you've had the opportunity to respond to what's been thrown at
*  you. And, you know, I think people can, I hope people will judge for themselves the tone of
*  Jonathan Ashworth and what he said and how you've come across, how you presented your answers.
*  And so do share this video, everyone, press like, subscribe, get the word out. But Chuck,
*  thanks so much for joining us. And it will be really fascinating to see what you'll be doing
*  as the independent MP for your constituency. Yeah, thank you so much for the opportunity.
*  Always keep me accountable and that's what I will be and I would expect that. And, you know,
*  judge me by my results, but you can be assured you will have a straightforward, honest MP
*  always available for you. Brilliant stuff. Cheers, Chuck. Thank you.
