# Keir Starmer's RACISM Over Palestinian Children Killed By Israel
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [July 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbz7Ox14Dsg)
*  It's not even subtle racism, is it? And events this week have underlined it. There's
*  not even a pretense that Palestinian life has equal worth, or any worth really, at all,
*  from the likes of our Prime Minister, Kirstama, and from other politicians and media outlets.
*  The other conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, both hideous, are happening at the same time, has
*  offered a brutally candid comparison of whose lives matter and whose don't. If describing
*  Gaza as a conflict is accurate or appropriate, given how one-sided it is, a genocidal rampage
*  by Israel is a more accurate way of framing it. None of this, by the way, is to belittle
*  the value of Ukrainian life. We are not guilty of the same sins as our opponents. As I've
*  been clear from the start, Russia launched a war of aggression against Ukraine. It is
*  committing hideous war crimes. Vladimir Putin is a despicable war criminal and he should rot in the
*  Hague for the rest of his life, as far as I'm concerned. The point is, Western leaders have
*  no problems whatsoever in condemning those war crimes. Indeed, a key distinction is that
*  Russia is an official enemy of the West. The West does not arm Russia or legitimise its war crimes.
*  It has imposed sweeping sanctions against Russia. It supports efforts by the International Criminal
*  Court to haul Putin before a court to answer for war crimes. Israel, on the other hand,
*  is backed and armed by Western states, who have justified its genocidal onslaught of self-defence
*  despite pointless hand-wringing. By the way, this is why it is important for us in Western states
*  to speak out so forcefully about Gaza. Because when we condemn Russia's war crimes, we are doing so
*  because morally that is the right thing to do, but it doesn't make any impact. Here in Western states,
*  we have leverage because these war crimes in Gaza are being done because they are facilitated by our
*  own governments. Now, this week, Okhmattyt Children's Hospital in Kyiv was bombed by Russia.
*  Let me quote the Ukrainian President Zelensky. He says,
*  One of the most important children's hospitals, not only in Ukraine, but also in Europe,
*  he said it had been saving and restoring the health of thousands of children. Now the hospital,
*  he says, has been damaged by a Russian strike. There are people under the rubble and the exact
*  number of casualties is still unknown. Right now, everyone is helping to clear the rubble,
*  doctors and ordinary people. Russia cannot claim ignorance of where its missiles are
*  flying and must be held fully accountable for all its crimes against people, against children,
*  against humanity in general. It is very important that the world does not remain silent about this
*  now and that everyone sees what Russia is and what it is doing. This is a hideous crime,
*  and yet more evidence of Putin's criminality. It all sounds horribly familiar to anyone,
*  doesn't it? He has been following Israel's genocide law against Gaza, including, I would say,
*  Russia's own denials. They've denied they're responsible and they blame, would you believe,
*  the Ukrainian state for placing so-called its civil defense in civilian areas,
*  literally using the same lines as the Israeli state. So they say it's not our fault and they're
*  suggesting actually it was the Ukrainians instead. We've heard this before, haven't we?
*  Every, now, if you'd be following Gaza, the same pattern, just a lot worse,
*  not to belittle what's happening in Ukraine, by the way. Every single hospital, every single
*  medical facility in Gaza has been bombed and attacked by Israel. There isn't a single
*  properly functioning hospital left in Gaza. Doctors, nurses and patients have all been
*  slaughtered by the Israeli state. So then in response to this crime, Keir Starmer tweeted,
*  Attacking innocent children, the most depraved of actions. We stand with Ukraine against Russian
*  aggression. Our support won't falter. Well, he's absolutely right. The condemnation of Putin is
*  correct. The point he makes here, attacking innocent children, the most depraved of actions,
*  that's a universal law. Attacking innocent children is the most depraved of actions,
*  whoever those children are and whoever attacks them. It is no less depraved for the Israeli
*  state to slaughter Palestinian children. Indeed, at least 14,000 Palestinian children
*  have been estimated to have been butchered by the Israeli military in the last nine months.
*  One of the highest slaughters of children in any conflict in modern history, in post-war history.
*  And that's happened in the last few months in such a short space of time as a proportion of
*  the population as well. Very few precedents, not for a very long time. But I'm afraid to say that
*  figure is likely to be a dramatic underestimate with three medical researchers in the prestigious
*  Lancet magazine suggesting that using conservative figures, around 186,000 Palestinians in total
*  may be killed by Israeli violence. They say it could be a lot higher. And if we apply the proportion
*  of children we know have been killed throughout, that would mean around 70,000 Palestinian kids
*  killed. Now on its own terms, again, Putin's war on Ukraine is obscene. It's not to belittle the
*  horror to state that Israel's rampage in Gaza is much worse. Not only is that likely to be much
*  higher in number killed in absolute terms in Gaza. Note that Ukraine's pre-war population is 45
*  million compared to Gaza's 2.3 million, so the proportion slaughtered is much higher in Gaza.
*  But Stama has failed all the way through to condemn Israel for war crimes. There's been pointless
*  hand-wringing, sure, but nothing condemning Israel for its depravity. Now there have been so many
*  incidents of Israel butchering Palestinian kids, but the very day after Stama rightly condemns
*  Putin for this slaughter, Israel bombs yet another school, a school sheltering Palestinian
*  kids amongst other civilians. Children who were playing football when the missile hit.
*  Let's hear from the BBC about this. I wanted to bring you the latest news on the Middle East.
*  The news that the Hamas-run health authority in Gaza says at least 29 Palestinians have been
*  killed and dozens more wounded in an Israeli airstrike on a camp for displaced people.
*  Our correspondent Nick Beek is in Jerusalem for us this morning and bring us the latest.
*  Hi Nick, what have you been able to establish?
*  Good morning, John. Well, we've heard from three eyewitnesses who've been talking to the BBC and
*  really they describe a horrific scene after this missile hit yesterday. Just to give you the
*  context, this was a school that was being used as a shelter for lots of families who'd actually
*  been moving from other places trying to seek safety. This missile hit apparently without any
*  warning whatsoever. Local doctors are saying that at least 29 people have been killed, including
*  women and children. Now, the Israeli army say that they're looking into reports of civilian casualties
*  but are saying that what happened was they used in their words a precision weapon to target someone
*  who they said was a Hamas fighter who'd been involved in the October the 7th attacks. But
*  it's worth noting this is the fourth missile strike on schools in Gaza in the past four days
*  and in the previous three cases the Israeli authorities have been saying they were targeting
*  members of Hamas, whether that's Hamas police officers, Hamas politicians or Hamas fighters.
*  Just listen to that. The fourth missile strike in four days. Butchering children as well as
*  men and women justified by a single target allegedly involved in the 7th October. What we
*  know Israel repeatedly justifies strikes which in some cases have slaughtered over 100 to 200
*  people in one go based on a single target. Where is the condemnation from Starler? Where is his
*  denunciation for the depravity of killing children? Those Palestinian kids whose lies are worth no
*  less than the Ukrainian kids. His silence is actually sending a deafening message. Palestinian
*  life doesn't matter. Not to him, not to the British government. The British government
*  officially doesn't believe Palestinian life has the same worth of Ukrainian life or anything close.
*  It's very simple. If you condemn the slaughter of children by an official enemy, but you don't
*  condemn the slaughter of children by an ally, an ally you are arming, then you believe that the life
*  of a child is more or less important based on their ethnicity. We have a word for this in the
*  English language. It is called racism. Yes, I am accusing Kirstein of racism. He's obviously
*  racist against Palestinians. He doesn't see Palestinian life as having equal worth of the
*  lives of others. Now, labor may be forced to shift on Israel because of the success
*  of anti-war independence and greens last week. Well, we have to keep pushing because they're
*  never going to shift their position. These people, they're never going to shift their position because
*  they care about Palestinians. They don't. They will only shift position if people organize and
*  put pressure on them and force them. So that's what we must do. And in the meantime, we must hold these
*  people to account. They're facilitating one of the great crimes of our age and their racist
*  dehumanization and the link of Palestinian life clear for the whole world to see. And they must
*  never, ever, ever be able to get away with that. Please like and subscribe. Do you leave your
