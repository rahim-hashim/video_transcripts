# Israeli Politician Denounces Israeli 'FASCISM' And Genocide - w/. Ofer Cassif
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [December 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc)
*  Now, I've interviewed this brilliant Israeli Jewish politician before Ofa Kaseif. He's a very [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=0.0s)]
*  courageous individual who very, I'm afraid, rarely amongst fellow members of the Israeli [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=6.48s)]
*  Knesset has used his platform to speak out against the horrors being perpetrated against the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=13.92s)]
*  Palestinian people, with of course the direct complicity and facilitation of our own governments [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=20.16s)]
*  here in the West, and he has been forced to pay a price. And what we're going to talk about today, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=26.32s)]
*  not least given Israel styles itself as the only democracy in the Middle East, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=33.6s)]
*  notwithstanding the occupation of the Palestinian people, a form of despotism, which itself is a [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=40.88s)]
*  disqualifier, of course, for any self-styled democracy, the space for basic democratic rights [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=47.92s)]
*  within Israel in its pre-1967 borders is diminishing. And it's worth talking about [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=55.92s)]
*  that. The ability to dissent, to speak out, to criticize, not least the occupation and the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=63.52s)]
*  abominations being perpetrated is shrinking. Now, Ofa Kaseif, as I've said, is a parliamentarian, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=70.8s)]
*  but action has been taken against him. We'll talk about that. Ofa, I should say, maybe for some of [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=77.12s)]
*  my listeners, a relief, I'm having to speak more slowly and loudly because we had a bit of a tech [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=83.28s)]
*  issue. So Ofa needs to be able to hear me properly. I speak too fast anyway, so a lot of viewers are [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=89.76s)]
*  going to be very relieved that this tech mishap has happened. Ofa, can you just start, just explain [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=97.2s)]
*  what action has been taken against you and why? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=104.72s)]
*  Well, there are a few actions that were taken against me and against my comrades, because the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=108.88s)]
*  silencing, the persecution of anyone who raises an alternative voice, anyone who raises a voice, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=116.96s)]
*  a clear voice against the genocide that goes on in Gaza and against other atrocities and crimes [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=124.39999999999999s)]
*  that Israel is guilty of against the Palestinian people, as well as against the Israeli people, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=131.12s)]
*  by the way. So everybody's been persecuted under the guise of fighting terrorism or incitement, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=136.0s)]
*  or whatever lie you can pick. So in my case, as a member of the Knesset, I am supposed to be [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=144.08s)]
*  immune, you know, and to have a more than basic freedom of speech, but that doesn't exist. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=152.32s)]
*  I've been suspended now for six months from the Knesset, apart from voting rights. So I am entitled [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=160.16s)]
*  still to vote in the plenum and in the different committees, but apart from that, I'm totally [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=170.32000000000002s)]
*  suspended. That means that my parliamentarian activity is banned, is blocked, and I cannot [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=176.72s)]
*  actually practice in the parliament, represent the values and the public that voted for us. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=184.8s)]
*  And this is only because, as I said before, they want to silence us. There's nothing, you know, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=191.84s)]
*  honest or lawful in this suspension of mine. It is a sheer political persecution because I've [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=199.84s)]
*  been raising my voice and I will continue, by the way, whatever the price is to raise my voice, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=208.32000000000002s)]
*  against those crimes committed by Israel, against, as I said, mainly the Palestinian people, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=214.96s)]
*  but as I consider it against the Israelis as well. The hostages, even the soldiers that are sent as [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=221.04000000000002s)]
*  cannon fodder only to, you know, on the altar of the government's survival. So because of that, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=228.4s)]
*  because I signed a petition in support of South African appeal to the International Court of [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=236.16000000000003s)]
*  Justice and because I a few times use the term genocide in regard to the ongoing assault on Gaza. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=242.56s)]
*  Because of those, I've been suspended, as I said, for six months and there are thousands of complaints [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=254.16s)]
*  against me organized by fascist organizations and I may be suspended even for more, which is in [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=260.32s)]
*  practice, by the way, impeachment. I say in practice because last February, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=267.12s)]
*  the Knesset actually tried to impeach me. That means to kick me out of the Knesset for good. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=272.48s)]
*  Again, it was totally unlawful, even according to the legal counselor of the Knesset and the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=278.96s)]
*  legal counselor of the government who opposed the attempts to impeach me, saying it was unlawful [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=285.04s)]
*  and a slippery slope, you know, towards banning anyone who the government doesn't like. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=292.0s)]
*  So the government and those who collaborate with it from within the opposition, unfortunately, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=299.2s)]
*  there are many. So because they didn't succeed, they ran short in four votes. They needed 90 to [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=303.6s)]
*  impeach me. They had 86. That means more than 20 for the so-called liberal opposition. So now [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=311.04s)]
*  with the ethics committee, which consists of four members of the Knesset, all of them [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  belong to the right side of the political spectrum, they vote to suspend me. But [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=323.52s)]
*  it seems that it is an impeachment in practice, even if it's not, you know, the jury. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=331.68s)]
*  I mean, you actually, in that original, you mentioned the petition to expel you. You were [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=338.4s)]
*  accused of treason. I mean, when you hear that term treason used to justify expelling an elected [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=345.04s)]
*  member of the Knesset. I was not formally accused in treason. You know, many people, including [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=353.04s)]
*  members of the Knesset ministers and others, refer to me as if I was a traitor. But formally, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=360.32000000000005s)]
*  officially, that was not what they used in their excuses to expel me. What they actually used [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=366.64000000000004s)]
*  if I have the time to explain, and you like me to, in 2016, a very dangerous and the [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=375.04s)]
*  anti-democratic law was enacted by the Knesset, which allows a majority of the Knesset members, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=382.88s)]
*  like I said, 90 out of 120. And there is a process that precedes it. I won't exhaust you with all the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=389.92s)]
*  details unless you want me to. So the eventually they need 90 out of 120 to impeach a member of [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=396.72s)]
*  the Knesset provided one of two conditions are met. One is that that member of the Knesset, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=406.0s)]
*  that is where he's about to be expelled, supported by deeds or words, racism, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=413.92s)]
*  which is ironic because if it was, you know, in play applied, I believe that the 80% of the [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=426.32000000000005s)]
*  Knesset members could not be members of the Knesset. And the other is if a member of the [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=433.68s)]
*  Knesset is accused in supporting terrorism or violence against the state of Israel. Now, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=440.0s)]
*  obviously, neither of those was relevant to in my case, as the legal counselors of the government [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=446.56s)]
*  and the Knesset actually said. But they didn't care because there's no law in Israel anymore. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=452.48s)]
*  Bad law, good law doesn't matter. There's no law. The government violates the law on a daily basis. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=460.96000000000004s)]
*  And so here too, they actually pursued an unlawful process. But eventually they failed, as I said, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=467.20000000000005s)]
*  that's what led them to the ethics committee, you know, alternative. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=477.44s)]
*  In terms of the wider picture, there is legislation which is to amend what is known [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=485.03999999999996s)]
*  as the basic law of the Knesset, the Israeli legislature, which will forbid candidate lists [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=493.28s)]
*  and individual candidates from being able to stand for election if they violate three criteria, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=500.71999999999997s)]
*  denying the right to exist of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state, incitement to racism, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=509.59999999999997s)]
*  and support for the armed struggle of an enemy state or of a terrorist organization [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=515.4399999999999s)]
*  against the state of Israel. Now, could you explain this and not least how in practice these [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=521.4399999999999s)]
*  terms are used in an all-encompassing way, which will prohibit the ability of you, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=528.4799999999999s)]
*  or for example, Palestinian citizens of Israel to be able to stand for election? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=535.12s)]
*  Well, you correctly cited almost word by word the amendment to basic law, the Knesset, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=540.9599999999999s)]
*  that was accepted 40 years ago in 1985. Now, we have to remember that Israel has no constitution, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=550.32s)]
*  just like in Britain. But in contrast to Britain, where, you know, there is a very long tradition [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=559.84s)]
*  of liberal and democratic, you know, political culture since the Magna Carta, you know, we're [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=565.76s)]
*  talking about 1,000 years, in Israel there's none. So we could, you know, dwell upon this issue for [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=573.44s)]
*  a long time. But basically, basic laws are supposed to be a so-called material rather than official [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=581.36s)]
*  or formal constitution, but it is not actually applied in such a way. And that's part of the [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=590.24s)]
*  government still is being, you know, pursuing. But after this amendment was enacted, there were [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=599.12s)]
*  many appeals. I think that all throughout those years, 40 years, every time that there are elections, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=609.6s)]
*  some rightist organizations and parties try to appeal to the elections committee, which consists [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=617.36s)]
*  of parties, by the way, in accordance with the size within the Knesset, to bar different parties [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=629.52s)]
*  or different candidates, individuals, from participating. To make a very long story short, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=638.8s)]
*  the Supreme Court ruled many years ago that because the right to vote and be elected [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=647.0400000000001s)]
*  are the most basic in any democratic system, in order really to ban someone or a [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=655.84s)]
*  a list or a candidate, there must be, so as the Supreme Court said, a mass evidence [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=663.76s)]
*  or mass fact that show that that person or list actually are interested systematically [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=673.92s)]
*  in violating one of those conditions you mentioned before. I rule out for the for a second, of course, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=683.28s)]
*  what is my opinion regarding those conditions themselves. I just take them for granted, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=690.08s)]
*  for granted, for argument's sake. So in order to every time that there was an attempt to bar us, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=695.5200000000001s)]
*  and me in person, in 2019, first time I was, you know, a candidate, there was an attempt to, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=703.6s)]
*  you know, ban me. Of course, the elections committee supported the ban, because, as I said, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=711.12s)]
*  it consists of members of the Knesset and the majority is always with the right. But the Supreme [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=717.52s)]
*  Court revoked it based on what I just said, that there was no mass evidence to show that I supported [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=724.24s)]
*  X or objected Y. Now there's a new bill now that is going to be passed, to pass very soon, I guess, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=731.6s)]
*  in a matter of weeks, that will change. Now they're going to change this amendment [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=741.12s)]
*  to say that it is going to be entrenched into the basic law that says that it's enough if there is [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=748.88s)]
*  a, even one phrase, once, by someone from the list to ban this candidate and even the list as a whole. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=757.36s)]
*  There are some other clauses in this bill. For instance, they're going to reduce the power of [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=768.4s)]
*  the Supreme Court to revoke such decisions that are going to be taken, as I said, by politicians, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=775.4399999999999s)]
*  basically. So the chances, once this law passes, the chances that we are going to be barred from [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=782.64s)]
*  participating in the elections, and not only us, as Kaddash, which is a Jewish-Palestinian partnership [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=792.0s)]
*  for decades, but also all Arab parties, they are going for sure to bar all of us. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=799.76s)]
*  That means that the only democracy in the Middle East, if it wasn't so sad, I would say that [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=811.44s)]
*  that is a very good joke, because Israel was never a real democracy. It was an ethnocracy, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=821.76s)]
*  because it is based, all its governments were devoted to one or another form of Jewish supremacy. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=827.52s)]
*  But now this government is a full-fledged fascist government, very rapidly changes the regime in [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=836.7199999999999s)]
*  Israel into a total fascist dictatorship. There's a list of bills and laws that already passed. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=843.12s)]
*  Including this week, two days ago, for instance. And of course, if they bar us, so it's not only [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=850.7199999999999s)]
*  that we cannot be elected, it means that 21% of the Israeli citizens, I'm not talking about the [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=860.0s)]
*  occupant territories, citizens who are Palestinians, the vast majority of them who vote for us [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=868.24s)]
*  and Arab parties, will not have actually a possibility or an alternative to vote for. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=875.36s)]
*  This is a clear dictatorship. I mean, in terms of that Palestinian population, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=882.32s)]
*  the fifth or so of Israel, we're talking for those to avoid contusion for viewers and listeners, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=889.6s)]
*  that's those within Israel's pre-1967 borders. Israel Katz, who is now the defense minister, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=896.08s)]
*  he declared back, and I spoke about this with Gideon Levy earlier in the week, he declared in [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=903.8399999999999s)]
*  2022, long before 7th of October, when he talked about Israel's Palestinian citizens, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=908.9599999999999s)]
*  yesterday I warned the Arab students who are flying Palestine flags at universities, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=915.6s)]
*  remember 48, remember our independence war and your Nakba, don't stretch the rope too much. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=921.92s)]
*  If you don't calm down, we'll teach you a lesson that won't be forgotten. I apologize, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=929.68s)]
*  that was reported in 2022. He actually said it a few years before. He's referring to, of course, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=935.2s)]
*  the Nakba, the catastrophe when 750,000 Palestinians were driven from their homes, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=940.16s)]
*  15,000 killed at the foundation of Israel. I mean, when I say that, that guy is defense minister, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=946.08s)]
*  he used to be foreign minister. Do you worry about the direction of travel when you get the [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=951.92s)]
*  disenfranchisement of a Palestinian population within Israel itself and the sort of demagogues, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=957.6s)]
*  anti-Palestinian racists at the top of the Israeli government? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=965.52s)]
*  Look, there is a connection between the genocide that goes on in Gaza, the ethnic cleansing that [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=971.44s)]
*  goes on in the West Bank under the smokescreen of the genocide in Gaza. It's very important to [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=977.6s)]
*  emphasize that in the West Bank, the Palestinians still live under occupation and ethnic cleansing [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=985.12s)]
*  goes on there. And only today it was published that there are plans to turn the West Bank into [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=991.12s)]
*  what is now Gaza. So in addition to that, there is a process of turning Israel proper within the [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=998.72s)]
*  borders of prior to June 67 into a fascist state. All of those are connected. They are connected to [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1006.48s)]
*  what the Bezalel Smotrich, who is a bigot, a fascist, a racist, who really believes in racial, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1015.12s)]
*  ethnic, so-called Jewish supremacy, he actually published in 2017 a plan that is called the [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1021.36s)]
*  decisive plan or subjugation plan that boils down to three points. One is annexation of all [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1031.92s)]
*  Palestinian occupied territories without, of course, granting basic civil, let alone political [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1039.76s)]
*  rights to those Palestinians. That means, of course, an official apartheid regime because [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1046.72s)]
*  in practice it already exists. Secondly, those Palestinians who are not going to accept [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1053.84s)]
*  their status as subjects rather than citizens are going to be expelled from their homeland altogether. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1060.32s)]
*  And third, those Palestinians who are going to resist are going to be killed. Everything is [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1067.2s)]
*  very explicitly published. You can even google and find it in English. So when the government [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1072.24s)]
*  announced almost two years ago that they were going to what they called pursue a judicial reform, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1079.3600000000001s)]
*  which is a sugar-coated term to coup d'etat, they actually wanted to made Israel and a fascist [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1087.92s)]
*  dictatorship that would allow it to pursue the subjugation or decisive plan easily. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1096.4s)]
*  Once they failed, especially because the massive demonstrations within Israel against [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1103.2800000000002s)]
*  those attempts, then came the terrible criminal massacre of October 7, and we have to say that [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1111.52s)]
*  was a criminal butchery by Hamas. Once it came, then the government of Israel has been now using [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1119.84s)]
*  it as an excuse to pursue with the very same decisive plan that failed to apply before October [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1130.9599999999998s)]
*  7. So that shows that first, everything is connected. The attempts to revoke, and unfortunately [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1142.16s)]
*  thus far quite successful attempts, basic civil rights within Israel, the genocide in Gaza, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1153.84s)]
*  the ethnic cleansing in the West Bank are all connected under the title of the decisive plan. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1160.56s)]
*  We have to remember that the main target and victim is the Palestinian people, although [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1169.84s)]
*  thousands, hundreds of thousands of democratic Jews who live here and take part like myself in [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1177.2s)]
*  the struggle against fascism, genocide, occupation, etc. We are of course targeted as well. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1185.2s)]
*  But the main victims were targeted by the Palestinians, whether it is within Israel, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1192.56s)]
*  whether it is in the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem. So everything is connected and I must [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1200.72s)]
*  say under the total practical and sometimes even theoretical support of the international community, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1206.8s)]
*  mainly the United States. Before I ask you about Gaza, just one final question about [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1218.0s)]
*  what's happening within Israel itself. Because there are other laws aren't there clamping down [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1225.76s)]
*  on freedom of expression, for example allowing the Israeli police to open investigations about [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1231.6s)]
*  suspicion of incitement to terrorism, which is used in an all-encompassing way without the approval [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1238.0s)]
*  of the state attorney office, for example, legislation pushed in academia to prevent [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1243.76s)]
*  freedom of expression there as well. We saw the banning of Al Jazeera, we saw action taken against [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1252.64s)]
*  Haaretz. Just in terms of how much do you see, just the kind of summary I guess of all these laws [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1259.84s)]
*  one after the other and what that means for the ability to speak out and speak the truth? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1268.8s)]
*  Well, this is part of what I called before the process of turning Israel into a full-fledged [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1276.32s)]
*  fascist dictatorship. There are many laws, for instance two days ago another law was passed, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1281.44s)]
*  another bill was passed into a law, it passed the third reading which means that it is a law now [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1288.8799999999999s)]
*  that allows the police, for instance, to order citizens in Israel to be confined [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1295.04s)]
*  to their houses, for instance, without any judicial process, without introducing evidence [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1302.6399999999999s)]
*  of any kind. And of course it's going to be used not against the Jewish terrorists, and unfortunately [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1312.8799999999999s)]
*  there are many, but against students, professors, artists, anyone who is even in a minimal sense [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1320.64s)]
*  critical of the government. There's a huge list, there's another law that passed two or three weeks [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1333.6000000000001s)]
*  ago that against, by the way, the international law and even some prior laws within Israel [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1341.92s)]
*  that now allows to put in prison minors under the age of 14 if they are involved in terrorism [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1352.5600000000002s)]
*  and only if they are Palestinians. So there's a huge list of laws, you mentioned correctly [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1362.8s)]
*  the war that the government has been waging on the freedom of the press. And also another [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1374.08s)]
*  thing that is very important is the judicial system. I'm very critical, by the way, I have to say. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1384.24s)]
*  I'm very critical of the Israeli media and judicial system. They are far from being ideal, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1390.08s)]
*  to say the least, but still they must be as free as possible and the government is doing exactly [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1395.36s)]
*  the opposite. They launch a war literally against the freedom of the judicial system and the press. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1405.04s)]
*  So for instance, Israel now for a long time has no president or chair of the Supreme Court [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1415.6s)]
*  because the minister of justice, which is ironic to call him like that, by the way, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1423.04s)]
*  refuses, as against, by the way, the rules of the court itself, he refuses to nominate [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1430.72s)]
*  or to even follow the process of electing president for the Supreme Court because he has no majority. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1441.68s)]
*  So there's no law in Israel. The government systematically on a daily basis literally violates [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1450.0s)]
*  the laws of the state themselves, let alone the international law and the rules of the courts. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1459.3600000000001s)]
*  They do whatever they like against the law and against the rules of the Supreme Court. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1466.64s)]
*  This is exactly what fascism and dictatorship are all about. And that's where Israel is standing now. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1475.76s)]
*  We are not on the road into the abyss. We are deep in the abyss already, sinking in the mud [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1485.2s)]
*  down there. And I put a lot of the blame on the international community that has the power [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1496.0s)]
*  to stop it, not only the genocide, but also the crimes that the Israeli government commits [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1503.1999999999998s)]
*  against the Israeli people themselves. And the world just, again, doesn't do anything [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1509.12s)]
*  and sometimes even supports those crimes of the government. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1516.4799999999998s)]
*  Will Barron I'll ask you about that just at the end. There's a couple of other things I wanted [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1520.96s)]
*  to ask you. One, genocide, a word you have no problem in using. Obviously, I agree with you [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1525.76s)]
*  that this is a genocide. Now, I mean, it's interesting in Haaretz, which I mentioned, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1532.16s)]
*  there was a report by an Israeli soldier who talks about how rules of engagement [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1538.88s)]
*  banned the shooting of stray dogs unless their jaws were clenched on the bodies of an Israeli [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1545.52s)]
*  soldier. But no rules existed to protect civilians from being shot who were being indiscriminately [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1554.0s)]
*  slaughtered and then categorized after they were killed as terrorists. I'm just wondering, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1561.44s)]
*  you know, what I've done all the way through this is speak to extremely courageous Israeli [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1566.72s)]
*  figures like yourself, which I'll continue to do so and history will vindicate you for what you [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1571.92s)]
*  have said. I've got no question about that unless we have a very dark future ahead of us. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1577.04s)]
*  But I'm wondering, you know, the polling has been catastrophic, I'll be honest, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1581.8400000000001s)]
*  amongst the Jewish Israeli population. That's why the stance you're taking is so courageous. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1588.64s)]
*  Do you detect any shift? Is there a growing number of, within Israeli society, I'm not [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1594.16s)]
*  talking about the Palestinian population, the 80% plus who are Jewish, do you see any hope that [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1600.8s)]
*  the recognition of the sheer barbarism being inflicted against the Palestinian people, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1608.08s)]
*  that there are growing numbers of people who actually can see that for what it is? What do you [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1614.96s)]
*  think? First of all, I want to say, and it's important for me, that when I say that the Israeli [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1621.2s)]
*  government is guilty in genocide, I do not say that, you know, in order to say, look, I told you [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1628.0s)]
*  so one year ago, you see, I was right. So I'm not saying that, you know, I'm not happy about that [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1635.92s)]
*  because I was right. I'm very sad and painful and hurt. It hurts me that the government of the state, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1644.24s)]
*  of my state, it is my state too. And my struggle is for justice, is for justice in my view, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1654.4s)]
*  justice is universal. So when I fight for justice, it's not for Palestinians against the Israelis or [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1662.5600000000002s)]
*  vice versa. It is for justice for all Israelis and Palestinians alike. And part of it is to fight [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1670.5600000000002s)]
*  against the crimes that my government is guilty of in order to change my society and state to be [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1679.1200000000001s)]
*  good ones. That's part of my struggle. And because of that, it hurts me that I have to say that, but [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1686.0s)]
*  I am committed to the truth because in order, you know, like in medicine, in order to give the [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1693.2s)]
*  right remedy, first you have to make the right diagnosis. So same here. If I refrain, if we refrain [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1699.92s)]
*  from using the right terms, that is genocide. How can we stop it? And how can we change it? [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1707.84s)]
*  And how can we, you know, heal both societies, the Palestinian and the Israeli? This is something [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1716.1599999999999s)]
*  very important for me to say. Now have been saying that my appeal is not only to the international [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1724.24s)]
*  community because alas, we do need the support of the international community without which [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1732.16s)]
*  we have no chance. We are doomed. But my appeal is also to the Israeli society [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1738.4s)]
*  to awake, to be awake, to wake up, to realize what in our name has been done for more than a year now. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1746.88s)]
*  Now I will never stop. I know that I am persecuted. I've been suspended. There's a great chance I'll be [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1757.2s)]
*  suspended again, perhaps even worse. There's a violence, you know, there's violence against people [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1764.72s)]
*  like me. I cannot walk down the street, you know, freely anywhere in Israel. I cannot go shopping, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1772.72s)]
*  for instance, which by the way, that's the good side of the story. Can I ask you, sorry, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1782.96s)]
*  do you fear for your life? Absolutely. I cannot walk down the streets by myself, really, absolutely. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1788.96s)]
*  I mean, there is a violence already because, you know, there is no police anymore in Israel. The [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1799.04s)]
*  police has turned into a private militia of the Minister of National Security, so-called, who is [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1804.16s)]
*  a bloody fascist. They act as if he owned them, the police. And of course, in addition to that, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1812.5600000000002s)]
*  there are many armed militias waiting for the D-Day. Once Netanyahu, Ben-Gvi or anyone else from this [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1822.64s)]
*  fascist government gives the order, they will no doubt shoot demonstrators. Who knows, perhaps a [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1831.2s)]
*  day will come that the mob will invade, you know, private homes to take people out and lynch them. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1840.48s)]
*  That already almost happened a few months ago when a mob penetrated into no less than military, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1849.52s)]
*  Israeli military bases to release soldiers who are suspected, who are suspected in [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1858.24s)]
*  torturing and sodomizing Palestinians, the Tainis. And the police was not there because the [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1867.4399999999998s)]
*  minister don't want them to be there. Why shouldn't they do the same to me or to anyone else who [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1877.1999999999998s)]
*  objects to the government? It's only a matter of time if it doesn't stop now. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1884.24s)]
*  Now, going back to your question- Can I ask just one more question? Because this is important. It's [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1891.68s)]
*  very important. I mean, do you see a moment will come when you feel you have to flee Israel for [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1895.76s)]
*  safety? Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. Some people already left. Some of them because they are, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1901.76s)]
*  most of them, I guess, because they just don't feel like home. They don't want their children [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1910.32s)]
*  to be educated in such a system, to be sacrificed in vain on the altar of this fascist government [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1914.8799999999999s)]
*  and the well-being of the settlers, for instance. They don't feel free. But some of them, and I know [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1923.12s)]
*  personally some of them, left Israel because they are afraid. It's already begun. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1930.32s)]
*  It's already begun, you know. It's not something that may happen in one month or one year. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1939.5200000000002s)]
*  It began already. Some people left. I don't know, I cannot tell you how many, but some people left [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1947.1200000000001s)]
*  because they are afraid. Absolutely. So that's what I've been saying before. When I'm talking [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1954.4s)]
*  about Israel turning into becoming a fascist regime, I do not use those terms like fascism [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1962.24s)]
*  or genocide, you know, very lightly. Allow me to say that as a professor at the university for many [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1970.48s)]
*  years, and you know that my PhD is from England, and I was teaching there as well for two years [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1977.36s)]
*  at London School of Economics, I know something about what fascism is and what genocide is, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1983.28s)]
*  academically speaking. And when I use those terms, as I said before, painfully, [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1990.8s)]
*  I use them not for political, cynical reasons, but as a diagnosis, as if I was an [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=1999.6s)]
*  M.D. who had to diagnose patients. The reason I find this, well, it's chilling on its own terms, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2007.36s)]
*  but if we were to think about pre-war... So we're going to hear you. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2015.9199999999998s)]
*  Oh, sorry. I was saying the reason I find this so chilling is chilling on its own terms, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2020.32s)]
*  is if we think of particularly pre-war antisemitism, obviously all Jewish people [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2026.24s)]
*  were affected by antisemitism, but there was a particular type that targeted left-wing Jews, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2032.48s)]
*  treating them as the enemy within, as traitors to their own country. So when I hear a [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2038.8s)]
*  Jewish leftist talking about how they might have to flee Israel on the grounds that the mob might [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2046.0s)]
*  come for them, it's, I mean, I don't know what, it's difficult to put into words how disturbing that is. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2052.96s)]
*  It is disturbing, and I've been warning of that for over a year now, but nobody wants to listen. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2060.72s)]
*  I am suspended time and time again. That's the second time I've been suspended in the last year, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2066.56s)]
*  because I insist in telling the truth. I'm not suspended because I was lying. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2072.48s)]
*  Actually, I am suspended. I've been suspended because I'm telling the truth and they want to hide it. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2079.52s)]
*  But I began to say, I wanted to say, going back to your question before, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2085.52s)]
*  there are thousands of Israelis, Jewish Israelis, who feel and think more than they do. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2092.48s)]
*  They think more or less like me. That does not necessarily mean that they think exactly like me. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2102.16s)]
*  I hope not, because I prefer the heterogeneous thinking. But many people, and diversity, of course, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2108.16s)]
*  but thousands and thousands of people, citizens in Israel, Jewish citizens, sometimes even take the streets. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2116.16s)]
*  But there is a fear going on because of the violence and the threats, etc. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2126.16s)]
*  People, you know, have been fired from their workplaces and from their studies at the university [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2132.16s)]
*  because of participation in demonstrations, by the way, or because they tweeted or posted something [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2138.16s)]
*  not in support of violence of Hamas Perish the Thought, but sympathy for the victims, for instance, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2144.16s)]
*  and they are using the ongoing attacks on Gaza. So people are afraid. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2152.16s)]
*  But there are hundreds of thousands, you know what, perhaps millions of Jewish in Israel who oppose the genocide, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2158.16s)]
*  not only because they are afraid and just be so for the lot or the faith of the Israeli hostages, [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2168.16s)]
*  but because they know that what's going on in Gaza is unjust, is evil. There are thousands like that. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2176.16s)]
*  We cannot generalize and think that all Israelis, Jewish Israelis think the same. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2184.16s)]
*  The Israeli society is very polarized. The problem is that the fascists, the racists, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2192.16s)]
*  and I dare say, unfortunately, I must say that there are also Nazi thugs in Israel in the streets. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2200.16s)]
*  And those are stronger at the moment. They are fearless because they are backed by the government. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2210.16s)]
*  So especially in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, but within Israel proper as well. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2220.16s)]
*  And but on the other hand, there are thousands who stand firm against them. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2228.16s)]
*  You know, people, Jewish Israelis, every almost every day accompany Palestinian shepherds in the West Bank [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2235.16s)]
*  to protect them from the violence of the settlers and the occupation forces. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2246.16s)]
*  And they take a risk by doing so. We cannot forget that. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2251.16s)]
*  So there is a very good reason on the one hand to be very worried and very pessimistic. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2256.16s)]
*  But on the other hand, still there is hope. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2265.16s)]
*  There is a reason to be optimistic as long as there are thousands of people who oppose those crimes [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2268.16s)]
*  and do something about it, not only oppose in their living room watching the telly and cursing. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2277.16s)]
*  Finally, I suppose a two part question, because I think they might be linked. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2283.16s)]
*  Certainly by looking at the history of South Africa, I think they're linked. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2290.16s)]
*  But you mentioned the so-called international community. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2295.16s)]
*  I mean, now with Trump in the White House, with right wing zealots, fanatical Christian evangelicals [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2299.16s)]
*  who have a religious underpinning for their uncritical devout pro-Israel positioning. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2308.16s)]
*  But I mean, if you think, for example, of the British government, what message would you have for the British government? [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2315.16s)]
*  And do you think, I mean, in terms of how this ends one day, if you have a land which is shared on the basis of equality [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2321.16s)]
*  and justice by all who live there, be they Jewish, Palestinian, how do we end up there? [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2329.16s)]
*  Is it about not, within Israeli society, as courageous as people as you are, you're marginalized. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2337.16s)]
*  Does this end because enough pressure is forced by the citizens of the West on their own governments to stop facilitating these crimes? [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2344.16s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you what I told the senior official in the British government that I met a couple of weeks ago. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2355.16s)]
*  And what I said, there were three main things. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2364.16s)]
*  First, respect the decision, the rule by the ICC to arrest Netanyahu and Gallant if they land in England and Britain. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2369.16s)]
*  This is one thing. Secondly, recognize the Palestinian state, as many states around the globe in the UN did. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2380.16s)]
*  It's time for the British government to do that too. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2388.16s)]
*  And third, which is more important, or it's a kind of overarching statement, given the former two, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2392.16s)]
*  is that the British government, like any other government, must understand that there is a distinction between the Israeli government and the Israeli people. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2403.16s)]
*  One who supports the Israeli government actually acts against the Israeli people. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2414.16s)]
*  If one wants really to stand by the Israelis, one has to object the Israeli government, [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2422.16s)]
*  because the Israeli government is not only guilty in genocidal crimes against the Palestinian people, as I said in the beginning of our conversation, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2433.16s)]
*  it is also guilty in crimes against the Israelis, not only by sacrificing knowingly more than 100 now Israeli hostages who have been dying in agony in Gaza. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2442.16s)]
*  And Netanyahu is the one who foiled time and time again any possibility to reach an deal and release them. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2459.16s)]
*  And not only by sending soldiers, many of them young people, almost youth, 18, 19, as a cannon fodder in vain, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2468.16s)]
*  no strategy beyond what I said before, colonization, etc. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2481.16s)]
*  It's not only that, they've been sacrificing the whole society of Israel, because everything this government does is either for the better, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2488.16s)]
*  for the interest of Netanyahu individually, especially vis-à-vis the trial he's standing in. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2500.16s)]
*  And secondly, because there are bigots within the government who truly believe that the blood of human beings, Palestinians and Israelis alike, [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2512.16s)]
*  is the red carpet for the Messiah. And those who support this bigot, this fanatic government, acts against the people of Israel, let alone the Palestinians, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2522.16s)]
*  that's not only a mistake and error, that's a crime that history will judge. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2534.16s)]
*  I think that's a beautiful place to end. Your courage, your integrity, your moral clarity, as always, shine through. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2543.16s)]
*  History is of course littered with examples of those who speak the truth and suffer the consequences in their own age. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2553.16s)]
*  History takes a very different look. And history, unless we have a very dark future, which I can't rule out, unfortunately, [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2562.16s)]
*  unless history continues to take a very dark turn, you will be vindicated. And I hope you always know that. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2569.16s)]
*  I hope that sense of standing on the right side of history gives some strength in very difficult times. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2576.16s)]
*  Please, for everyone listening and watching, share the video, get the message out. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2584.16s)]
*  It's so important we stand with people like Ofer when he's taking such a courageous stand and that his words are heard. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2589.16s)]
*  They educate people. So share the video, press like, subscribe, leave comments. That helps get the video shared. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2595.16s)]
*  But Ofer, what a pleasure as always. Great to speak to you. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2601.16s)]
*  Same here. Thank you so much. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tc1Yw3-8Yc&t=2604.16s)]
