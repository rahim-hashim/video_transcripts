# Starmer's VILE Response As Slaughtered Palestinian Kids Raised By Protester
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [September 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnl_JrHQ_-g)
*  This is truly vile stuff, nauseating frankly, and it really does somewhat what Labour has
*  become and it's contempt for the Palestinian people and that really is putting it lightly.
*  Now there have been instances of protests at Labour Party conference over the genocide
*  in Gaza and specifically the government's complicity in it.
*  Today, Sarkir Starmer, the Labour Prime Minister who gets rich people to buy his clothes for
*  him did his big annual speech and he was heckled by a young Labour Party member.
*  Starmer had said, preceding this heckle, every child, every person deserves to be respected
*  for the contribution they make.
*  The heckler yelled, does that include the children of Gaza?
*  Let's listen to that heckling and the Prime Minister's response.
*  My sister, my sister was a...
*  I think this guy's obviously got a pass from the 2019 conference.
*  We changed the party.
*  Well that's absolutely hideous isn't it?
*  A young Labour Party member is yelling about the slaughtered and maimed and starving and
*  grieving and traumatised children of Gaza and the Prime Minister, Sarkir Starmer, laughs
*  and suggests that this protester belongs to the Labour Party of 2019.
*  Presumably the message there being, we're a changed Labour Party, the Labour Party of
*  the past might have cared about murdered Palestinian children but this Labour Party doesn't.
*  It doesn't have a soul or a conscience.
*  It's just not possible to behave like that and to believe Palestinian children are human
*  beings.
*  I just don't accept it.
*  Imagine someone had been heckling about dead, slaughtered Israeli children after the 7th
*  October and a politician behaved like that.
*  There would be a massive political scandal and that would be the end of that politician's
*  career.
*  What does it say about today's Labour Party that its members would cheer that kind of
*  response on?
*  What about the fact that the media in this country failed to condemn the Prime Minister's
*  behaviour?
*  Well again it underlines that most of the media simply do not believe Palestinians are
*  human beings, not with any equal worth, not even with a fraction of the worth of say an
*  Israeli or a Brit.
*  Now I should also point out this underlines how duplicitous and dishonest Starbite is.
*  Who does he think he was in 2019?
*  Some outsider, bystander?
*  No, he was then in the shadow cabinet pretending to be then Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's
*  best friend.
*  Here he is just after the 2019 Labour Party conference.
*  You're loyal to Jeremy Corbyn and you've spoken in his defence just now but Louise
*  Elman says that he is a danger not just to the Labour Party but to the entire British
*  Jewish community.
*  I don't accept that.
*  I don't accept that.
*  I'm 100% behind Jeremy Corbyn.
*  I am working with Jeremy Corbyn to try to win the next general election.
*  Now there has been ridicule at this particular slip from Starmer in the speech.
*  I call again for immediate ceasefire in Gaza.
*  The return of the suffragettes.
*  The hostages.
*  Weird and embarrassing but not the moral outrage of this response which I showed you to the
*  slaughter of the Palestinian people, Palestinian children specifically, which Keir Starmer
*  is directly complicit in with the continued arming of the Israeli state despite a measly
*  8% of arms licences being suspended and the continued provision of parts for F-35 jets
*  which are raining death on Palestinian children.
*  Now this young protester was interviewed after being taken away in a police van.
*  Now can I just say for a minute, what the hell was he doing in a police van?
*  If we heard in a foreign country news of a protester being bundled into a police van
*  because they heckled the country's leader about the killing of children with their country's
*  weapons, we would conclude pretty quickly they were some sort of tin pot dictatorship,
*  would we not?
*  Now let's listen to him.
*  What did you want to say to the Prime Minister?
*  I just, I hadn't planned on saying anything.
*  It's just when I heard him speak about how he wants to cease firing Gaza and Lebanon,
*  just the hypocrisy on how every day we're still sending British bombs and British bullets
*  that are being used in Lebanon and in Gaza right now.
*  And the Prime Minister, he could stop that, he could stop that right now but he doesn't.
*  And he just, he says that he wants things to stop but he won't lift a finger to actually stop them.
*  So you weren't planning on saying anything, you would just move to say it while he was speaking?
*  No, no, I was a delegate, I'm a Labour Party member.
*  I hoped I'd be one for life but I suspect not now.
*  But just what's happened and just the complete failure of the Labour Party and Kistama to address it,
*  it's just completely sick now.
*  What more specifically do you want from them?
*  Complete suspension of arms sales to Israel, embargoes, sanctions,
*  whatever it takes to stop this genocide that is currently occurring,
*  not just empty plasitudes to conference halls full of people who support it.
*  Can I ask what your job is or are you a student?
*  I'm a student.
*  Are you happy with Kistama as Labour leader?
*  Absolutely not, no.
*  Although it's not just him, it's the party in general and the wider political establishment
*  for not being supportive of taking the action that is required to stop this genocide
*  and actually stop the war like they claim they want to do.
*  Can you tell us what was going through your head as you were sat there
*  and what was the moment you decided to stand up and start over?
*  I was just angry, myself I guess for not saying anything at the time,
*  but again like I say, just for him coming out to say that he wanted to ceasefire,
*  not taking any of the actions that he could,
*  not lifting a finger enough to do it.
*  I know I was just angry, but in the end I decided I'd like to do it.
*  How many?
*  Sorry, go on.
*  Did you want to, I don't know if you heard what Kistama said back at you,
*  he said you must have a pass from 2019 and they've changed the Labour Party,
*  what do you make of that?
*  No, I joined in 2022 when he was leader.
*  I thought he would be able to do what he said,
*  to be a more moderate force that could win the election
*  and still deliver change, but he hasn't delivered change.
*  That young man is principled, eloquent, full of integrity and humanity,
*  in other words, the exact opposite of our Prime Minister.
*  Now as you can hear there, the Prime Minister's vile claim
*  was also a nonsense on its own terms.
*  This young man wasn't old enough to even vote in the 2019 election,
*  he wasn't at the Labour Party conference,
*  he joined the Labour Party not under Jamie Corbyn,
*  but under Kirst Stammer in 2022
*  and he supported Stammer's leadership at the outset.
*  Why is it so hard for the Labour leadership to understand
*  that not supporting genocide,
*  not supporting the mass slaughter of kids,
*  of little children, is not an extreme or fringe opinion?
*  The fact is that the Labour leadership backed Israeli war crimes in opposition
*  and in government is still complicit in the war crimes being committed
*  every single day by the Israeli state.
*  Now that wasn't the only protester at Labour Party conference
*  who focused on the genocide in Gaza
*  and the government's complicity in that genocide.
*  Let's just see this from the speech of Rachel Reeves,
*  the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
*  They paid the price for their incompetence,
*  their dishonesty and their rule breaking.
*  We are still selling arms to Israel.
*  I've walked with a vote of the Taze web trial
*  and I'm proud of that.
*  This is a change Labour Party,
*  a Labour Party that represents working people,
*  not a party of protests.
*  The way he's violently manhandled is just disgusting,
*  it's absolutely nauseating.
*  Now I've got a longer interview with this also courageous young protester
*  included in the documentary which we record every year at Labour Party conference.
*  This year's 2024 will be published in the morning,
*  do check that out, but I just want to show you his injuries.
*  He was really aggressively manhandled
*  and it was really grim to watch, I was shocked.
*  You can just see here on your neck
*  where you're grabbed by your neck
*  and I can see it on your arms as well.
*  It turns out that the man briefly manhandling him
*  was actually a Labour Party councillor.
*  Now it tells you everything you need to know again
*  about the authoritarianism which runs through the Labour leadership
*  under Keir Starmer, completely intolerant of dissent,
*  and it's genocide as though they were violent criminals.
*  Indeed, it's a sick irony that this man protesting against Britain
*  arming a mass slaughter of children
*  was arrested for quote unquote, breach of the peace.
*  Now we can see here how the heart, the soul
*  has been ripped from the Labour Party
*  which only won the election because of Tory self-destruction.
*  It's leadership's behaving as though they won like 38,
*  sorry 45% of the vote even, 50% of the vote, 60% of the vote,
*  when they actually got 33.7% of the vote
*  on the lowest turnout in the democratic history of Britain
*  which means they got, wait for it,
*  fewer votes than Labour in 2019.
*  And this is also absolutely true.
*  This time round just 17.52% of British adults voted for it.
*  Now they could go on, oh well we won with this system,
*  the system's what matters, fine.
*  You won because of the absurdity of our electoral system,
*  frankly, the massive landslide that you got.
*  But that doesn't mean people have enthusiasm for you.
*  You're only one marginally higher share than 2019
*  which Keir Starmer was ridiculing and fewer votes
*  and you got a lot less than Jamie Corbyn got in 2017
*  when Labour got 40% of the vote and also far more votes.
*  The fact is this Labour leadership,
*  this Labour Party is authoritarian, unprincipled, brittle,
*  but also complicit in one of the worst crimes of our age.
*  That's what these protesters were making loud and clear
*  and they should be very proud of themselves.
*  Now the video at Labour Party conference has been done,
*  I have to say, very chuffed with the brilliant videographer
*  Jack Powerclough, do check out his work,
*  I just wandered around with a microphone,
*  or a silly microphone as a Starmer supporting journalist
*  described it, it's just a microphone.
*  I do think it shows what Labour is, what it currently is.
*  Do check that out in the morning.
*  But in the meantime, please like and subscribe,
*  leave your thoughts in the comments,

*  We're going to Conservative Party conference,
*  even though they've barred me.
*  That's right, every year, pretty much,
*  it's 2015, 2015 onwards, so about a decade,
*  I've got to Tory Party conference and I've recorded a video.
*  At this time round, after they've lost,
*  they've refused me a pass.
*  Embarrassing stuff, isn't it?
*  We're still going to go,
*  we'll just hang outside the conference
*  and run after their shadow ministers,
*  their remaining MPs, not many of them,
*  and their activists and their members to see what's going on.
*  They should be grateful for any attention they get.
*  If anything, they should be paying me to go.
*  Anyway, do check that out.
*  Speak in a bit.
