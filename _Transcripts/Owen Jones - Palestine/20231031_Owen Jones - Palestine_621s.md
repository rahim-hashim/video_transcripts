# EXPOSED: Israeli Ethnic Cleansing Plot
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo)
*  This is huge and absolutely chilling and it exposes the scale of the crime which Israel could now be undertaking. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=0.0s)]
*  An official document from the Israeli Ministry of Intelligence has been leaked. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=9.0s)]
*  It's in the hand of some dissident Israeli newspapers and this official document recommends the forcible and permanent removal of Gaza's 2.2 million Palestinians to Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=14.0s)]
*  We have a term for this. It is called ethnic cleansing and it is a grave war crime. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=28.0s)]
*  It was a grave war crime which was used to justify the West going to war against Bosnian Serb leaders and Slobodan Milosevic's regime in the Balkans back in the 1990s. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=35.0s)]
*  It's a 10 page document as these journalists report dated the 13th of October bearing the logo of the intelligence ministry. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=46.0s)]
*  It has three options for the Palestinian people in Gaza. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=55.0s)]
*  The course of action it recommends is this euphemistic term, a full population transfer, that is ethnic cleansing. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=58.0s)]
*  It recommends Israel acts to evacuate the civilian population to Sinai during this war, establish 10 cities and then more permanent cities in northern Sinai, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=66.0s)]
*  then create a sterile zone of several kilometres within Egypt and prevent the return of the population to activities slash residencies near the border with Israel. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=78.0s)]
*  Now it goes on. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=88.0s)]
*  The messages should revolve around the loss of land, making it clear that there is no hope of returning to the territories Israel will soon occupy, whether or not this is true. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=90.0s)]
*  The image needs to be, I'll make sure you lose this land because of Hamas's leadership. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=97.0s)]
*  There is no choice but to move to another place with the assistance of your Muslim brothers. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=102.0s)]
*  It is there in black and white. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=107.0s)]
*  Now there is an important nuance here. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=109.0s)]
*  The intelligence ministry does not have as big a role as its name might suggest. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=110.0s)]
*  It doesn't have binding recommendations, but rather studies, its policy papers are submitted to the Israeli government and security agencies for review. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=114.0s)]
*  But do note this. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=123.0s)]
*  It is headed by a politician named Gila Gamliel, who is a member of Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=125.0s)]
*  But crucially, she is regarded as a relative moderate. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=132.0s)]
*  So this plan for ethnic cleansing on a mass scale has been proposed by the ministry of a supposed moderate in Benjamin Netanyahu's party, a party which is extreme enough, but it's in correlation with even more extreme elements than that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=135.0s)]
*  Now it's been discussed in the context of personal and political maneuverings by the likes of this politician. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=155.0s)]
*  But the fact is that this is a senior Israeli politician regarded as a relative supposed moderate, and it shows where discussions at the top of the Israeli government have headed. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=160.0s)]
*  We've already seen Benjamin Netanyahu demand all of civilian, all of Gaza's civilian population flee near the start of this horror and impossibility. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=170.0s)]
*  Of course, they're trapped. It's an open air prison camp. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=177.0s)]
*  And then an official demand from the Israeli state for the population of northern Gaza to flee within 24 hours, which was condemned by the United Nations as a violation of international law and by the Norwegian Refugee Council as the war crime of forcible population transfer. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=181.0s)]
*  We've heard Eli Cohen, Israel's foreign minister, say that after this war, Gaza will shrink, i.e. that Israel will permanently occupy at least part of its land. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=199.0s)]
*  The former Israeli deputy foreign minister and now Israel's ambassador to the UK, Zippy Hoteveli, who once declared that between the sea and the Jordan River, there needs to be one state, only the state of Israel, demanding, in other words, mass annexation of Palestinian land. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=207.0s)]
*  Gideon Saar, the Israeli minister, said in an interview that Gaza must be smaller at the end of the war. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=223.0s)]
*  Whoever starts a war against Israel must lose territory. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=230.0s)]
*  Yov Galan, defense minister, saying Gaza won't return to what it was before. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=232.0s)]
*  We will eliminate everything. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=236.0s)]
*  The Egyptian regime has been repeatedly warning that Israel's plan is to drive Gaza's population into the Sinai desert. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=238.0s)]
*  We know the former Egyptian dictator Hosni Barak came under pressure from Washington to seed Egyptian territories in the Sinai desert to create a Palestinian state. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=245.0s)]
*  Now, if this evidence, all these reams of evidence, were coming from Putin's key allies or say from Serb leaders in the 1990s, it would just be seen as a slam dunk case. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=254.0s)]
*  Politicians, Western politicians, would be howling about it, as would it be heading key news broadcasts of a state undertaking and preparing for even graver war crimes, not least ethnic cleansing. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=263.0s)]
*  Now, it goes further. Let's hear from Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=280.0s)]
*  You must remember what Amalek has done to you, says our holy Bible. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=284.0s)]
*  And we do remember, and we are fighting our brave troops and combatants who are now in Gaza or around Gaza and in all other regions in Israel, are joining this chain of Jewish heroes, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=289.0s)]
*  a chain that has started 3,000 years ago from Joshua Benun until the heroes of 1948, the Six Day War, the 73 October War, and all other wars in this country. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=304.0s)]
*  Our hero troops, they have one supreme main goal, to completely defeat the murderous enemy and to guarantee our existence in this country. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=317.0s)]
*  We've always said never again. Never again is now. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=329.0s)]
*  This is what he said. You must remember what Amalek has done to you, says our holy Bible. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=335.0s)]
*  So let's just read from 1 Samuel 15.3. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=341.0s)]
*  Now go and smite Amalek and utterly destroy all that they have and spare them not, but slay both man and women, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=344.0s)]
*  How is that not a call for genocide? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=353.0s)]
*  Imagine a Muslim leader was quoting Quranic verses amounting to the same thing in the context of war. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=356.0s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=366.0s)]
*  We'd never hear the end of it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=370.0s)]
*  Now we heard the former deputy commander of the Gaza Division of Israel's military say, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=372.0s)]
*  We're not taking any chances when our soldiers are maneuvering. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=377.0s)]
*  We are doing this with massive artillery, with 50 airplanes overhead, destroying anything that moves, destroying anything that moves. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=380.0s)]
*  And that's from one of the former senior official in the Gaza Division. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=388.0s)]
*  That comes on top of Israeli leaders and officials saying that they will turn Gaza into a city of tents. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=393.0s)]
*  Are you raising it to the ground? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=398.0s)]
*  They are saying what they mean. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=400.0s)]
*  Believe them. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=412.0s)]
*  So listen then to Francesca Albanese, the UN special reporter on Palestine, who says with necessary passion what Israel is actually doing. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=413.0s)]
*  I don't know if Amal is scared or not, but I know that it's Israel's responsibility not to bomb 360 square meters. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=421.0s)]
*  Kilometer strip of land where the people are besieged. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=429.0s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=433.0s)]
*  I cannot be in an interview where I've just heard someone saying we are doing everything that we can to avoid the civilian loss of life. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=434.0s)]
*  This is not true because 8000 people have already been killed. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=443.0s)]
*  And if the commissioner general of UN says that 3500 children, around 3500 children have been killed, even if it's not fully verified, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=446.0s)]
*  it means that it's likely, highly likely because UNRWA has staff members who have been killed. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=458.0s)]
*  There are journalists who have been killed. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=465.0s)]
*  Fifty percent of the civilian infrastructure in Gaza has been destroyed. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=467.0s)]
*  The Palestinians in Gaza have nowhere to go. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=470.0s)]
*  Please imagine what it is to have 2 million people, 200,000 living in 300 square meters, which is being bobbed north to south. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=473.0s)]
*  Where do these people have to go? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=482.0s)]
*  There is no safe haven. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=484.0s)]
*  These people are trapped and they're being killed. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=485.0s)]
*  This is what Israel is pursuing. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=489.0s)]
*  Now, she actually warned at the end of that interview about the risk of genocide. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=491.0s)]
*  That's a senior UN official. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=495.0s)]
*  In over in just in three weeks, there have been over 8000 deaths. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=497.0s)]
*  That could be an underestimate given the number trapped under rubble. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=501.0s)]
*  Over 3000 of them children, she reports. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=504.0s)]
*  Half the damages, damages are destroyed. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=506.0s)]
*  How many more are going to die in the coming weeks if that's already how many have died in the opening salvos? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=508.0s)]
*  The risk is clear. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=515.0s)]
*  A mass slaughter of a scale, which frankly is something which should chill us and disturb us because the death toll is already hideous. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=517.0s)]
*  But it could be a mass slaughter culminating in the permanent mass expulsion of the Palestinian population of Gaza. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=529.0s)]
*  This is one of the gravest crimes being committed of our time and it is not being hidden by Israeli leaders. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=534.0s)]
*  I must keep repeating that they're not trying to disguise their intentions. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=541.0s)]
*  They are being open, shamelessly open about the war crimes they are committing. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=544.0s)]
*  And in a just world, they would be hauled before a international criminal court to face charges of war crimes. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=548.0s)]
*  And part of the evidence would be these statements that they have made in which they did not disguise their intentions to commit grave war crimes for which they should be punished with the same life sentences that have been imposed on other such war criminals. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=559.0s)]
*  But our governments are not condemning these war criminals. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=576.0s)]
*  They are complicit in their crimes. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=579.0s)]
*  And in this country, the government and the main opposition party have rallied behind them. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=580.0s)]
*  It is those who support these war crimes who are being portrayed as moderates and those who oppose these war crimes, oppose the mass slaughter of little children who are being treated as morally indecent extremists who deserve to be hounded and purged and demonised and silenced. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=585.0s)]
*  Well, I know how history will judge each of them. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=605.0s)]
*  Again, they are being open and honest. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=609.0s)]
*  They're not pretending. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=613.0s)]
*  Believe them. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt20GUg7bUo&t=614.0s)]
