# They Fought Gaza Genocide. Britain Locked Them Up Like TERRORISTS - Their Mothers Speak Out
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0)
*  It's over a year now since Israel's genocide against the Palestinian people in Gaza and beyond [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=0.0s)]
*  began. And of course, that genocide has been directly facilitated by Western governments, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=5.84s)]
*  including the British government. Now, 8% of arms sales to Israel were suspended, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  8%, 92% weren't. The British government essentially apologized, but the back was [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=19.2s)]
*  apologizing for doing that in the first place. Also crucial components, for example, the F-35 [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=24.48s)]
*  jets, which rain death and destruction in Gaza continue to be given to the Israeli state for [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=29.84s)]
*  those purposes. Now, how will history judge those who did talk certain actions during this period? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=35.2s)]
*  How will they judge British government ministers who continue to facilitate genocide? And as things [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=44.16s)]
*  stand, have huge salaries, are chauffeured around. And how will it judge those who tried to do [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=51.2s)]
*  something to stop a genocide, which is what we're talking about here. And those people, as things [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  stand, are not being chauffeured around. They're not on huge extortionate salaries. They're being [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=64.56s)]
*  arrested and languishing behind bars. Now, 10 members of Palestine Action, who take direct [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=70.08s)]
*  action in the long history in this country of peaceful civil disobedience, in case of injustice, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=77.28s)]
*  against a weapons company based in Bristol. And they now face a lengthy detention and then a trial. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=82.08s)]
*  And they are having counter-terrorism legislation used against them. And it was always clear with [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  this legislation how it was going to be used. And when it was passed at the time, these different [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=95.68s)]
*  forms of legislation, people made it clear it would be ended up being used against protesters. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=99.68s)]
*  And we can see that happening. While state terrorism on an industrial scale is facilitated [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=103.52s)]
*  by these weapons, the world has ever turned upside down. Now, I'm particularly delighted to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=108.96s)]
*  be joined by the two of the mothers of those who've been arrested, Sikena and Claire. Sikena's [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  daughter Fatima turned 20 just the day before she was arrested on August the 5th. And Claire's [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  daughter Zuri turned 21 in prison two weeks ago. It's great to speak to you both. I'm so sorry. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=129.52s)]
*  Obviously, this is a very traumatic time. You must be very proud on the one hand of what your [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=136.08s)]
*  children have done. But it's a huge sacrifice that they are paying, sacrifices paid by [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=140.88s)]
*  similar people throughout history. And we know how history judges the people who took those sacrifices. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  But in the here and now, that doesn't make it any easier. Firstly, just what's it been like these [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=152.56s)]
*  last few weeks? It's been two months now. Fatima Zainab has always been very passionate about [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=158.8s)]
*  social justice. Even before the war in Gaza started, she's been advocating for [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=165.76000000000002s)]
*  injustices around the world, whether it's Sudan, Congo, Kashmir, just to name a few. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=174.32000000000002s)]
*  She always says that if you ever wonder what you would have done during the slave trade or [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=180.16000000000003s)]
*  apartheid in South Africa or the Holocaust, then that's exactly what you're doing right now [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=187.6s)]
*  in the present day during a live stream genocide. And for Fatima Zainab, when the genocide began a [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=192.56s)]
*  year ago, she attended protests and marches. She went to teach-ins, fundraisers, and she also was [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  part of the encampment at her uni. At home, we boycotted religiously. We prayed and we cried [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=208.32s)]
*  together. And then 10 months into the genocide, the situation kept on worsening in Gaza. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=215.2s)]
*  The open murder of six-year-old Hind Rajab and the murder of the innocent babies [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=223.6s)]
*  kept Fatima Zainab awake at night, feeling really distressed and helpless. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  And I believe that this is when Fatima Zainab decided to take direct action, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=235.67999999999998s)]
*  putting her freedom and her future online for what she believes in. And it's important to [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=240.88s)]
*  also note here that Fatima Zainab, she strongly believes that no one is free until all of us are [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=248.95999999999998s)]
*  free. And that's one of, you know, that's her favourite line that she always keeps on telling us. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=257.91999999999996s)]
*  So they broke into [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=264.56s)]
*  Filton in Bristol. That's the Bristol-based research hub that was opened last year. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=268.96s)]
*  Elbit Systems is one of Israel's largest weapons manufacturers. And they [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=276.0s)]
*  allegedly cause damage to over a million pounds worth of weapons in the factory. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=285.03999999999996s)]
*  Claire, do you want to tell me about your, about Zuri as well? And then we'll talk about [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=292.56s)]
*  the action that was taken. Yeah, very similar to what I'm hearing about Fatima. Zuri was, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=297.91999999999996s)]
*  she attended march after march after march, and she got her friends to come along. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=304.08s)]
*  She is also like social justice is just part of her DNA. It's a huge part of who she is. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=309.44s)]
*  She, early on, she bought a gigantic white bed sheet. And she decided she was going to write all [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=317.76s)]
*  the names of the then only 2000 children who'd been killed and their ages, and she was going to [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=324.24s)]
*  take it to the next march. And she didn't write a single name on that sheet. She felt so defeated [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=328.88s)]
*  and overwhelmed. And she just, she just went back to bed for the weekend. And I think it was after [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=333.76s)]
*  that, that she kind of came across Palestine action, and realised that direct action really [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=339.84000000000003s)]
*  is the only way to go. And she said that to me, without telling me what she was going to do. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=345.76s)]
*  And so then the first I heard was 6th of August, when four police officers came [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=351.68s)]
*  up to my door with a warrant to search her bedroom and said that she'd been arrested in Bristol. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=357.44s)]
*  So can you just tell me what exactly, they were arrested initially under normal criminal charges, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=364.4s)]
*  but then the next day that was counter-terrorism charges. Tell us about that. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=368.64s)]
*  So they were arrested on the 6th of August under criminal charges. And then we were really [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=372.72s)]
*  surprised to hear on the 7th of August, they were re-arrested under counter-terrorism charges, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=380.48s)]
*  under the Terrorism Act, and brought to London, to Hammersmith Police Station, as well as Newbury [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=385.76000000000005s)]
*  Police Station. They were held in communicado and in solitary confinement for up to a week, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=392.24s)]
*  without any charges. And then when they were finally charged, it was not to do with the [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=398.64s)]
*  Terrorism Act, all terrorism charges were dropped. And it's been really distressing [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=406.4s)]
*  how the government is using these draconian counter-terror laws to incarcerate [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=412.15999999999997s)]
*  the Fulton 10, as they're now known. And what's really been chilling is that although they didn't [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=420.24s)]
*  charge them with terrorism, they charged them with things like criminal damage, as you'd expect, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=427.28s)]
*  on the charge sheet from the Crown Prosecution Service, it says, with terrorist connection. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=431.11999999999995s)]
*  And that has been plaguing them ever since. So every judge that's considered bail has obviously [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=436.08s)]
*  been freaked out by terrorist connection and has refused it. It's also the investigation is still [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=443.2s)]
*  being led by counter-terrorist police. And I had, after that initial search of 4x4 officers, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=450.0s)]
*  I had 12 counter-terrorism police turn up in a massive van and search my entire home from top [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=456.0s)]
*  to bottom. So it's the counter-terrorism thing, it extends to everything. So they refuse bail, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=462.24s)]
*  we think, because of that. In prison, they're given just very severe restrictions that don't apply to [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=471.04s)]
*  any of the other prisoners. So the six women of the 10 who are in Bronzefield have a non-association [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=476.0s)]
*  order on them, which means that they're restricted in their everyday activities. They can't apply to [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=481.6s)]
*  do something that another of the six might be doing. And that's affected visits, it's affected [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=486.32000000000005s)]
*  accommodation. My daughter was kept in the induction wing where she was unable to make friends for the [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=491.6s)]
*  first two months. And it will mean as well that when they're sentenced, they will get longer [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=496.16s)]
*  sentences because of the terrorism connection. And just to add on to what Claire just said, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=502.8s)]
*  with the visits as well, because of the non-association order on all of them, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=507.92s)]
*  if one of them books the visit, none of them is able to book a visit, whereas on Remand, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=513.2s)]
*  they're allowed to have a visit every day at Bronzefield. But because of this, their visits [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=518.4s)]
*  are severely restricted as well. So we're talking about trial next year and they're [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=523.04s)]
*  under detention all that time. I mean, we can apply for bail again. But our experience so far [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=529.12s)]
*  has been that judges have just not been interested. They meet the conditions for bail, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=535.76s)]
*  especially R2. They've never committed another offence. They've got absolutely no incentive to [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=542.96s)]
*  abscond. We were putting up a huge amount in security for them. And yet there's just this [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=547.84s)]
*  no, no, they stay in prison. Now, I'm just going to read from Open Democracy, which actually did a [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=555.92s)]
*  long piece about another case involving actually including Israeli nationals who took previous [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=561.92s)]
*  action against Elbit. Just again for more clarity, the court was told then that Elbit's UK [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=566.8s)]
*  Israeli parent company, Elbit System Limited, supplies 85% of land-based equipment used by [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=572.4799999999999s)]
*  Israeli military with a firm marketing its drones as the backbone of the Israeli defense force. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=577.28s)]
*  The case also saw a senior Elbit executive evidence at UK court for the same time. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=581.76s)]
*  Now, they say that the company shipped products to its parent company as well for support and [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=586.3199999999999s)]
*  repairs, but insisted they didn't supply the Israeli military. However, they said this is [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=589.84s)]
*  a UK listed company, therefore operates from the bounds of UK law. But under cross-examination, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=597.0400000000001s)]
*  Wright, a director, said there was a very significant overlap or acceptance of a significant [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=601.76s)]
*  overlap between senior staff at Elbit UK and its Israeli parent company in certain areas. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=607.0400000000001s)]
*  He also accepted there was a very large overlap in the product portfolios of the two companies. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=611.2s)]
*  Two of the three executive editors of Elbit UK are also directors of Elbit Systems Limited, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=616.72s)]
*  and they also accepted that Elbit UK's profits flowed back to the parent company in Israel, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=621.9200000000001s)]
*  which has ultimate control over the UK company. So it's just important to make that point because [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=626.24s)]
*  they are making the claims of Elbit UK as, look, we're not actually arming here, the Israeli [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=630.64s)]
*  military. But there's no that distinction between them and their parent company in court has already [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=635.6800000000001s)]
*  been clearly very thoroughly challenged. I mean, for me, I had never heard of Elbit Systems until [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=641.6s)]
*  Zoe dragged me into this kicking and screaming. And I'm just, sickened isn't a strong enough word [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=650.96s)]
*  for the fact that our country is hosting Israel's biggest arms manufacturer, and even giving them [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=659.0400000000001s)]
*  contracts, the tunes of hundreds of thousands of pounds since they've been based here. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=667.04s)]
*  If people knew that, what would they do? People need to know that these deadly weapons, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=673.36s)]
*  these drones, which are just diabolical, are being made here. And they are being sent to Gaza. I mean, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=680.88s)]
*  it was very clear that the quadcopter drones that the 10 found in Filton were the same that are used [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=685.92s)]
*  in Gaza. It's diabolical and people need to know and they need to raise their voices about that. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=693.04s)]
*  Just on the quadcopters used by, I mean, know this from the parent company, certainly Elbit, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=701.8399999999999s)]
*  the parent company is really parent company. Those quadcopters today, I interviewed a doctor [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=706.7199999999999s)]
*  who'd been at NASA hospital who testified that the quadcopters were used, that 60% to 70% of the [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=712.0799999999999s)]
*  victims that he treated in NASA hospital were women and children that you could tell from the [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=718.8s)]
*  cuboid pellets. They're not like bullets. They ricocheted around the victims. Often when a bomb [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=724.4799999999999s)]
*  lands, then the drones, the quadcopters appear, they then shoot at those who've survived, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=730.0s)]
*  including in the back as they run away and in the chest. And this includes small children, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=735.76s)]
*  I should note as well. And these are quadcopters we know, again, we know what people say, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=741.04s)]
*  as of the parent company, the Israeli parent company, and in court we can see you can't [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=747.36s)]
*  distinguish, but this is not an autonomous company. That's a really key point. Now, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=751.84s)]
*  legal authorities, lawyers across the world, there's a consensus of grievous war crimes and [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=757.2s)]
*  crimes against humanity being committed by Israel in Gaza and beyond. We also have the International [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=763.5200000000001s)]
*  Criminal Court's chief prosecutor issuing requests for arrest warrants against the Israeli prime [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=768.5600000000001s)]
*  minister, his defense minister. How do you feel about the facts that of all the people who are [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=772.96s)]
*  currently behind bars, it's not those who are slaughtering children, for example, imposing a [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=778.4000000000001s)]
*  deliberate siege on Gaza with starvation as a consequence, the mass destruction of civilian [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=783.76s)]
*  infrastructure, including the entire hospital system, they're not behind bars. They're actually [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=789.9200000000001s)]
*  still running the show. It's your kids, your children, they're behind bars. How do you feel [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=794.5600000000001s)]
*  about that? So, Kaina first. Just at this point in time, I just feel that international law, UN, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=799.68s)]
*  it just all seems like a farce. All these organizations and laws and resolutions and [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=806.0799999999999s)]
*  human rights organizations, they're not able to protect starving people from being bombed and [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=813.28s)]
*  burned alive. They're the real terrorists are roaming around free, whereas people of conscience, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=821.0400000000001s)]
*  young people who care, who are standing up for justice are the ones that are being incarcerated [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=829.76s)]
*  and being unjustly given unjust treatment by the government. So, that is upon us ordinary people to [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=837.52s)]
*  raise awareness and to raise that conscience and the voice and to be able to stand up for justice [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=848.64s)]
*  for all of them. Claire, how do you feel about that? It's unbelievable. It's just so difficult [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=859.52s)]
*  to get your head around. And it's particularly the terrorism connection, the use of counter-terrorism [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=866.3199999999999s)]
*  powers, which when we first learned of, because we weren't getting our phone calls from our loved [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=871.76s)]
*  ones, three, four, five days went past and we realized this is counter-terror power being used [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=877.6s)]
*  against them. And everyone at Palestine Action and all the families were just, all the lawyers were [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=882.88s)]
*  saying, we've never heard of this before. This is completely unprecedented. But I think in a way, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=889.12s)]
*  maybe because they have taken the step that's gone so far that people will wake up and realize [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=895.44s)]
*  just how unacceptable and upside down this is. I mean, we would say that our children are upholding [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=901.2s)]
*  international law. They are doing what the government should be doing by stopping the [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=907.36s)]
*  arms, the flow of arms. So, we've got a petition out at the moment, which has reached 4,000 signatures. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=913.52s)]
*  It might be by five by now. It's growing very quickly. We really urge everyone to sign that, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=920.24s)]
*  to say stop using counter-terrorism powers against these activists. And I'll be including the link, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=924.08s)]
*  just so everyone knows, is in the description of the video and tweeted out. Thank you. So, make [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=930.72s)]
*  sure you do that. I mean, just another question, I guess, is some will say, this is a deterrent. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=935.6s)]
*  I mean, basically, your kids, what they're going through, your children, this will stop other [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=943.2s)]
*  people from wanting to take action. It's just, so what do you say to that? That will just people [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=948.88s)]
*  look at this and go, if you cross a line when it comes to trying to stop this genocide, then you'll [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=953.9200000000001s)]
*  end up behind bars for an indefinite period. What do you say in terms of that chilling effect? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=964.16s)]
*  We have heard from many sources that our children are being made an example of [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=969.68s)]
*  by the government. And I just have one question in return. Why are the British government [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=976.48s)]
*  so keen on protecting and hiding what's happening in the world? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=985.12s)]
*  At the expense and at the cost of its own citizens. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=994.88s)]
*  Exactly right. I mean, why, the way I see it, Elbit, having grasped what Elbit is, I see it [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=999.4399999999999s)]
*  as this huge monster with tentacles and it's sort of bloated on the blood of innocent people. And I [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1005.36s)]
*  see our children going in with sticks and poking it because no one else will do that. No one else [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1010.88s)]
*  is brave enough. And it feels like the government has just come down to protect Elbit systems, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1016.8s)]
*  to protect the arms manufacturers. What is that about? Whose side should they be on? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1023.12s)]
*  But in terms of whether it's going to deter other people, I think the opposite is true. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1029.84s)]
*  I think people are so inspired by the bravery of our children. And they've set an example of [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1033.92s)]
*  not sitting on your hands because our young people have been watching a genocide unfold on [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1044.24s)]
*  social media. And many of them are devastated at the powerlessness that they feel. And something [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1048.24s)]
*  like Palestine Action is giving them a vehicle to express their grief and their anger and their [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1055.44s)]
*  solidarity. And I think more and more people will take that route and they'll say, yes, I'll be [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1060.0s)]
*  arrested. If it means one more child isn't killed, yes, I'll put myself up for arrest. Yes, I will [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1064.24s)]
*  sacrifice my university education, which is what our daughters are doing right now. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1070.48s)]
*  Yes, I'll sacrifice my liberty. And I know lots of people are making that decision inspired by our [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1074.48s)]
*  kids. We've also seen so many different movements sprung up in the past year. We've seen all these [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1080.56s)]
*  solidarity movements within universities, campuses that have sprung up. And the more you try to [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1093.9199999999998s)]
*  oppress the people, the more they will rise. And it's very important to note that the youths are [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1101.68s)]
*  not asleep. They're awake. They're watching. They have alternate forms of media that they are tuning [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1108.72s)]
*  into. And they're aware of the truth out there. And they are collectively forming organizations. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1114.8s)]
*  They're collectively rising. And that does give some sort of comfort that it is not going unnoticed. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1123.28s)]
*  Can I ask how they're holding up at the moment? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1132.64s)]
*  Obviously with Fatima Zainab, she does have her ups and downs with the non-association order, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1134.4s)]
*  especially with the restrictions on the visits, the restrictions on the activities that they're [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1139.04s)]
*  allowed to participate in. It's all very distressing. Of course, there are moments [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1143.3600000000001s)]
*  when she's quite low and then there are moments when she's okay. But at the end of the day, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1152.0s)]
*  she does know that what she has done, she's stood on the right side of history. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1157.12s)]
*  She has shown that she's not going to be complicit in the present-day genocide going on. And that's [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1163.1999999999998s)]
*  important. And that's what allows her to sleep in peace. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1169.4399999999998s)]
*  How about with your daughter, Zahri, Claire? [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1172.32s)]
*  Yeah, similar. I mean, her mental health was hugely impacted the first two months [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1175.52s)]
*  because they put her in the induction wing to keep away from the others. People were just passing [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1181.6799999999998s)]
*  through. She was unable to make friends. And Zahri is autistic and she finds social interactions [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1186.56s)]
*  very difficult as it is. And this was the worst way to punish her. And she just shut herself in [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1192.8s)]
*  her cell even when it was unlocked. So that's been really hard. But same as Fatima, she's really [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1199.04s)]
*  upheld by knowing that she did the right thing. She started writing poetry and she wrote a poem [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1206.3999999999999s)]
*  about why she did it, which has really inspired a lot of people, I think, on social. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1212.56s)]
*  Thank you. It's called Prison Conversations. When they ask why I did it, I tell them about the [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1221.76s)]
*  children, how their childhood is stolen from them, how their skeletons are left charred and smoking, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1230.0s)]
*  how easily their bodies are crushed by falling buildings, how their skin melts as their flaming [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1236.32s)]
*  tents collapse around them. I tell them of the boy found carrying his brother's body inside his [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1243.52s)]
*  bloody backpack. I tell them of the girl whose hanging corpse ended at the knees. I tell them [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1249.12s)]
*  of the father holding up his headless toddler. I tell them of the mother who received the approximate [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1255.36s)]
*  weight of her family in body parts to bury as they had all been shattered beyond recognition. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1261.36s)]
*  Then I tell them about the history, how this has happened time and time again. I tell them about [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1268.1599999999999s)]
*  the Stern Gang, the hilltop youth, the wars of 48 and 67, Operation Cast Lead and Protective Edge. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1272.24s)]
*  I explain how they call it mowing the lawn, cleaning the land of these human animals, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1281.52s)]
*  how they calculate the minimum nutrients to keep everyone alive, chop a bit off and let only that [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1287.76s)]
*  inside, how since the war they've banned chlorine, morphine and children's toys and much more that's [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1293.2s)]
*  needed for people to survive. Finally, I talk about how it was us that started it with our [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1298.4s)]
*  Balfour Declaration and media suppression and I say I cannot stand for this, it can go on no longer, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1304.24s)]
*  so I took action against Elbert, their weapons supplier. But I never forget to say that it [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1310.8s)]
*  was love, not hate that called me, watching their songs and dances for freedom, reading their [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1316.88s)]
*  hope-filled books, listening to their dreams of being doctors, teachers, journalists and never [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1322.8000000000002s)]
*  giving up. It's a wonderful poem, really, really incredible poem. I felt the chills and I'm sure [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1329.92s)]
*  everyone who heard that did as well. You should be incredibly proud of what your children have [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1337.3600000000001s)]
*  done. They've taken a stand against genocide and what more important stand could there possibly be? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1341.84s)]
*  History will be extremely kind to them and as damning as those who facilitated one of the worst [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1348.08s)]
*  atrocities of our age. There was this proud history throughout history, as I say, throughout [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1354.9599999999998s)]
*  history, not just here but all histories of those who at great cost and sacrifice for incredible [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1360.0s)]
*  evils and were persecuted at the time, incarcerated and worse, but we know how history [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1366.32s)]
*  remembers them and we know how history remembers those who prosecuted them and we all know how this [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1373.2s)]
*  one ends. We all know that this will be remembered as one of the worst crimes of our age and those, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1379.2s)]
*  you know, we all have to make a decision. What do we do at a time like this? Do we stay silent? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1384.08s)]
*  Do we render ourselves complicit or do we do something? And they have done more than that. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1390.1599999999999s)]
*  So in the best history and traditions, you should be so proud. So thank you so much to both of you. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1394.56s)]
*  Honestly, it's been such an honor. And again, just as a sign off, do share this video, leave [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1401.36s)]
*  your comments because that's good for engagement and then therefore more people will watch the [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1408.96s)]
*  video to share it, as I say, but please sign the petition. The petition is in the description on [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7H1e4teji0&t=1412.48s)]
