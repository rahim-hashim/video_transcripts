# Israel Unleashes WORST CRIMES After Yayha Sinwar Kill Extermination Happening Right Now
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mlQTrRehiQ)
*  Never stop being shocked. Never let this be normalised. Right now, murderous mayhem, which
*  is way beyond the comprehension of most of us, rages in Gaza.
*  After Israel's killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, after over a year of his genocidal
*  onslaught, some had suggested that this could prove a so-called off-ramp for Israel. Well,
*  certain Western commentators and politicians, that Israel could use this to declare victory
*  and finally agree to a hostage release deal and stop pulverising the already apocalyptic
*  ruins of Gaza and slaughtering its traumatised, maimed, starving survivors.
*  This flies in the face of everything we know about the Israeli state, which is not driven
*  by seeking to defeat Hamas, which in any case for a period it deliberately bolstered, believing
*  that would fatally divide the Palestinian movement. It is driven by seeking to expand,
*  by stealing the land of Palestinians and other Arab peoples, ethnically cleansing them from
*  that stolen land and then appropriating, expropriating, colonising that land.
*  The strategic thinking of the Israeli state in the assassination, the killing of Yahya
*  Sinwar, I have to say is beyond me, given they released the footage of Sinwar's killing
*  and details of how it happened, which I have to say, I can hardly think of circumstances
*  which would be more encouraging to an army of Hamas fighters, inevitably constantly replenished
*  by Israel's massacre to keep fighting to the end. According to Israeli newspaper Haaretz,
*  he was apparently wounded by tank fire, lost a hand when soldiers entered the building,
*  he threw two grenades at them causing the soldiers to retreat. They then sent in a drone
*  to scan the building, spotted a masked man with an injured hand, then Sinwar saw the
*  drone and threw a stick at it and then a tank fired under the shell, apparently killing him.
*  Now what's their strategy here? Why have they released all this?
*  The other studies I've been reading who were frankly angry at Hamas before are, you can see,
*  lauding the manner in which he died and Hamas are inevitably capitalising on this, leading
*  to one Israeli newspaper to denounce the IDF, the Israeli forces, for giving Hamas's leader
*  the ultimate honour in their words, but I would know more to the point, given these
*  claims were used to justify genocidal mayhem, which is what I'm interested in here, we
*  We were told that Sinwar was hiding in tunnels and surrounded by 22 handcuffed hostages.
*  This was used to justify the very nature of Israel's hideous assault.
*  Well, it seems not, doesn't it?
*  It seems not.
*  Now, those suggesting that this killing would cause Israel to roll back its violence have
*  collided with the hideous reality of what the Israeli state is and what it does.
*  As the Israeli Defense Minister Yevgalant declared, hostility will only take place under
*  fire.
*  Well, Gaza is certainly under fire, and then some.
*  In the north of Gaza, the Israeli state has accelerated its genocidal onslaught.
*  They've imposed a total siege there.
*  They've demanded its exhausted, traumatised, injured population to leave, which the vast
*  majority refused to do even if they were able to, believing quite rationally they would
*  be killed if they tried to flee and there's lots of evidence to support that fear.
*  In Jebel Yih camp, 18,000 Palestinians are deprived of water, food, the essentials of
*  life and access to healthcare.
*  Here the Israeli state claimed it had defeated Hamas months ago, then claimed subsequently
*  Hamas had reasserted control.
*  Again, because the idea Hamas can be defeated, that a force of this description could be
*  defeated by military means is a nonsense.
*  If you wage a genocidal war against an entire people, clearly you're going to keep offering
*  up endless recruits for Hamas.
*  Now here are some of the atrocities committed in Jebel Yih.
*  As the brilliant Palestinian journalist Hossam Shabam says, all communications and networks
*  in the northern Gaza Strip have been cut off due to a brutal military operation that the
*  occupation is conducting in the Jebel Yih camp from all directions.
*  In the past two weeks, Israeli occupation forces have killed 450 people in northern
*  Gaza.
*  That's the number we have been able to count.
*  There are many more bodies lying in the streets and under the rubble.
*  We haven't been able to reach them and the actual number is likely hundreds more.
*  Hashtag Gaza Genocide.
*  Hashtag Jebel Yih Genocide.
*  At 7.22pm on Friday, he tweeted in Arabic, Oh God, Jebel Yih, oh God, the north is being
*  destroyed, oh God.
*  Another Palestinian journalist, Anas Al Sharif, tweets that the Israeli army demolished a
*  house containing the displaced Hasoon family with a bulldozer.
*  That is, they demolished that house with a bulldozer while the family were inside.
*  The Palestinian writer Mossab Abu Taha tweets, I write with a heavy heart that my cousin
*  Sana, seven years old, has been killed in the airstrike on their house along with 18
*  members of her family, which is my extended family.
*  In the house was the grandmother Fatima, who was my grandmother's sister.
*  She was killed too with two of her daughters and their children.
*  I posted about this yesterday before the house was bombed.
*  I told everyone that tanks and soldiers were besieging the area but no one heard.
*  No one did anything to save them.
*  And he attached a picture of this little girl Sana from 2002.
*  If that one, that one slaughter of that family had happened in Britain, 18 members of an
*  entire extended family, that would go down as one of the worst tragedies of our post
*  war era.
*  No question.
*  That's just one of the many families who've been wiped out.
*  Endless families of an entire family, every generation gone forever exterminated.
*  Just imagine.
*  That's why I say never get used to this.
*  How are we normalizing?
*  How is this normalized?
*  What will future generations say when they know that for a year plus and it will go on
*  and on?
*  Endless Palestinian families, entire families have been exterminated from the face of the
*  earth.
*  And they will say, well, what excuse do people have?
*  They're the internet.
*  They could see this.
*  Well, we have to give that answer now.
*  There was no excuse.
*  Now this writer also reports that the Israeli army has massacred whole families in the Tal
*  Zata neighborhood in Jabalia after blowing up houses on top of the people inside.
*  And he included this video.
*  Hin Kaoudhry, another brilliant Palestinian journalist says our colleagues and journalists
*  inside Jabalia camp are telling us that the airstrikes did not stop.
*  They're saying the situation is very bad and they are being exterminated.
*  I've seen myself multiple pictures of Palestinian children in Jabalia who've been violently
*  killed and maimed.
*  You can see here the total destruction in Jabalia.
*  The ruling party of Israel, Likud, which is led by the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
*  has issued an invitation to an event which is entitled, Preparing to Settle Gaza.
*  And there it is.
*  The clear, shameless, unapologetic plan of the Israeli state to seize Gaza and to colonize
*  it.
*  As far as the Israeli state is concerned, the very existence of the Palestinian people
*  is a problem.
*  An existential problem.
*  A permanent obstacle to their desire to annex and colonize land.
*  That, above all else, is why we are in the midst of a genocide.
*  And that is above all else, while the Palestinian people are not going to reconcile themselves
*  to Israeli occupation.
*  Because they know how this all ends.
*  And it ends with the Palestinian people not existing in the land of Palestine.
*  The way it should end is for a land shared by all the people who live there, whatever
*  their faith or ethnicity, on the basis of equality, where no one is driven out or killed.
*  But instead, there is a peace based on justice, which is the only sustainable precondition
*  of peace.
*  But that will only come through external pressure.
*  Those of us in western states, above all else, the United States, have to build that pressure
*  on our governments to stop facilitating apartheid, colonisation or genocide.
*  Or this will never end.
*  So again, never normalise this.
*  Never get used to it.
