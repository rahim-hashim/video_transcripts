# US Official EXPOSES Truth About Gaza From The Inside
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg)
*  She resigned from the US State Department in protest at US complicity in genocide. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=0.0s)]
*  Anel Shaleen is one of a few US officials who resigned, unfortunately two few, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=4.96s)]
*  but history will judge them very kindly. She knows far better than most the inside story [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  of the US government and its complicity in genocide. She's just written a new report [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  for the Quincy Institute about the US role in this genocide, with a really disturbing [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=17.6s)]
*  point that she raises that I really want to talk to her about. Before I ask her about that, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=23.36s)]
*  I want to talk about what this really important report was exposing, and is exposing the broader [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=28.24s)]
*  context that we need to talk about, about US support for this genocide. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=32.8s)]
*  Thanks so much for having me back and for everything you've been doing [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=37.2s)]
*  to continue to draw attention to the genocide. So in this report, as you said, it's in the context [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=40.96s)]
*  of what the United States has been supporting Israel's genocide in Gaza, but it also looks [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=49.36s)]
*  into history and the fact that the United States, as long as maintaining military primacy, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  remains the overarching objective of our foreign policy, human rights will never be prioritized. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=61.04s)]
*  And what's interesting is even going back in the law, human rights and weapons sales are supposed [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=67.12s)]
*  to be linked back in the aftermath or sort of in the context of Vietnam. You had this notion that [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=72.4s)]
*  human rights should actually influence US foreign policy, and you had a Congress that implemented [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  laws saying that the United States is not to sell or sell weapons or provide any security [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=84.72s)]
*  assistance to a country that engages in gross violations of human rights. And yet that law, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=89.52s)]
*  502B, which is part of the Foreign Assistance Act, has never actually been implemented. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=94.56s)]
*  And subsequently, there are other laws that have also been violated, things like the Leahy laws, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=99.52s)]
*  which are about US security assistance or weapons going to a specific military unit that has engaged [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=103.68s)]
*  in gross violations of human rights, or things like if a country is blocking US humanitarian [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=109.04s)]
*  assistance, they're no longer eligible to receive US security assistance. But these are all sort of [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=116.16000000000001s)]
*  under the framework of this broader overarching law that the US is not supposed to provide weapons [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=122.08000000000001s)]
*  or any sort of security assistance to these kinds of countries. And so what I argue in the report is [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  to actually uphold that, the US would have to fundamentally rethink our whole approach to foreign [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=133.76s)]
*  policy. This isn't something that we could sort of do on the margins. It does require a really [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=139.76s)]
*  fundamental rethink, which I do advocate for. But obviously, in the context of something like [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=144.72s)]
*  looking at the Biden administration, which like to talk a lot about human rights, and certainly as [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=152.56s)]
*  someone who was working in the human rights office, focused on Near East Affairs under Biden, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=157.76s)]
*  it was quite obvious even long before October 7th that human rights were not in fact a priority, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=163.20000000000002s)]
*  despite the fact that they like to use that rhetoric a lot. And then obviously, in the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=168.0s)]
*  aftermath of October 7th, the glaring hypocrisy, in particular the emphasis, the justified and [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=172.56s)]
*  important emphasis on the human rights of Ukrainians, but the complete disregard for [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=178.8s)]
*  the human rights of Palestinians, just that the hypocrisy was so blinding. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=183.28s)]
*  There's a striking point you made, which before I come on to, because it was a really striking [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=189.76000000000002s)]
*  point in the report you made. Last year, it was revealed, in fact, last April, that two US [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=194.96s)]
*  government agencies had concluded that Israel was deliberately preventing humanitarian aid [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=201.84s)]
*  from getting into Gaza, both the State Department's refugee agency and US aid, which [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=208.0s)]
*  obviously now has been dismantled. And that legally required the United States to cease [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=213.92s)]
*  arms sales to Israel, because under US law, any state which is preventing US aid, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=220.48s)]
*  aid from the United States from entering, is legally prohibited from receiving weapons sales. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=228.07999999999998s)]
*  And Antony Blinken was informed of this, and the Biden administration ignored that law. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=234.39999999999998s)]
*  Exactly. This is what my State Department colleague, Stacy Gilbert, resigned over. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=244.72s)]
*  This was the, if people remember, almost a year ago, the NSM 20, where the Biden administration [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=249.12s)]
*  had said they were going to sort of implement a mechanism or this means of looking deeper into [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  what Israel was doing. And Stacy and other colleagues who'd been working on this report [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=262.0s)]
*  and determined that, yes, Israel is blocking US humanitarian aid, and so it's ineligible to receive [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=267.59999999999997s)]
*  any additional security assistance, they lost access to this report they were writing. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=273.04s)]
*  And instead, what the State Department published declared the opposite. And Stacy quit over that. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=278.56s)]
*  And this is someone who had overseen, as she described it, many US foreign policy decisions [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  that maybe she didn't agree with, but she was sort of believed in the overarching mission of the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=290.32000000000005s)]
*  State Department. And again, this sort of belief that the US is a force for good in the world, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=296.40000000000003s)]
*  which is so pervasive at State, and unfortunately, I think it just remains such a large part of [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=300.16s)]
*  American exceptionalism. And this is a big part of what I'm trying to push against in the report, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=305.52000000000004s)]
*  is this notion that American primacy or American military power advocates for human rights, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=309.92s)]
*  when in fact, I argue it's the opposite, that as long as the US continues to actually pursue [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=315.76000000000005s)]
*  military power, which is often manifested through weapon sales, human rights are never going to be [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=321.68s)]
*  a priority. And under Trump, there, some people would say, well, none of this matters anyway, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=327.12s)]
*  Trump doesn't care about human rights. And I would argue that in many ways, the way that the Biden [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=332.72s)]
*  administration said it cared about human rights, or would use this kind of rhetoric or talk about [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=338.24s)]
*  its support for democracies and all of this kind of thing in many ways, is more pernicious and more [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=345.76s)]
*  insidious, because it signals that it's actually adequate to mention human rights, to use the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=351.68s)]
*  pretty language, to say you care, and then to do the opposite, and to show that all that human [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=359.04s)]
*  rights really means to the US government is to deploy the rhetoric and not change the policy. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=365.12s)]
*  In contrast to someone like Trump, who very clearly does not value human rights, is clearly [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=370.48s)]
*  not upholding them for US residents or US American citizens, people in this country. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=375.76s)]
*  And it's easier, I would argue, for those who do believe that human rights are important, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=381.59999999999997s)]
*  obviously not only for Americans, for people all over the world, and that we are all better off [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=387.36s)]
*  when countries respect human rights, it's easier to push back against someone who's sort of openly [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=391.76s)]
*  against that idea. And it has a unifying effect, as opposed to someone like Biden and his [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=398.64s)]
*  administration, where it was harder, people who sort of saw, well, maybe their issue is being [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=404.4s)]
*  advanced. Well, I'm not going to criticize the ways that they're not actually holding up [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=412.96s)]
*  the broader spectrum of human rights. I think one thing in particular that the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=418.4s)]
*  Biden administration did do was to emphasize much more the rights of LGBTQIA plus people around the [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=423.12s)]
*  world, which is commendable. But then again, it's sort of like, or like, you know, the rights of [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=431.59999999999997s)]
*  Ukrainians. And so it sort of splinters the overarching human rights coalition, which against [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=436.96s)]
*  someone like Trump can say, no, human rights do matter. We need to enforce international laws on [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=441.35999999999996s)]
*  this. We need to enforce domestic laws on this. Whereas under Biden, it really, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=446.15999999999997s)]
*  it sort of was able to successfully splinter what might otherwise be a coalition. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=453.91999999999996s)]
*  Well, the striking thing, which I really, one of the striking things in what you wrote was [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=460.08s)]
*  that the Israeli state didn't expect the US to give them carte blanche to engage in its war of [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=465.84000000000003s)]
*  annihilation, essentially against Gaza, for more than a few weeks. I mean, I remember back then, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=475.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, you, I have to say, I mean, imagine, I mean, look, it's been a year and a half of this. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=481.2s)]
*  And I think, I think if any of us could transport ourselves back to those first [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=486.4s)]
*  week or two and say in a year and a half, this will still be going on. I think that would have [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=493.84s)]
*  been, I mean, you know, almost mind blowing, actually, to be honest. But that's what happened. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=501.36s)]
*  But I mean, the Israelis, they didn't, they didn't think they'd be able to get away with it. And yet [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=508.4s)]
*  they did. I mean, what do you, what do you, what, I mean, what, how would you expand on that? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=512.48s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, so that has been reported publicly, you know, that was reported by the economist, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=518.08s)]
*  this idea that the Israelis anticipated similarly to other instances in history, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=522.96s)]
*  including the Biden White House itself, when Israel was, was engaging in the bombardment of [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=529.52s)]
*  Gaza in May of 2021. And after a matter of weeks, the Biden White House said, okay, that that's [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=535.04s)]
*  enough. And looking back through history, you know, the famous call Reagan made during the [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=541.44s)]
*  Israel's attack on Beirut, you know, Reagan seeing like one picture of a child, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=548.8000000000001s)]
*  a Lebanese child devastated, you know, who'd been either killed or maimed by Israel's assault on [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=556.8000000000001s)]
*  Lebanon. And that that was enough for Reagan to call and say, all right, this, this needs to stop. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=561.6800000000001s)]
*  And instead, you saw the Biden administration continuing to provide essentially unconditional [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=568.4000000000001s)]
*  support. And one thing I find so maddening is the Republican talking point that Biden was [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=574.8800000000001s)]
*  constraining Israel in some way, because they blocked a single shipment of 2000 pound bombs, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=580.1600000000001s)]
*  which is like, okay, a single shipment of like, you look at, you know, in the report, I have a [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=586.8000000000001s)]
*  graph from Steven Semler, who's excellent at like, sort of visualizing some some of these figures. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=594.08s)]
*  And you look at like, us support for Israel over time. And then you look at the past just under [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=601.44s)]
*  Biden, you know, the 12 months in the aftermath of October 7, $17.9 billion, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=605.52s)]
*  above the 3.3 billion that the US lead, you know, sends to Israel every year, as a matter of course. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=613.92s)]
*  And I do think that one one question that that I keep hearing that I've grappled with myself is [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=624.72s)]
*  kind of what explains this of why did they continue to to continue to provide this unconditional [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=631.44s)]
*  support. And I think one thing to keep in mind is this notion of the bear hug policy, this idea that [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=638.88s)]
*  if we if there's no daylight between the Biden administration and the Netanyahu government, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=646.08s)]
*  then they can influence Netanyahu and we can save lives. And this was something that I heard from [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=651.12s)]
*  Blinken himself, who met with myself and others from the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=656.0s)]
*  Labor who were very concerned. And at the time that this meeting happened, it was right when [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=661.84s)]
*  there was that initial ceasefire around Thanksgiving in November of 2023. And so it [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=667.12s)]
*  seemed that actually that logic was was correct. And that by whole, you know, by providing this [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=672.4s)]
*  this massive level of support to Israel, then the US could facilitate a ceasefire. But [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=678.16s)]
*  over time, it should have become clear that Netanyahu was not willing [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=686.16s)]
*  to engage in a sort of ceasefire again. And it was only Trump actually using leverage. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=692.0s)]
*  And my understanding is possibly even threatening to withhold US weapons that actually finally got [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=698.0799999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu to agree to at least phase one of the ceasefire. And obviously now the Trump [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=703.28s)]
*  administration is parroting the same lies that it was Hamas that violated the ceasefire [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=708.64s)]
*  when it wasn't. It was Israel. So but yeah, the this dogged persistence in maintaining [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=712.9599999999999s)]
*  the Biden administration just continuing to pretend that they were actually trying to push [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=725.1999999999999s)]
*  for a ceasefire when they were using zero leverage and instead just allowing Netanyahu to do whatever [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=729.68s)]
*  he wanted. I mean, what do you think is really driving that? I mean, as you know, in the past, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=734.2399999999999s)]
*  as you know, Ronald Reagan, when he he rang, then Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin had said, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=739.76s)]
*  stop this Holocaust, was what he said. And then, I mean, even in the even after 9-11, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=746.3199999999999s)]
*  in the early 2000s, George Bush's administration condemned issued a condemnation of Israel [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=753.0400000000001s)]
*  bombing a Hamas target. So they killed a Hamas official, but they killed several civilians in [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=761.12s)]
*  the process. And, you know, you end up with a I mean, look, that's not why, why was the Democrats [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=766.1600000000001s)]
*  who started the Vietnam War? But I mean, you know, the what do you think is driving that? What do you [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=771.6s)]
*  think is so I mean, in this case, do you think it was US policy meets Joe Biden's own kind of [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=777.2s)]
*  fanatical position on Israel? I mean, in the mid 1980s, he said, in Congress as a senator, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=784.5600000000001s)]
*  it was the best multi-billion pound investment the US had ever made. If Israel didn't exist, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=790.6400000000001s)]
*  we'd have to create it. And he wasn't talking there from the kind of moral perspective of the [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=794.5600000000001s)]
*  Jewish people need a state. He was talking about US strategic interests and that's which. So what [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=798.8000000000001s)]
*  do you think is driving it? Yes, I mean, I think absolutely. It was Biden's deep commitment to [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=803.12s)]
*  Zionism. I think it's racism. I think it's this willingness to see brown and black bodies destroyed [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=812.72s)]
*  in a way that clearly sort of the European and American reaction to Russia's assault on Ukraine [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=823.04s)]
*  and seeing, you know, blonde, blue eyed Ukrainian refugees was seen as as unacceptable. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=830.72s)]
*  You know, I think that there was this this perception, you know, the Biden administration [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=841.28s)]
*  was trying to achieve what the Trump administration had done with the Abraham Accords. They wanted to [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=847.44s)]
*  expand them. They wanted to know they wanted Israel and Saudi Arabia to normalize relations. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=853.52s)]
*  And I think they continue to see that as a possibility, even though, you know, even somewhere [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=858.64s)]
*  like Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was saying, I cannot normalize with Israel. They'll assassinate [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=865.04s)]
*  me. You know, and we demand the creation of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem, East Jerusalem [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=872.0s)]
*  as its capital as sort of our starting position for normalization. And I mean, just this dogged [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=876.4s)]
*  unwillingness by the Biden people to to recognize what was happening, even to the point of losing [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=885.6s)]
*  the election over this, that the poll finding that 29 percent of people who voted for Biden [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=892.88s)]
*  in 2020 who didn't vote for Harris in 2024, for whom their primary issue was Gaza and that outranked [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=900.0s)]
*  inflation or immigration like that was the most important issue. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=909.76s)]
*  They lost the White House over this. And now we've got Trump. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=915.68s)]
*  And, you know, I think it's really frustrating when people say, well, now you have Trump and [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=920.4s)]
*  he's even worse. You know, if your main issue was Palestine, then you should have voted for Harris [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=923.68s)]
*  because she would have been better on this. I don't think she would have been. It was and Trump, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=928.7199999999999s)]
*  at least, was willing to impose a measure of leverage that did achieve a ceasefire. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=933.68s)]
*  And even now, recently with Netanyahu visiting, we saw Netanyahu not walking away with what he [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=940.16s)]
*  wanted. You know, he was he was alarmed by the fact the U.S. and Iran are talking directly. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=944.9599999999999s)]
*  He wanted to get Trump to lift the 17 percent tariffs on Israeli goods, and he wanted Trump [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=950.7199999999999s)]
*  to make some kind of commitment to defend Israel against Turkey. And instead, Trump told him, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=955.68s)]
*  you need to be reasonable and, you know, I really like Erdogan. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=960.1600000000001s)]
*  So unfortunately, on Gaza, Trump is not reigning in Israel. But on other issues, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=964.08s)]
*  it does seem clear that Trump has a better understanding of what U.S. interests, at least, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=968.88s)]
*  is unwilling to be led around by the nose by Netanyahu the way Biden was. And to this question [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=976.64s)]
*  of what you quoting Biden as far as this notion that Israel is so useful for U.S. national security [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=982.88s)]
*  interests in the Middle East. I mean, increasingly, that is just becoming harder and harder to defend, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=991.36s)]
*  given Israel's war on Lebanon, attacks on Syria, continued annexation of the West Bank, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=996.56s)]
*  which is going to destabilize Jordan, who's a key U.S. partner in the region, and also a key [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1004.0s)]
*  partner for Israel. The question of what will happen, I mean, Egypt has been complicit in [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1010.56s)]
*  maintaining the blockade and the starvation of people in Gaza. But if somehow, you know, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1018.4799999999999s)]
*  suddenly there's a mass exodus of Palestinians from Gaza into the Sinai in Egypt, I mean, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1026.0s)]
*  that could threaten the Israel-Egyptian peace treaty. I mean, Israel is just behaving in a [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1032.8799999999999s)]
*  manner that is counterproductive, certainly to American security or long-term security interests [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1038.08s)]
*  in the Middle East, but even to its own security. And the U.S. continues to enable this kind of [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1045.12s)]
*  behavior, mostly just to keep Netanyahu out of jail because he has to maintain his coalition of [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1048.96s)]
*  these extreme right-wing ministers or face accountability for his own corruption and fraud. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1054.32s)]
*  I mean, I guess finally, I'm just interested in what hope is there. I mean, because you've, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1062.96s)]
*  this is structural. That's the point you're making. It's a structural problem. And whoever, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1067.36s)]
*  whether it was, you know, Harris, Biden, Trump, a similar outcome. So, you know, because when I [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1073.12s)]
*  spoke to, I've interviewed a few times the Israeli journalist Gideon Levy, he thinks that hope will [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1080.4799999999998s)]
*  come when public opinion in the United States reaches a tipping point, which politicians can't [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1086.6399999999999s)]
*  ignore. What do you think? Where is the hope, given the kind of structural problem you're talking [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1091.12s)]
*  about? I mean, at least on this question, I would agree with him on that point, that U.S. public [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1095.84s)]
*  opinion is crucial here. And at the same time that you see even Republicans, like negative views of [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1103.9199999999998s)]
*  Israel increasing, even among Republicans and certainly among Democrats. But at the same time, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1111.52s)]
*  you, I think in a recent Pew poll, fewer people said that this was a really important issue to [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1116.72s)]
*  them. So on the one hand, I do think that it signals over the long run, Israel will no longer [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1122.24s)]
*  enjoy the same measure of bipartisan, unconditional support. But at the same time, I think people are [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1127.76s)]
*  distracted. And so for those of us for whom, you know, who are trying to do what we can to, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1135.6s)]
*  to continue to raise the alarm bells about this genocide, and also just what this means for sort [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1142.96s)]
*  of the broader, you know, what implications this has moving forward. I do think continuing [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1147.28s)]
*  to talk to people around you to bring this up, it's, we have the numbers and, and there, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1154.3999999999999s)]
*  and we could have even greater numbers. And I do think it's, I mean, it's really astonishing given [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1162.32s)]
*  the ways, the measure of coercion that the Trump administration is turning to, to try to [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1168.0s)]
*  terrify people into not speaking out about these issues, including people, you know, people like [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1173.12s)]
*  trying to deport Mahmoud Khalil, who may be deported, you know, snatching other graduate [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1179.6799999999998s)]
*  students off the streets, sending them into detention, people self deporting out of fear [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1186.6399999999999s)]
*  over this. You know, I understand that people are afraid, but at the same time, governments cannot [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1190.9599999999998s)]
*  withstand if the, you know, if enough, and again, it's not even that many, I think people keep [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1197.84s)]
*  talking about the like 3.5% of a population is all it takes to essentially force a government to [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1203.1999999999998s)]
*  to pay attention to what they're demanding. And I do think that that is growing. And I do think that [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1211.04s)]
*  people, even on the political right, I mean, it's just horrifying what we continue to see happening [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1220.1599999999999s)]
*  in Gaza. I think my concern is that even if in the long run, the United States starts to move away [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1226.72s)]
*  from this sort of bipartisan unconditional support for Israel, I don't know who's going to be left [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1233.3600000000001s)]
*  in either Gaza or the West Bank by then given the ongoing efforts to starve and bomb people in Gaza [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1239.1200000000001s)]
*  into leaving and forcing them to try to escape. And again, with the annexation of the West Bank, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1249.92s)]
*  we'll see very similar, we are seeing very similar degrees of violence. So I think for the longer run, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1255.52s)]
*  there is some hope politically that we'll start to see a shift here. But I do worry that we don't, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1265.44s)]
*  we don't have time to wait for that. And so I would encourage people to continue to post about [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1270.4s)]
*  this, to share videos, to talk about this. I do think there's a little people are distracted, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1274.96s)]
*  especially in Washington. I mean, there's so much going on. But you know, this is a genocide. And [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1279.6s)]
*  those of us who've been sort of screaming about it for a year and a half now, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1285.84s)]
*  maybe it feels like we're screaming into the void. But I do think like the level of coercion they're [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1292.0s)]
*  using shows that they're feeling desperate. And that they're having to sort of show their hand [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1298.0s)]
*  with what is required to maintain or to try to suffocate support for Palestine, I think does seem [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1305.12s)]
*  to show that we're winning. Amen. And thank you so much for your wisdom, your insights. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1312.48s)]
*  And then I think as well giving a bit of hope about what people can actually achieve, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1321.6s)]
*  and not actually giving up in the face of what is a genocide, as you say. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1327.1200000000001s)]
*  But what you've done is so, so important. And, you know, history will record those who did actually [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1331.3600000000001s)]
*  take a stand and paid a price. And history is always very kind in those circumstances. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1337.76s)]
*  For those watching, please like and subscribe, leave your comments, very important, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1343.84s)]
*  help get an else voice out, share the video. But now, honestly, thank you so, so much. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1347.6s)]
*  Thank you. You've been such an important voice on this. So really appreciate all of your work. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfujk_RZPYg&t=1354.16s)]
