# Palestinian-American Analyst EXPOSES Pro-Israel Racism - w/. Tariq Kenney-Shawa
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [June 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU)
*  It's over eight months now since this particular horror has begun. And I think what's been [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=0.0s)]
*  striking throughout is the lack of subtlety of the total dehumanization of the Palestinian people. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=6.0s)]
*  It's a theme that on this channel we've returned to time and time again. Many guests have obviously [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=12.56s)]
*  returned to that point. It runs throughout the coverage, the way politicians behave, speak. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=17.6s)]
*  And there are moments when it is lit up in gruesome primary colors. So there's a lot to [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=26.0s)]
*  talk about and I've got the best possible guest to talk to about this. I've been following Tarik [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=34.24s)]
*  Kenney-Sharwar's work throughout. One of the voices I always look to when wanting to know [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=42.08s)]
*  about what's going on in Palestine, Gaza, putting things in context, both historical context, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=51.52s)]
*  immediate context, huge amounts of knowledge. So it's really a big pleasure just to give more [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=58.88s)]
*  context. Tarik is a writer for Policy Analyst and a policy fellow at Al-Tabak, the Palestinian Policy [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=65.60000000000001s)]
*  Network. So it's great to see you, Tarik. How are you doing? Thanks Owen. I'm doing okay. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=72.4s)]
*  It's great to be on with you. I just want to start, this weekend we saw what was trumpeted [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=77.12s)]
*  by the Israeli state, by politicians in the US, in Britain, elsewhere, by media outlets as a huge [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=83.60000000000001s)]
*  success, the rescue of four Israeli hostages. Many of those statements didn't even mention, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=91.92s)]
*  no mention at all of the catastrophic human consequence of what that actually meant in practice. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  Massacre of perhaps 300 Palestinians, many of them children, and that's without even talking [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=107.44000000000001s)]
*  about the number who've been named. I just want your thoughts just on that, just seeing what [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=112.16000000000001s)]
*  happened this weekend and seeing how the likes of Joe Biden, Western politicians, and media outlets [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=116.88000000000001s)]
*  reported on what should be seen as actually one of the big specific massacres of what overall is a [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=122.0s)]
*  huge massacre. Yeah, I think I'm glad we're starting here because I think it's also important to note [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=129.04000000000002s)]
*  that we've been seeing the dehumanization of Palestinians for decades really. None of this [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=134.96s)]
*  is new, but the last eight months and then the last week in particular have really shed a new [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=140.56s)]
*  light on it. I think what the last eight months have done, over 37,000 Palestinians dead, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=146.8s)]
*  and then this past weekend with the hostage operation that rescued four hostages and killed [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  at least 274 Palestinians in the process. What that does is that puts a numerical, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=160.72s)]
*  a number on how Palestinian life and Palestinian lives are valued or devalued. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=167.28s)]
*  That's what the last eight months have shown us, is that thousands upon thousands of Palestinians [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=175.12s)]
*  can be killed brutally. The bodies of 15,000 children can be piled up in the streets of Gaza, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=179.44s)]
*  and the world has, those in power at least, have failed to intervene and failed to anything, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  and to do anything really because, and at the core of it is because the Western world and the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=194.96s)]
*  countries that actually hold sway in the international system simply don't empathize the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=201.28s)]
*  same way with Palestinians as they do with Israelis or other white children or Western children. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=206.0s)]
*  And that's really the core of the issue here is the lack of empathy and deeper than that, the actual [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=211.12s)]
*  deeply ingrained hatred of Palestinians, hatred of Arabs, Islamophobia, that all kind of mixes together [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=216.16s)]
*  and allows a tragedy, a catastrophe like this to happen without intervention. And so what we saw [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=224.24s)]
*  over the last week in terms of Israel's brutal hostage rescue operation, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=233.52s)]
*  is kind of a microcosm of this. As we saw in the news, President Biden, Secretary of State Blinken, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=239.44s)]
*  leaders across the Western world applauded Israel's operation that successfully rescued [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=246.56s)]
*  four Israeli hostages at the expense of 274 human beings. And the only mention of those 274 [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=254.32s)]
*  Palestinians killed was as a footnote, as an aside. And basically what this does is it just [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=265.12s)]
*  hammers home the fact that Palestinian life is not equal to the lives of Israelis. And what this past [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=271.76s)]
*  week showed us is a number, put a number to that, is that one Israeli life is in their eyes worth [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=277.52s)]
*  hundreds of Palestinian civilians. And that's again, kind of a microcosm of what we've seen over the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=286.64s)]
*  last eight months and then what we've seen over decades. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=292.96s)]
*  I mean, just that point, you know, I mean, what we're talking about here is racism, loud and proud [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=298.08s)]
*  racism. It's not possible to applaud what happened this weekend without accepting the fact that you [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=302.56s)]
*  would have to be racist. You would have to be saying that you believe that four Israeli hostages [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=312.24s)]
*  being rescued at such vast expense, bearing in mind, by the way, as we all know, there is actually [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=319.84000000000003s)]
*  a proven way of releasing hostages en masse through ceasefire and prisoner exchanges. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=325.52000000000004s)]
*  So it's not like people can argue, well, this is the only way this can possibly happen when [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=332.96000000000004s)]
*  that's clearly certified as a fact. But it's not like that. And so I think that's a good [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=336.72s)]
*  untrue. Israel has killed more hostages than it has rescued by military force. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=342.23999999999995s)]
*  That's the point. You know, it's not just, we're not just talking about, you know, people on the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=348.4s)]
*  right, right wing Trumpian type people. These are people who regard themselves often as liberal, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=351.76s)]
*  humane, moderate people. And they're coming out and saying, well, actually, we believe that [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=356.32s)]
*  four Israeli lives, they have far more worth than at least two to 74 Palestinians, many of them who [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=362.71999999999997s)]
*  are just kids. And, you know, look, you're a Palestinian American in my own lane, I find that [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=371.2s)]
*  just disturbing beyond belief. You know, the emotional toll for those, you know, for whom this [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=376.40000000000003s)]
*  is lived experience is far more pulling. But I just, what do you think about that? It's just, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=383.84000000000003s)]
*  this is, it's kind of made people speak in terms, which is, which, you know, before probably they [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=387.68s)]
*  wouldn't even have imagined they could get away with. Yeah. And for this, for this, I'd kind of, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=395.52s)]
*  I want to speak from my perspective as an Arab American, as a Palestinian American, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=403.12s)]
*  who grew up most of his, my life in New York. And again, I just really want to hammer home the fact [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=407.28s)]
*  that none of this is new, none of this anti-Palestinian hatred, none of this anti-Arab hatred, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=414.96s)]
*  none of this Islamophobia is new. And as someone who grew up in New York City, I kind of came to [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=419.44s)]
*  terms with that fact. As a young kid, I remember, you know, early on when I was visiting a friend of [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=426.24s)]
*  mine, I think I was, you know, either 12, 13, early teens, I went to his house and I introduced [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=431.68s)]
*  myself to his parents and we were friends and they asked where I was from. And I said, oh, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=437.12s)]
*  I'm Palestinian. And the, I always remember his father, and this is, you know, a grown man [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=441.44s)]
*  speaking to a 12 year old was like, Palestine? What's that? Never heard of it. Doesn't exist. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=447.12s)]
*  So this, this is a sentiment that's, that's, you know, kind of represents a core belief of, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=453.28000000000003s)]
*  of, you know, Americans again, and you make a good point, it's across the political spectrum. It's [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=460.72s)]
*  not just Trumpians. It's not just the far right. It's not just conservatives. And it's not even [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=465.44s)]
*  just moderate Democrats. It's, it's across the board. You have progressives who are kind of, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=470.32s)]
*  who base their understanding of, you know, what we've been seeing over the last eight months, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=477.52s)]
*  the genocide in Gaza on this deep hatred of Palestinians. And that's because [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=481.44s)]
*  anti-Palestinian narratives have become so deeply ingrained in the American mind over the, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=486.4s)]
*  since essentially since Israel's founding, that they've become essentially invisible. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=493.2s)]
*  And in that sense, they, they inform the decision-making processes and inform the [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=498.24s)]
*  opinions of most Americans from, you know, everyday people to the highest levels. And then, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=503.04s)]
*  and, and, and that's, that's where the, for example, the president comes in. And, you know, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=509.04s)]
*  Aaron David Miller, for as many differences as I have with him as an individual and as a, as a [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=515.36s)]
*  policy analyst, I think he gave a very, very honest answer in his interview with Isaac Chotner from, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=520.72s)]
*  when he, when he discussed Biden's, the fact that Biden's sympathy doesn't, simply does not empathize [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=526.8s)]
*  with Palestinians the same day he does, same way he does with Israelis. And that shows in his [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=535.8399999999999s)]
*  policymaking. But I think it's, again, so critical to recognize that it's really not on the right. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=541.3599999999999s)]
*  It's not the right. It's not the left. It's both. It's a bipartisan mindset that has sunk in. And [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=548.0s)]
*  of course, this is changing. If you look at, you know, if you look at polling in the United States [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=553.2s)]
*  and across the West, really, there's a massive generational gap in that, you know, opinions among [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=557.0400000000001s)]
*  youth, among people under 35 are basically the inverse of what we're seeing with people over 35. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=564.08s)]
*  So there's obviously, you know, this is changing. And much of this is due to the fact that although [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=570.0s)]
*  Palestinians in the West continue to be silenced and continue to be marginalized and, and despite [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=575.36s)]
*  that reality, there are so many more of us who are getting our voices out and who are sharing [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=583.4399999999999s)]
*  our narrative in an honest way, in a way that hasn't been been shared before. That coupled with [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=589.6s)]
*  the fact that, you know, the one silver lining of social media is that the world sees everything. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=594.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=599.2s)]
*  And the images that have been coming out of Gaza, not just for the last eight months, but eight [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=600.4s)]
*  months, but for years now have shown a reality that no amount of lobbying and no amount of [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=604.88s)]
*  propaganda and disinformation from the Israeli side can kind of push back against. And it's kind [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=614.4s)]
*  of just a matter of time before that cultural hegemony that Israel and its apologists have [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=621.52s)]
*  for so long tried to cultivate shifts. And that's what we're seeing now gradually. But right now, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=627.28s)]
*  policymakers at the highest office are still very much guided by this lack of empathy towards [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=635.12s)]
*  Palestinians. And more than that, still very much guided by an actual hatred of Palestinians, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=641.28s)]
*  whether they're Muslim or Christian or atheist or whatever their background. But it's really [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=647.52s)]
*  important. And I think it's left out of this discussion around, at least from the US perspective, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=653.4399999999999s)]
*  when we're talking about what the US is doing in terms of its policy of unconditional support for [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=658.88s)]
*  Israel, people often focus on the influence of the pro-Israel lobby. People often focus on the [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=663.12s)]
*  influence of geopolitics. But what's often left out of the discussion is that pure lack of empathy [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=668.64s)]
*  and that actual hatred of Palestinians that guides decision makers. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=675.84s)]
*  You mentioned social media and the impact I think it's undoubtedly had, particularly in politicising [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=682.08s)]
*  younger Americans who can see the depravity of Israel's genocidal onslaught on Gaza in a way they [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=687.8399999999999s)]
*  wouldn't get from watching cable news, which predominantly older Americans watch. And I also [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=693.92s)]
*  think that the flip side is that the Israeli state soldiers just flaunting their war crimes and their [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=698.48s)]
*  genocidal intent. And it just brings me to the Israeli state has an official Twitter account and [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=707.04s)]
*  it is wild. I mean, it's just wild. It's like an alt-right troll account, which is fitting. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=713.12s)]
*  And I bring this up because Raz Sigal, the Israeli American associate professor of Holocaust and [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=720.4s)]
*  genocide studies says, and I mentioned this a lot, it's rare actually for a state to be so open about [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=724.96s)]
*  its intent. Normally that's the hardest part to establish when you're alleging genocide. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=729.92s)]
*  So it just brings me to this in the aftermath of what I said this massacre on Saturday, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=738.08s)]
*  where they tweeted out with a video, we need to talk about the elephant in the room. Many [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=742.64s)]
*  Gaza civilians participate in the horrific events of October 7th. It's also reported [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=746.4799999999999s)]
*  Gaza civilians held Israeli hostages captive in their homes. The world must condemn this in [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=750.4s)]
*  the strongest possible terms. They have an attached video. It's got a narrative with still titles [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=754.88s)]
*  declaring many Gaza civilians participating in killing, raping, looting. That includes footage [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=758.9599999999999s)]
*  from an interview with a former Israeli hostage and includes a saying in Hebrew, it's only a short [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=763.76s)]
*  video, there are no innocent civilians there in big, and then she says that in Hebrew and it's [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=767.52s)]
*  translated into English with big subtitles, so it comes up as a big pullout quote. That's just [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=773.04s)]
*  genocidal intent there. I mean, I would just present that as key evidence. I mean, there's a lot, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=779.52s)]
*  but I mean, it's a collective punishment. It's collective guilt. I mean, even if you're getting [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=784.4s)]
*  on the statistics, I mean, they would have to, what, also be something about civilians, what, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=789.04s)]
*  0.001% of civilians would have participated, but eat park or that. That's just gen- I mean, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=793.76s)]
*  that's just genocidal intent. It's not subtle. Yeah, I think, sure, it's not subtle, but I think [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=799.28s)]
*  the bigger point is that it's across all facets of Israeli society, right? And it's one thing for, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=806.48s)]
*  you know, fringe far-right extremists and trolls on Twitter to say, hey, we want to turn Gaza into [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=813.92s)]
*  a parking lot, or hey, there are no innocent civilians in Gaza, but it's a whole other thing [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=821.28s)]
*  if it's the official state of Israel's Twitter account, right? And because not only because that [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=826.88s)]
*  has a much further reach, but because that is representing the state itself. And even stepping [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=832.0s)]
*  away from social media, because social media can just be such a pit of bottomless grotesqueness, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=839.04s)]
*  but stepping away from that and just looking at the political statements that Israeli leaders have [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=846.08s)]
*  made, everyone from Knesset members to the president himself, the president, Isaac Herzog, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=852.32s)]
*  who said there are no innocents in Gaza, Knesset members who have said, let's explicitly wipe Gaza [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=858.24s)]
*  off the map and resettle it in Judea, Isaac. So what sets this genocidal and Israeli genocidal [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=864.5600000000001s)]
*  intent apart from other instances of it is that it is across the board. And it's not just the [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=871.84s)]
*  fringe extremists who are saying this, but it also is coming straight from the mouths of Israeli [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=878.24s)]
*  leaders, again, across the political spectrum. So you have Israeli leaders on the so-called Israeli [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=885.0400000000001s)]
*  moderates and so-called left saying this. You have the far-right ministers like Itamar Ben-Ghivir and [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=890.88s)]
*  Bezal Smoczorich saying it. So it's across the board. And like you said, when Raz Segal mentioned [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=898.0s)]
*  that the hardest part to prove of a genocide is the intent, that's really not the case when it [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=904.48s)]
*  comes to Israel, because not only have they been saying it since day one, explicitly telling the [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=910.1600000000001s)]
*  world of their intentions, but they've been doing it. They've killed 37,000, at least, at the very [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=916.4000000000001s)]
*  least, Palestinians over the last eight months. 10,000 Palestinians are missing, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=921.76s)]
*  presumably buried under the rubble, their bodies decaying under tons and tons of rubble. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=926.8s)]
*  They've injured 83,000 people. And they've decimated the entire Gaza Strip, making most of it [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=933.3599999999999s)]
*  unlivable, which is going to force a humanitarian catastrophe over the coming summer months that we [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=942.2399999999999s)]
*  are not prepared for. So the death toll right now is going to skyrocket, even if there's a ceasefire [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=949.6s)]
*  today. So now tie those genocidal statements to the actual death toll, and the case is closed, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=955.6s)]
*  basically. Now, we haven't even talked about the enjoyment that the Israeli soldiers are getting [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=966.32s)]
*  out of it, right? And something, again, unique to Israel's case that we've seen over the last couple [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=972.96s)]
*  of months are hundreds of soldiers posting snuff videos of them literally enjoying [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=978.24s)]
*  frolicking in the remains and in the ruins of the Gaza Strip. You get everything from soldiers [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=987.2s)]
*  parading around in women's lingerie to soldiers spray painting Nakba 2023 on the walls of the [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=994.24s)]
*  destroyed homes they've bombed and cleared out. And then you have videos of soldiers demolishing [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1001.44s)]
*  and mosques, lighting them on fire with no military purpose served. And basically, you have these [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1009.2s)]
*  three levels of genocidal intent that really make the case a no-brainer, right? And [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1019.2800000000001s)]
*  I think we get so caught up in these debates about what the legal definition of genocide is, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1027.52s)]
*  but the reality of the situation, I'm confident in a couple of years when we look back at this, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1036.1599999999999s)]
*  the same people who are denying that this is a genocide, the same people who are kind of pushing [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1040.96s)]
*  back against that term being used are going to be the ones apologizing and saying that they wish [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1045.36s)]
*  they did more to stop it when it was actually happening. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1050.1599999999999s)]
*  I think that's a very much a phenomenon that we're going to see. In terms of the dehumanization [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1052.56s)]
*  of Palestinians, and I should just warn people I'm going to mention sexual violence, I was struck [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1061.2s)]
*  by a piece in the New York Times, which he had to read all the way to the bottom, and then it [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1067.6s)]
*  mentioned that Palestinian men were being raped. And I won't go into graphic detail, but with iron [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1071.52s)]
*  rods and in this New York Times article, it suggested one of them, one example, the consequence [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1078.4s)]
*  was that a Palestinian man was killed, raped to death. You had to read all the way down to [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1086.0800000000002s)]
*  the bottom of the article for this to be mentioned at all. No, just casually thrown in. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1091.52s)]
*  That's not front page news, that's not leading bulletins, barely any mention of that. Even I [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1100.8000000000002s)]
*  bet some people who are listening to this video or the podcast have had a lot of interest and [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1106.0s)]
*  engagement with what's happened to Gaza, Israel's genocide of Rampage. I bet that's the first time [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1114.08s)]
*  they've even heard of it. What does that tell us? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1120.24s)]
*  Again, it's Palestinian lives and Palestinian dignity too are just not even a passing thought [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1124.0s)]
*  for most people. And I think that's really the core of it. Listen, I think accusations of sexual [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1130.88s)]
*  violence must be investigated whoever commits them, whoever they're targeted against, period. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1138.4s)]
*  It should always be carried out with an independent investigation, not by a military, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1145.6000000000001s)]
*  not by a biased government. It should always be investigated by an independent investigation. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1150.0800000000002s)]
*  There needs to be an independent investigation into these claims, like the one you just mentioned [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1156.72s)]
*  in the New York Times. Just going back to that specific example that you talked about, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1162.08s)]
*  the New York Times, and I was even surprised that the New York Times covered it. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1171.76s)]
*  Same. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1174.96s)]
*  To give them the credit they don't deserve. But basically, Israel has been operating clandestine [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1175.76s)]
*  black sites in the desert where they've been taking hundreds and actually thousands of [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1182.16s)]
*  Palestinians hostage, torturing them. And at least 48, I think the last count was at least 48, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1188.4s)]
*  have been killed in Israeli captivity just over the last eight months. And in any other situation, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1195.92s)]
*  this would be openly called out. When Russia does this in Ukraine, it's understandably called out [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1202.88s)]
*  by basically everyone. When Bashar al-Assad did this in Syria, it was called out. But when Israel, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1210.88s)]
*  which is backed by an array of Western powers, does this, it's just war, right? So again, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1218.16s)]
*  this all ties back to the fact that the Palestinian lives simply just are not considered equal. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1228.3200000000002s)]
*  And something I've been thinking about over the last couple days actually is, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1236.88s)]
*  okay, so we exist in a world where Palestinians aren't considered equal. We exist in the world [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1241.68s)]
*  where Palestinian life is actively devalued and there's actual hate towards Palestinians [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1247.5200000000002s)]
*  and other Arabs. How does this change? And over the last eight months, we've been seeing [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1252.48s)]
*  video after video, photo after photo of Palestinian bodies ripped apart. We've seen [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1258.24s)]
*  actual images of beheaded babies. Just yesterday, I saw a photo of a dead baby with his lower half [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1265.68s)]
*  gone. And at this point, in many ways, I have become desensitized to these images. And I'm [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1273.44s)]
*  Palestinian, I'm Palestinian-American. And in many ways, these images hurt me more because I see [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1282.16s)]
*  my people in them, right? But if I'm becoming desensitized to these images, what does that say [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1287.6s)]
*  about the rest of us? What does that say about everybody else who I imagine is also becoming [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1294.8799999999999s)]
*  desensitized to these images? And so what I'm worried about is that people over the last, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1299.04s)]
*  not just the last eight months, but over the last couple of years, over the last several decades, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1303.68s)]
*  have just become accustomed to seeing Palestinians as dead bodies. And I've just become accustomed [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1307.84s)]
*  to seeing Palestinians as torn apart. And basically, the default mode for Palestinians [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1313.12s)]
*  in the eyes of many Americans or Westerners is just that they just get killed and they're there [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1320.24s)]
*  to be killed, right? And how do we escape from this? Because if people in the West, if people [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1326.72s)]
*  with an actual chance of changing the policies of their governments towards ending unconditional [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1334.48s)]
*  support of Israel, if they just see this as the status quo, what incentive does that give them to [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1342.56s)]
*  work towards changing that and hold their governments accountable? And so what I want [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1350.24s)]
*  to think about now is how to move from, how to document Israel's war crimes and the atrocities [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1353.9199999999998s)]
*  Israel's committing, but also show people that humanize Palestinians in a different way than [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1359.04s)]
*  they've been before. And this is not just, this is going to need more than, okay, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1365.44s)]
*  Palestinians are on a cooking show and Anthony Bourdain has done his episode in Gaza. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1369.84s)]
*  All the respect to Anthony Bourdain, love him. But it needs more than that. We need a [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1378.0s)]
*  purposeful, deliberate campaign that somehow humanizes Palestinians in a different way so [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1386.08s)]
*  that people don't just say, hey, listen, you guys have been getting killed for decades. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1392.32s)]
*  It's what's, I don't know any other reality for you. And I think that's extremely important now, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1396.48s)]
*  but it's a balance and I just don't know how to go about it really. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1404.16s)]
*  Because it strikes me as part of that is almost a sense of, well, yeah, as you say, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1408.08s)]
*  Palestinians are used to this. They used to being killed and made the, as though the impact [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1412.88s)]
*  is different. Because I think a lot of people, when they see [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1417.68s)]
*  the examples of Palestinians, they've lost so many loved ones. So 20 members of a family, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1421.2800000000002s)]
*  you know, 25 members of their extended family. And for a lot of people that is impossible to [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1429.0400000000002s)]
*  process. Most people struggle to imagine how they grieve over two or three people at the same time. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1434.5600000000002s)]
*  So there's almost a sense of, do you see what I mean? There's almost a sense they must have [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1439.76s)]
*  a different emotional capacity. Of course that's not true, but that's part of the dehumanization [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1444.4s)]
*  I always feel that's not really discussed enough. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's, in many ways, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1450.6399999999999s)]
*  we've just become conditioned to seeing Palestinians be killed and these massive [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1456.56s)]
*  deaths. I mean, my immediate family was very lucky to get out of Gaza early. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1460.8799999999999s)]
*  But my extended family, 82 I think have been killed. And that's when I stopped counting. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1468.0s)]
*  But even that, it's even for me, it's still difficult for me to wrap my mind around, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1474.24s)]
*  because these are also, you know, extended, yes, they're extended family members, but I [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1481.36s)]
*  haven't been able to meet them for years, right? Because I haven't been able to go to Gaza. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1485.04s)]
*  And that alone is, it's indescribable, right? How do you even put the feelings that that gives you [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1490.96s)]
*  into a description, right? How do you put it into words? And that's me, that's me with my family, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1500.0s)]
*  let alone, that's not even talking about the rest of the world who has to kind of contemplate that. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1506.48s)]
*  And my family is extremely lucky because there are still Shahuas in Gaza, right? There are many [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1511.92s)]
*  families who have been completely wiped out off the Gaza Registry, population registry. Those [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1518.08s)]
*  families are gone. When we're talking about genocide, you know, when we're talking about [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1524.16s)]
*  genocide, the wiping out of entire bloodlines, it's impossible to put into words. So, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1530.5600000000002s)]
*  of course, a lot of this is kind of new territory for a lot of people, right? You know, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1538.8000000000002s)]
*  a lot of Americans, a lot of people in the West are kind of, this concept of entire families being [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1543.3600000000001s)]
*  wiped out, dozens of family members being killed. That's an entirely foreign concept. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1549.92s)]
*  So, finding ways, again, just going back to finding ways to tell our story and to humanize [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1556.0800000000002s)]
*  ourselves and to make sure that we're simultaneously documenting the atrocities that [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1563.76s)]
*  are unfolding while not desensitizing people or finding ways to keep them engaged [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1568.96s)]
*  is a challenging process, but it's increasingly important if we want to talk about actions that [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1574.3200000000002s)]
*  are approached, our strategy when it comes to actually changing our government's policies that [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1580.1599999999999s)]
*  sustained this in the first place. Speaking of government policies, one of the themes throughout [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1585.6799999999998s)]
*  has been gaslighting, basically upending people's sense of reality, telling you that you're [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1593.28s)]
*  not to trust your lying eyes and lying ears about what's actually happened. And the US government, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1600.08s)]
*  in conjunction with Israel, is now spreading the idea that there was a peace deal, which Israel [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1606.48s)]
*  is an Israeli peace deal, which Hamas is refusing to accept when actually, well, there was almost [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1613.84s)]
*  the same peace deal Hamas accepted last month, which Israel refused to accept, and which Israel [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1621.84s)]
*  kept coming out making clear it was not going to accept. And that remains, that's still going on [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1628.72s)]
*  now. So you've got US figures saying, well, if you want the ceasefire, then this is on them, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1634.56s)]
*  it's nothing to do with Israel. I don't know, in terms of what's going on with the ceasefire [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1639.84s)]
*  proposal at the moment, I'm interested in your thoughts given that context. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1644.08s)]
*  Yeah, well, you said it yourself. I mean, gaslighting and disinformation has been the [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1648.8799999999999s)]
*  name of the game over the last eight months. In my life, I have never seen this amount of [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1652.72s)]
*  state-sponsored disinformation in any other instance, and I'm talking about globally. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1658.08s)]
*  But what we're seeing right now, in terms of the ceasefire, the main sticking point here [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1664.0800000000002s)]
*  is that Hamas, Palestinians, and the rest of the world want a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1669.8400000000001s)]
*  a permanent ceasefire that'll allow us to flood the region with aid and allow us to start talking [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1676.96s)]
*  about the next day. It'll allow Palestinians to dig their loved ones out from under the rubble [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1683.1200000000001s)]
*  and start to rebuild, right? But that needs to be a permanent ceasefire. There needs to be a [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1690.8s)]
*  political solution that's discussed as well. The main sticking point here is that Israel does not [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1695.28s)]
*  want an end to this genocide. Israel wants to continue until they've achieved all of their [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1700.24s)]
*  war aims. And I like to think of their war aims in two levels, the macro and the micro. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1707.6s)]
*  The micro war aims that Israel likes to talk about is the rescuing of the hostages and the defeat of [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1712.48s)]
*  Hamas, because they're very unclear about what that means, and so are military analysts who say [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1721.04s)]
*  that that is an impossible task. Their macro goals are what brings us back into the genocidal [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1725.52s)]
*  intense statements, right? Their macro goals are the thinning out of Gaza's population [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1733.1999999999998s)]
*  and the pacifying of those who remain. And we see that with how they've now divided up Gaza into [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1738.08s)]
*  the north and the south, bisected by the Nasserim Corridor, and they've eaten up about 30% of Gaza's [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1743.4399999999998s)]
*  periphery with their new buffer zone. So they've made it very clear that that is their way of, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1750.08s)]
*  that's their plan for pacifying the population. But going back to this ceasefire debacle is [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1758.08s)]
*  the fact of the matter is that Israel does not want this quote unquote war to end. And that's [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1766.3999999999999s)]
*  the main sticking point. And the Biden administration believes that they can kind of push Israel into, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1771.1999999999998s)]
*  and Hamas into agreeing to this ceasefire agreement. But what I'm mainly worried about is [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1778.48s)]
*  that after the first phase of the hostage exchanges and negotiations are carried through, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1783.6799999999998s)]
*  that Israel just resumes its assault on Gaza. And the US, the Biden administration, or maybe it's [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1791.76s)]
*  the Trump administration by that time, wipes its hands. They say, we reached the ceasefire. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1796.3999999999999s)]
*  This is not our problem anymore, or just simply doesn't have the will or the ability to hold [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1802.88s)]
*  Israel accountable for that step. So what I'm worried about now is that what the Biden [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1807.68s)]
*  administration is trying to do is it's trying to set up an easy win for itself in the lead-up to [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1813.7600000000002s)]
*  elections. It's trying to coerce Hamas into agreeing to a non-permanent ceasefire, only for [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1818.24s)]
*  Israel to resume the assault on Gaza at a later point. But anything that'll give the Biden [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1825.68s)]
*  administration a much needed win in what is going to be an extremely close, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1832.64s)]
*  pivotal, again, yet another pivotal election season in November. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1838.0s)]
*  I'm interested in your thoughts about Lebanon, because obviously, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1843.6000000000001s)]
*  focus has been overwhelmingly on Gaza. Obviously, there's also the pogrom going on in the West Bank [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1848.64s)]
*  against the Palestinian people there. And even before last year, before the 7th of October, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1854.16s)]
*  last year alone, 240 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank. But we're also seeing the prospect [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1861.28s)]
*  of an Israeli war with Lebanon. You've obviously got Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, and we've seen [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1867.12s)]
*  escalating hostilities there. What would you say to people at the moment who are maybe perplexed [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1876.32s)]
*  about what's happening there? Maybe they know it's buried in the news, the talk of this occasionally. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1881.52s)]
*  What's your thoughts? Because I mean, for one thing, Hezbollah is a completely different [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1886.8s)]
*  fish from Hamas. And the context is very different. What's your thoughts? [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1890.16s)]
*  Well, more and more people are saying that a full-blown Israeli invasion of Lebanon is [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1895.68s)]
*  looking increasingly likely. And I tend to agree with them, if not a full-blown invasion, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1901.52s)]
*  at least a limited, basically because in Israel's eyes, at least, the status quo in the north is [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1907.52s)]
*  is unsustainable, right? I think something like 60, 65,000 Israeli settlers have been pushed out [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1913.92s)]
*  of their settlements in the north because of the fighting with Hezbollah. And I think 90 to 100,000 [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1922.88s)]
*  people in Lebanon have been forced to flee their homes because of Israeli airstrikes that have [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1931.92s)]
*  stretched deep into the territory. So Israeli military leaders have said it themselves. They've [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1936.4s)]
*  said that this isn't sustainable. The only way to get the Israelis back to their towns in the north [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1942.0s)]
*  is by dealing with Hezbollah militarily. And that's what the Israeli military has said. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1948.56s)]
*  And what they want to do is effectively push Hezbollah and their elite forces and the rocket [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1953.36s)]
*  forces up above the Latani River. Or at least, I think, a plan B was to push them seven kilometers [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1959.6s)]
*  inland, basically to reduce their ability to fire upon Israel. But as you said, Hezbollah is a very [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1967.84s)]
*  different beast than Hamas. They have three to four times the number of, or maybe more, of fighters. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1976.56s)]
*  They're much better trained, much more well-equipped. They have something like 150,000 [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1982.9599999999998s)]
*  rockets that range from the kind of the low-cost, unguided rockets to high-precision [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1988.3999999999999s)]
*  rockets and missiles. And basically, what we've seen over the last couple months is [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=1995.44s)]
*  Hezbollah and Israel kind of climbing the escalatory ladder in the south of Lebanon. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2001.76s)]
*  And what Hezbollah has been showing Israel is its technological strength. For example, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2007.2800000000002s)]
*  they've recently targeted an iron dome battery. It's unclear if the iron dome battery itself was [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2015.0400000000002s)]
*  a decoy or not, but the point is they were able to carry out a pinpoint strike on it, which shows [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2021.2s)]
*  that in an event of a full-blown conflict with Hezbollah, it's going to get very destructive, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2026.64s)]
*  and it's going to be a different beast. So again, it's a different situation. Gaza's [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2035.6000000000001s)]
*  a lot more densely populated. Lebanon is, obviously, there's dense towns and cities in the south, but [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2040.88s)]
*  it would be a different scenario there. But what concerns me most is that over the last eight [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2048.32s)]
*  months, Israel has gotten away with the complete decimation of Gaza, and Israeli military leaders [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2053.6800000000003s)]
*  themselves have explicitly said that they will turn Beirut into Gaza if war with Hezbollah happens. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2059.52s)]
*  So in short, what that means is that Israel has learned that through its absolute impunity [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2067.6000000000004s)]
*  that they can get away with anything, that no one is going to hold them accountable. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2075.44s)]
*  And if you are a military that believes it's existentially threatened, then that means what [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2080.6400000000003s)]
*  they will do to south Lebanon is going to be horrific. And I think that's what we all should [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2088.1600000000003s)]
*  be the most concerned about, is Israel's appetite for destruction. Because we also have to remember [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2098.0s)]
*  the Israeli Dahiya doctrine, which was kind of formulated during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2104.64s)]
*  is predicated on this idea, this strategy that you have to punish the civilian population [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2109.84s)]
*  in order to deter further attacks against Israel. And they've used this to devastating effect in [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2116.4s)]
*  Gaza. They've used this to devastating effect in Lebanon, Syria. Basically, what October 7th did [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2123.04s)]
*  is that it showed Israel that it needs to reestablish deterrence. And they've done so [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2133.52s)]
*  in Gaza, and they're going to try to do so again in Lebanon. And I think their quest to reestablish [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2141.04s)]
*  that deterrence is inevitable when it comes to Lebanon. The question is how they'll do it, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2147.76s)]
*  and when and if there will be a full invasion. But most analysts are saying it's looking [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2152.88s)]
*  increasingly likely. And I think that'll have a devastating, devastating effect on the entire [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2158.88s)]
*  region, because we haven't even talked about all the other regional actors that could get involved. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2163.04s)]
*  But before I ask my final question, just links to that. I mean, this might sound [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2169.52s)]
*  even a kind of disturbing thing to say in the context of the human impact that we're discussing. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2173.44s)]
*  The tens of thousands slaughtered in Gaza, officially 37,000 plus, but clearly a lot more. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2180.96s)]
*  And not just those buried under the rubble, but that horrible clinical term excess deaths, [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2186.56s)]
*  which is where we use the average of deaths before, and then the number above that, and that's people [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2192.1600000000003s)]
*  with cancer. People don't even think, people get this kind of thing. There were lots of people [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2197.92s)]
*  with cancer in Gaza, as you would expect. There were people with health conditions, heart conditions [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2203.36s)]
*  that aren't getting treated. You could go on. Notwithstanding the destruction of Gaza, so it [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2207.52s)]
*  now looks a different color and texture when looked at from space. Israel has lost. I mean, [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2213.2s)]
*  it has failed in its military objectives to destroy Hamas. I mean, reading US briefings [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2218.88s)]
*  where they suddenly act surprised, this was in Politico last month. Oh, well, tens of thousands [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2227.36s)]
*  of they've got, they keep getting Hamas constant new recruits. So they kill all these militants. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2232.56s)]
*  But then, did you not think that was going to happen? I don't know. Why did you, maybe if you [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2237.6s)]
*  kill lots of people and then they watched their loved ones being slaughtered, maybe some of them [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2241.76s)]
*  will in fact take, I mean, it's just absurd. But in any case, returning the hostages by military [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2246.88s)]
*  means, Israel has killed more hostages than is rescued by military means. It's isolation. I mean, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2252.32s)]
*  you know, this is open to eyes. People can't unsee what they've seen. They can't unhear what [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2258.4s)]
*  they've heard and they can't unread what they've read. You know, before a lot of people, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2262.8s)]
*  Israel's front reputation, it's the way it presented itself to the world. Just a kind of, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2268.72s)]
*  we're just an oasis of democracy, minding our business, we're Western democracy, we're besieged. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2274.16s)]
*  A whole generation has just locked in this in so much horror and disgust and they're not going to [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2279.2s)]
*  shift. And we can see attitudes in the US where basically not being pro-Israel was the bottom [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2284.24s)]
*  before this. And these are the states Israel depends on for weapons and diplomatic and military [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2289.7599999999998s)]
*  support and aid. So you kind of just think they've lost this. They've not, there's not actually, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2295.6s)]
*  in terms of a long-term strategy, that doesn't mean they're not capable of immense destruction [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2300.7999999999997s)]
*  in building on the destruction they've already inflicted. But should we just be talking very [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2305.6s)]
*  clearly that Israel clearly has just lost? Yeah, I think you kind of just said it yourself [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2310.16s)]
*  perfectly. Israel is capable and has shown us that they're capable of such immense destruction. So in [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2315.44s)]
*  that sense, I mean, if you carpet bomb anywhere, you've done that, congrats. But Israel has very [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2320.8s)]
*  much experienced strategic defeat. I'm not just talking about in Gaza, but I'm talking about [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2327.6000000000004s)]
*  strategically for Israel's survival as a nation, right, in the long run. In Gaza, Israel has, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2333.36s)]
*  after eight months of unprecedented fighting, of an unprecedented scale assault, they've failed to [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2340.8s)]
*  strike a final or a quote unquote death blow to Hamas. They haven't even killed half of Hamas's [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2348.64s)]
*  fighters. They haven't located or killed Yahya Sanwar or any other strategic leader, really. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2356.0s)]
*  And that's the thing though, even if they did, even if they killed Yahya Sanwar, even if they [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2364.64s)]
*  wiped out more of Gaza's, more of Hamas's foot soldiers, it doesn't matter because at the end [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2371.6s)]
*  of the day, Hamas is a resistance group that exists because of roots planted by Israel. And [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2379.3599999999997s)]
*  those roots are 76 plus years of occupation, apartheid and settler colonialism. As long as [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2388.7999999999997s)]
*  those roots exist, there will be resistance. That's plain and simple. So if Hamas was wiped [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2395.68s)]
*  off the face of the earth this week, there would be a new, the next generation that has been [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2402.24s)]
*  traumatized by Israel's eight months of genocide is going to fill their shoes and dedicate their [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2407.68s)]
*  lives to resisting their oppressors because they have nothing left to lose. And even by Israel's [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2414.08s)]
*  numbers, there was a study that found something like 60% of Hamas fighters were orphans, right? [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2421.04s)]
*  And that just goes to show that the people who are picking up guns and fighting against Israel [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2428.0s)]
*  are the people with nothing left to lose and the people who want to be liberated, the people who [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2432.88s)]
*  want to be free. And we can condemn whoever you want and saying this isn't an approval or a message [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2437.2799999999997s)]
*  of support or opposition for or against Hamas. That doesn't matter. People ask me all the time, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2450.32s)]
*  well, do you support or do you condemn Hamas? What I support, that doesn't matter. What I'm [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2455.52s)]
*  trying to describe is the reality on the ground where people, whoever they are, faced with an [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2461.28s)]
*  oppressive force will resist until they're dead, right? And that's the reality of the situation. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2467.36s)]
*  But stepping away from Gaza, Israel has faced strategic defeat because Israel depends on the [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2473.84s)]
*  West for survival, namely the United States. And Israel has become increasingly isolated on the [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2481.84s)]
*  global stage. Their actions in Gaza have created a surge in support even in the US, which is [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2488.96s)]
*  historically and traditionally seen as Israel's closest, most unconditional ally. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2499.8399999999997s)]
*  What we're looking at right now is the next generation of Americans have basically created [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2506.0s)]
*  or are now living in this new cultural hegemony where they see Israel as this racist, genocidal [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2514.0s)]
*  state that it is. And so what happens in 10, 20 years, obviously this isn't going to change [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2520.16s)]
*  overnight. Our current leadership is still very much pro-Israel and Americans on average are still [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2525.52s)]
*  pro-Israel, even though that's changing. But the next generation, 10, 20 years down the line, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2530.8s)]
*  the question now is will Americans continue to support giving their hard-earned tax dollars to [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2536.56s)]
*  a state that they see as racist and genocidal and violent and rotten to the core? So basically, [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2544.8s)]
*  Israel has not only strategically failed at their quote unquote micro objectives in Gaza, [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2553.44s)]
*  it's yet to be seen if they'll succeed in thinning out the population and pacifying the rest, which [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2560.5600000000004s)]
*  are their other objectives, but they've strategically failed in terms of what gets them their main [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2565.52s)]
*  sources of support on the international stage. And without that, again, without that international [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2574.96s)]
*  support, unconditional international support, Israel cannot survive as this artificial creation [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2579.68s)]
*  that is essentially transplanted onto an indigenous population. And in the long run, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2586.64s)]
*  that's what we're going to be focusing on as activists and as advocates, is continuing this [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2593.7599999999998s)]
*  narrative shift around Israel and turning that narrative shift into actual policy so that we can [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2600.3999999999996s)]
*  make sure that Israel, in a way, never recovers from its strategic mistake, from its strategic [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2605.6s)]
*  crime that they've committed in Gaza, and that we can work to start to dismantle the system of [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2612.56s)]
*  oppression that's been in place for over 76 years. Just very finally, actually, partly just that [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2618.24s)]
*  historical context. Now, the international order to most has already, much of the world looks like [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2627.44s)]
*  a sham rigged in favor of great powers, not least the United States and their allies. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2632.8s)]
*  But it had at least this, it has to present itself theoretically as existing to prevent, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2637.44s)]
*  for example, terrible atrocities, genocide. I mean, that's what it would at least try and claim. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2645.04s)]
*  And we see now the United States arm and support a genocidal onslaught, where notwithstanding the [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2651.84s)]
*  way the international order is rigged, we've seen the International Court of Justice, obviously, [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2660.8s)]
*  Israel is on trial for alleged genocide there, and it's intervened, for example, to order an end to [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2664.4s)]
*  the military operations. But also the International Criminal Court, its chief prosecutor issued arrest [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2670.8s)]
*  warrants for the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defense minister, Yov Galan. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2676.32s)]
*  That would have seen a year ago, you'd kind of think out of body experience that would ever happen. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2681.6800000000003s)]
*  But obviously, the response of the US has been to try and face that down. I'm just wondering what [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2686.32s)]
*  you think about that in terms of the international order and what the consequences, the lasting [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2690.64s)]
*  consequences for the international order, and whether you see hope and that the global south [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2696.08s)]
*  is flexing its muscles. And actually, the global north, the US is not as powerful as it once was. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2700.3199999999997s)]
*  It's in long term decline. And that's why we see this. Where do you see the international order [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2706.96s)]
*  basically finally from the rubble of the horror here? Yeah, I'm glad you asked that. That's [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2712.7999999999997s)]
*  something I've been thinking about a lot lately is, and it kind of so often kind of, I just land [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2717.92s)]
*  at the words, nothing matters, right? Nothing means anything, right? And that's kind of a reflexive [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2724.8s)]
*  idea I get. I'm not sure I fully agree with it. But I, so I was, I'm part of a generation that grew [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2732.4s)]
*  up with the understanding, taught to me that we were in this era of never again, right? The post [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2737.44s)]
*  world war, post Holocaust, the horrors of the second world war. That initiated basically a [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2744.0s)]
*  worldwide contemplation about who we are as a human species, right? And that kind of led to the [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2755.92s)]
*  birth of the United Nations. It led to the birth of international law, the human rights declaration. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2762.16s)]
*  It led to an attempt in short, to mediate and control the worst tendencies of humankind, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2768.8799999999997s)]
*  right? And I think that as a goal should be the purpose basically of our existence, right? And [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2777.92s)]
*  we attempted that as a species post world war II, right? Obviously this was co-opted by the West [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2785.6s)]
*  and these frameworks were co-opted by the United States and the West as a means of carrying out [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2791.6s)]
*  modern day 20th, 21st century imperialism within this new framework that people were getting used [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2800.72s)]
*  to, right? But that doesn't mean that it's an entirely useless attempt, right? That doesn't [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2807.7599999999998s)]
*  mean that it's entirely useless framework. But what Gaza has shown us, and it's not the only [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2814.4s)]
*  thing, Gaza in many ways is kind of like the last straw, just kind of the icing on the cake really. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2820.72s)]
*  But what the invasion of Vietnam showed us, what the invasion of Iraq showed us, what [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2828.56s)]
*  Syria showed us and Libya showed us was that this framework again was simply created [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2834.72s)]
*  as a means of continuing the domination of the U.S. dominated West. And what Gaza is [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2842.3199999999997s)]
*  showing us is kind of in specific, how these institutions like the ICC and the ICJ and how [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2850.56s)]
*  specific international laws are openly violated when the U.S. basically wants to violate them [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2857.7599999999998s)]
*  and respect it and honor it when it's in the U.S. interests or Western interests. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2864.72s)]
*  So that begs the question, okay, so what do we do moving forward? Do we abandon this framework, [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2870.96s)]
*  this human rights-based framework that we've all been kind of drilled into our minds as sacrosanct [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2875.76s)]
*  in many ways? Or do we stick with it and try to reform it? Or do we think of a new framework? [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2882.32s)]
*  And I'm glad you kind of mentioned this rise of the global South, and I don't want to be premature. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2890.32s)]
*  I don't think there's going to be a shift anytime soon in terms of multipolarity. I think the U.S. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2896.7200000000003s)]
*  is going to continue to be the most powerful country in the world for a long time to come. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2904.56s)]
*  But I do think it is a promising sign that in many ways, and we see this with the ICJ case led by [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2909.6s)]
*  South Africa, in many ways countries in the global South are kind of reclaiming this human rights [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2916.64s)]
*  framework as a framework that is equal to all, right? Or that should be equally and equitably [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2922.4s)]
*  applied to all human beings across the board, whether they're white Westerners or Black Africans [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2930.8s)]
*  and so on and so forth. And what I think needs to be done is, I mean, this needs to be focused on. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2938.88s)]
*  And I think efforts need to be focused on enhancing the power and the influence of these [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2948.6400000000003s)]
*  other actors that haven't had much of a say lately, or haven't had much of a say over the last [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2954.7200000000003s)]
*  several decades. But I do think Gaza and many of the atrocities that we've seen over the last [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2960.1600000000003s)]
*  couple of years, not just in Gaza or not just in Palestine, it's a sign that we need to rethink [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2965.6800000000003s)]
*  these frameworks from the ground up. Rethink how they're written legally, step away from the [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCLhjEjNgU&t=2973.44s)]
