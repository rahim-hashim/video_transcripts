# Witness To Israeli Hooligan Rampage Exposes How Media LIED About Her Footage
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [November 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HFM_V1rnPA)
*  What really happened on the streets of Amsterdam last week after violent altercations involving
*  Tel Aviv, Maccabee fans and local residents? Now I'm about to speak to somebody who actually knows
*  she's a photographer in Amsterdam who recorded footage which was unbelievably twisted, distorted,
*  completely turned upside down by mainstream media outlets. You'll see what I mean when I talk to her,
*  this is truly shocking. This was indicative of how mainstream media outlets and politicians
*  deliberately distorted what happened, erasing basic facts like Maccabee Tel Aviv fans,
*  celebrating the slaughter of Palestinian children and calling for the murder of Arabs while their
*  country is committing genocide, violently attacking local residents, rampaging around the streets,
*  clutching iron poles and other weapons, tearing down Palestinian flags from people's homes
*  and then burning those flags, throwing stones at people's properties, leaving residents terrified,
*  setting off fireworks on the streets and including to deliberately disrupt a minute's silence for
*  victims of Spain's floods. That's not to say Maccabee fans weren't attacked or that they weren't
*  attacked with an anti-Semitic flavour that happened, the latter I would certainly
*  unreservedly condemn. The point is this context was deliberately stripped away from what happened,
*  the genocidal racism of Maccabee Tel Aviv fans erased and that this constitutes misinformation.
*  What happened with the footage we're about to discuss underlines objective misinformation,
*  this is utterly scandalous, it shows how you're being lied to, unequivocally lied to. Now let
*  me talk to Annette de Graaff, she recorded footage which showed Maccabee Tel Aviv fans attacking
*  local residents and then mainstream media outlets portrayed that as Maccabee Tel Aviv fans as the
*  ones who were being attacked, underlining again all the way through this horror how the world is
*  turned upside down. It's great to speak to you Annette, how you doing? I'm fine yes, a little
*  bit exhausted I have to say but fine. I can imagine you exhausted, I mean just tell me first before
*  I'm going to show just a clip that you took, could you just explain what, how did you get,
*  you were on the street, how did it happen? What was, you know, what brought you to think I want
*  to be here taking pictures? What was your kind of understanding at the time of what was happening?
*  Yes of course, well I was already there at six o'clock before the match and there were some
*  incidents on Dumb Square and I read about it on social so I was grabbing my iPhone and I went there.
*  I'm an iPhone photographer and yeah then at the moment at Dumb Square it was silenced
*  so the incidents were gone and the supporters, the Maccabee supporters were surrounded by the
*  police. There was a lot of police force everywhere so then from that moment on they were guided to
*  the entrance of Central Station where the subway leads them to the arena yes and that took a lot
*  of time. People were like, it was just like football supporters you know, very excited about
*  the match. There were some smoke bombs you know, for me that's, as a photographer that's nice so I
*  took my first footage. I'm always on top of my subject so I was inside of the group. Felt good,
*  you know, positive energy and so I posted that on X because I always do that immediately
*  and so they guided the group towards the Central Station. We were there, they were shouting, yes they
*  were going downstairs in groups and then they left. For me it was not exciting anymore. I went home
*  and I was thinking like okay I will return at 11 because they have to go back at the same entrance.
*  At the same entrance. So I was there quarter past 11 and you have to know as a photographer I'm only
*  interested in the police force because they are photogenic you know and I was thinking like okay
*  there will be a lot of police in front of that entrance. No, none, none. Only three buses with no
*  police inside, just one car passing by every time, no police force. So I went to a bridge that was in
*  the opposite of Central Station waiting for the supporters to come up. I saw they came up half past
*  11 from one side that was the side of the Central Station but also from another side that was there
*  on the right of me and that was a big group. They crossed me, I was in the middle of the group so
*  feeling their energy, yeah, it was like high adrenaline you know and a bit fucked up you know
*  and I was thinking like okay something is going to happen. Let's stand here, stay here because I
*  didn't feel to go after that very near. So they turned around on the dumb rock that's the street
*  between Central Station and the Dome Square and immediately they lit up the fireworks, big fireworks
*  it was like a bomb and they ran away. Yes, so I recorded the smoke of the bomb and them running away.
*  Then I was thinking like okay I think something more is going to happen. They gathered in front
*  of the Victoria Hotel, yes, and I was walking in front of them on the other side of the road. There
*  I was standing waiting what will happen you know and then they shouting you know and it was like
*  really really bad vibes, very really almost aggression and then I saw also Amsterdam youngsters
*  not really grouped but like two or three of them walking around. There were two with a Palestinian
*  flag around their bodies, there were scooters
*  shouting at each other from the one side of the road to the other side of the road. Well I couldn't
*  of course hear what they exactly said and then there was maybe two or three guys,
*  Amsterdam youngsters, they went in one corner of the group so they approached each other
*  and then the aggression started, the fight started so the supporters, the Maccabi supporters ran
*  after those three guys. One fell on the ground, two or three were, one fell on the ground,
*  was beaten, you know they escaped, went to the other side of the road. You can see that on the
*  footage. I had my camera on it was 15 one seconds of time. Shall I show you this footage? I can
*  show you the footage. Yes of course. Let me show it.
*  So that was Maccabi fans, they're the ones doing the attacking and that was your footage you took.
*  Yes. That footage was then used all over the western media to suggest that those were local
*  Dutch people attacking Maccabi fans. Yes I posted it like five minutes on X
*  and immediately it was taken from me. I posted it with a non-downloadable feature you know.
*  I posted it with my copyright sign on it and yeah immediately someone, I don't even know the name
*  of the guy but he's like an influencer in America and he posted it within saying something totally
*  the opposite like it was like some sort of Jews hunt and so people pointed that out to me.
*  So I immediately responded to this guy and said like you take it down or and I will show you the
*  real context and that was Maccabi supporters attacked the Dutchmen.
*  We could I mean that was I'm just giving another striking example because this is quite scandalous
*  that Sky News did a package which accurately summed up the events in Amsterdam and then they
*  did another package which then was actually just disinformation. They completely distorted what
*  happened and they use your footage and this I'll just show you this because it shows side by side
*  how Sky News originally presented accurately your footage and then what they did in the second
*  version. Let me just show you this. Maccabi fans were seen attacking locals as a police car can be
*  seen driving by. A video posted on social media shows a large group of hooded men dressed in black
*  running down the street and striking people at random. So what they did in the second version
*  is just completely erase what the hell was actually happening. They just said so it makes
*  it look ambiguous so it could be local residents attacking Maccabi fans. I mean what do you think
*  about when you saw this what are you thinking? I was shocked. I was really shocked not so much
*  because of what you can see from the re-editing of the original but also because I know and no one
*  knows that I was recorded in a live show of Sky News. So what happened with that? Friday night
*  half past nine I was actually live in their show in their broadcast and I commented on the footage
*  so they already knew what was happening and they acknowledged it even because they were like okay
*  very interesting very interesting what you are seeing here you know and then all of sudden
*  that's re-editing what you just showed it's like awful. So they actually knew. I have mailed them
*  and I have tried to phone the contact person and they say yes we are not going we are not
*  searching for the show. I said you can send me a link we are searching for the show.
*  They said show me the link to the show and they don't mail it to me. Weird that is really weird
*  and I would say sinister to be honest. Having appeared on Sky News many times that's extremely
*  weird. I mean what else in terms of because we saw across I mean in multiple news organizations the
*  BBC they took a still from that video and they had the headline showing something along the lines
*  of Tel Aviv fans attacked on the streets of Amsterdam and they used that as the main clip
*  that footage of what we just saw to make people look at that and think that was the other way
*  around. You've asked for an apology from multiple media organizations have you received any apology
*  because there's so many news organizations have used that footage in the way I've said
*  inaccurately. Has anyone apologized? Is it one German news organization? Yes. That's it.
*  Only Target Show. Yes so the the journalist phoned me I thought he wanted an interview
*  but he said no my apology so I was like well this is this is how you do it you know. So I was
*  very happy about that and I also said like let's show the world that you apologize so I can
*  ask the other news outlets to apologize and so we did but no respond. Not from one. Wow I mean as
*  I say it was multiple media organizations but use that footage to say it's Maccabee fans being attacked
*  and just finally I mean what other is there any other kind of key incidents that you witnessed
*  because I know that you said you're in contact with the police in order to try and in the
*  know loads to try and actually correct the record and what's happened is there any other kind of
*  incidents that you think are important that we know about? Well I will tell you something else
*  it is like you're almost you're almost doubting yourself on your own capability of observation
*  you know but I'm a photographer I'm trained but then the footage came out of Ben Derby
*  that young boy all the props to him. He's a young Dutch journalist and he showed them picking up
*  steel pipes and going on the rampage. Oh man man man man yes he saw the same things I saw but
*  more specific and I was so happy that I had someone who also were a witness and that made my
*  story of course and my presence online more trustworthy because it's all it's all about
*  trust it's all about finding the truth that is the most important. Absolutely we and we have we
*  know of course they attacked a Moroccan cab driver we know that they were throwing things at people's
*  homes that's on footage as well and obviously tearing down Palestinian flags and setting fire
*  to them setting on fireworks as they did so and well your work has been absolutely important
*  like let's say that every violence every violence needs to be condemned. Of course violence doesn't
*  have a label it's not it's not related to race it's not related to belief that's the most important
*  I think message we have to also spread so I am condemning anti-semitism in my city yes people are
*  afraid I have a Jewish friend she is afraid she's old so I feel for her you know but I also feel for the
*  other people in my city yeah who constantly are framed and I get a lot of response in my mailbox
*  of people who are thanking me like finally there's someone who shows the other side
*  Absolutely that's absolutely right and you know as I've said to myself any violence against
*  those Maccabees especially if it was just untargeted and it was based on anyone who they
*  thought was Israeli or a Maccabee fan has to be condemned and also if there was expressions of
*  anti-semitism and we have I know there's some footage which some have not been verified I have
*  to say by journalists but there is you know disturbing reports which have to be taken
*  always seriously and but what we see here is the truth that context was stripped away and not only
*  the context was stripped away it was turned on its head we can see that from your footage what
*  actually happened and how the media took it and turned it upside down honestly well done you've
*  done actually far more journalism than the most almost the entire western media you and that that
*  as you say that teenage Dutch reporter have been absolutely crucial so honestly can't appreciate
*  being able to speak to you enough for those watching do share this video
*  press like subscribe share your comments but honestly it's a real honour thank you so much
*  you too thank you for having me
