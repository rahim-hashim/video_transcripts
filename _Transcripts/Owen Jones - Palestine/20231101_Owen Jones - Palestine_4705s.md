# LIVE Gaza - Slaughter Without End
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [November 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gar8ed6lnoE)
*  Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to the show. The events in Gaza, as horrifying as ever,
*  we now know around 8,500 people have died, over 3,500 children, a truly dreadful death
*  toll. And must be said that must be feared that the worst is yet to come. Now, what I've been
*  doing on this channel as best I can, as well as obviously my own videos commenting on what's
*  happening is I've tried to elevate the voices that we need to be hearing from right now. It's
*  been a pretty broad range of people. And that includes, of course, Palestinians both here and
*  in Palestine, Israeli peace activists, Jewish peace activists here in Britain, medics, experts
*  generally. And today's no exception. We're very lucky today to have some fantastic speakers who
*  can speak from lived experience about the horror that is unfolding. And that's what I'll be trying
*  to do as best I can over the coming weeks. And particularly, I have to say, one of the things
*  which I found particularly disturbing is when we talk when Palestinians are platformed in the media,
*  it's often an interrogation, as though they're even though they have nothing to do with Hamas,
*  or the atrocities committed by Hamas, but they're almost as though they're being prosecuted. And I
*  think this is particularly disturbing often when these Palestinians on air who have lost their
*  relatives and lost their loved ones, a gruesome episode, all of this, but that's one particularly
*  disturbing facet of it. So it's particularly important that those I interview, I provide the
*  space to talk about what's happening on their own terms. So we have a lot to talk about today.
*  Later on, we'll have a brilliant medic who has been to Gaza many times who will talk about
*  humanitarian catastrophe, which is currently unfolding in Gaza. And we're also very lucky to
*  have a man who's an Israeli man whose cousin was kidnapped by Hamas on the 7th of October,
*  who is calling for peace. And shortly, I will be speaking to Ahmed Najjar, who is a Palestinian man
*  who has family in Gaza. Before we begin, I think it's just worth again just reflecting on where
*  we are currently at. Yesterday, a refugee camp, Jabaliyah, was hit by an Israeli missile. Let's
*  just see some of the devastation that was unleashed and the aftermath of that attack.
*  These are difficult images to watch and there's no shortage of videos exposing the horror of
*  what's being unleashed online. We are making an editorial decision at the moment, which is
*  difficult in terms of what we show, in terms of the horror of what's happened, which I'll talk
*  about I think later. I just want to see a response. This was a spokesperson for the Israeli Defense
*  Force who was interviewed on CNN in the aftermath of that missile attack, which has killed a huge
*  number of innocent civilians. And let's just see how he responded when being interviewed by
*  War Wolf. But you know that there are a lot of refugees, a lot of innocent civilians,
*  men, women, and children in that refugee camp as well, right?
*  This is the tragedy of War Wolf. I mean, we, as you know, we've been saying for days,
*  move south. The villains are not involved with the mass. Please move south.
*  I'm just trying to get a little bit more information. You knew there were civilians there.
*  You knew there were refugees, all sorts of refugees, but you decided to still drop a bomb
*  on that refugee camp attempting to kill the Samas commander.
*  I think it's important just to display that because, you know, obviously we're being told
*  over again, we're being told that the Israeli forces are not intentionally killing civilians. Now
*  I've done a lot in terms of the rhetoric of Israeli officials, Benjamin Netanyahu,
*  who refers to Amalek in the Bible, in which if you read that biblical passage, calls for the
*  killing of men, women, and children and animals for that matter. I have to say if it was a Muslim
*  country at war in this way, and the leader was quoting from the Koran, passages which call for
*  the extermination of all civilians. I wonder what conversation we'd be having, but at the same time,
*  whether it be Israeli officials saying that the focus is on damage and accuracy,
*  about reducing Gaza to a city of tents where all buildings are destroyed.
*  And I mean, it's so important that we're not gaslit into pretending that there is some sort
*  of attempt here to preserve civilian life. In a previous video I did earlier, I noted that the
*  Bosnian war, which took place over three years, an estimated 40,000 civilians died, and that was
*  regarded as particularly violent bloody war. Many of the soldiers died in that war as well.
*  Eight and a half thousand civilians have been killed in the space of three and a half weeks,
*  it's estimated, or eight and a half thousand people, Palestinians, have been killed.
*  The death toll may be significantly higher because the number under rubble.
*  And Gaza has half the population of Bosnia before that particular war. Iraq body count
*  have pointed out that the death rate in Gaza is 10 times higher than the same period of the Iraq
*  war back in 2003. I think it's very important that we do put this in context, the sheer scale
*  of death we're talking about, because this could go on for many months. And if in three and a half
*  weeks, eight and a half thousand people have been killed, it's just worth putting that in context.
*  And we will be talking later in terms of the humanitarian disaster, because a lot of the
*  focus is on the missiles and the weapons which have killed huge numbers of people, but we have
*  a medical health system which is collapsing and the lack of clean water, the lack of available food,
*  the scale of this humanitarian catastrophe, and what could happen next is something that
*  needs particular focus at the moment. And I'll be doing much more on that.
*  Now, if you're watching Life Press or not watching Life, please press like and do subscribe. You can
*  keep the show on the road on patreon.com. Questions to our guest, he's super chat, keeps the show on
*  the road in terms of the channel. Thank everyone at the end. I just want to straight bring in
*  straight away Akram Nazir, who has many hats, your playwright, director, actor, financial analyst,
*  many hats. Really appreciate having you here, Akram, because you have, so thank you, welcome.
*  So you have family currently in Gaza. I mean, you studied, didn't you,
*  Al-Azhar University in Gaza. So can you just tell me in terms of how many relatives you have in Gaza
*  at the moment and whether you've been in touch with them at all?
*  Well, my entire family is in Gaza right now. My parents, my siblings, nephews and nieces,
*  and extended family as well, cousins and what have you. I actually, I didn't manage to get
*  hold of my family since yesterday, since the massacre that happened in Jabalia Camp, which
*  you mentioned earlier on. And then also today, actually another massive attack in the Fallujah
*  area, which is in Jabalia Camp as well. And just half an hour ago, another attack in a Burashid
*  area, which is also in Jabalia Camp. All of these areas are very close to my parents' neighborhood
*  where all my family members are residing at the moment. So I managed to get hold of my sister,
*  who is in Khenyounis, which is in the south of Gaza. And she kept trying to call for more than
*  two hours. And I was keeping also trying to keep trying to call them. And she eventually managed
*  to get hold of them. Thankfully, they are still alive. But as you may be able to imagine how scared
*  they are and how really desperate in a way they don't know what to do, because all the attacks
*  are surrounding them. And there's been a lot of people killed that they know or they've heard
*  that they've been killed, but they're not sure because they don't have any way of actually
*  finding out who has been killed and who is not. So there has been, in the last 24 hours, has been
*  three massive attacks in Jabalia Camp. People don't know the number that has been killed,
*  but they're estimating about 600 people that have been killed in the three attacks since yesterday.
*  In the first attack, I have to say there's a lot of my relatives live in that neighborhood.
*  And we couldn't manage to get hold of them. And that's because all the communications in
*  particularly in Jabalia is down. So yeah, the I don't know, the situation is dire. The situation
*  is really extremely scary. And it doesn't look like Israel will is intending to stop at any point. I
*  think they will carry on. And I fear that it's almost like you're waiting. Is your family going
*  to be next? Is your immediate family? I mean, like, we have lost already three cousins, and then we're
*  now wondering, is my immediate family going to be next? Now, we were thinking about, but then my
*  sister in the South, and she said, it's, there's also a lot of bombardments everywhere. We don't
*  know with the same thing, we're hearing a lot of bombardments, but we're not quite sure where
*  exactly they are. So the whole of Gaza really is not is not safe at all. They don't know where to
*  go. They don't know what to do. And let alone the situation of the food and water and, and medicine.
*  My parents are diabetic, and they need the insulin regularly. And as you know, the insulin
*  goes in the fridge, and there's no electricity, no fridge to no electricity for the fridge.
*  And they've been really suffering, really suffering, trying to keep going. And they've
*  been drinking contaminated water, they've been manually filtering the water into putting it into
*  pieces of clothes and trying to filter it, doing whatever they can to survive. What's really
*  happening there is a genocide is a massacres everywhere in the streets is like an massive
*  earthquake has hit the entire Gaza Strip. Everywhere you go, their houses demolished. That's how
*  the picture that my family painting it to me is like, they're saying like, do you know that this
*  house that this house for this people is gone? This house, this house? Do you know this school
*  is gone? Do you know this bakery is gone? Do you know like hundreds of places that they they're
*  trying to remind me where they are? And then they're saying, yeah, this is gone. This is no
*  longer there. You know, this road that we used to go by the sea that yes, okay, it's gone. And
*  then like, this is this is insane. Like, it's literally nothing is left there.
*  When you hit that idea spokesperson, I referred to before should his short clip, and he was asked
*  by Wolf Blitzer about this refugee camp being bombed with a truly horrifying death toll. And
*  it was justified on the basis of a single Hamas commander being present. And his justification
*  was well, we told civilians to move south. Under international law, it doesn't that doesn't count.
*  You can't say you can't treat anyone who doesn't flee when you demand they flee. I mean, the UN
*  condemned that forcible removal or demand for people to leave and as a legitimate targets,
*  which is almost what the implication was, and many people couldn't flee. And even the south,
*  the south is being bombed. It's not safe. So yeah. But when you hear that, what's your reaction
*  when when you hear that justification, there was a single Hamas commander,
*  and that justified bombing a refugee camp? I think I fear that there is go they're going to
*  carry on committing more and more massacres and killing more people. And the world is giving them
*  really most Western governments have given them the green light to carry on to carry out their
*  massacres. And I feel that they feel the justification and the power to do what they are
*  doing. And because there's no one really trying to stop them as an in fact, they are actually
*  encouraging them to carry on. And we've seen what the position of our government here and even the
*  opposition government party, they were saying this is not the time for a ceasefire that actually has
*  made me feel sick, worried and disgusted at the same time, because how many Palestinians
*  do you need to be killed to call for a ceasefire? How many how many people to be displaced? We have
*  more than 1 million Palestinians in Gaza being displaced right now. 300 or 400 thousands of them,
*  they don't have any houses. How many how many destructions do you want? Is our life that
*  cheap? Is our life is not worthy? Is our life not the same as the Jewish people's lives in
*  that spot of land? And I think it does make me feel like really, really worried and scared
*  in looking back at history, how genocides were committed and how massacres were committed.
*  It was pretty much like that dehumanize these people and make the rest of the world feel okay
*  about killing them. And this is exactly what we're seeing in the mainstream media,
*  the politicians, the way that they are covering the conflict there. They never hold Israel
*  responsible for what is it doing. They never challenged Israelis narrative. They never
*  challenged Israeli politicians when they come out and speak in the mainstream media.
*  As a matter of fact, particularly, you know, BBC Sky News have been watching and following them,
*  and they're really giving justification to that. And this scares me a lot. I mean, they're complicit
*  and I, as a Palestinian, as a Palestinian British, I will not forget what the British
*  government's position towards my people, towards my family. They are, Israel is committing a genocide
*  in front of their eyes, and they're supporting that. I feel, you know, apart from the fact that
*  I feel helpless, but I feel very, very angry of their position, extremely angry about the fact
*  that they are supporting such an atrocity. I mean, I can't, I still can't believe it. I still can't,
*  you know, still can't sink into me. It's like, how could you not even call for a ceasefire?
*  This is beyond belief for me. I can't comprehend what's, why wouldn't you do that?
*  Save lives, call for ceasefire, stop the fighting. And to be very honest, I think there's a lot of
*  ignorance about the fact that they keep telling people, oh, but Israel is after Hamas. I don't
*  understand, I don't think they actually understand what's Hamas. And they even probably haven't read
*  the Charter of Hamas, or they don't know what Hamas is. And it's just a name that trying to
*  throw a dust in people's eyes, and they don't see the truth what's happening on the ground.
*  And so that gives Israel the legitimacy and justification to carry on whatever plan they have,
*  to make Palestinians refugees again, or to take Gaza over again, or whatever plans they have.
*  And that's what it is, because I don't really think they know who Hamas is, and what Hamas is.
*  Hamas is an idea of resistance. Are you going to, do you think that by finishing Hamas,
*  you're going to finish the resistance? Someone else will resist. And Hamas,
*  it wasn't there for all of that. Hamas was created in the late 80s, and before that it was the PLO,
*  before that were other parties, and after as well, the resistance is there, as long as there's
*  suppression, there's occupation, then there will always be resistance. So I'm not, I don't really
*  know why they can't get there. I don't really know why can't they just call for peace, why they can't
*  really put their effort to settle this conflict, to try and implement justice for both. And I don't
*  understand why can't they see it. It just the way that I see it is that they don't think of other
*  Palestinians as humans. They dehumanize us, and they don't want us there. And that's how I see it.
*  The problem is in the international community, and we know what Israel is going to do, but we are
*  deeply, deeply disappointed on the international community that is supporting the Israeli
*  narrative, which is unfortunately now, sadly, is carrying the, it's carrying genocides into it.
*  I mean, I should say as well, just in terms of just finally, because I'm very glad to have taken
*  up so much of your time, but in previous counterinsurgencies, for example, in Iraq,
*  when there was a counterinsurgency against Al-Qaeda, and what happened is an even more extreme
*  force filled the vacuum, which was ISIS. And there's a lack of imagination there, I think,
*  in terms of, if you look historically, what happens with these sorts of, when the focus is on
*  military solutions, as it were, rather than... Exactly.
*  I mean, just finally, there's also just talk of, which is being discussed, it's from the
*  intelligence ministry in Israel, though many are pointing out the Israeli ministry doesn't actually
*  have the source of sweeping power, you might think, but nonetheless, discussing the potential for
*  driving the entire population of Gaza into the Sinai desert. That has been discussed by other
*  officials, of course, and that isn't, that's not what, you know, an Egypt has warned that could be
*  the case. I mean, is that a worry, that this could end with Gaza's population being driven from...
*  Absolutely. Absolutely. This is a massive worry. When I spoke to my dad three days ago,
*  the last time I spoke to him, I managed to get hold of him, and I said, like,
*  Dad, why don't you just leave, go to the south? And then he said to me, I have been displaced,
*  I have been made refugees twice before in my life. He was born in a small town, in a Palestinian
*  town that's now Israel, and he's 77 years old now. And then he was displaced at that time in the
*  Nakba, and again in the 70s, and he said to me, I will not go, I will not leave into a refugees camp
*  to start again from scratch. I've started this twice in my life, and I can't see myself doing it
*  again now. I cannot, at the age of 77, I will not leave. And then a lot of fearing amongst the
*  Palestinians in Gaza, fearing that could be the case that they drive them to Sinai desert,
*  and I think the Israeli politicians have spoken clearly about that. And it's a huge, massive fear
*  for me that might be the case. And yeah. I mean, I really appreciate you joining us. It's such a
*  difficult time for you, and I know the coming weeks and days and weeks will be full of worry and
*  concern, but so many people obviously are not just thinking about you, but doing their best to think,
*  to campaign to end this, this absolute horror show, which is obviously consumed your lives and
*  the lives of so many people. So we really appreciate you being able to talk to us. It's
*  such a difficult time and look forward to speaking to you again. But thank you so,
*  so much for joining us. Honestly, really appreciate it. Thank you. Thanks very much for inviting me.
*  Always. Cheers. Take care. Difficult conversation to be having. Really appreciate, obviously,
*  talking to us and we'll continue to platform as many Palestinian voices as we can. Now really
*  delighted to be joined by Udi Garen. Udi is from Israel. His cousin was kidnapped by Hamas on the
*  7th of October. Udi, someone else, obviously in a very difficult situation. So really, really,
*  really appreciate being able to speak to us, given the raw emotions of what you're going through.
*  Thank you. Frisik, can you just tell me in terms of on 7th of October, just tell me a bit about
*  your cousin, about what happened and how you found out and what was going through your head, I suppose?
*  Yeah, so first of all, thank you for having me and having these stories also be told.
*  On the 7th of October, it took a while until people in Israel realized what was going on
*  in the South. Once headlines started coming out, we started calling my family and we have a family,
*  all of my moms, all of my mother's family, they live in southern Israel in Kibbutz, which is about
*  four kilometers from Gaza. And they were among the Kibbutz team that were hit very hard, very early.
*  At about 6.30 in the morning, they heard a very odd amount of sirens. They're very used to the
*  sirens of missile launches from Gaza, but this was something completely out of the ordinary.
*  Everybody ran to the bomb shelters. And soon after, they realized there were people trying
*  to infiltrate the Kibbutz. Tal, my cousin, went out trying to defend his house, or his home rather.
*  And we know he was accompanied by his brother-in-law. We know he encountered some of the
*  terrorists that were trying to get into the Kibbutz. And that's about eight o'clock, that's the last
*  time his wife was able to reach him. And from that point on, we don't really know what had happened.
*  His phone was traced to Gaza. His body wasn't found anywhere. He's not in any of the Israeli
*  hospitals. So that leads us to conclude that he is being held hostage in Gaza.
*  I mean, that's a huge amount for you to process. I mean, being left in limbo like that and just
*  having no idea whatsoever about what's happened to someone you all love so much. I mean,
*  lots of people in your situation have come to the conclusion of war is the only answer,
*  but you haven't come to that conclusion. Can you just talk through what's going through your mind
*  and what your position is? I think you made a very good point with the previous interview. And
*  I also want to extend my warm, heartfelt compassion to Ahmed, who spoke before me.
*  He was in a terrible, terrible situation. The fact that I'm in pain and losing sleep doesn't
*  mean that his pain is any less than mine, especially when he has so much family there.
*  And I think in your conversation with him, you pointed out the exact answer. There is no military
*  solution to this conflict. There never was, there isn't, there never will be. And he made a very
*  good point as well, that when the Israeli politicians backed by Prime Minister Sunak or
*  by President Biden say, we're going to win, we're going to annihilate Hamas, I haven't heard anyone
*  ask them, what does that mean? Because he said it exactly right. Hamas is an idea of resistance,
*  and you cannot kill an idea of resistance. It doesn't matter how many commanders we kill,
*  it doesn't matter how many soldiers of Hamas we kill, it doesn't matter how many missile launching
*  sites we destroy, as long as the idea is there, they'll find a way to rise again. And with more
*  vengeance, with more anger, with more power, and the spiral will continue on and on and on.
*  And I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that there will never ever be a military solution to
*  this. And again, referring to your point, it has never happened before. You can look at the US,
*  everything they've tried to do, even when they aim for good at times, with Iraq and Afghanistan
*  being the most recent examples, power or war, violence, will never ever change public opinion.
*  You cannot go into a people that hate you and resist you, and then by force make them love you
*  and stop opposing you. It's actually ridiculous. It's childish to think that. It's so mind-blowingly
*  infantile to think that. All you need to do is just pick up your phone and Google it.
*  You don't have to be an expert military man. You don't have to be a professional historian with a
*  PhD. Pick up your damn phones and just find one instance in history where it worked. You won't,
*  because an oppressed people will always find a way to fight their oppressor.
*  I think when we talk about these precedents, Afghanistan being one where you had a two-decade
*  long occupation, which ended with the Taliban stronger than it was before, Iraq-
*  Within a month. Within a month. It's not even like there was something like a period that something
*  worked out. Iraq, I gave that other example, but the problem even with that, because you had,
*  the argument that Saddam Hussein was in cahoots with Al-Qaeda, which was a nonsense, but after
*  the Iraq war, that's when you got Al-Qaeda in Iraq. You had a counterinsurgency program,
*  and then when Al-Qaeda was supposedly defeated, ISIS replaced it. It was far, far worse in terms
*  of not just its extremism, but how much of Iraq and Syria it took hold of. But the point there is
*  it's not even comparable because the context of Al-Qaeda in Iraq compared to Palestine with the
*  decades going back of occupation and not having a nation, that kind of thing, it's not even-
*  So that's the, logically, but the problem is, I suppose this is the fear that many in your
*  situation understandably are angry and full of grief, and on that emotional level, just there's
*  inevitable human response, which is you go in there and white guards are off the map.
*  That's where some have ended up. What would you say to people who think there is a military
*  solution to this in that sense? Because it seems that in Israeli society, there were brave
*  peace activists who were really fighting, but the atmosphere is very, very difficult to make those
*  arguments. Yeah, so, okay, so you've asked a very good question, and I've got three different
*  responses that I want to give to that. So first of all, what do I tell people? I don't keep quiet
*  at any point. I don't keep quiet because, like that guy in Vietnam, during the Vietnam War that
*  stood outside the White House with a sign saying, stop the war. And when people ask them, why are
*  you there? You're not going to make any difference. You're not going to change the world. He said,
*  I want to make sure the world doesn't change me. So I will not keep quiet, and especially in these
*  times, because this is when your true values and morals come into play. And I think that many
*  people, understandably so, because they're struck by grief and anger and rage, and it's far beyond
*  that. It's far beyond that. And maybe we'll have time to address it. What did the Hamas attack
*  really do in Israel? But their response is, you know, we have the military, we have the power,
*  and that's also what we've been used to. That's what we have been told from a very early age.
*  That's the ethos that Israel was founded on, that if we don't take care of ourselves, if we don't
*  fight back, they will destroy us, which was true until 1973. It was 100% true. Exactly 50 years
*  ago, the Yom Kippur War, the 73 war. But this ethos remains. So what I tell people right now
*  is what I tell myself, think of your own interest. What's your interest? Not what's your position,
*  not what you feel like, not how you want to support and kill and destroy and revenge and whatever.
*  What is your interest? What's your long-term interest? What is going to be the optimal result
*  for this war that would benefit you, you the Israeli citizen? And I don't think that destroying
*  Gaza is the right answer. First of all, because if we're doing that and the ground invasion
*  is continued, we are basically saying to the world, we give up on the hostages. We don't care
*  about the hostages. We care about continuing with the war, achieving our goals. And this is it.
*  In human lives and civilian lives, very important to stress this out.
*  Kids, pregnant women, elderly, chronically ill, these are not a priority. So this is the meaning
*  of continuing with the war and not calling for a ceasefire. Aside from that, and I think
*  this is something that's a huge topic, but Israelis are not only very fearful,
*  and this is something that I think the world does not understand when it comes to how Israelis
*  perceive themselves, because we keep building walls and more walls and more walls around us.
*  And we keep attacking three times or 10 times or 100 times hard as we're hit, because Israelis
*  are incredibly fearful for their lives, historically, for right reasons. And
*  we're trying, I think it's a lot due to our politicians who are, I don't think are very good,
*  that we somehow think that the Gaza problem would just disappear or the Palestinian problem would
*  just disappear. And the only time that it really makes the headlines and people actually think
*  about it and give it a lot of attention is when we're at war. And this is the sentiment,
*  we just want this problem to be over, because all we have been promised by our politicians,
*  our politicians, and by Hamas, is that there is no resolution. That's the only thing we're being
*  told. So that's my point. I tried to speak of our own interests, because the Palestinians will not
*  evaporate into thin air. They're not going to disappear magically. They will stay there. And,
*  you know, sadly for us, that's what I keep telling people, there are problems. We don't border the
*  Swiss. We don't border the Danes. Maybe it would have been much easier. We border the Palestinians,
*  and they're there to stay, and we are there to stay. And it's our responsibility to solve this
*  situation. Which brings me to my other point in regards to your question when you said this is
*  no comparison to Iraq and Afghanistan, because this is an ongoing occupation. And it's a true
*  statement. But what's missing in the public discourse, what's 100% missing in the public
*  discourse, especially on the more leftist activists, is the Palestinian responsibility
*  for their own fate. And I don't mean what's happening now in Gaza. Absolutely not. The
*  people who are now in Gaza are in a horrific situation, which is awful beyond comprehension.
*  But for 75 years, the main attitude of the Palestinian leadership was we don't have a state
*  because of Israel. We don't have a state because of the US, because of the UN, because of Europe,
*  because of whoever. And they had several opportunities to have a state. And I'll tell
*  you more than that. They still have an opportunity to have a state. But this opportunity has to be
*  taken, not waited for. And I'll just finish this thought, and I'll be happy to have you ask me about
*  it. In 1948, the whole region was under occupation. And after 1948, Israel had a state and the
*  Palestinians did not. And there was a reason, and we could go on and on about this. And they had
*  several other opportunities in the past. But the main thing is that every time we reach this point,
*  we're in the middle of the war, and then Israel hits very, very hard. And this is no excuse by
*  any means to the carnage that's happening in Gaza. This is absolutely not my point. But between now
*  and the next round of violence, Israel has the responsibility to solve it. But you know who else
*  has the responsibility to solve it? Hamas and the Palestinian Authority. And the same request, claim,
*  and demand need to be made from all sides. Yeah, I suppose. I mean, I don't want to get too bogged
*  down, obviously, in terms of the history. And I really appreciate, obviously, you coming to talk
*  about it. And particularly that call for peace and not least given what you're going through.
*  I suppose if I was going to just, in terms of a historical context, because you mentioned we don't
*  border the Swiss. But if the Swiss didn't have a state and they were deprived of their ability to
*  have a nation and they were in the same situation, I don't think there would have been any difference.
*  In 1948, 700,000 Palestinians were driven from their homes, huge numbers were built during the
*  Nakba. And then, you know, the PLO did accept the peaceful route, didn't really have very much to
*  show for it. The West Bank has been settled illegally. And if we look at, because I mean,
*  I think many would contest the idea there were several opportunities to have a viable Palestinian
*  state. But also, if we look at Hamas and why so many ended up being driven into the arms of Hamas,
*  it's not just the fact that Israeli newspapers like Haaretz have exposed how Benjamin Netanyahu
*  and those around him helped, it was in their interest to divide the Palestinian people.
*  But the difference between Israel and the Palestinians is the Palestinians, of course,
*  are deprived of the ability to have a state, they've been deprived of that ability for a
*  very long time, they've been driven from their homes repeatedly. And they don't have the support
*  of the military superpower. Israel, of course, does. And, you know, the West Bank at the moment,
*  you see that it's not under the control of Hamas, we can see the wave of onslaught.
*  That's not exactly true. That's not exactly true. That's not a true statement.
*  Which bit is it, sorry?
*  That it's not under the control of Hamas.
*  No, it's, of course, it's under the PLO, of course. Yes.
*  Israel withdrew tomorrow morning, the next day, Abu Mazen would be hung in the main square of
*  Ramallah, and Hamas would take power. Because the Palestinians are extremely, extremely frustrated
*  with them. Well, I mean, that's the part that's my point, I suppose, you know,
*  how much it was 30 years ago, Hamas would not be in the position is that and what we've seen is
*  the undermining of the secular movements, which ended up abandoning the armed struggle. And that
*  wasn't rewarded in the eyes of the Palestinian people. I mean, look, I suppose where we would
*  agree, because I don't want to take up too much of your time is there is no solution without one
*  that accepts that Jews, Israelis, Israelis and Palestinians, Jews and Palestinians,
*  they're not going anywhere. This is your shared land. There is no, there's no peaceful settlement,
*  unless there is a security, safety and peace for Palestinians and Israelis in that same
*  strip of land. But I would just say just because I had to introduce the history, I suppose,
*  and I don't think we can address that unless we obviously accept the asymmetry of power and
*  who has whose backing and who doesn't. I wouldn't 100% agree with you. But this is a whole different
*  discussion. No, I know. My point, just my point being, is that it takes two to tango always,
*  and when we speak now about this war, and we speak about the carnage going on in Gaza,
*  it's true carnage. It's horrible. I don't support it. I want the war to stop and I want to cease fire
*  immediately. Not just because of my cousin, because I think what's being done to the Gazans
*  is immoral and I think what's being done in Gaza is not in Israel's interest. For all these reasons,
*  I think we should have a ceasefire immediately. However, when we address this situation and we
*  don't acknowledge that this began, the reason we're talking right now is that three weeks ago,
*  this event began by crimes against humanity, conducted against civilians, that most of them,
*  the irony is that most of them are left-leaning, peaceful or pro-resolution Israelis that would be
*  potential partners for any kind of peace agreement or future peace agreement.
*  When we leave this out, when the discussion is only about what Israel is doing now,
*  we're missing the point because what it does, and I don't think you could be exposed to it as much
*  as I am because I read the Israeli media, is that what it does, it makes Israel get tougher
*  on its positions or Israelis get tougher because we sit at home, not me, but we as Israelis,
*  sit at home and they hold their heads and they just say, I can't believe they're defending
*  Kamas. How is that possible? When you mention about progressive,
*  careful that I'm sensitive with obviously how I express this, not least given what you've
*  gone through. I was with an Israeli friend on the 7th of October and his cousin was at the rave
*  and escaped, two of his friends got kidnapped. I was with him, he was on the phone to his
*  family back in Israel talking about that and these are progressive Israelis who are predisposed to
*  peace. My worry would always be just, look, the 7th of October, what Hamas did was terrible.
*  I just say crimes against humanity. These were crimes against humanity. There was no cause on
*  earth that justifies the murder of innocent civilians. None. And it's very important that
*  we talk about those atrocities and I've always tried ever since it began to condemn those hideous
*  indefensible atrocities that were committed and that we have to understand the pain and the
*  suffering and also to put it in the wider context of the collective trauma that so many Jews feel
*  given the 2000 years of persecution that Jews and that whenever you get something like this,
*  that always brings that to the surface. I suppose the point I would make is it's so important that
*  we don't start the clock there because clearly that's not when the clock began.
*  Absolutely not.
*  The 7th of October is so important that this began decades and decades ago. It didn't even
*  begin in 1948, it began before 1948.
*  You can go back 150 years, easy.
*  Exactly. But look, your voice is so important regardless of us discussing that wider context
*  because the fact is to call for a ceasefire given what you've gone through is something which
*  I think just speaks to your sense of humanity and your sense of whatever you're going through,
*  your family are going through, your belief in the common humanity of Palestinians and
*  those in Israel and your belief that this suffering has to end, whatever ends up
*  happening afterwards and whatever the way forward is, I think it really speaks to that humanity.
*  So I just really appreciate it and I hope obviously that your cousin comes out safe and back with you
*  and the family and I just really appreciate you being able to speak to us.
*  Thank you. And I want to encourage everyone who cares about this region and it doesn't matter
*  if you feel that your position is being pro-Palestinian or being pro-Israeli,
*  I encourage everyone to think about their own interests and if your interest is saving human
*  lives and you care, you truly care about the lives of Palestinians or you truly care about the lives
*  of Israelis, then the call should be equal. A ceasefire and immediately after, immediately after,
*  keep talking about this all the time, not just when we're at war because otherwise it will never end.
*  And that's I think a brilliant way to end it. Udi, thank you so much and all my thoughts and thank
*  you so much for having me. Cheers, take care. Again, really important that we have this,
*  such a great, such an important range of voices and we'll continue to have all the way through this,
*  I'm just even talking about all the way through, I mean when, when and does that, what time frame
*  I've been talking about here, that we will all the way through do our best to platform
*  a whole range of different voices and including having discussions and debates about things where
*  we will disagree or agree. I do think it's so important that we have someone there who's
*  gone through a trauma and has spoken, I think very hot from the heart, in support of a ceasefire,
*  which within Israeli society now is a very isolated position to have and I think it's just
*  worth bearing that in mind. I'm now going to begin, very lucky to have Brenda Kelly who is
*  a consultant obstetrician, I can't even say obstetrician can I? Obstetrician. It's not even
*  hard to say, what's my problem? Brenda it's so great to speak to you, it's medics for Gaza,
*  am I right? Am I just, am I? Gaza medics, well we're a team, I'm part of a team of doctors who,
*  based in Oxford and London, who've been going to Gaza for the last 12, 13 years and we were
*  actually supposed to be going again on Friday, to do to start teaching on Sunday in Gaza,
*  but because of the events we're obviously no longer doing that, but instead what we're doing
*  is coming together as a team with our friends and colleagues in Gaza to ensure that they have an
*  ongoing platform. So we have Gaza medics voices, which is on Twitter or X and on Instagram,
*  where we're trying to stream curated voices because in honesty Owen, a lot of the material
*  we're getting from friends and colleagues is so horrific that we've had to edit and we've certainly
*  not been able to post the videos that we've had coming through, which have been deeply distressing
*  but what we want to do is stand in solidarity with our friends and colleagues in Gaza, many of whom
*  we've known for years with former medical students as well that we've worked with and ensure their
*  voice comes out to the world. We're very lucky to speak last week to Omar Abdelman and your colleague
*  who spoke brilliantly about what was happening but it's not, and I should say this, it is
*  difficult to hear the details but painfully necessary and you've spoken about how you've
*  had to edit some of the stuff you've got because we are speaking about absolutely
*  just hideous horrors which are beyond the realms of most people's nightmares and I think it's
*  important we talk about that. I mean what the sorts of things you're hearing, because you've
*  been to obviously Gaza repeatedly but you're getting this information on the ground. We spoke
*  to Omar a week ago and things were catastrophic. Well I would say that a week ago we were talking
*  in terms of catastrophic humanitarian crises and actually the reality is that it's way beyond that
*  now. What we're seeing on the footage that's coming through from our medical colleagues is
*  an apocalypse. I mean it is absolutely unimaginable. I mean Omar would have spoken about
*  how the situation was before October 7th in that the Gaza and Palestine is admitted in
*  under siege for many many years. The hospitals were already working at capacity, already hugely
*  dependent on outside aid coming in. We've worked with some incredibly highly skilled
*  you know clinicians, surgeons and so forth but nothing prepares for such a mass casualty situation
*  and it's the scale of the killing and it is the scale of the repeated atrocities,
*  it's the unrelenting nature of what's happening. We are also hearing stories of hospitals,
*  our main link is with Al-Shifa but we're hearing stories of hospitals running out of very basic
*  supplies. One of the most distressing things that I have personally heard in the last 24 hours is
*  you know the narrative of you know a clinician treating a child with 90 percent you know body
*  covered in third degree burns, unable to even give basic paracetamol, basic pain relief, running out
*  of really really basic stuff. You know the Jabalia massacre that happened yesterday with
*  further bombardments today, you know there are children arriving in hospital and I'm sorry to
*  be graphic about this but there are children arriving in hospital with partially severed limbs
*  with disembowelment, with their with their abdomens actually open with balls hanging out
*  and not been able to care. You know the clinicians in Gaza are stripped of the most basic tools of
*  medical care, they're stripped of the ability to give comfort through pain relief, they're
*  stripped of the ability to even adequately dress wounds with a lack of dressings for wounds.
*  You know Hassan Abu Seti was talking about you know someone going to the corner shop to get vinegar
*  to cleanse a wound, you know it's unimaginable. You know there's been a lot of discourse around
*  the shortage of anaesthetics, you know there sadly are cases where you know
*  people are having you know fractures you know reduced or you know sort of very basic medical
*  care that would have been done under local anaesthetic or under regional anaesthetic,
*  been done with that anaesthetic or under very very light sedation. You know it is in a modern
*  society and I always come back with this striking thing when you cross from
*  Israel into Gaza, you cross from this first world country into a situation where you have well you
*  cross from everything that available tarmac roads you know beautiful hostels into a situation where
*  they want for such basic things. You know before the war one in three essential drugs could not
*  be found in Gaza on a reliable basis and now we're in a completely different situation.
*  I've just heard before I came on the show that the Turkish friendship hospital which is the only
*  cancer hospital in Gaza you know it has you know about 10,000 cancer patients in Gaza, this is the
*  only cancer hospital, it's now going to be out of service. They've experienced repeated bombardments
*  in the last 48 hours, they've now run out of fuel. Al-Shifa you know the major trauma center in fact
*  it's the major hospital receiving trauma, it doesn't have trauma trained surgeons, it's got
*  excellent vascular surgeons, orthopedic surgeons and general surgeons but you know Al-Shifa are
*  also on their knees running out of fuel in addition to the basic medical supplies. There is a sort of
*  message put out from the Ministry of Health asking you know any civilians if they have extra fuel,
*  spare fuel, to you know to donate that to the hospital to try and keep generators running
*  and I think you know the situation's deteriorated even further in that with the repeated cries for
*  you know from the Israelis to evacuate from northern and central Gaza you know that's
*  an impossibility in reality. You're asking sort of to evacuate thousands of you know staff and
*  patients as well as the sort of you know 115, 120,000 internally displaced people who are taking shelter
*  in those hospitals and you're asking to move to a part of Gaza that we know in the past week has
*  also been targeted in bombing so just over thousands of the deaths have been in calm units and about
*  800 or so deaths have been recorded in Ra'atba so there is no safe space in Gaza.
*  The interesting question that I've heard asked of my colleagues who've come onto media to speak
*  about the humanitarian crisis which just beggars belief it's that question asked of
*  humanitarians like myself and Omar you know but there's really yes they may be bombing the
*  hospitals they may be doing that but they're targeting Hamas. The reality is as you know as
*  you've heard Gaza is such a densely populated area you cannot you know bomb targeted you know Hamas
*  without having indiscriminate killings but the other questions come up repeatedly is you know but
*  Hamas are the baddies they're using the civilians as human shields and it's interesting how often
*  that question's asked without actually the sort of kickback on that you know are you asking us
*  to legitimise the bombing of hospitals and the bombing of civilians you know it's just
*  I sometimes struggle with the narrative around this where it comes one way but the question
*  isn't ever about the morality of the Israelis bombing and massacring civilians.
*  And I think that's a really I mean look let's be honest in terms of what's underpinning this is
*  such a systematic dehumanisation of Palestinian life because there isn't even a sense here that
*  in this discussion that Palestinian life matters so I mean you know that's how you end up with
*  a rationale between an entire refugee camp being bombed for the sake of one Hamas commander.
*  Oh it's appalling it's appalling and and but the reality is no matter which part of Gaza
*  the Israelis the idea of bomb they will be hitting of course hundreds of civilians every
*  single time and you know as one of my colleagues said earlier today every child that dies that
*  that's someone's everything yeah um you know we've heard of you know entire families being wiped off
*  the civil register and you know it is truly appalling. The um I mean the the narrative
*  around the numbers and dehumanisation I'm from Northern Ireland and you know lives you know
*  through the troubles and I come under the same thing happened in Northern Ireland that sort of
*  death of the British soldier you know being demoted to page five of the newspaper or if it was a sort
*  of you know loyalist new newspaper it was the death of a Catholic got demoted and quite rapidly
*  we dehumanised and I think the the scale of this horror it cannot be underestimated or understated
*  you know if I think about Northern Ireland you know we had um just over 3700 deaths in a 30-year
*  conflict I mean the latest news we're getting from Gaza is we've almost got the same number of
*  children who have died in just over three weeks it when we think about the statistics that have
*  come out about civilian deaths in Ukraine after the Russian invasion so we're talking over a sort
*  of 18-month period about 9 700 deaths we're getting so close to that in Gaza in three and a
*  half weeks and Ukraine is a much much bigger population I mean the population of Gaza is
*  2.2 million or so and the population of Ukraine is 44 million and also you've got to think of the
*  geographical area I think I keep hearing discussions about the city in the north and the city in the
*  south the whole of Gaza could fit under the onto the isle of white um you know so if you think
*  about internal displacement of 1.4 million people and you've got that on the sort of same geographical
*  area of the isle of white and it's densely populated you've got to measure humanitarian
*  prices straight away in terms of sanitation lack of water and so forth um but it's it's
*  extraordinary and the other thing I'd say with the conflict I mean some of the previous um
*  contributors to the show have mentioned the zone is that in no other conflict in no other natural
*  disaster in the world in modern times has there ever been such a blockade of humanitarian aid in
*  has there ever been such targeting of civilian um homes hospitals schools all protected places
*  you know schools hospitals protected under the Geneva Convention and in Gaza previously within
*  24 hours of you know an Israeli military strike there has been humanitarian going in aid going in
*  there have been additional personnel to come in and relieve the absolutely exhausted medical staff
*  some of whom are actually you know we had a posting from a nurse um earlier today where you
*  know there's a description of you know watching a colleague a fellow nurse meet an injured patient
*  to realize it's her her child um and that while she was at work her family home was bombed but
*  but these these medical staff are working on to duress and they they need help themselves they
*  need aid coming in um as well I mean just I don't want to keep making these comparisons but I mean
*  I keep talking about Bosnia at the moment I do think there was some striking parallels at the
*  moment by the way because the Bosnian Serbs suffered a genocide in World War II they suffered
*  terrible atrocities the first big massacre of the Bosnian War was against Bosnian Serb civilians
*  and I read through some of the details of some things Bosnian Serb civilians suffered
*  um which I can't repeat here but they were similar to that which Hamas
*  um and there was the the position of Bosnian Serbs that they needed an ethno state to protect
*  themselves from Muslim domination I just want to just be clear here um but no one
*  identifies what the Bosnian Serb nationalist leaders did in the atrocities that they just
*  committed I've been to Sarajevo I've seen I've interviewed people who on the receiving end of
*  that but the point I would just make again is 40 000 civilians I estimated to have died in the
*  Bosnian War in three years um up to around 100 000 overall died but they were mostly soldiers
*  on each side and that was over a three-year period and Bosnia had twice the pre-war population of
*  Gaza so we're already at a situation within three and a half weeks when the total death toll in Gaza
*  is a quarter of the total civilian deaths in the entire Bosnian War and half if you do it per
*  capita yeah I mean I just just finally on that I mean you know the humanitarian catastrophe
*  because this I think one of the most surreal in the worst possible way things I've ever
*  experienced my entire life um in that I've I've you know it's I've always studied atrocity throughout
*  history and being fascinated in a multiple way and how these atrocities are made possible
*  how they get consent and complicity how people otherwise regard themselves as as as as humane
*  rational moderate people buy in but we are talking aren't we about a one of the most
*  severe humanitarian catastrophes of our time and yet it has the buy-in of most of our politicians
*  and journalists how do you feel as a medic how do you feel as a medic knowing what's happening
*  the medical catastrophe your government our government is it's something it's calling you
*  on I mean the the I was I was just thinking this morning is there some sort of threshold body count
*  at which the US and the UK government will say okay it's now time to stay the hand of Netanyahu
*  I mean look at look at what I mean I know this isn't the subject of this program but
*  if you think of how late we were to step in and you know work within the Balkan War that you
*  mentioned or other major conflicts it's you know how many people Rwanda how many people do we need
*  to see massacred how big does the genocide have to be how big does that body kind have to be
*  before finally our governments what what what does it take and I think that thing about you know
*  Udi mentioned it our politicians are clearly you know somehow they're over a barrel on this and I'm
*  not quite sure exactly what drives them or how they sleep in bed at night but it's I think there's
*  a huge role for civil society here you know as medics you know we're coming together we're trying
*  to ensure the voice out there I know that within the global surgery community there's a growing
*  a number of doctors who are coming together to try and lobby against their national bodies
*  in their countries they're trying to lobby politicians in our Oxford you know locality
*  we've had several or seven labor councillors resigned from from the party and resign their
*  and that's that's what I mean by civil action in Belgium we've had you know transports you know
*  blocking any sort of arms leaving Belgium so I think civil society has to come together and and
*  to sort of the liver Liverpool streets are sit sit in the you know the Jewish rights human rights
*  activists and you know that sort of thing is really really powerful I mean the we could spend
*  another half hour talking about our esteemed home secretary here and the language that she is using
*  you know this is a home secretary renowned for her hate speech against asylum seekers you know the
*  sort of othering and dehumanization of asylum seekers to now turn around and talk about peaceful
*  protest as happened in London on Saturday where you had people from all denominations you had people
*  you know from all walks of life young old families whatever coming together in a unified cause in a
*  largely peaceful process a protest and you had our esteemed home secretary define that as you know
*  you know a hate an incident of hate you know a sort of protest of hate and other slanderous
*  words against humanitarian cause and humanitarian rights I do not see our government at any point
*  standing up for the Geneva Convention that it is the signatory of and I think that's quite frankly
*  you know embarrassing at least oh and you and I can sort of when this is hopefully over and hopefully
*  soon we can at least say that we did something we're standing we're talking about it and I think I
*  am a believer in the butterfly effect I think if if these conversations start and if everyone starts
*  having these conversations we might just get somewhere as a civil society what I think is
*  really really hard is when I hear people talking about how the scenes from Gaza are so distressing
*  they turn off the television yeah that's the danger if only the doctors the nurses the paramedics
*  that we have had contact with could turn off the television you know at night time and that and that
*  media blackout that's calmed blackout that's happened before the weekend and it's happened again
*  for a time this morning you know what psychological torture is that because that is you know that is
*  saying to the Palestinians you know you're you're cut off now we can do as we like you know this is
*  how much power we have over you the only thing they haven't yet cut off from Gaza to my mind
*  is the air that they breathe because the torture that's going on psychologically physically is
*  is inhumane as well if we think about any of the major mass shootings and just take what happened
*  in Maine you know in USA can you imagine the outcry if there was a sort of loss of connectivity
*  from phones and from internets you know for people not to be able to call an ambulance for people
*  who have friends or family in hospital not to know how they are and not to be able to phone your
*  friends say they've survived or not survived you know what has happened there is pure psychological
*  torture. Renda honestly I just know basically of everything that you you do I'm always in all
*  doctors not just my partner's a doctor but at the best of times but to be able to speak so
*  humanely about about this catastrophe and to put it in that broader context honestly I really
*  appreciate it I'm sorry by the way my cat all the way through is being very annoying. I had locked my dog my dog is sitting here and I'm through a glass of water here.
*  There was a tweet when I started but he he decided to stop playing up but um yeah and what you said I just
*  think it's it's so it's so crucial to put that border context after you leave I'm going to talk
*  actually a bit about Liverpool Street and and the protests you have to delegitimize them but
*  Brenda honestly and the stuff you've all been doing to raise uh to provide a voice
*  uh for what's happening in terms of the medics in Gaza I mean the at sorry I keep I always share
*  the ads and I will after this as well of um of of the Gaza medic voices so it's on x as
*  Gaza medic voices and instagram is just Gaza medic voices the other interesting one oh and if we
*  could just make sure people are aware of is the Gaza journalist voices yes so the same sort of
*  line is very much getting because as you know foreign journalists aren't getting in and yes
*  no no no the journalists are integrating under such threat to their own lives and their family's lives
*  as and medics uh journalists UN officials alike have been murdered uh killed en masse as well as
*  their families uh yeah we've lost over 100 I think 130 health care workers and and the
*  death student thing you know we're myself one of the other obstetricians were trying to go to Gaza
*  next week and one of our key contacts in Gaza wonderful obstetrician gynaecologist was killed
*  with her with her family in one of the bombs in the first week so every person will have a story
*  like that um unfortunately yeah where do you begin to be honest uh Brenda thank you so much
*  and all my love thank you thank you so no that's yeah goes about saying and do you
*  can speak between take care take care okay brilliant stuff there from Brenda uh and all
*  I guess and um all the way through this will keep promoting the voices of medics and we need to know
*  the reality this obviously the humanity and calamity I'm going to talk about the protests the
*  attack on protests and frankly the attack on voices um standing with Palestine I'm just going to go
*  quickly through super chats because there's been a number of super chats I just want to take one on
*  actually quickly and which I saw and I'm just going to take this on uh so I'm saying that don't
*  morphers don't forget that Israel is a democracy and Jews have voted for this it's not some dictator
*  forcing its people to fight Jews volunteered to join the army and do this violence they can see it
*  they don't care remember I'm going to take this on this is the language of collective guilt the
*  language of collective guilt which has been used obviously again in the onslaught against the
*  Palestinian um people and it has to be fought and there was no peace there was no prospect of any
*  peace with the attitudes as expressed by by morphers and it's important that we say that
*  you know and you know there will only be peace in the middle east with a just settlement which
*  provides security for Palestinians and Jews alike that's the only way out of this now whether you
*  believe in a two-state solution or a one-state solution with a set with where with the equal
*  rights for all however difficult that might seem as a prospect now that is the only solution that
*  is the only way that this will ever be resolved and anything that in any sense echoes anti-semitic
*  tropes which is what this does is riddled with anti-semitic anti-semitism will instantly what it
*  does is makes for example many Jewish people who are angry with Benjamin Netanyahu and angry with
*  what's happening in Gaza it will provoke a defensive reaction because of the context of
*  2000 years of the persecution of the Jewish people um overwhelmingly by Europeans which
*  Palestinians have been made to pay for but it instantly brings up that collective trauma which
*  is rooted in historical reality and people who express these views are not just an affront in
*  terms of worth or expressing anti-semitic views which needs to be fought as an evil in their own
*  right they are the enemy of peace people who speak like this are exactly the sorts of people
*  who Benjamin Netanyahu and the likes want to hear platformed so I just wanted to take that on
*  um David Bratt of the sheer hypocrisy the west here showing that our leaders are no better than
*  Putin is there anything people can do to help push our leaders and asking for a ceasefire I mean
*  that's the thing I mean we are basically now the western media and western and western politicians
*  who will denounce the war crimes of Vladimir Putin correctly as I have done you see the differences
*  between the new between me and them is inconsistent they have they they will say in the
*  most fiery possible terms they'll hang the Ukrainian flags from their windows denounce the war crimes
*  committed by Putin and then say either nothing about the about war crimes being committed en mass
*  you know I mean imagine a a Ukrainian refugee camp was just blown up by Putin with hundreds of
*  deaths on the basis that there was one member of the Azoff Brigade there can you imagine the
*  response and the truth is those western politicians are content to see Ukrainians as human beings which
*  they should and they do not see Palestinians as human beings this dehumanization is racism
*  underpins all of this it's always underpinned colonialism and and we can't divorce it from this
*  um at all um and they don't believe in human rights they don't believe in humanity they would
*  never tolerate this death toll nobody would tolerate the death toll in Gaza if the number
*  of civilians died were those they recognized as being human beings like themselves you would never
*  tolerate that level I mean what what the argument now is what that until they keep saying to the
*  hostages released well I want the hostages released I don't think for one second those 200 hostages
*  are going to come out alive the vast majority of them and with the way with the military onslaught
*  that raises Gaza to the ground I mean Hamas have claimed that several of the hostages have been
*  killed because of airstrikes I'm not going to just regurgitate what Hamas says quite clearly
*  that given the amount of bombs explosives and detonated in Gaza in the last three and a half
*  weeks is one and a half times the amount released by the Hiroshima bomb in an area the size of East
*  London I will only presume that some hostages have been killed that way I mean I think the the odds
*  are overwhelmingly in that favor and I don't believe that Gaza's moaned to the ground and
*  destroyed that those hostages are going to come out alive but what are these people arguing for
*  how if they're saying well until the hostages have released 200 how many Palestinian lives are they
*  prepared to innocent lives are they prepared to kill for that we've well 10 000 nearly 10 000
*  they're fine with that 20 000 50 000 100 000 I ask because I want to know what the ratio is so I can
*  work out exactly what worth they attach to a Palestinian life and but we need to keep marching
*  and protesting I'm going to come on to that and David Bratt also says would it be feasible for
*  UN controlled buffets I said this is Cyprus and Israel Palestine at some point well I don't think
*  isn't it I mean because the truth is what's happened in the last few weeks makes
*  makes any lasting peace so much harder the bitterness the anger which exists is so hard
*  and at the moment the focus has to be on ending the killing you know for those who believe in
*  a one-state solution with the equal rights for all that's just so difficult now to envisage and
*  you know there isn't in any case the majority for either amongst the Palestinian people or
*  the Israeli people and the best we can hope for is a two-state solution in which both are protected
*  and how that happens obviously we have to discuss and at towns can well there seems to be no defined
*  end points of the campaign it seems this fight for last month with continued suffering I mean
*  that's the thing look guys Jesus three and a half weeks and approaching 10 000 dead people
*  um without even the you know with only the ground invasion beginning and you know the
*  worry has to be what happens if this spirals Hezbollah is involved a regional war I mean what's
*  the death toll going to be in a month two months three months four months I mean already with the
*  collapse of all the things you expect in human civilization in Gaza where people can't escape
*  it's hideous thank you to wildflowers and dead rats again just at hospitals
*  oh sorry I should have asked the doctor that sorry running low resource and it was up to me
*  to try what the risks of cholera albans of the diseases well what are you hearing I mean basically
*  lots of reports of of you know people drinking dirty water and their health impacts of that look
*  people who have got cancer on getting cancer treatment there are 50 000 women who are pregnant
*  in Gaza I mean it's just every single level people with heart conditions
*  I mean you know you could end up with more people dying in various health conditions than dying
*  missiles it's an absolute catastrophe and it has to be fought and just before I end I just want to
*  talk about the protest so in Liverpool Street a protest was organized and Jewish activists were
*  in the absolute forefront of this which is very relevant let me just show you this flash mob in
*  Liverpool Street station it was absolutely huge let's have a look
*  keep going now
*  now there were some interesting responses to that to say the least one for example suggesting that
*  this was intimidating and to Jewish people that this posed a menace to Jewish people there
*  even though you can quite clearly see the Jews against genocide banner
*  but no many activists involved Jewish activists played a leading role
*  and they were in the forefront of organizing that and other protests including the protests
*  against Kirstama just in terms of where we're heading here and Simon Sharma is a very prestigious
*  one of the most famous historians in the country not one of the most famous he tweeted a clarification
*  the chant at Liverpool Street as many have pointed out is indeed not into father but
*  ceasefire now apologies no biggie no biggie there into father ceasefire now what's the
*  difference I mean they sound exactly the same there don't they someone else another public figure
*  definitely not naming them life really is too short claimed it was a call for jihad they thought it was
*  jihad the point I'm making is and it is important to say that Jewish peace activists at the forefront
*  of organizing these protests what is happening in this country is the more the atrocities spiral
*  the more the death toll spirals the worse the humanitarian catastrophe the more those standing
*  in solidarity with the Palestinian people are going to come under attack they know they don't
*  have public opinion on their side as it is even though a lot of public opinion are scared about
*  coming under attack which is why you've got political politicians and the media behaving
*  in the way they are they're trying to stigmatize any solidarity with the Palestinian people because
*  these people are on the side of the rather than caraditches of our time that's the side they're on
*  now they they're going to keep stigmatizing and attacking people who stand in solidarity with
*  people they're going to escalate that campaign we're probably going to end up where they're
*  going to try banning protest there's already calls to ban those protests and it is absolutely
*  unbelievably transparent what is happening and and we need to be very clear about that
*  and because it's going to get worse and worse and worse and worse all the way through it's going to
*  get worse and worse and worse and worse and so stand your ground we are we do need to protest
*  everyone needs to come out on this saturday at 12 p.m on wizard london but protests across the
*  country just look them up easy to find out where processes are taking place or internationally i
*  know lots of people watch or listen from other countries but be aware there's going to be an
*  increased campaign to demonize and vilify those standing with the Palestinian people
*  we need to talk about that because it's it is going to get worse but we know we are on the side
*  of humanity we are a trying to stop the mass slaughter of innocent people and b trying to
*  do with the root causes of this horror show which means we have to put it in its wider context and
*  that is so so important and i just want to say thanks again to our guests so important that we
*  heard from them and those different voices i'll keep platforming those different voices and i
*  really appreciate it and and thank you everyone for listening do make sure you press like and
*  subscribe keep the show on the road and patreon.com for slash i'm joseph for obviously we're putting
*  out a huge amount of contents we're working every day as hard as we can and what reason we have to
*  do that is because we're so too few people within the media who are who are speaking out that's why
*  we're doing so much and i've been good morning britain on thursday um 6 30 a.m i think i'm on
*  sky news as well at 7 p.m on thursday and obviously i'll do my best and but obviously we need to try
*  to get the other voices and but there are too few of us so that's why we are focusing so much
*  on building up alternative platforms which is what this is all about so thank you for keeping
*  the show on the road thanks everyone as i say press like and subscribe and we'll be live again
*  next wednesday we've got loads and loads of interviews videos to come so do stay tuned and
