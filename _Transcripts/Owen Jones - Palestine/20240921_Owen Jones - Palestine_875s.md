# Donald Trump MENACES Jewish Americans
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [September 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI)
*  This is truly disturbing and deeply revealing. Donald Trump has announced that he will blame [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=0.0s)]
*  Jewish people if he loses the US presidential election in November. No, this is not some [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  exaggeration. There is a lot to unpack here, including the conflation of Jewish people on [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  the state of Israel, the history of antisemitic champions of Israel, including Donald Trump, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=16.4s)]
*  the resurgence of antisemitism on the increasingly radicalised right, the dangerous antisemitic tropes [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=21.12s)]
*  on Sho Heir, which are a threat to Jewish safety. Now let's just have a listen to this clip. At the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=27.76s)]
*  start of it, in a speech at the Israeli-American Council, he's specifically addressing American [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=33.04s)]
*  Jewish voters who, according to polling, decisively plan to reject Donald Trump in the coming election. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=38.08s)]
*  Honestly, you ought to have your heads examined. You ought to have your heads examined. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=43.040000000000006s)]
*  And those votes may be necessary for us to win. I say us to win because we're in this together. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  But who are these people? Who are the 60% that would vote? And I really believe that bad things, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=54.88s)]
*  very bad things are going to happen. And I'll put it to you very simply and as gently as I can, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  I wasn't treated properly by the voters who happen to be Jewish. I don't know. Do they know [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=66.64s)]
*  what the hell is happening? If I don't win this election, and the Jewish people would really have [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=73.68s)]
*  a lot to do with that if that happens because at 40%, that means 60% of the people are voting for [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=80.16s)]
*  the enemy. I wasn't treated properly by the voters who happen to be Jewish, he says. I mean, full [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=85.2s)]
*  start when a political leader in a democracy claims victimhood at the hands of the voters, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=90.0s)]
*  claiming to be not properly treated by voters, that's sinister. Obviously, in a democracy, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=94.72s)]
*  leaders exist, at least in theory, to serve voters. But he specifically claims here that [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=98.56s)]
*  Jewish voters didn't treat him properly. He suggests that's because of their ignorance. He says, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=103.84s)]
*  if I don't win this election, and the Jewish people would have a lot to do with that if it [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=109.76s)]
*  happens, if that happens, and then cites polling, which actually got wrong, it's actually worse for [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  him. Polling earlier this month shows that 68% of Jewish voters in America plan to vote for Kamala [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=119.04s)]
*  Harris, just 25% for Donald Trump. Now that actually reflects a voting pattern which has [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=124.56s)]
*  persisted for decades. Today's 7.5 million strong US Jewish population, slightly larger, I would note, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=129.68s)]
*  than the Israeli Jewish population, has long been significantly more progressive than the average [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=136.16s)]
*  American. Looking back at the polling, Jewish Americans have voted for the Democrats over the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=141.68s)]
*  Republicans in every single presidential election for over a century, the exception being in 1920, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=146.16s)]
*  and that's because so many Jewish Americans voted for the socialist candidate Eugene Debs. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=152.24s)]
*  In the 1930s and 40s, between 82 and 90% of Jewish Americans voted for the Democrats, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=157.2s)]
*  Franklin Roosevelt. In 1964, 90% voted for Lyndon Johnson over Barry Goldwater. Now, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=162.8s)]
*  if Trump loses the election, the relatively small Jewish population, given the size of the American [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=169.44s)]
*  population overall, will not be the reason why. For one thing, they tend to be concentrated in [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=174.16000000000003s)]
*  pretty safe blue seats states anyway. Think New York, California, Washington DC. In any case, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  Jewish voters have this long history of rejecting the Republicans anyway. We should note that Donald [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=184.8s)]
*  Trump has a radicalized far-right base behind him there. If he loses, the danger is they will act [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=191.76s)]
*  on what he said and portray Jewish Americans as traitors, or if he wins, despite most Jewish [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=196.56s)]
*  Americans voting against him, the same line of attack could emerge as well. Now, this is a [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=201.67999999999998s)]
*  dangerous anti-Semitic trope, which goes back a very long way, that Jews are politically disloyal, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=206.56s)]
*  or indeed subversive. There's also the notorious stab in the back trope, the Nazis notoriously [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=212.72s)]
*  peddled that Germany lost World War II because of supposedly disloyal Jewish Germans. Now, as Rabbi [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=217.84s)]
*  Rick Jacobs, president of the Union of Reform Judaism, the largest Jewish movement in North [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=225.44s)]
*  America put it, it's time to call it like it is. One cannot be an ally to the Jewish community only [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=230.08s)]
*  when it suits your personal needs. President Trump, your words preemptively blaming Jews for [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=235.2s)]
*  your potential election loss, is a piece with millennia of anti-Semitic lies about Jewish power. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=238.96s)]
*  It puts a target on American Jews and it makes you an ally not to our vulnerable community, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=244.56s)]
*  but to those who wish us harm. Stop. I mean, that's also the point here is drawing on this [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=249.04s)]
*  idea of Jewish people having disproportionate shadowy power with the ability to just call, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=252.96s)]
*  decide an election, for example. Now, this isn't simply a Trumpian stream of consciousness. It is [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=259.52s)]
*  clearly central to what he thinks. And you can tell that because he's not just said it there. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=265.52s)]
*  He said it at a speech at another Jewish audience. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=270.64s)]
*  A lot of people said, no, that won't happen. But a lot of bad things happened and some good things [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=301.12s)]
*  I've been right about too. And I only want to be so I'm not going to call this as a prediction. But [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=305.03999999999996s)]
*  in my opinion, the Jewish people would have a lot to do with a loss. If I'm at 40 percent, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=310.8s)]
*  if I'm at four, think of it. That means 60 percent of voting for Kamala, who in particular is a bad [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=317.76s)]
*  Democrat. The Democrats are bad to Israel. Very bad. They'll never change because they have a [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=323.2s)]
*  section of their party now, which has become amazingly and quickly very powerful vote wise. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=329.12s)]
*  I mean, Chuck Schumer is a Palestinian. Who would have thought that was going to happen? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=333.92s)]
*  What the hell happened to him? I saw him the other day. He was dressed in one of their robes. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=338.8s)]
*  That'll be next. Now you can hear him here outright conflating the Jewish people with Israel. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=346.24s)]
*  There is nothing subtle about that. He's declaring that the one test that should matter [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=350.48s)]
*  when it comes to Jewish Americans is unquestioning support for Israel. Now, on one [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=354.4s)]
*  level, trying to portray the Democrats as hostile to Israel is insulting given the Democratic [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=358.88s)]
*  administration of both Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have facilitated Israel's genocide [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=364.64s)]
*  from day one. They've armed Israel to the teeth, giving it the weapons it needs to slaughter tens [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=369.35999999999996s)]
*  of thousands of people and maim and traumatize and starve far more. But note how he uses [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=373.91999999999996s)]
*  Palestinian as an insult. Just no pretence there. Anti-Palestinian racism. He's repeatedly attacked [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=379.12s)]
*  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the first Jewish Senate Majority Leader, on the grounds he [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=383.92s)]
*  has quote unquote become like a Palestinian. He's also called him a proud member of Hamas, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=388.96000000000004s)]
*  partly because Schumer warned Israel risked becoming a pariah earlier this year. He was [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=393.44s)]
*  doing so while positioning himself as Israel's friend. He said, we love Israel in our bones. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=397.44s)]
*  Now, just so you don't think this is coming out of nowhere, this was Trump at the beginning of August. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=401.84000000000003s)]
*  Trump's speech. A consistent theme then. This conflation here of US, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=407.12s)]
*  Jews and Israel is offensive and it is wrong. Now, a really interesting poll in May by the [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=421.28000000000003s)]
*  right-wing Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs found that most Jewish Americans supported [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=428.24s)]
*  withholding some arm shipments at least to Israel. It found nearly 30% of Jewish Americans [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=434.4s)]
*  thought Israel was committing genocide in Gaza. Half disagreed. That half disagreeing is not what [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=440.71999999999997s)]
*  I'd call overwhelming. It's a lot less than it would have been a while ago. A lot less. I mean, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=446.0s)]
*  18.6% said they neither agree or disagree. So clearly they're at least open to persuasion. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=451.59999999999997s)]
*  Those are another group of Jewish Americans who didn't go when asked, do you think genocide's [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=455.59999999999997s)]
*  happening? They didn't go. Absolutely not. They were like, you know, they couldn't say. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=459.68s)]
*  So, you know, if you look at it by generation, there was also even more stark. 38% of Jewish [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=464.8s)]
*  Americans under 44 thought Israel was committing genocide compared to 22% over 44. Now, I know the [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=470.64s)]
*  polling shows that white evangelical Americans are far more supportive of the Israeli state and [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=477.6s)]
*  hostile to the Palestinian people than Jewish Americans are. What's really important here is [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=481.68s)]
*  what we would call direction of travel. There's no question that traditionally since World War II, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=488.56s)]
*  that is, a large majority of Jewish Americans did look upon Israel very favorably as a kind of [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=492.88s)]
*  refuge. A view I would note is not actually unique to Jewish Americans. It was shared by a large [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=496.88s)]
*  majority of other Americans. The point is that is shifting dramatically and it's shifting quite a [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=502.16s)]
*  short period of time. Many of the demonstrations of the US against Israel's genocide have been [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=508.0s)]
*  organized by younger Jewish Americans. We're talking here often in their 20s or even teens [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=512.24s)]
*  who based on the trend reflected in the polling, we would expect to have the most pro-Palestinian [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=516.88s)]
*  sympathies yet. I'm thinking of, for example, if not now, a US Jewish group set up in opposition [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=521.3599999999999s)]
*  to Israel's occupation a decade ago. I've interviewed the brilliant co-founder of that, Simone Zimmerman. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=527.1999999999999s)]
*  Do check out that interview. There's also a Jewish Voice for Peace, an anti-Zionist Jewish movement, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=532.7199999999999s)]
*  which was founded nearly three decades ago, which has significantly grown since this genocide began. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=538.0s)]
*  There have been hideous attempts to smear these deeply courageous and principled Jewish Americans [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=542.24s)]
*  and that has deterred, undoubtedly, some of them speaking out, but more and more are speaking out. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=546.24s)]
*  So Trump positions himself as someone who feels entitled to the Jewish vote purely because of [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=550.8s)]
*  his pro-Israel positioning, including his history, for example, the so-called Trump Peace Plan, which [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=555.04s)]
*  was in practice the annexation of Palestinian areas, the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=560.32s)]
*  capital, including its illegally occupied East. But that positioning is going to alienate huge [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=566.32s)]
*  numbers and growing numbers of Jewish Americans, particularly younger Jewish Americans. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=573.68s)]
*  Now, there is a very long tradition of what we could call or should call anti-Semites for Israel. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=577.5999999999999s)]
*  The US Democratic President, Harry Truman, was the first world leader to officially [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=582.8s)]
*  recognize Israel on the 14th of May 1948. He repeatedly used in private an anti-Semitic [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=587.4399999999999s)]
*  slur, which is way too offensive for me to say. It begins with K, almost certainly the most [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=593.68s)]
*  violent anti-Semitic word you can use. He would dismiss Miami in a letter to his wife as nothing [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=598.3199999999999s)]
*  but hotels, filling stations, Hebrews and cabins. He described Jewish people as very, very selfish [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=603.6s)]
*  and said neither Hitler nor Stalin has anything on them for cruelty or mistreatment to the underdog. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=609.0400000000001s)]
*  Blimey. What about Richard Nixon, the Republican president from 1968 to, what was it, 1974? He [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=613.9200000000001s)]
*  backed Israel to the hill, or 1973, sorry, Watergate. Anyway, what was it, 1974? I'm looking up. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=621.76s)]
*  He backed Israel to the hill and saw it as a key strategic asset for US power in the Middle East. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=627.44s)]
*  This guy was anti-Semitic to the very core. There was something called the Nixon Jew count, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=632.48s)]
*  where Nixon was convinced Jewish members of the Bureau of Labor Statistics were seeking to [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=636.72s)]
*  undermine him. So he got his advisers to drop a list of employees with Jewish sounding names to [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=640.48s)]
*  demote and get rid of. 13 employees considered Jewish were removed. Tapes were also released [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=646.32s)]
*  of Richard Nixon ranting about Jews being behind the communist conspiracy against the US, this being [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=651.2800000000001s)]
*  just a revisit of the classic trait of the Nazis for a start, by the way. He denounced [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=657.0400000000001s)]
*  Wallen journalists as that damn Jew. He used, again, anti-Jewish slurs. He claimed Jews control [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=661.28s)]
*  the media. He said anti-Semitism in the US would grow if, and I quote, these people don't start [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=665.92s)]
*  behaving, adding it may be that they have a death wish. You know, that's been a problem with our [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=670.72s)]
*  Jewish friends for centuries. Now, yes, famously his Secretary of State was Jewish, Henry Kissinger, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=674.8s)]
*  but this notorious walker mill, I might add, appeased Nixon's anti-Semitism, saying Judaism [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=679.92s)]
*  has no significance for me. On one occasion, when Nixon was railing against those he called [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=685.68s)]
*  Jewish traitors, Kissinger replied, well, Mr. President, there are Jews and Jews. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=690.0s)]
*  Now, there are many other examples today. For example, the Hungarian semi-dictatorship of Victor [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=695.76s)]
*  Orbán, perhaps Israel's staunchest European ally, is also the most overtly anti-Semitic regime in [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=701.68s)]
*  Europe, waging a ceaseless war against the Hungarian-born Jewish businessman, George Soros, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=706.56s)]
*  portraying him as the puppet master of the opposition, the classic anti-Semitic puppet master [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=710.96s)]
*  trope, of course. There is also the staunchly pro-Israel owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, who has [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=715.52s)]
*  not only allowed Nazis and anti-Semites to proliferate on Twitter, but who has endorsed [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=720.8s)]
*  anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, for example, endorsing the idea that Jewish people are pushing [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=724.88s)]
*  hatred of white people. And Donald Trump has a long history himself, partly, by the way, I would [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=729.28s)]
*  note, associating with white supremacists and far-right extremists, but including saying that he [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=734.48s)]
*  wouldn't be surprised if Soros was funding immigrant caravans in the US, baseless, but leaning [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=739.12s)]
*  into far-right tropes, lies about Jewish people, promoting immigration to replace white people in [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=743.6s)]
*  the West. This is the so-called great replacement theory. He's also previously denounced Jewish [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=750.24s)]
*  people with disloyalty to Israel if they don't vote for him. The fact is the US state sees Israel [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=755.28s)]
*  as a means to protect its own strategic interest in the Middle East above anything else. It's got [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=759.9200000000001s)]
*  nothing, really, compared to that, to do with the US establishment believing this is about the [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=764.32s)]
*  protection of Jewish people. That's not some left-wing conspiracy theory. Listen here to what [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=768.4s)]
*  US Senator Joe Biden, at the time, had to say in 1986. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=773.44s)]
*  You see, the truth is that Jewish people in the US and elsewhere, in Europe, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=803.44s)]
*  for example, have always been disproportionately involved in progressive movements, in movements [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=814.8800000000001s)]
*  for justice, for emancipation, and indeed haters of Jewish people have long noted that, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=819.2s)]
*  with much anger and fury and focussed on it. The far-right, which is along the rise [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=823.84s)]
*  everywhere, knows this and hates this. Anti-Semitism is growing in their ranks, a belief [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=828.32s)]
*  that Jewish people are disloyal to the nation, are politically untrustworthy, are even [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=832.56s)]
*  an enemy within. And yet, the focus has been on the left because of our objection to Israel's [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=837.68s)]
*  genocide. By smearing the left, falsely claiming that our opposition to genocide is because of [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=842.3199999999999s)]
*  hatred of Jewish people, in an effort to protect the interests of Israel, that whole smear campaign, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=846.88s)]
*  attention has been deflected from the real danger to Jewish people, which is, of course, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=851.76s)]
*  principally the far-right. But what Donald Trump has said here is instructive. He's yet another [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=856.2399999999999s)]
*  anti-Semite who sees Israel as a means to an end, and it's people like him who pose the real threat [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9aqxAcPRYI&t=860.4s)]
