# Israel's Syria Invasion Exposes Impunity And Hypocrisy - w/ Palestinian-American Analyst Omar Baddar
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [December 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs)
*  Omar Badr has been one of the most important voices we have since the genocide began. He is, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=0.0s)]
*  of course, a Palestinian-American analyst. I don't really need to keep banging on about [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  how great he is because his work speaks for himself. And if you haven't heard of him so far, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=10.56s)]
*  then sort it out, fix it. I just want to go straight into it. Let's just go straight in. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=14.0s)]
*  We were just talking actually just before I pressed record, 14 months of this genocidal mayhem, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=20.0s)]
*  some of the worst imaginable atrocities committed every single day, some of them live streamed. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=26.72s)]
*  Is this a sense of this terror of normalization? Because I always try to say to the audience, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=34.8s)]
*  never, ever let this be normal, never, ever stop being shocked. But would you have imagined 14 [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=42.72s)]
*  months on this horror would still be going on? And what does that tell us? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=49.36s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, and really not in my wildest dreams that I ever imagined that this would drag on [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=53.68s)]
*  for as long as it did. There's a way in which when genocide is unfolding, you have to put your life [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=58.08s)]
*  on hold and say, this is an emergency. This is the primary thing we're dealing with right now. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=64.48s)]
*  And more than a year into it with still no end in sight and things being absolutely horrific day [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  in and day out, just for basic self-preservation, you can't help but find some way to know what's [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=76.47999999999999s)]
*  going on. And you can't find some way to normalize the absolutely abnormal. On a moral level, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=82.8s)]
*  you should never normalize what is unfolding. But in order to be able to go on with your daily life, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=88.08s)]
*  to maintain a job and a family and just function, you have to in some ways allow this to drift a [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=92.32s)]
*  little bit back to the, you know, into the background in a sense. Never obviously giving up [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=98.64s)]
*  the fact that we do have to fight this day in and day out in ways that we can. But also, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=104.96s)]
*  I'm realizing that I can't be constantly in emergency mode, you know, burning into my sleep [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  and just thinking about this all the time is absolutely exhausting. And you can't help but [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=113.67999999999999s)]
*  also feel some level of survivor's guilt. In order for me to preserve my basic life, I feel like I [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=119.92s)]
*  need to take a step back. But the people who are living through it don't have that luxury at all. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=129.44s)]
*  This is their daily reality as horrific as imaginably possible. And to think, you know, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=133.76s)]
*  today, just the day that we were talking, there is this news of 66 people being killed in Gaza. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=139.44s)]
*  And to imagine what it's like to be one of those people who has had to endure all of this, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=144.39999999999998s)]
*  the starvation, the mass killing, the just living in hell, living, watching the apocalypse unfold [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=150.56s)]
*  before you. And then you don't get to survive at the end of it. You get to live through this hell [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=157.12s)]
*  for well over a year, and then you might still get killed at the end of it or watch your immediate [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=161.84s)]
*  family members get killed. It's unconscionable. And it's no longer, you know, there was a time [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=166.32s)]
*  in which there could be a debate, from my perspective, not among informed observers, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=173.52s)]
*  about what Israel's intent is. To me, it was quite obvious that going after the civilian [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=178.8s)]
*  population in Gaza was the intent. But there was room for argument among people who are less [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=183.04s)]
*  informed. But at this point, you've got the leading biggest human rights organization in the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=187.52s)]
*  world coming out with a report outlining and detailing how this is actually genocide. There [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=192.88000000000002s)]
*  really is no more room for debate. And it's hard to state, you know, you can't overstate [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=198.32000000000002s)]
*  the moral failure of our world order, our leading governments, and allowing this genocide to unfold [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  for as long as it has, and still not being able to step in and say enough is enough. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=212.64s)]
*  And the last video uploaded is an interview with Amnesty International about their crucial report [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=219.11999999999998s)]
*  on the genocide, which you referred to there, which takes apart the dire bad faith criticisms. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=223.76s)]
*  And you said, no, there's no place to hide the evidence being as overwhelming as it is. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  A question I want to fire at you. I put this actually to the Israeli journalist Gideon Levy, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=235.67999999999998s)]
*  which is earlier this week. The Israelis today might say, you know, they'll go, well, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=239.2s)]
*  you know, you could denounce us for what we've done. We are winning. Full of triumphalism. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=246.0s)]
*  Look at the strategic picture. Yes, we've raised Gaza to the ground and wiped it up, you know, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=252.32s)]
*  so many innocent people off the face of the earth. I mean, to be honest, it sounds absurd that I'm [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=257.52s)]
*  quoting, paraphrasing Israeli officials like that, but actually some of them do speak like that [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=262.48s)]
*  anyway. But I mean, what would you say to that in terms of, is that hubris in terms of what [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=265.52s)]
*  the strategic map, I guess, of the Middle East at the moment, what do you think about that in [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=272.08s)]
*  terms of that triumphalist narrative which is in play? Yeah, hubris is I think the perfect word [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=276.64s)]
*  to really describe it. Now, I also want to have some humility in saying that there is an instinctive [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=282.88s)]
*  part of human nature that says the bad guys never win at the end, that if you carry on like this, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=288.4s)]
*  your end has to, you know, the end of your behavior, things are not going to end well [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=292.4s)]
*  for you if this is how you conduct yourself. But to be frank, when you think of the story of [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=297.91999999999996s)]
*  Native Americans and what white settlers have been able to accomplish, and at this point, yes, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=303.35999999999996s)]
*  we look back and the entire world agrees that what white settlers did to Native Americans in [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=309.2s)]
*  the United States is an atrocity. There's an understanding that that kind of genocide, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=314.79999999999995s)]
*  we say if you could take time back, you would never do the same thing again. But it's all too [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=320.0s)]
*  late to do anything about. And I'm mindful of that is that even though I have absolute, complete, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=325.52000000000004s)]
*  and total confidence in the fact that history will not judge Israel kindly for the way that [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=332.0s)]
*  they have conducted themselves, I don't have the same confidence that there's going to be meaningful [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=336.56s)]
*  real consequences on the ground. And that's what worries me in some way, is that in the absence, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=342.16s)]
*  you know, their reputation in the world is utterly destroyed. They'll never come back from that. This [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=348.56s)]
*  entire notion of Israel as a beacon of democracy and freedom and human rights in the Middle East [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=355.12s)]
*  and all this utter garbage and nonsense, I think that's dead. So nobody's going to buy this [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=360.56s)]
*  narrative anymore. But if you're going to live by brute force, and you're going to have European [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=364.64000000000004s)]
*  and the American government come back and aid you in every way possible in order for you to fulfill [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=371.44s)]
*  what is obviously under way right now, the complete liquidation of the Palestinian struggle for [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=377.6s)]
*  freedom and justice, the elimination of the Palestinian national struggle, that is what is [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=381.36s)]
*  unfolding right now. It is premature to say how this is going to turn out. And I think it is, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=385.44s)]
*  speaking of unbelievable arrogance for Israel to act as if this is a done deal and everything is [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=391.84000000000003s)]
*  fine from this point forward. But it's also not completely out of the realm of possibility [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=396.0s)]
*  that they do win the strategic fight at the end of the day, and that later on, they can make reforms, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=401.04s)]
*  they can get rid of the leaders who are responsible for this genocide and say we have changed. But by [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=406.8s)]
*  then, Palestine is no more. That's a possibility. And I think that there is an urgency from my [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=411.2s)]
*  perspective. Whenever we talk about justice being inevitable, yes, it's true. The arc of history [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=417.44s)]
*  always bends towards justice. But if Palestine is no more, if you victimize hundreds of thousands [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=424.56s)]
*  of Palestinians, if not millions of Palestinians by the end of this, I think that's not an option. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=430.32s)]
*  We have an absolute immediate need to act in every way that we possibly can to put an end to [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=435.04s)]
*  the slaughter before it's too late and to save what is left to be saved. Gaza will never be the [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=440.0s)]
*  same again. It's just impossible for it to come back from that level of devastation. Still, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=444.88s)]
*  every day, every week, every month longer that we allow this genocide to go on, we are talking about [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=450.40000000000003s)]
*  countless families that are being obliterated, entire bloodlines, people's children. You are [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=456.0s)]
*  fundamentally losing out on a segment of the population that would otherwise exist if we were [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=461.6s)]
*  able to put a stop to it. So the strategic map is looking pretty dire at this point with what [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=470.24s)]
*  happened in Lebanon, with what happened in Syria. And if we can dive into those bits, actually, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=476.64000000000004s)]
*  I'm happy to talk about those real quick. After you, go ahead. I'll let you frame it. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=482.72s)]
*  Well, just on Syria, because Israel has invaded Syria and bombed Syria repeatedly and destroyed [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=490.0s)]
*  its military capabilities. But interestingly, the new Syrian government has filed its first [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=497.28s)]
*  report to the UN Security Council. And it's a denunciation of the Israeli invasion of Syria. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=503.04s)]
*  It says the Syrian Arab Republic condemns in the strongest terms this Israeli aggression, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=513.68s)]
*  which represents a serious violation of the 1974 Disengagement Agreement. That's the ceasefire [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=518.48s)]
*  agreement negotiated between the Assad regime and Israel in 1974, which Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=522.96s)]
*  who you know, actually said no longer applied, which is a legal nonsense, obviously, because the [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=527.52s)]
*  Syrian state still exists. It's just a different government. And it says it constitutes a violation [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=531.44s)]
*  of sovereignty of the Syrian Arab Republic and the unity and strength of its territories, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=537.04s)]
*  and inconsistent with the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=540.32s)]
*  the provisions of international law and UN Security Council resolutions that they cite [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=544.72s)]
*  as well. What do you think about that? I mean, that's interesting, because actually some were [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=550.08s)]
*  disturbed, I think, by the lack of response by the Syrian government. Notwithstanding, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=555.0400000000001s)]
*  it just emerged. We don't know its character really at the moment, properly. What do you think in [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=558.8000000000001s)]
*  terms of what's happening in Syria? What it represents, the invasion and just, you know, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=563.2s)]
*  the fact the Syrian government have now come out against it? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=567.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, look, I mean, just in terms of what Israel is doing in Syria, and what has done for the past [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=570.7199999999999s)]
*  several days, it's just unbelievable that, again, just the fact that we're giving Israel a pass, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=575.92s)]
*  constantly Israel is treated like a country that is above the law and above the rules, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=582.4799999999999s)]
*  and they get to do whatever they want. Even before the past few days, Israel is illegally [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=585.92s)]
*  occupying a huge part of Syria, the Golan Heights. And the claim was we can't give up the Golan [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=591.04s)]
*  Heights, even though they're Syrian, because we need that as a buffer zone to prevent any possible [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=596.48s)]
*  Syrian attack, and we need that kind of land as a buffer zone, effectively. And what Israel has [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=600.88s)]
*  done since is taken more land inside Syria, and they're claiming that as a buffer zone to protect [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=606.72s)]
*  already the land that they claim is a buffer zone. It's just transparently an attempt at expansion [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=613.2s)]
*  and kind of stacking the deck against the incoming Syrian government whenever it forms, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=619.36s)]
*  that if you want any part of this land back, you're going to have to negotiate a deal with us. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=624.0s)]
*  And the deal entails allowing Israel to hold on to the Golan Heights and making sure that Syria [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=627.92s)]
*  abandons the Palestinian cause and no longer is a supporter of Palestine in any serious and meaningful [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=632.96s)]
*  sense. What they want of Syria is to become like many other Arab governments in the region that are [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=638.08s)]
*  effectively within the US orbit, which is to say you're allowed to say whatever you want about [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=644.0s)]
*  solidarity with Palestinians as long as you don't meaningfully do anything. And a lot of these [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=649.92s)]
*  governments maintain trade relations with Israel. Everything is normal with Israel. They maintain [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=654.16s)]
*  Israeli embassies. They express outrage about what Israel is doing in Gaza, but it's obviously not [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=658.8s)]
*  serious outrage, because if it were, you would not maintain these kinds of diplomatic relations and [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=664.4s)]
*  trade relations with Israel. You would put your money where your mouth is, and you would say no [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=668.64s)]
*  more relations with this country until this genocide ends, but that's not what they do. It is [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=672.16s)]
*  all a performance for their populations. And I think what Israel hopes to get out of Syria is a [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=676.0s)]
*  very similar arrangement where it's fine to express solidarity with Palestinians for public [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=682.24s)]
*  consumption, but when push comes to shove, you're not going to lift a finger to do anything to [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=687.12s)]
*  support Palestinians. And more importantly, you're going to have to recognize that the Golan Heights [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=691.36s)]
*  is now a part of Israel. Just allow Israel to annex Syrian territory and be okay with it. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=695.44s)]
*  And that's the mass devastation that we're seeing. And when you listen to Western officials talk about [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=700.16s)]
*  how Israel has legitimate security concerns, and that's why they're doing what they're doing, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=705.28s)]
*  just imagine the opposite scenario. Everybody knows that Israel is constantly threatening to [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=709.2s)]
*  strike Iran and Iran's nuclear facilities. So Iran has a legitimate security concern when it comes to [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=713.9200000000001s)]
*  Israel. But if Iran started unloading on the Israeli Navy, devastating it and bombing several [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=719.84s)]
*  hundred points throughout Israel, including major cities, nobody would defend that as an [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=725.28s)]
*  active self-defense. So they have legitimate security concerns. Everybody would understand [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=731.36s)]
*  that as an act of aggression. But somehow when Israel does it, it is always okay. And that's just [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=735.12s)]
*  again, an infuriating reality. And the way that we engage with this, people are noticing people in [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=740.32s)]
*  the region see the double standard. It doesn't sit well with them. And sooner or later, they're going [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=746.24s)]
*  to rebel against it. When you look at Syria itself, and I think it's worth separating those things, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=750.96s)]
*  for many years, by the way, leading up to this, you've had many fights over Syria between people [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=757.9200000000001s)]
*  who say the Al-Assad government is a brutal repressive regime and Syria's deserve to be free [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=762.48s)]
*  from it. And then on the other side, you would say there is this Western conspiracy that includes [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=768.88s)]
*  Israel and many other states and some Arab states conspiring to overthrow the Syrian regime as a way [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=774.8000000000001s)]
*  to defeat regional resistance against Israel. And what's been ironic about this fight is that [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=782.72s)]
*  neither side is wrong. They're just choosing to focus on one particular piece of the picture [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=788.08s)]
*  and using it to argue. But the reality is Syrians deserve to be free from this repressive regime. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=792.4s)]
*  And at the same time, you can't deny the fact that what is unfolding in Syria, the reason why [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=797.9200000000001s)]
*  it was facilitated by neighboring countries that have tight relations with Israel, there's even some [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=802.64s)]
*  reporting about how the rebel offensive was armed by Turkey, but facilitated in coordination [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=807.04s)]
*  with the Biden administration as well. You can't ignore the fact that these are not people who are [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=812.8s)]
*  concerned about human rights in Syria. When you look at the way they behave throughout the entire [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=818.0s)]
*  region, when you look at Turkish policy towards the Kurds, when you look at American policy [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=821.8399999999999s)]
*  towards Palestinians, there isn't a real concern about people's freedom and democracy and human [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=825.4399999999999s)]
*  rights. Obviously something else is at play, but I also don't want the geopolitics of it to get in [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=829.4399999999999s)]
*  the way of recognizing basic Syrian humanity and the fact that there is a genuine feeling of joy [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=834.96s)]
*  right now in Syria over the overthrow of that government. But the challenge is what comes next. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=839.76s)]
*  And the challenge for Syria right now is that between the religious fanatics and fundamentalists [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=845.84s)]
*  who are part of the opposition and the kind of climate they might create within Syria of religious [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=852.48s)]
*  fundamentalist rule, of attacks on minorities, that is one threat. And then the other threat [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=857.2800000000001s)]
*  is the threat of regional bullying in which other countries in the region try to basically [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=863.5200000000001s)]
*  determine what Syria's strategic position is going to be effectively in service of Israel's [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=868.6400000000001s)]
*  position of dominance in the region. And if the Syrian people can overcome both of these [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=874.72s)]
*  threats, I think Syria will be an incredible example of prosperity and an example of how you [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=880.32s)]
*  actually fight for your rights and win. And I think it'll be an inspiring example for the entire [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=887.0400000000001s)]
*  region. But I'm deeply worried about Syria's ability to overcome both of these threats, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=890.64s)]
*  given the extent of the effort that is being poured in by regional countries in order to [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=895.6s)]
*  facilitate an agenda that is not really the Syrian people's. I mean, just in the spirit of how we [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=900.4s)]
*  started and never ever normalizing what we see before us. I mean, we've seen Israel just lay [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=905.4399999999999s)]
*  waste to so much of Lebanon. We've seen obviously Gaza, we've seen the pogrom in the West Bank, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=911.76s)]
*  and we've seen intents of attacks beyond that. Far beyond that. The idea you can just say a [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=917.76s)]
*  military of a new government which hasn't even established itself yet could be a potential threat. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=928.9599999999999s)]
*  So we're going to invade and we're just going to wipe it out. The fact that isn't betrayed all over [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=933.6s)]
*  the media is, you barely even saw Israeli invasion of Syria. The coverage didn't even [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=939.52s)]
*  use invasion. They just sent their tanks a few miles away from Damascus, the capital. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=946.88s)]
*  I mean, you just have to, what does that tell us? Just the sheer level of impunity both [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=952.72s)]
*  in terms of the international order and within our media. Yeah. And it's really, it's that [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=956.32s)]
*  disgusting internalization of the Israeli narrative. Our media covers this from the [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=961.2s)]
*  perspective of Israel. Israel is the protagonist. And if you enter that story with that emotional [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=965.76s)]
*  presupposition that you're just going into it, feeling like Israel is the protagonist, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=970.96s)]
*  and then writing the story, everything that follows follows naturally. That's really the [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=974.56s)]
*  fundamental problem. It's the underlying orientation with which we cover the Middle East. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=979.4399999999999s)]
*  We view Arabs and Muslims and other people throughout the region as other, and we always [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=984.2399999999999s)]
*  look at it the perspective of Israel as an extension of the West somehow. And we're looking [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=989.4399999999999s)]
*  through the prism of the way that Israel looks at the region. What threats are there and what's not [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=993.4399999999999s)]
*  there. And we understand it when we extend it to our own countries, right? When US media [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=998.0s)]
*  acts like the US is above the law. And we say Iran can't have nuclear weapons, but the US gets [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1004.08s)]
*  to have nuclear weapons. Nobody examines that bias. It's kind of understandable when you have [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1010.8000000000001s)]
*  these kinds of biases. But when you extend that bias to a foreign country, to me, that's even [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1016.0s)]
*  more incomprehensible. It's one thing to try to challenge people on the biases that they have [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1021.84s)]
*  towards themselves. It's another to ask why on earth does this one foreign country that is an [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1026.56s)]
*  apartheid regime that is in the midst of committing genocide, why do you extend to them [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1032.48s)]
*  that automatic feeling of us and viewing everything they do as inherently defensive? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1036.88s)]
*  There really is no coherent explanation for this. And I wish more people would actually examine it [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1040.88s)]
*  because it is absolutely distorting to the way the coverage is made and by extension to the way our [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1045.76s)]
*  politicians engage with the story. And it influences the way audiences emotionally feel about this. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1050.8000000000002s)]
*  Even though a lot of people think that Israel has gone overboard and too far, the more fundamental [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1056.56s)]
*  framing of Israel as an aggressor and an occupier, that is a lot less understood. I think people [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1062.6399999999999s)]
*  oppose the genocide in the West largely because of how grotesque the conduct is, that it's beyond [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1068.56s)]
*  anything that anybody has imagined. And it's impossible to deny how monstrous it is. But the [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1074.7199999999998s)]
*  more underlying narrative of understanding that Israel is doing this intentionally and that it is [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1079.84s)]
*  doing it in a project of expansion at the expense of other people on their rights, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1084.56s)]
*  that is less understood. And I think if that's better understood, you can start seeing a more [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1089.12s)]
*  significant shift in the way people behave about this politically and in a way that could actually [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1093.44s)]
*  influence policy in a more meaningful way too. Just finally, I want to just circle back to where [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1097.84s)]
*  we started really, and it just develops from what you just talked about there. And the theme, I [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1102.48s)]
*  suppose, what we've talked about in terms of normalization, because for the last 14 months, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1108.32s)]
*  I've always tried to just put aside what I know about the dynamics, the history, all that kind [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1114.08s)]
*  of stuff, and just constantly say, I cannot believe this is actually happening. And I've always got to [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1118.8s)]
*  remember as well the lane I'm in. I'm a white guy. I'm not Palestinian. I'm from Stockport in Northern [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1126.24s)]
*  England. But it is happening, and it has happened, and it has been allowed to happen for 14 months. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1130.8s)]
*  And no genocide has been so documented and confessed as it was happening in the history [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1137.5200000000002s)]
*  of our species. And it's been facilitated by the dominant powers on Earth, the dominant power, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1143.92s)]
*  sorry, on Earth and its allies, and normalized. And I just think to myself, there's no going back [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1151.0400000000002s)]
*  from that. There has to be. That is like a nuclear bomb going off in the fabric of the world somehow. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1157.3600000000001s)]
*  I don't know. There's probably a better way of framing that. I don't know. I keep coming up with [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1165.76s)]
*  these things, which I just come up with in my head and then just throw at people just without any [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1171.68s)]
*  buildup. So I apologize for that. Do you know what I mean, though? What do you not think? I just don't [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1176.32s)]
*  think there's any way back from that. And the consequences of that, I think, are so unpredictable, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1180.24s)]
*  actually. You just can't unleash that level of violence, of such an obscene kind of violence, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1185.36s)]
*  in terms of who is murdered and slaughtered and the way that happens, and there not be catastrophic [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1192.24s)]
*  consequences. What do you think in terms of where this leads all of us, the world, humanity? I don't [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1198.72s)]
*  know. Yeah, absolutely. No, I think you are absolutely spot on in the sense that we've [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1203.68s)]
*  pretended as a species to have gone beyond a certain point. The entire reason we created [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1210.72s)]
*  the international law order, the UN and all of that, it's on the back of World War II. It is [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1216.16s)]
*  saying that there is a certain kind of atrocities that is no longer allowed, and if they were to [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1220.8s)]
*  happen, there would have to be immediate accountability for them, a way to prevent the world from coming to [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1224.56s)]
*  the brink the way we have before. And here we are with an entire population being destroyed before [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1228.96s)]
*  our eyes, and it is live streamed for the entire world to see. And there isn't that international [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1234.48s)]
*  action to actually put an end to it, that there is this level of apathy that we're seeing from the [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1240.48s)]
*  world's most powerful countries and governments, ranging from either excusing it to being satisfied [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1245.52s)]
*  merely condemning it and moving on as if nothing really meriting involvement is occurring before us. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1252.08s)]
*  That shatters our entire sense of collective world community. When we talk about the [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1258.8799999999999s)]
*  entire world as all of this rhetoric about us being one people and about belonging to this planet and [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1267.44s)]
*  surviving beyond borders and so on, it is just clearly that it was a pretense. It's something [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1273.76s)]
*  that we're willing to go along with as make nice rhetoric when things are going well, but then when [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1280.8s)]
*  something horrific happens and a powerful country is behind it and a more powerful country is backing [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1285.52s)]
*  it, everybody's happy to just look away and not get involved. That I think shakes certainly my [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1290.32s)]
*  conception of where we are as a species. I believed foolishly at some point that we were past this [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyWktTm0fs&t=1296.56s)]
