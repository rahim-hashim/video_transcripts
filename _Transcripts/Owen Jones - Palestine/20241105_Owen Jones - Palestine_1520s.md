# US Votes As Gaza And Fascism Loom Large - Owen Jones In Pennsylvania
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [November 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGJl6nVyG2I)
*  It's Judgement Day guys, the world's last remaining superpower is about to elect its next president
*  which has dramatic consequences of course for all of us.
*  This is Pennsylvania, it is a working class heartland and it is notable that both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump
*  are campaigning across this state on the last day of the election.
*  That's because this state will help determine, very likely, who ends up in the White House.
*  Couple of things I want to explore here, I want to explore how the flatlining of wages for so many American workers,
*  for most American workers in real terms, since the 1970s, how that's driven a lot of the anger and division
*  which has manifested itself in various different ways.
*  And I want to find out about if Kamala Harris ends up president, will her supporters,
*  who've lined up in some cases to stop Donald Trump becoming president,
*  are they going to hold her to account and take on the divisions which define this country?
*  We've got a lot to go and investigate, we're going to Trump and Harris rallies.
*  I just want to ask, why do you think Trump is doing so well here?
*  Because I mean, he's 50-50, who knows how Pennsylvania is going to go, he's got a big base, what's that about?
*  I don't know, I think it's probably because people are a lot more grounded here.
*  So since I moved here, it's definitely a lot more poverty, unfortunately.
*  Do you think that has to do with a lot of the decline of steel in industries, that used to be the beating heart?
*  It's not like that anymore, so their backbone, once it left, they had to adjust to it.
*  Now one of the things I'm really interested in is the phenomenon of working-class support for Donald Trump.
*  It exists, I might not like it, I might find it uncomfortable,
*  but some working-class Americans believe that their class interests are best served
*  by voting for a very right-wing, very rich mogul.
*  Donald Trump, why? What's going on?
*  So, this is the perfect place to do it, Pennsylvania, formerly industrial state, I mean, steel city,
*  I was born in the British steel city, Sheffield, so I think I kind of get the gist of what that's like.
*  It's fallen on harder times, often, for many people, because of that decline,
*  so I'm going to talk to them about what that means and why they're backing Trump as a result.
*  They tried to kill him because he was against their revolution.
*  I was a coal miner.
*  Are people in Pennsylvania proud, proud of that mining past, you know, being an industrial state?
*  Yes, they were.
*  Well, they still are, but it's gone now.
*  Are you sad about that?
*  They closed them all down.
*  How do you feel about that?
*  I think it's a shame, it's a pity.
*  Were you proud to be a miner?
*  Yeah, I was proud to be a coal miner.
*  I've been a foreman for over 20 years.
*  I retired about 15 years ago, and I started when I was 18.
*  That's all I ever did.
*  Just lastly, do you think Trump, you know, because Trump's a very rich man, let's be honest,
*  he's a rich guy, do you really think he's the people around him and him stand,
*  do you really think it's working people that they really care about?
*  I think he cares about people like me, yes.
*  Yes, I do.
*  Why Trump for you?
*  Why Trump for me?
*  Because I truly believe he cares about the people, he doesn't need the job.
*  All these politicians are just that, politicians, they're in it for the money and about themselves.
*  As much as they promote, the left says that Trump is all about him and his friends,
*  he don't need to do this.
*  Why would you take a chance of getting shot and everything else for why,
*  unless he really believed in what he was doing?
*  The power?
*  He has all the power he needs.
*  How much more can you use?
*  The most powerful person on earth, if you're a US president.
*  Well, that's not even true.
*  I would say someone like Elon Musk got more power than a president.
*  Do you think? I mean, he just runs Twitter.
*  You know, I mean, he's a billionaire, he got more money, money equals power, right?
*  And even Musk is not about power.
*  Does that worry you a bit that we have a world where the more money you are,
*  the more powerful you are? Isn't that a bit unfair?
*  Does that worry me?
*  Only if it was leaning in the other direction.
*  But for me, it's not.
*  What direction?
*  The left would open borders and not taking care of your own people first
*  as a priority over taking care of the rest of the world.
*  How can you take care of your family?
*  I mean, not take care of your family, but help your neighbor.
*  That's what I was going to ask you about.
*  Take working class Americans.
*  I mean, seven out of ten American workers take out inflation
*  are no better off than they were when Nixon was in power.
*  What the hell has happened in the United States? Why?
*  Because rich people have got richer and richer and richer
*  than working class people haven't. Why?
*  But what people don't understand is that we work for the rich people.
*  They're the ones that create the businesses, the jobs, the factories.
*  But the workers are the ones that create the wealth.
*  That's fine, but somebody has to do it.
*  If not him, who else is going to do it?
*  Don't you think it's the workers who put in the real hard work?
*  And then someone like Trump, he's all about the blue collar worker.
*  He spends more time with his help than he does in the office,
*  you know, when he's not running for office.
*  As a businessman, people said...
*  I mean, the evidence showed workers didn't have a very good deal
*  as him being the boss.
*  In terms of what they were paid, in terms of their rights.
*  Well, like you... I don't know.
*  Like, you see that a lot of times you see that the rich people
*  pay less taxes than their secretary. OK?
*  That's not fair, is it?
*  Not at all. But the thing is, they made the rules.
*  The government, the federal employees, you know, the senators and stuff.
*  And I think there should be term limits for everything.
*  Don't you think it's unfair that we have a world...
*  What you're talking about is a world run by the rich for the rich.
*  And I don't know, it just seems like you're saying that's the way the world is.
*  But should it be?
*  Well, that's the way it's been since the beginning of time.
*  You have different classes of people.
*  That's where you get first class tickets, second class tickets, third class tickets.
*  People with the third class tickets used to be in the bottom of the boat.
*  Second class was in the middle, first class was on top.
*  Can I ask what you did by trade?
*  I own a shop, auto repair business.
*  Yeah, I mean, you're there, you're grafting,
*  you're doing a very useful service that people rely on.
*  And you're being paid a lot less than a lot of rich people,
*  who frankly are just selling stuff people don't even need.
*  Do you really think that is fair?
*  Actually, I do.
*  And the reason I say that, it's my choice.
*  I made that decision to stay at this level of wealth.
*  Where in this country, if you want to succeed and go even further,
*  you have the opportunity.
*  I think you're doing yourself down.
*  I think you do something really, really important.
*  And I think people like you should be paid more than people who,
*  I don't know, just sell things that make people ill
*  and they get huge amounts of money for it.
*  Well, I agree with that.
*  Like all these pharmaceutical companies are loading up...
*  What? I meant more like...
*  ...chemicals and drugs and stuff that we need.
*  Fast food, I meant that kind of thing.
*  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
*  I mean, there's better opportunities out there than what I do,
*  but I'm proud of what I do and I do it for me.
*  Your job is more important than a lot of the jobs that rich people do,
*  but they're getting loads of money and I don't know how much you earn,
*  but you obviously earn a lot less than them.
*  Yeah, this is true, but there again,
*  they either got schooled, educated or fell into it.
*  Yeah, or they had rich parents or they were just lucky.
*  Well, I totally agree with that,
*  but the thing is I don't envy them.
*  I work hard for what I do and what I get and what I earn
*  and I'm happy with that.
*  USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!
*  Am I here?
*  Yeah, I mean, probably because you're a big fan.
*  Yes, I am.
*  And we support Trump.
*  We need him. We're done. Our country's done.
*  In what way is it done?
*  Well, we're going to crash. Our markets are crash.
*  We're on the brink of World War III.
*  It's bad out there.
*  And other countries, I think, depend on us to a point.
*  And if we go down, they're going to suffer also.
*  So, yes, I do feel that we need to get Trump elected.
*  So with the World War III, it comes up a lot.
*  It's bad out there. I get that.
*  I mean, do you think he's the stabiliser?
*  You think he's the kind of cool head in the room?
*  Do you... Did you pay attention to his last term?
*  Yes, he was the stabiliser. There were no wars.
*  There was still war happening.
*  He might not have been involved with people in America,
*  but the wars were there, weren't they?
*  Well, there weren't really that many wars.
*  He... Ukraine wouldn't have been invaded.
*  If Trump had been president, why do you think Putin would have gone,
*  I was thinking of invading Ukraine, but no, I'm not going to do it.
*  Because I think he was afraid of what Trump would do.
*  I think he realised that Trump could be a little muddy.
*  But doesn't that mean... Because I agree, you know, World War III.
*  But then... But then isn't the idea that Trump could have just hit
*  the nuclear button, as you suggested, that would have been World War III then?
*  Yes, but I don't believe that he would have done that.
*  But then Putin wouldn't have believed it either.
*  It actually is like a nightmare to have people...
*  There are a lot of ways that Trump could have hurt him,
*  could have put sanctions on him, he could have hurt the Russian people.
*  Well, they did... They've done sanctions.
*  There are loads of sanctions in Russia.
*  Yeah, there are loads of sanctions, but there could have been a lot more.
*  It could have gotten a lot worse.
*  Which sanctions?
*  Well, he could have actually stopped Russian people
*  from coming to the United States.
*  He could have sent all the students home.
*  Are there any Russians in there?
*  I mean, there's Russian exiles, I mean, then.
*  No, I don't mean exiles, I mean students that are here studying.
*  Do you think that would have stopped him invading Ukraine,
*  Russian students not being able to study in an American university?
*  I really do believe that Trump would have been able to...
*  I don't know, I don't want to say anything.
*  No, I don't want to say anything. He's not nasty.
*  No, I don't want to say anything nasty.
*  I think they were afraid of Trump. They were afraid of what he would have done.
*  I know, I'm just injured, because you talk about World War III being a risk,
*  but then you're saying they're afraid of what he'd do.
*  But that makes me think he might just get a little bit unpredictable
*  and just hit the button.
*  Well, he is a little bit unpredictable, but you don't know what he's going to do.
*  That's why he's unpredictable.
*  Could we have World War...
*  I'll hit the button, I don't believe that.
*  Then we could have World War III.
*  Oh, you don't... They can't be that unpredictable.
*  If he's not doing World War III, then he's less unpredictable.
*  We give them back, baby girl, that's just what we do.
*  No shout out to my homies out here with the camera, bros.
*  We gotta run this, because we got some good stamina.
*  Just give me a word, anything that you want, we kick in a freestyle.
*  You know the people see how...
*  When you hear people who work for him say he's a fascist, what do you think?
*  I agree.
*  Do you think fascism is possible in this country?
*  I think that if we aren't careful, yes it is.
*  So if Trump wins, do you think that's where things are heading?
*  I think that is a strong possibility if he wins,
*  as long as the Congress is also Republican.
*  I was trying to speak about the Trump rally,
*  and there's sorts of people who I would have expected generations ago
*  to always vote Democrat, like, you know, working people.
*  That's really changed in the past several years,
*  since the Republican Party has convinced those people, many of them,
*  that they are the saviours for what has happened to the economy.
*  Why do you think that's happened, in terms of working people,
*  who they vote for rich, right-wing, very rich guy,
*  you wouldn't expect him to be their icon?
*  I don't know, if I knew the answer, I think,
*  be very rich or very powerful.
*  When we went to the Trump rally, we met people who were working class Americans
*  who voted for Trump, and they saw him as the guy to stand up for working people.
*  What's that about? How would you explain that?
*  Racism.
*  They don't want there to be another black president.
*  That's it. So it's basically...
*  That's it. So you have to... What are you going to say?
*  We don't have a black president?
*  Some of them do, but most of them don't.
*  So they have to complain about, let's make it about the border.
*  Well, they wanted to make the border the issue from the day.
*  But they're the ones who had... Democrats suckered them.
*  What they did was they went ahead and said, you know what, let's pass
*  the most comprehensive immigration laws we could ever pass.
*  Things that Republicans have been asking for for years, for decades.
*  Is that a good thing, like, stealing their right-wing policies?
*  No, it wasn't stealing. It was like, we're going to let you show your hand.
*  So they already knew that Trump was going to go ahead and make his calls
*  and say, go ahead and squash this.
*  We were at the Trump rally and we met people who were from...
*  Oh, you were at the Trump rally? Oh!
*  Well, that's our job. That's my job.
*  And some of those were working-class Americans who traditionally
*  would always have been Democrats.
*  But they were saying, Donald Trump's the kind of saviour of working people.
*  What's happening there? How do you explain that?
*  Yeah, propaganda.
*  We have a real problem in the US with propaganda.
*  And the mainstream media does not cover Trump fairly.
*  I say that's probably because of big money that supports mainstream media.
*  The reason Kamala Harris has been so successful is she tapped into
*  outside mainstream media.
*  So there's a lot of propaganda.
*  A lot of people who Trump will do nothing for have always embraced him.
*  It is cultish, but it's all propaganda.
*  They do not understand.
*  They have no concept.
*  It's propagated by conservative media.
*  They have no idea what they're actually voting for.
*  Come on in here. He's an independent.
*  Well, my other question was just my final question,
*  was on the other side, I met people who naturally would have voted Democrat,
*  but they can't because of Israel's onslaught against Gaza.
*  They just can't. What would you say about that?
*  So my own daughter, who I love dearly, is voted for Jill Stein,
*  but she lives in California.
*  She's not in a swing state, so it doesn't really matter.
*  I think that's ignorance.
*  I think that is being intellectually lazy.
*  We all care about Gaza.
*  How would that win? That's not going to win people over, is it?
*  If they're looking at what they consider genocide and mass slaughter.
*  Because, again, they have been swayed to believe
*  that that is the only issue they should vote for.
*  Which is lots of dead people slaughtered, you know,
*  children shot in the head, blown apart.
*  Trust me.
*  With American weapons?
*  I could not agree with you more.
*  But let's be honest, you and me here, let's have an actual, honest discussion about this.
*  The situation in the Mideast is not that simple.
*  You and I can't reduce it to a soundbite.
*  Yes, American money goes to Israel.
*  What, weapons, which kill lots of people?
*  Yes, yes, yes. Our support. 100%. I agree with you on that.
*  But again, understand Hamas is a force that has committed grave, grave, grave damage to Israel.
*  Again, we can't solve this.
*  You and I sitting here, Netanyahu needs to get his ass to the table and negotiate.
*  And shame on the fact that Donald Trump has been lobbying him
*  when he shouldn't have been, as a personal citizen,
*  to stay away from the table for the benefit of the election.
*  Again, again, you and I can't solve the Mideast in this conversation here.
*  I am not glossing over Gaza.
*  It is atrocious what's happened in Gaza.
*  But again, Hamas needs to be reigned in.
*  Netanyahu needs to come to the table.
*  But no one denies Hamas has committed grave war crimes.
*  But Israel has committed far deadlier war crimes with US rep...
*  Again, I think there's all kinds of blame that can be laid.
*  This is not a one-issue election.
*  I am distressed and dismayed by Gaza.
*  However, this is about reproductive freedom, LGBTQ plus rights.
*  It is about taxation.
*  It is about...
*  People see genocide as far more important than all of those issues.
*  I think you're wrong.
*  Obviously, you're just here for one issue.
*  No, I'm not.
*  That's your issue.
*  I wish you the best.
*  No, it's just an important issue, that's all.
*  Alright.
*  Wish them the best as well.
*  Thinking about voters with disillusionment travelling around the country,
*  we went to Dearborn in Michigan,
*  and a lot of natural democratic voters just can't vote for the Democrats
*  because of the arming of Israel and Gaza.
*  What would you say to those voters?
*  Um, there's a lot of question right now about policies and plans and everything.
*  But at this point, it's a threat against our democracy,
*  and it's a threat against...
*  There's no choice.
*  Yeah, there's no choice.
*  It's not a question you have to vote for Harris.
*  I mean, our democracy is at risk if you don't.
*  Are you unhappy about the choice and offer then?
*  You're doing it more because of the stakes?
*  Um, yeah.
*  I can't vote for Trump, but I will vote for Harris.
*  I was going to vote for her anyway, but I just feel like there is no choice.
*  Like, Trump is not an option.
*  So my final question is, when she's in power,
*  do you think people like yourself, who...
*  preserving democracy, number one issue,
*  they put pressure on her and her administration
*  to do better things than she's currently offering?
*  Will we put pressure?
*  Sure, yeah.
*  Do you think there's a plan to do that amongst certain people?
*  Yeah?
*  Absolutely.
*  Yeah, it's much better than our alternative,
*  but I definitely think that Kamala Harris has...
*  She treats everyone like humans.
*  She recognizes that.
*  And I think she definitely has a history of listening to her supporters,
*  and I think she will do the right thing.
*  What's driving, do you think, Trump's support here?
*  How would you explain it?
*  Um...
*  Do you want me to be, like, totally honest?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  OK.
*  I think that at this point, most Trump voters are either bad people
*  or they're low-information voters.
*  So this is to say that they're either easily manipulable
*  or want bad things to happen to other people.
*  What does that say about the United States?
*  That's half the country gone, to be honest.
*  I'm going to be frank with you.
*  What that says about the country is that our institutions
*  and our institutions of politics and our media,
*  particularly the relationship of our media to our governmental institutions,
*  aren't as invulnerable as we believed, right?
*  So things that we've seen happen in other countries throughout the Global South
*  can and do happen here in terms of manipulation of the electorate
*  and pitting people against one another based on ideological grounds.
*  How would you win that?
*  I mean, if a Trump voter heard that, they're not going to go,
*  oh, you're right, I'm an obstacle-voting Democrat.
*  You know, they'd be like, well, fuck you then.
*  Yeah, I don't know.
*  The Democratic Party has done, like, a pretty terrible job
*  over the past three decades, keeping its promises
*  to the white working class and to the working poor.
*  So it is no kind of fault of early Trump voters
*  that they were, I don't know, manipulated in the way that they were.
*  So I feel like if the question is kind of like how to win them back,
*  like how do Democrats do that?
*  I don't know that the Democratic Party can win them back.
*  I think that there needs to be a concerted effort
*  on the part of the American governmental system to rebuild trust
*  because it's lost a considerable amount of trust
*  over the past 30 years to half century.
*  And that's deservedly so.
*  It hasn't done much to instill trust.
*  Are you, you're probably not here to be like, yeah, Kamala Harris.
*  No, I'm not.
*  I mean, truthfully, I think that Trump is still a terrible option comparatively.
*  So I think people see me and they're afraid to interact with me
*  because they automatically assume that I'm not voting for Harris.
*  But I've been struggling a lot with this, but I am voting for Harris
*  because I think that Trump will be even worse for Palestine and Lebanon.
*  But I just think it's important to pressure every second possible
*  because clearly Kamala and Waltz are very pro-Israel.
*  And so I think that it's important to pressure every second leading up to the election.
*  I don't feel good about this vote.
*  I was very much like Jill Stein.
*  I do love Jill Stein, but I think it's just unrealistic to expect
*  that our bipartisan system, you know, in our bipartisan system,
*  that someone like Jill Stein is going to win because she's unfortunately not.
*  When I spoke to people in there, they, about this, they were a bit like,
*  look, that's just one issue.
*  We've got all these other issues.
*  And someone actually said to me, I've got to think about me now in response.
*  When I talked about Gaza. What do you say to those people?
*  So, I mean, I don't think people have told me before that this is, you know,
*  just voting based on one issue.
*  And I don't agree with that at all.
*  I think that what I think that the genocide that's going on in Gaza right now
*  is a women's rights issue, is an LGBTQ issue, is a bigger issue
*  that just highlights how corrupt our Western world is
*  and how corrupt our system is because all of these politicians,
*  you know, both Trump and Harris are taking money by horrible organizations,
*  horrible Zionist organizations.
*  And so I think that it's important to keep that in mind because, you know,
*  everyone's afraid of Trump, myself included, you know, because he's fascist.
*  But I think that, you know, we're already there.
*  And I think that unfortunately, we think we have more influence
*  than we do with this vote, but both parties are bought out by Zionist organizations.
*  And so I think that's the bigger, you know, overarching reason
*  why this is not a single issue vote.
*  Have you been yelled at in going to these rallies with this?
*  Have you gone to a rally with this?
*  I actually haven't been yelled at yet today.
*  One person told me they liked my sign.
*  No one yelled at me, though, which is better than some other times.
*  Just lastly, what does it say about American democracy that you literally hear
*  about genocide and you feel you have no choice but to vote for a candidate,
*  complicit in it because the option is just so much worse?
*  What does that say about the system?
*  It says that it's horrible.
*  You know, it's I feel like it's not a democracy.
*  I feel like we are, you know, again, everyone always comments on,
*  you know, Trump is fascist.
*  Yes, he is.
*  But I think we're already in, you know, a fascist system.
*  And so I think that unfortunately, we don't have democracy.
*  I feel like I hate the whole voting for the lesser of two evils
*  because these are both really horrible evils.
*  And so my vote doesn't feel good.
*  Guys, I love you. I'm a little bit depressed.
*  On the one hand, we've got an ever more extreme,
*  right wing authoritarian movement which draws its well of support
*  from different constituencies, some of them just raging committed racist.
*  Let's just be honest about it.
*  And others are, I would say, from disillusioned working class communities
*  which have suffered terrible consequences from a broken economic system
*  and their anger's gone in all the wrong directions.
*  And on the other here, certainly the committed,
*  really committed Kamala Harris sort of supporters,
*  there's not really an understanding of why people who are struggling
*  have been seduced by Trumpism and they don't have actually any interest,
*  as far as I can tell, in winning them back at all.
*  They're just cast out into outer darkness and that's the end of it.
*  And that point about Gaza and Israel's genocide,
*  there's a lack, let's be honest, of just basic emotional intelligence.
*  I understand the arguments, of course,
*  about this terrible threat posed by Donald Trump.
*  I get that. It's not to belittle that.
*  But even if you're going to make the argument
*  that you have to support Kamala Harris for that reason,
*  to just treat a genocide, I think, with the lack of seriousness on display here,
*  as though it's just one issue, why are people so fixated with this?
*  It's a genocide. And I think that is disturbing.
*  And if there are going to be movements which emerge if Kamala Harris
*  wins the presidency to put her under pressure,
*  then it's not going to come from those sorts of constituencies.
*  And the question is, where, what happens next?
*  Do you have a right-wing authoritarian government
*  which threatens democracy or a neoliberal government
*  which doesn't do much for many working people and continues to arm a genocide?
*  That, in the moment, I'm afraid, is a choice.
*  What happens next is what I'm going to investigate
*  because we're going to do videos in the aftermath of the election.
*  We're doing elections all through the night.
*  I'll be in New York with the American left.
