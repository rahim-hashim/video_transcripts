# Renowned Gaza Writer's DEVASTATING Experience Of Genocide - w. Ahmed Masoud
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [August 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LSSC_xuKnI)
*  I'm really honored to be joined by the acclaimed Palestinian British writer, director, Ahmed
*  Masood, who is from Gaza, from Jabalia. He's lived in the UK now for over two decades. His
*  brilliant work includes Vanished and Mysterious Disappearance of Mustafa Huda, It Come What May,
*  also as well as books, theatre, radio, camouflage, The Shroudmaker, and Escape from Gaza. Now,
*  I've been meaning to speak to Ahmed for a long time. I've been following his Twitter feed
*  throughout this catastrophe, this crime, the genocidal onslaught, of course, against Gaza
*  by Israel, armed and backed by our governments. And obviously, this is a horror which has touched
*  all the lives of Palestinians from Gaza in the most hideous way. And unfortunately,
*  Ahmed is no exception. His brother was killed by the Israeli state earlier this year. I mean,
*  it's such an honor to be able to speak to you. Always very humble to be able to speak to people
*  like yourself in circumstances which people like myself can try and imagine, but there's always a
*  barrier there. And I know how hard, well, I can only imagine how hard it is to talk about this.
*  So just thank you so much for joining us. Thank you. Thank you. And it's really a great
*  pleasure to be here. I made a decision quite early on when the genocide started to boycott
*  media completely. So I had requests from the BBC and Channel 4 and others to kind of appear on
*  interviews and things like that. But I made a conscious decision to not appear there. And the
*  reason for that was because I felt that they were complicit in this genocide and because they
*  actually prepared the groundwork for what is happening right now. And I remember tweeting
*  about it and talking about it, saying like what you're seeing on TV now, and a lot of people
*  actually did as well, was similar to kind of the prelude to the Iraq War or the Afghan War where
*  thousands and thousands and millions were killed. Yeah, so pleased to be here because this is not,
*  you know, the BBC or the others. I'm still in the same position. I'm not going to go and speak to
*  them at all. I was cornered once by the BBC when I did a play last year and this journalist came
*  in and really wanted to talk to me. But I said no and I held my ground for it. But yeah, it's great
*  to be able to talk to like-minded people and to reach to people who understand because I think
*  we need that. We need that so much, people who understand or at least try to understand rather
*  than judge us immediately. Amen to that. And I think that point about Western media complicity
*  in all of this, I've interviewed, for example, Al Naouk, the co-fan of We Are Not Numbers, and
*  that point he's made very strongly that he says the Western media killed his family alongside
*  everybody else. So I'm glad you've raised that to begin with. Just to begin with, I mean,
*  can you just tell me, you grew up in Gaza, so you left in 2002. Can you just tell me a bit,
*  just a bit about growing up in Gaza? At the time it was under direct Israeli, of course,
*  military occupation when you were there. Can you just tell me a bit, just that experience and how
*  it kind of shaped you, your work as well, I suppose? Yeah, sure. I mean, it's really interesting
*  because at the moment, like because of what is happening in Gaza and the unimaginable destruction
*  where Gaza is being completely erased from the map, buildings, streets, cafes, restaurants, mosques,
*  universities, hospitals, I mean, everything that a city has. A lot of people, especially, you know,
*  my friends on social media and people I'm in touch with on the ground, they're constantly posting
*  pictures of Gaza before the war, before the genocide, and how beautiful it was. And yes,
*  I agree to a large extent, it was a beautiful city. Gaza is a Mediterranean city in the end.
*  Think of Napoli, think of Alexandria, think of, you know, any Mediterranean city with its little
*  alleys and cafes and restaurants and beautiful, you know, Jerusalem stone houses. It was beautiful
*  indeed. However, it was a very, very, very difficult place to live in with very high
*  unemployment rates, borders completely sealed. We weren't allowed to have our own airport or our
*  own access to the port, the seaport, completely controlled from all sides by Israel. Now, people
*  say that Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, and Gaza was left its own in a sense. And that's true,
*  they withdrew troops from Gaza, from the ground. But however, they controlled everything else,
*  including as they boasted themselves, including the calories that we ate at the time. So Gaza,
*  before the genocide, was always an open air prison. It was described as an open air prison.
*  And it remained, and now it got even worse. In 2009, I was in London, my mum had cancer in Gaza,
*  and Gaza was completely sealed. There was no way to get in or out of Gaza.
*  There was no, she had a bowel cancer and there was no colostomy bags for her to use.
*  And I remember trying to join the Freedom Flutella boat in 2009, which is an activist
*  movement that tried to break the siege on Gaza through sailing from Cyprus to Gaza. They succeeded
*  once or twice, but other times Israel rammed the boat and arrested everybody on board.
*  And I remember in 2009, going to Cyprus, getting ready to get on the boat and going around
*  hospitals and clinics in Larnaca, in Cyprus, asking them and begging them for colostomy bags.
*  And their reaction was so, like I will never forget it, but they said, but why wouldn't you
*  have colostomy bags in Gaza? And I couldn't answer, I was like, I don't know why. I really don't know
*  why. And that is the sort of thing that Israel did, that they took the colostomy bags and they
*  controlled things to make life as hard as possible, you know, sometimes without justification,
*  most of the time without justification. And they always used the kind of security sort of threat
*  around it, et cetera. Anyway, to cut a long story short, I didn't go in the boat because the boat
*  was delayed. The border opened for about three days. I flew to Cairo, long journey to Gaza,
*  got into Gaza and I got stuck there for six months. I lost my job in London,
*  ran out of money and it took a miracle to get out. And that was in 2009, by the way, where,
*  you know, the whole border was completely, completely sealed. And so you can imagine
*  when people talk of Gaza before the war, yes, it was beautiful because people in the end of place
*  has memories, people have a relationship to it, no matter how hard it is. I miss it.
*  I miss growing up there in Jabalia camp, which was very, very difficult, you know, we didn't have a
*  proper sewage system, for example. I lived in a small house in the camp where it was covered with
*  asbestos sheets, which made it like a baking oven in summer and like a freezer in winter because it
*  doesn't protect at all. But I still miss it. I still miss those days. I still miss, you know,
*  the sense of family and security and community. Well, not so much security because Israeli soldiers
*  were there all the time shooting whenever they wanted, arresting whenever they wanted. So,
*  yeah, that's what it was like. Beautiful. I mean, a beautiful place. So imagine driving from Cairo
*  to Gaza, which is my route, my journey, because again, as I said, we don't have an airport.
*  Sometimes it takes three to five days to get from Cairo to Gaza because of all the checkpoints,
*  you sleep on the road and all of these things. And then he was driving through the Sinai and it's
*  a desert and it's a beautiful desert, by the way, really beautiful. And he drives through the Sinai
*  and as he gets close to Gaza, you see this green oasis over there in the distance and that is Gaza.
*  And there's a massive difference between like that desert kind of drive to this green land in a way.
*  I mean, your work has always fleshed out the kind of, I mean, vanished the mysterious
*  disappearance of Mustafa Uda. I mean, that was set over a long period, wasn't it? Throughout
*  Gaza's history. Can you tell me about that and kind of the experiences that you fed on or
*  in that work that kind of tell us about Gaza throughout that period? I mean, with my writing,
*  that's what I've always tried to do, by the way, because I've lived in the prison called Gaza,
*  as it were, and now I feel like I'm living out of prison, as it were. I tried my writing to kind
*  of, with my writing, I tried to kind of get people there, to take them there and describe Gaza as it
*  really is, with its beautiful streets and shops and cafes, etc., etc., without so much kind of
*  telling them more about the history and political situation, but more about through telling a
*  personal story and, yeah, just a narrative that is normal and could happen anywhere else. So I
*  write about people and their stories and their interactions. And guess what? We are a nation.
*  We have the good and the bad. We have the hero and the villain. We're not some sort of
*  extraterrestrial people that are just called Gaza and that they should be killed or we're not some
*  human animals, as the Israelis describe us. There are people, beautiful people, and there are people
*  who are trying to climb on top of each other to kind of make money or whatever. This is normal
*  in any conflict situation. So when I write, like in Vanished, there are a number of characters that
*  I paint that actually reflect that. Come what may, the same thing, like the main character's
*  husband is killed and she's trying to find his murderer and he was murdered by a Palestinian.
*  We do have murders, you know, we do have. So I try with my writing to kind of get this idea that
*  we are a normal kind of society, but come and experience us, come and smell us, come and smell
*  the food, come and smell the streets and the cafes and the music and hear us, et cetera.
*  But unfortunately with my writing, like it's especially in the UK that would, because I am
*  Palestinian, it's almost like I am not even allowed to put my voice on. It's not so easy,
*  it's not, it's very, very challenging. It's this idea of censorship that actually it's quite scary
*  to be honest with you, that people refuse your work just because of who you are, because you
*  are Palestinian. It's practically racist to be honest. I've had events and theater and plays
*  cancelled and people haven't even read it. They haven't even read it to actually say anything
*  about it or say, well actually, no, this doesn't fit with us or whatever. Because all I write is
*  just about people and human stories. It's funny because I was remembering yesterday,
*  a few years ago, about 10 years ago, I wrote a short story about Gaza set in 2048. And it's a
*  fantasy kind of story about Gaza winning the right to host the Olympics, the 2048 Olympics.
*  And it's a joke and there's two geek guys, they submit this application to the IOC and they win
*  it and then it's like, oh shit, what do we do? And they start preparing for the Olympics. So it was
*  published in a book called Palestine Plus 100 as a short story. And then it was sort of adapted
*  into a radio drama, which played in Germany in WDR, which is a very famous radio station in
*  China. It's a bit like Channel 4 in the UK, I suppose. And for the last few Olympics, every
*  Olympics, they played it and sent me my royalties, all of that, my paycheck for it, which was great.
*  This is the first time they haven't, which I was very surprised about. And then I thought,
*  but why wouldn't they? Every Olympics they play it because it's about the Olympics. It's kind of a
*  bit of a joke play or whatever. But then I remembered, oh, okay, it's because what's happening
*  in Germany at the moment, they can't even play something they've already played, something that
*  they're so confident and happy about and paid the fee. That's why I mentioned the fee in there
*  before. And now it's like this silencing of everything Palestinian in Europe and in the UK
*  specifically. So it's really, really like a shame. It's a struggle. And I really hope that this will
*  change at some point, because in order for things to change, our voice needs to be elevated as much
*  as possible as well. It's striking, isn't it? All that discussion about so-called cancel culture
*  seems to have stopped after the 7th of October. You barely actually hear it talked about. And many
*  of the people who spoke about free speech being stifled are the very people who have led this
*  attempt to silence, well, particularly Palestinian voices, actually, this deliberate attempt,
*  just including various forms of art. We've seen as well, I mean, Germany, Jewish and German-Israeli
*  authors who stand out, speak out for Palestine, hippie science. What hope, I suppose, for Palestinian
*  voices in those circumstances? Exactly. And also the shameful thing about it, what we talk about,
*  what I talk about, for example, on Twitter and stuff, is my family, my personal stories.
*  One of the most vile things I saw in there, when I posted a picture of my sister who's in
*  Jabalia when she was pregnant, and she's had her baby now a couple of months, her baby's two months
*  old, but when I posted saying I'm so worried about her and her pregnancy and her not being able to
*  go to hospital and get support and all of these things, the responses and the provocation from
*  Zionist lobbies and some comments were absolutely vile. Of course, we ignore social media things,
*  and especially Twitter or X or whatever, you do ignore it, but then you realize that you kind of
*  think, how could people think like that? How could people really put us in that situation where
*  there are people suffering at the moment? There are people being starved to death.
*  I've got some messages from my sister yesterday, actually, she was in Jabalia, she was like,
*  basically all she's dreaming of is a cucumber and some tomatoes to make a salad. Can you imagine?
*  And that is something that we are witnessing live on TV in a sense, that people are being starved
*  to death. Let's forget for a second about the killing and all the murders and everything,
*  but the idea that you put people somewhere and you start them, you cut off food, you cut off
*  electricity, you cut off everything, and you let them die, and so many of them have died.
*  I know people in Jabalia who are neighbors and friends of friends, and who actually died because
*  of lack of medication, lack of food, and all of these things, and it is allowed to happen.
*  In other parts in Gaza, it's the constant bombardment, constantly. People are moving
*  from one place to the other, and that's what I talk about. I talk about somebody who's been
*  forcibly removed from their place like five or six times. Even now, as we speak,
*  last night they gave orders to an area in Khan Younis to evacuate again, but where do people go?
*  How are we just looking at this and allowing it to happen? Then the moment you start to discuss it
*  and talk about it, and then as if it's like, oh, you know, you can't do this because you haven't
*  mentioned the other side. I'm talking about my family and my friends. It's really frustrating
*  at the moment. Your family, of course, lived through previous onslaughts, but this was
*  from the beginning. Obviously, it was always going to be very clear, something of a completely
*  different order. Can you just talk me through it? Because you've got one brother who was obviously
*  killed horrifically. You had three brothers, five sisters, your mother, you got nephews and nieces.
*  What was going through your head? Were you able to communicate right at the start?
*  With your family, what was going through your head about what was likely to happen?
*  Well, I think this is the worst thing that happened in this genocide and this war. I think it
*  doesn't happen very often elsewhere, which is the fact that Israel cut off communication completely
*  on Palestinians. That was actually the worst feeling. That was actually the hardest thing,
*  and still is, by the way. Still is because a lot of people don't have access to the internet.
*  They've destroyed the infrastructure, like the telecommunication infrastructure, purposely,
*  of course. But I remember back in October when there was one weekend, there was a big blackout
*  over Gaza. Imagine you're somewhere else and you just don't know. You just don't know whatever
*  happens. You could get connected at the end of that weekend and your entire family is killed.
*  Your entire neighborhood is destroyed. Anything could have happened. Trying to find news, trying
*  to follow news, trying to find out what's happening. But this time it's just been very,
*  very difficult to do that. It's been really, really taxing for us, for anybody who's from Gaza.
*  He knows very well the situation. He knows the area. He knows that Khan Younes is a tiny place,
*  really. When they're bombing Khan Younes, you could hear it in Jabalia. The whole of Gaza is
*  36 kilometers long, so it's not that big. They kept talking of Rafa has this linen guard or
*  something like this. It's a tiny one street, really. That's been really, really difficult.
*  And still is. I can't connect easily to my nephews and nieces, to my sisters. Right now,
*  I hear that there is bombing in the middle of Gaza. I can't easily call her and check on her.
*  That's been really, really difficult. My own mother, I managed to evacuate her from Gaza back
*  in April, just the day before the Rafa border closed. But for months before that, I didn't know
*  if she was alive or not. Imagine that feeling. Waking up every day, going to work, going to do
*  your daily, getting on with your daily routine, not knowing if your mom is alive or not. You can't
*  even connect to her. She herself, my brother was killed in January in a really horrific attack where
*  he was bombed by a drone, wasn't killed immediately. He was left on the street for three
*  days bleeding until he was found by his own kids. And as he was found and they put him on a donkey
*  cart because there was no ambulance or anything to rush him to hospital, he died with them.
*  There is comfort in that, that he died with the people he loved and closed his eyes as he saw his
*  kids and said goodbye. But the fact that he wasn't allowed medication, access to medication,
*  the fact that he was bleeding for three days, the fact that if there was one hospital or a medic or
*  whatever, he could still be with us right now. That thought just torments me. What is worse,
*  that my own mother, his own mother didn't know about his death until three months later because
*  there was no connection. She was in Chaniunas. She had left Jabalia in December when that pause
*  happened and she thought, as we were told, that the South and Chaniunas was safe. But of course,
*  now we know that that was all part of their plan to expel people from the North of Gaza.
*  Yeah, so it was one of the most horrific things that I had to experience and having to deal with
*  that, deal with the grief. And I haven't been able to deal with the grief yet because I've been
*  trying to support my nephews and nieces, my brother's kids. My mom, I went to see her in Egypt
*  a few weeks ago and it was one of the most difficult things I've done in my life because
*  that woman who's now 75 years old and lost her son that she didn't know about and then her other son
*  just comes in and she's just like clinging and hanging on as if I've just come back from the dead
*  or something. And that's just one example. I mean, I still feel I'm kind of one of the lucky ones in
*  a sense because other families have experienced far more horrific things. We managed to bury my
*  brother in the main cemetery in Jabalia where my dad was buried last year. Unfortunately, when the
*  Israelis went into Jabalia again, they destroyed the cemetery and destroyed the graves and everything.
*  So for me, I will never have that closure for him to go and stand by his grave and cry and say goodbye
*  as it were. Yeah, but again, like I said, we are one of the lucky ones to actually be able to find
*  his body and to bury him and for his kids to have that closure. But imagine of all the thousands of
*  people that still have hope that their children might still be alive under the rubble or in Israeli
*  prison. And when I was in Egypt, I was talking to my mom and she said something that made me cry,
*  really. She said that if she would have a choice between when the Israelis invade between her
*  children being killed or arrested by the Israelis, she would rather that they're killed. Can you
*  imagine? Can you imagine that? And I was like, wow, you know, and I was like, but why is that? She
*  said, have you not heard what they're doing there? And now more things are coming out of, you know,
*  you know, abuse of Palestinian hostages, I called them. And for a mother to say that,
*  it's just, it means that what she knows and what people know is far, far greater
*  than what we're getting over here. I mean, I can't even imagine the grieving process is to kind of
*  the assault on the grieving process, as well as everything else, the constant anxiety mixed in
*  with all of that, of course, for the rest of your family still there, I mean, what's it like,
*  the fact, you know, we're here, we're talking here in Britain, not that far away from where we both
*  sit, the seat of government, that your family going through this and the knowledge that this government
*  has armed and is arming Israel has provided diplomatic support, supported Israel's genocide,
*  alongside from the start. I mean, the way that much of the media, of course, has framed this
*  from the very beginning. I mean, what's that just maybe talk me through a bit, you know,
*  knowing what your family's gone through, you've got a big girl and that kind of backdrop.
*  I think people there can look at the UK as a party, as a complicit party of this genocide,
*  the UK is the same as the US, as the Israel as well. If you speak to my mum, she would tell you
*  that there are British drones flying over Gaza, they know them, they know the difference between
*  the British drones and the Israeli drones, by the way, I don't know how, but they do,
*  you know, because people have lived under this surveillance state for a long time and they know.
*  She would tell you that there are British soldiers fighting in Gaza along this Israeli army.
*  She would tell you how angry she is about the UK basically interfering against the ICC case
*  with the arrest warrant against Netanyahu. She would tell you how angry that the armed trade
*  is still going by the British government to Israel, weapons, British weapons being used for genocide.
*  So I think people there are incredibly, incredibly frustrated and angry that
*  not even a ceasefire has been called by the British government. And the reason why they're angry is,
*  I mean, kind of expected that Britain would support Israel, you know, they like,
*  in the end, Britain created Israel in Palestine, you know.
*  But they see other examples of like Spain, for example, or Belgium or Norway, who are trying to
*  kind of put an influence, who are trying to make a change. I mean, can you imagine if all the
*  international community got together and after the ICJ ruling back in January decided to force Israel
*  to do just that and to stop the genocide? Can you imagine how many lives we would have saved by now?
*  Can you imagine that how much that would have opened in terms of negotiations, in terms of
*  building a real opportunity for peace? Because we also have to have hope and people in Gaza also
*  have a bit of hope to say that this is it, this is the last time, we don't want to be there anymore,
*  nobody wants to be there anymore. So I'm hoping that out of this destruction and darkness and
*  all of these things, that some sort of real hope for peace will be born. But it does need
*  an international kind of commitment and does need some real pressure put on Israel. Otherwise,
*  they're not going to do it. They've got a government who are complete nutters, you know,
*  they're complete nutters. They're calling for, you know, the starvation of, only yesterday,
*  Smotrych and others called for the starvation of Gaza of 2.3 million people in there to be starved
*  to death. They're constantly talking about occupying Gaza and ethnically cleansing Gaza and the rest of
*  Palestine. They today was they were also talking about Janine in the West Bank to do the same
*  in there. And that is allowed. It's fine. You know, it's absolutely fine. You just go and kill
*  2 million people. It's okay. You know. So yeah, they're really, really angry with the UK position
*  in there. And they haven't seen any change like with the new government. I haven't either, you
*  know, in terms of, you know, we've got a new Labour government, they're supposed to be on the left,
*  they're supposed to be a bit more kind of supportive and understanding, but it's the same
*  policy, to be honest. I mean, links about the media, we mentioned that earlier. I worked in
*  the British media industry for a long time. So I don't say this, whenever I say it's not serious
*  in position of naivety, I'm not surprised. But the lack of subtlety involved in the just dehumanization
*  of Palestinian life, and that's because I'm obviously Palestinian. So that's why I'm asking
*  the impact. Just your view, because there's just so little subtlety. I mean, almost if you
*  were to erase the dynamics in the history and the context, if you were to just start from the
*  position of Palestinians being equal human beings, then you would have screened for this to end,
*  as in the media, from day one. So I'm just about, what's that like just living through that,
*  just seeing that dehumanization on a daily basis and how that expresses itself?
*  It's very, very difficult and very hard because, I mean, yeah, it allows others also to dehumanize
*  us. It allows people in our daily lives at work or in the street or whatever it is, because that's
*  what people see. They see the media, they see the BBC, they see how they address you, they see
*  what your position in the human ranking is, and they treat you like that, basically,
*  as a second-class citizen, as somebody who's not even a human, doesn't have proper human rights,
*  as it were. But there are so many examples from the media where they just don't... Like, I mean,
*  if you think about sort of basically reporting numbers, right? This always followed by, oh,
*  100 Palestinians died rather than were killed by Israel, as reported by the Hamas-run Ministry of
*  Health. It's like even that, the Hamas Ministry of Health, you know, Hamas-run Ministry of Health,
*  that basically is saying to you, don't care about those people, they're all liars, they're all
*  terrorists, we don't even believe their numbers, let them confuse, etc. But those 100 people I know
*  yesterday were killed, innocent civilians that were there taking shelter in that school.
*  Many, many, many, many other examples that I can pick on today, but it basically dehumanizes you,
*  makes you somebody who's not worth discussing their lives, discussing... And that translates
*  into other things, as I said, like your daily life, your work, theatre, culture, which is sort
*  of my scene and my sector, as it were. You know, when people are scared, it's like, you're Palestinian,
*  you're not quite right, I'm not sure I'm gonna put things on. Like, I've got a play in Edinburgh now,
*  The Shroudmakers playing in Edinburgh. And like, it's testament to the production company,
*  Andy Jordan Company, production company that went to and took it and took that brave decision. But
*  it took a long time to convince everybody to put it on. And people were just like scared and doubtful
*  and read the script several times. And all of these things like forensic looking into, I'm gonna
*  find a problem with this, I am gonna find because the media tells me he's not a human, he must be
*  awful, you know. Whereas some writer who's writing, I don't know about anything, you know,
*  yeah, great, you know, do it. But yeah, that's the reality that we live in at the moment. But
*  things like also, I mean, I've been lucky with my work in London, here that it's been fine, but I
*  hear from my friends where they've been, you know, targeted by colleagues, they've been harassed by
*  colleagues, by their work workplace as well. They haven't been given the support and time off to
*  deal with their grief and what is happening. And as British Palestinians who are here, the government
*  hasn't reached out to us at all to see what support they can give. They haven't even, we've been
*  asking for like a family reunion scheme, similar to the Ukraine one. Nothing, no engagement
*  whatsoever. We got together, we organized ourselves, there are various groups working on this with
*  lawyers and all of these things. They haven't even budged, they haven't even changed their position
*  at all, which is really, really ridiculous. I mean, there has been nobody from Gaza who has made it
*  here, which is ridiculous. There are about 200,000 people in Gaza who left Gaza to Egypt now
*  for various reasons, whether it's medication or study or whatever, that's before the border was
*  closed. None of those people, I think one kid actually made it to Wales and that's it. But apart
*  from that, nobody else was allowed or granted entry on a humanitarian basis.
*  Just, I mean, just lastly, following from that question, maybe seems, well, just in given the
*  context, I found this kind of slightly difficult question to ask, but I mean, do you see any hope?
*  I mean, partly we've seen the polling of Western public opinion, including the US,
*  has been a dramatic shift in support of the Palestinian people. I mean, the polling shows
*  in Britain, large majority think war crimes have been committed, that an arms embargo
*  should be instituted. A recent poll showed a large majority support their arrest of Benjamin Netanyahu.
*  I mean, do you see in that any hope, the fact that public opinion has shifted in that, in time,
*  that must have a political expression, that governments in the US and elsewhere, I mean,
*  we can see also the US presidential elections, do you see that pressure coming to bear? I mean,
*  is that where you think the hope, partly because of the work of Palestinian journalists, I have to say,
*  the journalists in history showing the world what's actually happening has had a big impact,
*  particularly on younger generations? Yeah, I would like to think so. I mean,
*  our great poet Mahmoud Darwish, who died in 2008, he said, in describing Palestinians, he said,
*  we do what the prisoners do, we cultivate hope. And we also have another saying in Arabic that
*  says, and that life is so claustrophobic without the vastness of hope. And I think there is hope.
*  I think, like I said, I was referring to it earlier, I think the hope is that this is it,
*  that both Palestinians and Israelis in general will learn from this, that they both can't get
*  rid of each other, you know, we'll be there together forever, you know. So what we need is
*  a political process that ensures the rights of all civilians to be protected and to be equal as much
*  as possible. And this is where the hope is, is that the world will start to see the problem is,
*  it's not just about ceasefire, it's not just about what happened in October or whatever,
*  it's beyond that, it's about ensuring that there is a political process that ensures the rights,
*  the civil rights of everybody who lives there as equal. And that's really, really important and key.
*  I think the international pressure is mounting, of course. And I feel a lot of the work that
*  the journalists have done in Palestine, which has then been sort of translated into student protests,
*  you know, and the young generation across Europe and the US and others, it is making a difference,
*  of course. But I think it needs a stance, a political stance, where like, you know,
*  a boycott of arms trade or whatever it is against Israel, and then that will translate into real
*  pressure, because otherwise it's just words at the moment, just, you know, curious, dumb,
*  we want a lasting ceasefire that ensures aid gets in and the hostages are returned.
*  Great, you know, everybody wants that. But does that even mean, you know, yeah, it's just a
*  politician talk. And of course, Israel knows this, and they won't do anything, they won't change
*  anything at all. I think there is, there is a change. And I'm grateful for everybody who's
*  engaging, who's sharing our stories, who's sharing, even like just retweeting, reposting,
*  resharing, people underestimate the power that that has. Like you said, that those journalists,
*  this is how they're getting, they're not getting it on the BBC and Channel 4 or anything, they're
*  getting it on social media, which in turn is actually censoring us a lot. Meta hides our
*  posts, and there is an algorithm, anything pro-Palestinian. So I think the more that
*  people share would be amazing. The more that people read our stories, our literature, our books,
*  our poems, everything and share it, because that gives us humanity, that gives us our humanity,
*  that deserves it again, that we're not just numbers either, we're not just numbers, we are
*  people with humans, we write poems, we write songs, share everything, food recipes and all
*  of these things, because if we lose our land, Gaza and Palestine, I don't want us to lose our culture
*  as well, which belongs to us, nobody can take that from us. Absolutely not. Your humanity shines too,
*  I have to say, all the way through this conversation, I know through your work. I hope everyone
*  who's listened to this, watched this, goes and checks out your work, I'll include links so people
*  can read what your incredible work, very acclaimed work, I have to say. I can't imagine,
*  again, the conditions being an artist, expressing and thinking and emotion,
*  expressing that at a time like this, difficult to imagine what that's like, but it's been such
*  an honour. For everyone who's listened or watched, please share this, make sure his voice is heard
*  loud and clear, press like, subscribe, leave comments, good for algorithm, but I comment,
*  honestly, it's been such an honour. Thank you so much. Thank you so much for having me,
*  it's been a pleasure. Thank you.
