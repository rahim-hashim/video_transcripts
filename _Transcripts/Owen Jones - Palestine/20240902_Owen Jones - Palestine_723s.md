# UK Suspends Israel Arms Sales - But Only Some Donâ€™t Be Fooled
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [September 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C37ckSzn2XM)
*  The British government has played a significant role in facilitating Israel's genocidal onslaught
*  against the Palestinian people through its use of its global platform to champion Israel's slaughter,
*  its failure to use its diplomatic position to challenge this crime of historic proportions,
*  its failure to use its relationship with the United States to stop the atrocities
*  being committed on a daily basis, and of course, its arming of this genocide with weapons.
*  Today, it's been announced by the British Foreign Secretary David Lammy that the British
*  government is suspending some arms exports licenses to Israel. The operative word here being some,
*  which I'll come on to. That's after a review by the government which found a clear risk,
*  in adverse quotes, that British arms could be used in serious violations of humanitarian law,
*  specifically relating to the treatment of Palestinian detainees and the supply of aid to Gaza.
*  I should say that the British government has a legal duty, if it has legal advice,
*  stating that Israel is committing war crimes, crimes against humanity, not to provide arms
*  to enable those war crimes. So it's not like you should go, well, hey, British government,
*  look what they're doing on their own steam. They have a legal obligation not to arm a genocide.
*  Now, what's covered in this includes components for drones, helicopters, and fighter aircraft.
*  Now, before you start cracking open those champagne bottles, that's 30 arms export licenses,
*  which have been suspended out of about 300 arms sales, arms licenses to Israel. So they've
*  suspended about 10%. And specifically, it excludes components for Israel's F-35 fighters, which are
*  raining down death and destruction on the people of Gaza, with 15% of every F-35 fighter's components
*  being made here in the UK. Now, this genocide has been going on now for 11 months. The new government
*  has been in place now for two months. And while any move in this particular direction is welcome,
*  and it is down to pressure that people like you have put on the government, and it is the first
*  time that the British government has essentially officially come out and tacitly accepted that it
*  is likely that Israel is committing war crimes, it is not good enough. Before this announcement,
*  Britain was facilitating genocide. After this announcement, Britain is still facilitating
*  genocide. We should set the bar higher than not facilitating genocide quite as much as before.
*  It's predictably not gone down well with Israel, who nonetheless regard anything but outright
*  cheerleading for its genocide or rampage as unacceptable. A senior Israeli official has
*  told the Telegraph that Israel is furious, boo hoo hoo, and called it a reward for Hamas.
*  They say it's a miserable and insensitive decision which comes the same day as we bury
*  hostages executed by Hamas. Hostages which would have been rescued if Netanyahu had agreed a peace
*  deal, which he's refused to do because he's determined to continue his genocide or rampage.
*  I'm sorry Israel, but Palestinian families are burying their dead every single day.
*  Loved ones, you slaughtered. Including in mass graves, including in unmarked graves,
*  indeed thousands who haven't even been able to bury their relatives. Their remains are buried
*  under the rubble or eaten by the starving cats and dogs of Gaza. And in some cases,
*  there's no relatives to bury these people because every single member of particular families have
*  been exterminated. Entire families, every single generation, every single individual, eliminated,
*  exterminated, physically liquidated, wiped from the civil registry forever. Let's listen to David
*  Labbie. Taking office in July, I told this house that this government's priority in the region
*  would be to advance the cause of peace. And this continues to be our mission on every front.
*  In Israel, in the West Bank, in Lebanon, in the Red Sea, and of course in Gaza, where we need an
*  immediate ceasefire. The protection of civilians, the immediate release of all hostages, and more
*  aid getting into Gaza. Empty, vacuous rhetoric here. The Israelis say only understands actions,
*  not words, and the least we should expect in these circumstances are sanctions against Israel,
*  not constantly looking for mere scraps and platitudes and empty rhetoric. The Israeli people
*  still living under rocket fire, not only from Hamas, but from other hostile actors explicitly
*  dedicated to Israel's annihilation. Fighting an enemy in Hamas whose appalling tactics endanger
*  countless civilian lives. And the innocent Palestinians, tens of thousands killed in the
*  fighting, their numbers growing by the day, including distressing numbers of women and children,
*  many mothers so malnourished they cannot produce milk for their babies,
*  families struggling to keep their children alive, disease and famine looming ever larger.
*  This is just grotesque. We hear Hamas and indeed other Palestinian armed groups held to account by
*  the Foreign Secretary for their violence, but not a single attempt to hold Israel to account for the
*  far, far, far, far graver and deadlier atrocities committed by Israel. Listening to him, you would
*  think that the Palestinian people are simply suffering at the hands of a tragic natural
*  disaster. Throughout my life, I have been a friend of Israel, a liberal progressive Zionist who
*  believes in Israel as a democratic state and a homeland for the Jewish people, which has both
*  the right to exist and defend itself. But I believe also that Israel will only exist in safety and
*  security if there is a two state solution that guarantees the rights of all Israeli citizens
*  and their Palestinian neighbours who have their own inalienable right to self-determination and
*  security. Well, interesting timing there to call yourself a friend of Israel and to whitewash
*  Israel's reputation as it practices apartheid, which it was doing long before it was committing
*  genocide in the form it's taking place currently in Gaza. A state which subjects so many Palestinians
*  to illegal occupation and illegal land theft for illegal colonisation as the International Court
*  of Justice, the world's highest court recently ruled, has no right to call itself democratic.
*  It is no such thing. And this government is also deeply concerned by credible claims of mistreatment
*  of detainees, which the International Committee of the Red Cross cannot investigate after being
*  denied access to places of detention. Both my predecessor and all our major allies have repeatedly
*  and forcefully raised these concerns with the Israeli government. Regrettably, they have not
*  been addressed satisfactorily. Let's just be clear here. There is overwhelming evidence of sadistic
*  torture and rape and countless Palestinian detainees being tortured to death, including
*  doctors. Israeli soldiers were caught on film gang raping a detainee. Even pro-Israel media
*  organisations like CNN and the New York Times have printed overwhelming evidence about Palestinian
*  detainees being raped. We have countless testimonies about the depravity going on
*  in Israeli detention, including thousands of Palestinians who are held without charge,
*  who have done nothing other than being guilty of being Palestinian, and who are being tortured
*  in the most depraved ways possible, including being raped.
*  Where's their mention? I've been clear from the start. The taking of hostages,
*  including by Hamas, is a serious war crime. There was never any justification for war crimes
*  to only talk in these terms about the war crimes of Hamas and other armed groups, and not to talk
*  about the war crimes being committed by the Israeli state with the complicity of the British
*  government tells its own story. Now, talking about these claims being merely credible without
*  detailing what they actually are, because this is the point. He talks about the credibility of these
*  allegations, as I suppose that's what they're talking about in detention. There is overwhelming
*  evidence. So if you can condemn Hamas and hold them responsible, why can't you talk in the same
*  terms about Israel? Where is the fiery condemnation of the crimes committed by the Israeli state,
*  for which there is overwhelming evidence? And if you deny them, you're an atrocity denier.
*  But no such thing. Only the fiery condemnation that comes to Hamas, the far worse war crimes committed
*  by Israel with our, well, the British government's complicity. No such thing, just talking about how
*  that there isn't satisfactory responses to what's going on. There can be no doubt that Hamas pays not
*  the slightest heed to international humanitarian law, and endangers civilians by embedding itself
*  in the tightly concentrated civilian population and in civilian infrastructure. There is no
*  equivalence between Hamas, terrorists and Israel's democratic government, or indeed Iran and their
*  partners and proxies. But to license arms exports to Israel, we must assess their compliance with
*  international humanitarian law, notwithstanding the abhorrence of their opponents tactics and ideology.
*  Well, I'm going to be clear, there's no question Hamas has committed war crimes for which there is
*  Israel has committed far worse war crimes. It is committing genocide. Its leaders
*  openly made clear from the start they had genocidal intentions. So let's not even indulge the
*  Israel has huge world superiority over Hamas shtick. It is bollocks, total and utter bollocks.
*  There can be no doubt that Hamas pays not the slightest heed to international humanitarian law,
*  and endangers civilians by embedding itself in the tightly concentrated civilian population
*  and in civilian infrastructure. There is no equivalence between Hamas, terrorists
*  and Israel's democratic government, or indeed Iran and their partners and proxies.
*  But to license arms exports to Israel, we must assess their compliance with international
*  humanitarian law, notwithstanding the abhorrence of their opponents tactics and ideology.
*  Third, this is not a blanket ban. This is not an arms embargo. It targets around 30, approximately
*  a 350 licenses to Israel in total for items which could be used in the current conflict in Gaza.
*  Well, he makes clear that no arms embargo in Israel, making it clear that the UK will continue
*  arming a state which is currently responsible for the worst rate of killing since the Rwandan
*  genocide of 1994. The rest, he says, will continue. So it's very clear the UK will keep arming
*  this genocide, just not quite the same rate. Now look, Labour came under pressure, not least
*  because it lost support to the Greens and Independents and only won the election because
*  of the Tory collapse and the Reform Party winning support at the expense of the Conservatives. This
*  is not good enough and we have to renew the pressure on them. It is my view that the British
*  politicians of both main parties are complicit in genocide. And my view is several of them
*  should go to jail. There is no graver crime than genocide and all those complicit must face justice.
*  That includes members of the current British government and a Prime Minister who uses,
*  who used his public constitutional position as leader of the opposition to endorse Israel's
*  right to commit war crimes, which he then tries to gaslight his own believing that he never believed,
*  helping to provide cover at the most crucial moment at the time in the Western world for Israel's
*  genocide. They're trying to ask over here and I honestly think they have one eye on the future,
*  given the scale of the crime that has been committed and is being committed.
*  That if they do something, however tokenistic, that one day in their later lives where they go
*  on holiday somewhere, they won't end up being arrested for the war crimes which they're complicit.
*  But it's up to us to make sure they face justice for what they have done and what they continue to
*  do. Please like and subscribe, do leave your comments, your thoughts, love to hear them as
