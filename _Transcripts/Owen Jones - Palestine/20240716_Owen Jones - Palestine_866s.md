Video Description: Former Tory minister Alan Duncan was smeared after denouncing the role of Israel's cheerleaders in British politics - but today has been vindicated in full.

I speak to him about what happened to him - but also what this means about efforts to drive British politics to champion the Israeli state's interests at the exclusion of peace, international law - and the Palestinian people.

# Tory Told TRUTH On Israel - And Was Smeared And Vindicated. Now He Speaks Out. w. Alan Duncan
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [July 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbwpURVQZw4)
*  He's a conservative former minister who speaks sense on the question of Israel and Palestine.
*  Not words, you'd probably expect me to say, but it is true in this case.
*  Now this interview I'm about to do is very important, but first a bit of context.
*  Sir Alan Duncan, who I'm going to speak to, is a former conservative minister in the
*  International Development Office and the Foreign Office, and he was smeared and then had his name
*  vindicated. In April, he made some important comments on LBC, which led to the conservative
*  party taking action against him. Let's have a listen firstly to this clip from that interview.
*  No lies detected there. Now let's listen to this next clip.
*  Well, do you agree with your own party's policy? Do you condemn illegal settlements?
*  And I will name them now. The conservative friends of Israel have been doing the bidding of Netanyahu
*  by passing all proper processes of government to exercise undue influence at the European Parliament.
*  So what you have is a lot of people now sitting around Rishi Sunak who are giving him appalling
*  advice. Let's start with the head of CFI, or has been for many years, Lord Pollack. In my view, I think he should be removed from the Lords because he is exercising the interests of another country.
*  Not that of the parliament in which he sits. Joined, I have to say, by Lord Pickles. They're the sort of Laurel and Hardy who should be pushed out together.
*  Now it was then announced that the conservative party had placed Alan Duncan under investigation,
*  while the tragically misnamed campaign against anti-Semitism, which spends much of his time conflating the very
*  real and growing evil of anti-Semitism with critique of the state of Israel, denounced him for invoking classic anti-Semitic tropes in their words.
*  Well, Alan Duncan was today vindicated in full. An investigation panel found that his comments did not go beyond political debate,
*  and that he was not a political figure. He was a political figure who was not a political figure.
*  Well, I'm very pleased to discuss this with Sir Alan, as well as the murkiness surrounding the investigation to what he said.
*  I'm very interested to find out more about those who are promoting the interests of the state of Israel, how they operate.
*  Let's have a listen to what Alan has to say.
*  What the hell is going on?
*  Well, it was an attempt to silence me with basically a smear, working behind the scenes without being open,
*  bypassing all proper processes, which is what they've been doing in government for years.
*  And so I was very happy to be part of this group.
*  I was very happy to be part of the group, and I was very happy to be part of the group.
*  It's a very good group, and I'm very happy to be part of it.
*  I've been part of the government for years.
*  And so what happened was I heard from a journalist that I'd been subjected to disciplinary proceedings, which could lead to expulsion.
*  No one had told me.
*  And the next thing I know, I've got to defend what was a very vague accusation of antisemitism.
*  But they wouldn't send me the complaint or who the complainant was.
*  Anyway, a few months later, after I spent a few thousand quid defending myself and saying why I am not antisemitic,
*  why all I'm doing is defending international law and indeed government policy,
*  I've just been told by the party that the panel, all credit to them, the panel are fine, said,
*  there's nothing antisemitic here.
*  There's no case to answer.
*  Everything he said was perfectly legitimate political comment.
*  And then when you read it further, it says, actually, there wasn't a complaint.
*  The Conservative Party itself had decided to become the complainant.
*  That's why they could never send me a copy of the complaint because there wasn't one.
*  Is that even part of the rules?
*  I'm slightly confused about how that's even possible.
*  No, no, it's not even.
*  Well, I mean, they broke the rules in many things about deadlines and notifications and all sorts of stuff,
*  not sending me the complaint, not saying what clause of the code of conduct I was supposed to have breached.
*  So I was rather in the dark about what it was I was having to defend, except that every website in the world said that I'd been accused of antisemitism.
*  And was going to be expelled from the party.
*  So now it turns out that really people at the top of the party, I suspect one or two sitting in the cabinet who had the ear of Rishi Sunay decided to try and force me into submission on this.
*  And the panel have said everything I said was perfectly OK.
*  So I think we need to know what was going on behind the bike sheds here.
*  So I think this is a good example of conflation.
*  And there is an antisemitic trope of shadowy Jewish influence behind the scenes, which is what they were trying to conflate with what you were talking about,
*  which was the role of the Israeli state, not the same as the Jewish people, and the role that it plays in British politics.
*  You're absolutely right. You are absolutely right.
*  And that conflation is very damaging both to our foreign policy, to rational thought, but in the end to the Jewish community in the UK,
*  because it makes people get very angry about them when the people who say, you know, I represent the Jewish community are in fact rather unpleasant in their vitriol,
*  but also apparently defending always a Jewish, not Jewish, Israeli extremism on the part of Netanyahu.
*  So that is what happened.
*  And this conflation so often by the Board of Deputies, campaign against antisemitism, conservative friends of Israel is a constant error on their part,
*  which I think distorts argument and is in logical terms unacceptable.
*  Can you explain how this works?
*  When we talk about conservative friends of Israel, there's Labour friends of Israel as well.
*  How, what's the influence that they exercise?
*  And do we know about what their formal links are with the state of which they are saying they are the friends on?
*  Oh, yeah, there's no doubt that Stuart Pollack, you know, is very, very close to Netanyahu, has been for 25 years.
*  I've even met Netanyahu with him when I was shadow foreign minister.
*  But I know exactly, and some of it was in my book, how he uses his influence and the power of donor money to phone straight into number 10,
*  bypassing the Foreign Office, say, no, this is what we want.
*  Then you've got complicit people at the top of the party.
*  Oliver Dalden, for instance, as deputy prime minister, was an obvious name.
*  Some of them have been chucked out of the recent election.
*  But it means that on things like making policy such as the boycott and divestment bill, where Michael Goh, similar sort of mindset,
*  put in a bill that basically you can't, as a local authority, say you're going to boycott illegal goods from Palestinian settlements.
*  So that's in conflict with our law.
*  Likewise, you know, trying to prescribe certain organizations, all sorts of other things in their interest.
*  They pedal and push going behind the scenes, but also it bypasses the Foreign Office and is a disgrace.
*  And let me give you a classic example.
*  Priti Patel, as Secretary of State for International Development, went to Israel, didn't tell her officials as a breach of the ministerial code.
*  We don't know who paid for it. That's a breach of all rules.
*  Had meetings with the prime minister, didn't tell the local ambassador and Stuart Pollack was at all the meetings.
*  This is suborning our proper politics.
*  If I was going to do devil's advocate for the Conservative Party, weird, surreal moment for all of us, they'd go, look, this is conviction.
*  We just, all of this happens because this is what we happen to believe.
*  We're passionate supporters of the state of Israel.
*  And so what would your response be in terms of how is it in terms of influence, which actually shifts conservative policy above and beyond what an ideological commitment would do instead?
*  Every single Foreign Office questions or what we used to have as development questions, the tame sort of team had questions which had pretty well been drafted by the Israeli embassy.
*  That's an example.
*  All of the trips to Israel, you know, follow the money.
*  The fact that then afterwards people tend to be, you know, quiet, anything for a quiet life.
*  Having been there and having received a very distorted view of Israeli history and Israeli politics.
*  And the fact is, I think that the Pollack and Pickles attitude is unquestioningly in defense of Netanyahu and the extreme sides of Israel, which in my view is not mainstream Israel.
*  In my view, mainstream Israel is far more moderate.
*  It's also true of the Palestinians.
*  And that's one of the reasons we had October the 7th is that all the moderates were squeezed out.
*  Then you end up with a clash of extremes, which is an absolute tragedy.
*  Are there conservative politicians that you know as a fact are scared to speak out because of the consequences that might happen if they spoke out on this question?
*  Oh, yeah. I mean, many, and many of them just say, you know, I don't want to take the flag.
*  I just know that, you know, if I do this, I'll get tweeted against that suddenly get some vicious letters in my in my inbox, you know, all of that.
*  And they just say, it's not my fight.
*  I'm just not going to bother.
*  So they get squashed out.
*  But worse is the influence at the very top.
*  I mean, did Rishi Sunak know anything about this issue?
*  Really? Does he?
*  Did he really take an interest in the Middle East?
*  No, just took the script and caved in.
*  Just a couple of final things.
*  I mean, what do you think in terms of the Labour government?
*  We have a Labour government, but we also have Labour friends of Israel.
*  We also have I mean, you know, there's someone, you know, we have people who've been, Luke Geykirsch is now the MP for North Durham.
*  He was the former head of We Believe Israel, which is a vehemently pro-Israel group, uncritical supporter of Israel.
*  He plays a very prominent role in the Labour Party.
*  I don't expect you to know the internal machinations of the Labour Party.
*  I just know as a long-experienced parliamentarian and you do know MPs on all sides of the House, what kind of influence do you think is being exerted in the new government with kind of continuity?
*  No, it is there.
*  And there's quite a lot that's there.
*  And of course, there's the fallout from the whole Jeremy Corbyn issue, which, you know, is parked about to one side at the moment.
*  So there are pressures on Kier Starmer.
*  On the other hand, he's appointed, I think, encouragingly Richard Helmer as attorney general.
*  I think there's some very good people around.
*  He'll be slightly worried looking over his shoulder at five pro-Gaza MPs and other opinion within his own party.
*  But all of that really doesn't matter compared with what international law is, what principle is, and what our historic obligation is to fulfill the other half of the Balfour Declaration.
*  So I think we should not be afraid in the months remaining before the American election to make our view clear, even though now it probably looks as though it's going to be Trump and so people will probably be more cautious.
*  I nonetheless think that the UK should make a principled stand and restore some self-respect because our reputation in the region has hit rock bottom.
*  And just very finally, what would your recommendations be based on your own experiences of how we stop, well, it's not, I mean, you could say it's any power.
*  I mean, other powers also try to exert influence.
*  It's not specific to Israel, but we're talking about Israel here.
*  How do we stop the state of Israel having undue influence within our politics in a way which is trying to shift British foreign policy favorably in favor of Israel at the expense of the Palestinian people and international law and, of course, peace?
*  I think the leaders of both main parties need to make a principled stand and say settlements are illegal.
*  Israel is Israel.
*  That's fine.
*  But get out of Palestine because it's not your country.
*  So go back to those first principles.
*  I would also recognize a Palestinian state because once it's done, it's done.
*  And if we do it now, then Trump can't make us undo it.
*  But we also have to reawaken some intellectual thinking on what the solution could be because, I mean, 20 years on from when I first said there are too many settlers in the West Bank, it's gone up for my head.
*  20,000 to 500,000 or more.
*  So the 500,000 people who should be being moved are not those starved people in Gaza.
*  It's the illegal occupants of the West Bank.
*  But the facts on the ground are now tough because moving them out is going to be difficult.
*  So how can you have a two state solution?
*  So we've got to be realistic about whether a two state solution is any longer possible.
*  And if it's not, then we have to change the whole rhetoric and policy.
*  So some intellectual honesty is long overdue.
*  Alan, really fascinating stuff.
*  You have been vindicated.
*  You were put through the ringer.
*  It can't have been pleasant.
*  It never is this sort of thing.
*  But you should be rightly vindicated and your name completely cleared.
*  And I hope it encourages other people, regardless of their political affiliation, to speak out because she well, lives are at stake, peace is at stake.
*  For those watching, please like and subscribe and leave your comments.
*  We'd love to hear your thoughts as ever.
*  But Alan, thank you so, so much.
*  Really appreciate it.
*  Thank you.
