# Gideon Levy EXPOSES Israeli "Barbarism" - Israel's Most Courageous Journalist On Israel's Crimes
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [December 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc)
*  Now, I'm not going to do a long rambling introduction as I often do for Gideon Lavie, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=0.0s)]
*  he doesn't really need an introduction. Harret's writer, extraordinarily courageous, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=4.48s)]
*  morally courageous Israeli journalist who has spoken the truth throughout the horrors, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=10.72s)]
*  not just since 7th October, but long before then. We've got so much to speak about. Gideon, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=16.16s)]
*  it's great to see you again. How are you? Thank you, Warren. It's a great pleasure to be with [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=21.36s)]
*  you again. I just want to start, actually. It's been a while since we spoke. And in that time, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=25.44s)]
*  you could forgive, well, is that the right word? You could see why the Israeli state is in a state [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=32.56s)]
*  of triumphalism, that it will brush aside the likes of me and you who will rage against the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=38.8s)]
*  horror, the outrage, the criminality of its behaviour, but look at the landscape, its enemies [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  in chaos, in collapse, and feel a sense of vindication and triumphalism. What do you think [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=52.08s)]
*  about that? Is that a fair assessment of where they're at, I would say? And how much is that [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=58.4s)]
*  hubris or accurate? It's a very good point because after the fall of Assad in Syria, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=65.12s)]
*  the point you raise now is even much stronger because all of a sudden Israel and Netanyahu [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=75.52s)]
*  and the right-winger can present a whole row of achievements when they show Hamas was beaten, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=82.16s)]
*  Hezbollah was beaten, now Syria is beaten, Iran is the next one, Iran is much weaker already by now. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=91.44s)]
*  By now, all the wars were justified. It is a challenge, but first of all, we are in a certain [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=98.88s)]
*  stage in time in which things are really not so clear. You know, what seems now as a big [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  achievement can turn into a terrible catastrophe very soon. Secondly, even if there are achievements, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=116.24s)]
*  none of them justify the price. None of them justify the violation of morality, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=124.96s)]
*  of international law. None of them justify the barbarism in Gaza. None of them, by all means. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=132.0s)]
*  And therefore, even if people think that now people like me should learn the lesson and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=140.64s)]
*  draw the conclusions, no, there are no conclusions to draw. What was a crime [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  until one year ago is still a crime and what is barbarism is still barbarism and 1,000 babies [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=153.68s)]
*  under the age of one year are a crime which nobody can justify even if Israel achieved, I don't know [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=162.08s)]
*  what. And therefore, I stand solid in the same place. Since we spoke, we've had the International [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=170.96s)]
*  Criminal Court finally issue arrest warrants against Benjamin Netanyahu and his former [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=181.04000000000002s)]
*  defence minister, Yov Galan, for war crimes and crimes against humanity. There's reasons to believe [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=186.16s)]
*  those charges will extend and they may well go on to apply to other Israeli figures. They may not [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=192.4s)]
*  be public. There's no compulsion. There's no necessity for the ICC to publicly declare [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=200.4s)]
*  those arrest warrants. I mean, they could have done that with Benjamin Netanyahu and Yov Galan. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=208.48000000000002s)]
*  They could have done that privately if they so chose. What do you think the significance of that [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=212.32s)]
*  has been? I mean, in terms of the response from the Israeli state, do you think that's indicative [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=216.0s)]
*  of, you know, in terms of this has consequences as far as they see it in terms of Israeli impunity? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  Has it made any difference domestically? What's your thoughts? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=225.76s)]
*  No, there are no immediate consequences. Israel, like Israel, reacted with a clear blame at the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=230.0s)]
*  International Criminal Court as an anti-Semitic organ. Donald Trump is around the corner [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=240.48s)]
*  threatening that he will not let it happen and he might be capable of really destroying the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=248.07999999999998s)]
*  International Criminal Court. So Israel is still in its point, but it has an effect. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=254.24s)]
*  Not an immediate one, not a totally declared one, but it has an effect. When the Israeli Prime [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=265.52s)]
*  Minister cannot go anywhere except of United States and maybe Micronesia, then Israel has a [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=272.8s)]
*  problem and it starts to penetrate. It's also much broader than this because there were some [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=281.36s)]
*  rumors that any soldier is now called back, if you were any soldier who was documented in Gaza, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=291.2s)]
*  and when the broad might face charges in many countries now and they even according to what [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=298.8s)]
*  was published here, some of them were really called home immediately. This is a process, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=308.88000000000005s)]
*  it's not a one day that people will realize that we did terrible things. It will take some time, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=316.8s)]
*  but it is starting and I feel it because this sense of we are the most moral army in the world [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=325.20000000000005s)]
*  became already a joke. Nobody in Israel believes in it anymore. It will take some more time, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=336.08s)]
*  it will take some more measures until Israelis will understand that only blaming the world [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=343.44s)]
*  does not lead them to the truth and the truth is that instead of blaming the world they should [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=351.04s)]
*  look upon themselves and look what we have done in this year in Gaza before we blame the whole world [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=356.88s)]
*  and Hamas and the ICC and the EU and everyone. It will take time, but I can clearly feel a [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=364.48s)]
*  beginning of a change. That's interesting and that's new I have to say when we've had these [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=375.68s)]
*  conversations. You mentioned the number of Palestinian babies in Gaza who've been killed, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=381.20000000000005s)]
*  which is around the same number of total Israeli civilians who were killed on the 7th of October, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=385.68s)]
*  the best part of a thousand babies killed. We don't know the exact number. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=390.56s)]
*  Under one year old, under one year, because babies can be also two years and three years. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=395.35999999999996s)]
*  We are speaking about babies under one year, imagine yourself. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=401.28s)]
*  Infants. What you just said there made me think of an article in the newspaper you write for [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=405.28s)]
*  Haaretz which was written by Yasmin Levy and it was headlined in a rare break from self-censorship [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=411.59999999999997s)]
*  Israelis got to watch Gaza horrors on their screens. A CNN report from Gaza played on [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=418.0s)]
*  Israel's channel 13 showed starving women being crushed by desperate masses, but in Israel people [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=423.12s)]
*  are still shocked by ethnic cleansing accusations. Yasmin Levy was exploring what you were talking [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=428.48s)]
*  about there. She goes on to say Israeli television has kept all this off air, not because of [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=434.16s)]
*  censorship voluntarily, but she said that's catering to an audience and there are courageous [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=442.64s)]
*  Israelis like you and her, but people can use the internet. What you said there was you can [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=449.76s)]
*  detect a change though. Is that example where we saw some horror in Gaza actually on the Israeli [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=455.76s)]
*  television screen extremely rare for those who don't watch Israeli television, you normally [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=462.15999999999997s)]
*  don't see people suffering on Israeli television in Gaza, it's normally buildings being blown up [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=466.88s)]
*  and so on. Do you think people are? Is there a sense of amongst people who acquiesce [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=470.56s)]
*  or even enthusiastic, what is the change? It's the beginning of a change. It will not be felt [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=477.28000000000003s)]
*  in what Israel is doing. I don't think that Israel is more careful now in Gaza, by all means not [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=488.56s)]
*  and we shouldn't have any illusions that this is a short process. It's a very long process because [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=495.12s)]
*  we are facing an enormous challenge, not only brainwash of decades, but also the 7th of October [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=501.84000000000003s)]
*  and for the Israelis the 7th of October is an excuse for anything, still anything justifies [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=510.88s)]
*  vis-a-vis the 7th of October. Therefore I wouldn't be too optimistic, but you can feel the first [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=519.52s)]
*  signs and I always knew that it will take some time. First there will be the first reaction is [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=528.2399999999999s)]
*  always blaming the other, like babies by the way. If a child falls down he immediately blames the parents [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=535.1199999999999s)]
*  or anyone who is around him first will blame the whole world, then we will say it's all lies, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=541.12s)]
*  then we will say that it's exaggerated, then they will say that Yemen is worse and Sudan is worse, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=549.76s)]
*  but you know finally they will have to face the truth if they want it or not because it is in their [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=558.88s)]
*  face by the whole world now and if the ICC will continue, which is also questionable, how far will [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=566.96s)]
*  they go? Then I think the total victimization of Israel will change gradually and only by part of [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=576.0s)]
*  the population, not by all Israelis, no way, but at least by those who were part of the peace camp [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=585.9200000000001s)]
*  until the 7th of October at least they will realize that something horrible happened in Gaza [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=595.12s)]
*  and we take responsibility for this. We are responsible for it, not only happened but still [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=602.08s)]
*  happening by the time we are talking now. Only today there were dozens killed in Gaza and every [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=609.52s)]
*  day dozens are killed in Gaza without any purpose, nothing. What you said there reminded me of what [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=615.6s)]
*  the Palestinian-Canadian lawyer, Diana Butu said, she's based in Haifa, she said that nothing [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=623.68s)]
*  as far as the narrative goes, nothing justifies the 7th of October but anything can be justified [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=631.52s)]
*  by the 7th of October and that's the mentality you're talking about. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=637.68s)]
*  Absolutely, absolutely. Israelis feel first of all they have no interest in Palestine, in Gaza, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=641.68s)]
*  in Palestinians, in humanity, in anything because they feel they are the victims and the only [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=647.92s)]
*  victims. Secondly they think that Israel has the right to defend itself and by the framework of [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=653.36s)]
*  defending itself they think that everything is self-defense. Killing 1,000 infants is self-defense, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=660.88s)]
*  sure. Do you know any other way to self-defend yourself if not by killing babies who were just [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=668.08s)]
*  born or women or children or civilians or anyone? So therefore I say the challenge is so big [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=674.88s)]
*  the Israeli media is betraying its mission so much so you really need to work very hard and to be [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=683.36s)]
*  very patient but I truly believe that the change will come because you see the first cracks now. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=692.16s)]
*  On that, I mean the Hebrew version of Haaretz your newspaper published a testimony of an Israeli [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=700.72s)]
*  soldier named Chaim Hazahav who served in Gaza and he wrote and I'll quote, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=706.72s)]
*  a human life in the Gaza Strip is worth less than the lives of the thousands of stray dogs that roam [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=714.08s)]
*  the area looking for food. While there is a clear order prohibiting shooting dogs unless a soldier [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=718.64s)]
*  is in real danger when the dog's jaws are locked on him, humans are permitted to be shot without [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=724.24s)]
*  any real restrictions except for the personal moral boundaries of the soldier holding the weapon. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=730.08s)]
*  So he's setting out there that Israeli engagement policy is that a civilian life is worth less than [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=737.28s)]
*  a stray dog. So here it is important to know also who is fighting it and Chaim Hazahav is not a [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=746.0s)]
*  political figure, not a leftist, total mainstream. He works in one of the Israeli TV channels as a [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=755.28s)]
*  producer, as an editor, not very well known, not well known at all I guess, but you have to take [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=764.64s)]
*  his word because he was there. Unlikely all the deniers he was there. Now he wrote it in a very [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=771.92s)]
*  low key way which also gave it a lot of strength. He didn't give any adjectives, he just described [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=780.08s)]
*  what he and his fellow soldiers are doing on a daily basis in Gaza. He was there for 85 days, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=791.1199999999999s)]
*  he knows. Again it was published only in Haaretz, it didn't create any attention, public attention [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=799.52s)]
*  unfortunately. I wrote the other day that this text should be taught in any high school and in [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=809.1199999999999s)]
*  any army unit in Israel. If Israel would have been really a democratic country which wants to [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=816.56s)]
*  follow the international law, but that's not the case. But again that's another sign of [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=825.04s)]
*  first cracks because to deny Chaim Hazahav is impossible. He was there. It's not me who hates [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=831.52s)]
*  Israel as they say, that is a self-hating Jew and everything. That's an ordinary soldier who writes [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=838.4s)]
*  his memories and that's enough for any normal situation. But Israel is not in a normal situation [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=845.28s)]
*  and therefore it's not enough, but it's a beginning. He says in it anyone who wants to kill Arabs [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=852.4s)]
*  because there are Arabs will indeed kill Arabs and no one will ask him questions, interrogate [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=858.4s)]
*  him or punish him. Basically his analysis was whether you live or die, if you're pouncing [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=862.24s)]
*  civilian depends on the whims of whoever happens to be holding the gun at that time. He notes an [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=868.4s)]
*  invisible line drawn across Gaza, separating the north and the south. Palestinians can only work [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=873.68s)]
*  out where that line is when they're shot dead the moments before they're killed and then they're [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=880.0s)]
*  classed as terrorists. I guess that goes to show what he was alluding to is the official statistics [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=885.8399999999999s)]
*  of terrorist kills. He's saying well these are often, who knows? He says maybe it's in one case [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=891.12s)]
*  it's a Hamas militant looking for intelligence and another it's just a civilian looking for their [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=897.1999999999999s)]
*  possessions at home crossing a line they don't even know exists. So I mean I guess it shows [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=901.36s)]
*  how terrorist is used as classification he really debunks. And he's a real mainstreamer, this must [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=905.92s)]
*  be emphasized, really mainstream who never wrote anything. I don't remember him ever expressing [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=913.68s)]
*  himself about peace and war and occupation and apartheid, maybe he did but I never heard him [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=922.16s)]
*  talking about it and therefore it was so powerful. The next day, the next day we had a huge peace [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=928.96s)]
*  which I think was translated into English I hope at least of an Israeli historian who collected [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=937.6800000000001s)]
*  thousands of evidences, thousands of evidences of war crimes. It's the biggest archive of war crimes [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=945.6800000000001s)]
*  again a mainstream historian from the university. So you see day by day it's a very specific process [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=956.64s)]
*  but I still believe that finally Israelis will have no other choice but to admit [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=967.28s)]
*  but it will take more time at least those who is conscious. There are those who are the Arab haters [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=974.56s)]
*  the racist they will never whatever if Israel will open extermination camps they will say [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=980.48s)]
*  they will justify find some justification. I mean there is this part of Israeli society which will [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=990.24s)]
*  never never see anything wrong in what Israel is doing but there is still there are people [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=996.24s)]
*  with conscience in Israel who were just very brainwashed and very hurt from the 7th of October [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1003.76s)]
*  and they think unfortunately that the 7th of October gives them the right both to ignore the [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1013.04s)]
*  crimes and to justify. So just that historian you mentioned just so everyone knows is Lee Mordecai [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1020.56s)]
*  who I've interviewed actually on this channel. He's a very courageous, very somber, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1027.04s)]
*  you know very calm voice who's very clinically and I say this in a positive way drawn together [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1031.44s)]
*  a whole archive of war crimes which have been committed. It's an invaluable piece of work that [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1038.88s)]
*  he's put together. I do want to ask you about Haaretz because I keep citing Haaretz and the [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1043.92s)]
*  government is taking action against Haaretz and that's to do with basically money which is all [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1048.96s)]
*  Israeli newspapers is common in other countries through advertisements and so on from public [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1055.76s)]
*  bodies the government that's an important part of revenue particularly when advertising revenue [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1062.4s)]
*  generally is in crisis. Can you just tell me what's I mean as much as you can I guess what [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1067.04s)]
*  that's what's going on there and what it signifies about the atmosphere in Israel at the moment? [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1072.4s)]
*  So we had the our adult at least by me adult publisher who said in a Haaretz conference [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1076.32s)]
*  in London that the the the Palestinian so-called terrorists are freedom fighters [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1089.4399999999998s)]
*  and this had blown a fire which was mainly among Haaretz readers there were many [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1100.5600000000002s)]
*  subscribers who cancelled their subscription and you know Haaretz is not very strong economically [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1110.96s)]
*  it's very fragile I mean newspapers all over are very fragile but Haaretz for sure is very fragile [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1118.48s)]
*  doesn't have a lot of reservoir both in terms of money but it's not only about money it's also [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1127.1200000000001s)]
*  about you know being hurt being red and then the government used this cynically obviously used this [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1133.84s)]
*  opportunity to get this resolution in the government which is I'm not sure it's legal at all [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1142.96s)]
*  it's being checked yet that the government will not subscribe on Haaretz imagine yourself all the [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1151.12s)]
*  Israeli ministers politicians bureaucrats soldiers will not read Haaretz I don't know how many of [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1159.28s)]
*  them are reading it but and and it's not an order I mean they can read it but you know I don't know [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1166.6399999999999s)]
*  to scale it in economical terms I know there is also a wave now of reaction I see I got it by [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1175.2s)]
*  myself a few emails by people who decided now I subscribe on Haaretz because Haaretz goes through [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1184.24s)]
*  this persecution so I hope it will somehow balance it balance Haaretz went through so many [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1191.44s)]
*  challenges throughout the years I hope it will overcome also this challenge [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1200.88s)]
*  but it never faced the challenge by the government in a very clear way and brutal way [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1204.96s)]
*  and this was never the case I'm in Haaretz for 40 years over 40 years and I never remember such a [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1212.8000000000002s)]
*  situation in which the government is declaring war on a newspaper but that's part of the strategy [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1220.8000000000002s)]
*  of the government they don't do it only against us they do it against anyone who dares to raise [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1227.92s)]
*  their voice they are having now a campaign against the public broadcast authority [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1233.8400000000001s)]
*  which they might also destroy [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1241.92s)]
*  I mean links are that I mean you know obviously Israel's self-description is often the only [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1246.64s)]
*  democracy in the Middle East and disregarding for a moment obviously the occupation of the [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1251.6000000000001s)]
*  Palestinians which is a despotism and you know there's no there's no consent there so [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1256.72s)]
*  that itself you know that's a pretty big disqualifier but Afa Kassif who is a [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1262.88s)]
*  a Jewish Israeli the one Jewish Israeli parliamentarian who's consistently spoken [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1270.96s)]
*  out about the Horengaza I'm interviewing him this week actually but there's action being [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1276.24s)]
*  taken against him there's the and the new election law being introduced to try and prevent [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1281.12s)]
*  people like him and Palestinian Israelis being elected I don't know if you could just briefly [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1287.76s)]
*  explain again about that and what that represents look it's in all fronts this government declared [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1292.3999999999999s)]
*  now an official war against all the democratic institutions all the gatekeepers one of them is [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1299.9199999999998s)]
*  obviously the the media other one is the the those who raise their voice in the parliament [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1309.28s)]
*  but when it comes to the Israeli Palestinian members of parliament what we call the Israeli Arabs [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1317.76s)]
*  here it has also another hidden goal because the left will never be able [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1325.12s)]
*  to have a majority without the Arab voters there are 20 percent of the of the voters in Israel [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1335.76s)]
*  and they want now to do whatever possible and they will succeed to exclude them from the Israeli [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1342.56s)]
*  democracy democracy I mean you cannot get closer to apartheid than this they will find all kind [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1349.44s)]
*  of covers for example the law that they are now a working on which will take the right to be a [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1358.96s)]
*  member of parliament if you ever expressed any kind of support privately publicly to any kind of [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1368.48s)]
*  terror organization now imagine yourself I mean which Palestinian didn't stay something of the [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1378.0s)]
*  right to struggle to resist the occupation that's the ABC of of any freedom fighter [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1387.6s)]
*  you have to challenge and resist the occupation and by the way by according to the international [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1398.32s)]
*  law you have the right to do so even in violence so anyone who will express something like this [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1403.9199999999998s)]
*  will not be in the parliament so you can imagine yourself what is well will it be and what parliament [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1411.68s)]
*  not that we are very far away from there from there but now it becomes officially and maybe [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1418.88s)]
*  this at least will portray Israel to the world because even now nobody what you quoted the only [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1425.76s)]
*  democracy in the middle east which was mentioned quite seriously until recently I don't think any [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1432.96s)]
*  serious person would use it now when all those legislations are going on I mean it is really a [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1439.76s)]
*  very sad joke but nothing but the joke to say even without the occupation not speaking about [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1446.4s)]
*  the fact that what kind of democracy is it when five million people have no rights whatsoever [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1452.96s)]
*  I never heard about such a democracy I mean you mentioned there the 20 of the population the [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1459.6s)]
*  Palestinian population of Israel do you have concerns about the direction of travel there [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1466.08s)]
*  I mean even years ago this was a Pew research sorry Pew research a thing like based in Washington [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1472.32s)]
*  and and they did face-to-face interviews with Israelis Jewish Israelis Palestinian Israelis [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1479.76s)]
*  but they found that half of the Jewish respondents at the time this back 2014 2015 thought that Arabs [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1486.0s)]
*  should be expelled or transferred from Israel so this is long before what we've seen in the last [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1493.92s)]
*  year or so and Israel Katz the current foreign minister um sorry defense minister he was foreign [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1499.44s)]
*  minister is now defense minister replace your gallon he said in May 2022 he said about [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1506.4s)]
*  Palestinians waving Palestinian flags yesterday I warned the Arab students who are flying Palestine [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1513.2s)]
*  flags at universities remember 48 remember our independence war and your Nakba don't stretch the [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1517.52s)]

*  what do you say I mean you hear that and this is I've just cited this is before 7th of October [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1528.72s)]
*  but do you worry do you worry about that direction in terms of now particularly the [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1534.0800000000002s)]
*  election law which should just looking to disenfranchise that population where [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1538.48s)]
*  the direction things are heading with that population whatever you describe was tripled [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1542.56s)]
*  after the 7th of October was intense in a way that you can't imagine yourself [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1551.2s)]
*  it's not only about declarations many of our taxi drivers are Israeli Palestinians [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1557.5200000000002s)]
*  for for your viewers and listeners just to explain the other I guess all of them know [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1566.16s)]
*  but still they are the Palestinians who live under the occupied or under the occupation the [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1571.5200000000002s)]
*  military occupation and 20 percent of the citizens of Israel are also Palestinians and they're [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1576.08s)]
*  supposed to have equal rights like any other Israeli many taxi drivers are Palestinians [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1581.6s)]
*  and recently in Israel you order your taxi through EPS and it gives you always the name of the driver [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1591.28s)]
*  and again gives you always the name of the driver who is coming to [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1603.2s)]
*  collect you and you can't believe how many Israelis wouldn't order a taxi if the name is [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1606.96s)]
*  an Arab name it's on a daily basis they look like they claim that I don't know how many at least half [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1615.92s)]
*  of the people wouldn't drive with an Arab taxi driver this worries me much more than the excitement [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1625.76s)]
*  of the politicians because this shows that it is already on the ground people who used to go to [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1633.04s)]
*  do shopping in the Israeli and Palestinians countries and towns don't then are afraid to go there even though [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1640.08s)]
*  the Israeli Arab population in this war was paralyzed paralyzed out of fear [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1649.12s)]
*  didn't say a word for sure didn't demonstrate did any terror obviously but people are scared and [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1657.6s)]
*  people are hating and this this division is is very hard to repair but yes I'm very worried [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1666.8s)]
*  I mean you wouldn't like to be a young student in Israeli in Israeli university if you are Palestinian [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1676.8799999999999s)]

*  one day I mean even my vision my dream about the one state solution [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1701.2s)]
*  this damage is irreversible might become irreversible [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1707.76s)]
*  with Syria we mentioned that briefly before I'm interested to know what you think you'd sum up [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1714.72s)]
*  the kind of dominant hegemonic Israeli establishment view on this in that do you think [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1721.2s)]
*  it's reasonable to say that actually there was more comfort with the status quo which was a [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1726.88s)]
*  fatally weakened Assad rather than what we have now which is up for grabs I guess potentially from [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1732.4s)]
*  the perspective of Israel and what do you think about the significance of the Israeli invasion [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1741.2800000000002s)]
*  and which was used to justify defending the Golan Heights which of course is a legally occupied [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1746.48s)]
*  territory which actually belongs to Syria but what's your thoughts on that I mean what do you [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1751.6000000000001s)]
*  think the kind of general Israeli view is on on the establishment level you know at the top I guess [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1755.6s)]
*  and in terms of what happens next and the significance of what is an invasion [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1761.6s)]
*  so I just finished a short time ago my piece for tomorrow dealing exactly with this [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1767.6799999999998s)]
*  look on one hand Israelis are very happy that we take this advantage to destroy the Syrian army [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1775.84s)]
*  so there will be no danger now nobody knows where is Syria aiming to there are some some signs [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1784.72s)]
*  which leave room for some kind of optimism the behavior of the of the rebels in the first two [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1796.0s)]
*  days is rather impressive it's not Iraq when they destroyed everything and killed everyone [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1804.32s)]
*  they seem at least until this moment they seem much more responsible than this [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1812.16s)]
*  when Syria is on its knees bleeding and traumatized from all those years of this [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1818.08s)]
*  tough dictatorship and feels that they are breathing some new air and there are many [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1828.72s)]
*  Syrians who feel so to go and to bomb to go and to conquer territory I'm not speaking about this [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1835.52s)]
*  elegance of violating the sovereignty of Syria for god's sake this is not Gaza that's a sovereign [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1845.68s)]
*  state what justification does Israel has now to to conquer parts of Syria [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1852.8s)]
*  it really reminds me of those birds eagles and others who would smell blood and death and come [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1860.16s)]
*  and eat the bodies of dead animals when they are on the ground helpless that's the way Israel is [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1872.0800000000002s)]
*  that's the way Israel is dealing now now I don't say maybe the the rebels will turn into an Al-Qaeda [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1885.2s)]
*  an Islamist terrible dangerous regime terrible for Syria and terrible for Israel [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1893.92s)]
*  and then what Israel had done until now at least in terms of destroying the weapons [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1903.92s)]
*  might turn out clever I'm not sure but not to give it a chance [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1909.2s)]
*  maybe this regime wants to open a new chapter maybe they look for a different Syria give them a chance [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1917.76s)]
*  offer your hand what do you have to lose by this they will say no okay no yes there is the question [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1927.04s)]
*  of the Golan Heights which is still occupied even though Israel had annexated and the United [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1936.16s)]
*  States had recognized it Donald Trump we should say but still yes to think I mean how aided can [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1941.52s)]
*  Israel become if every time that something happens in an Arab country Israel will come and bomb and [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1950.3200000000002s)]
*  conquer without any provocation in this case there is no provocation there's no seventh of October in [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1958.4s)]
*  the Golan Heights how are we planning to stay in this part of the world with so much hatred justified [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1964.64s)]
*  hatred toward us those Syrians who are trying now to build something what will they feel toward Israel [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1973.6000000000001s)]
*  and really can we live in this neighborhood with so much hatred that part of it is on our blame [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1981.6000000000001s)]
*  like now with Syria [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1989.2s)]
*  one thing is I just want to ask you about I mean someone might go I don't know how much does this [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1993.52s)]
*  matter but it's about Benjamin Netanyahu who became I would say quite a useful bogeyman [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=1997.8400000000001s)]
*  for lots of people and you know people could pretend all the horrors were down to Benjamin [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2003.2s)]
*  Netanyahu and just ignore the pronouncements of opposition leaders but I mean it is interesting [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2008.16s)]
*  isn't it in terms of him that after 7th of October he was seen as the walking dead politically [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2015.52s)]
*  speaking because clearly this had happened on his watch and yet now I mean he's flying high isn't he [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2021.2s)]
*  if there was an election he'd win wouldn't he most probably it's not so guaranteed but he has a good [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2030.48s)]
*  chance which is by itself amazing I mean I can't think in any other country about a politician who [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2038.64s)]
*  is responsible I'm not speaking about the corruption and the charges and the trial which by itself [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2046.3200000000002s)]
*  should bring to his resign I mean what does it mean that he goes now every day six hours a day [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2052.4s)]
*  to court for at least half a year now while Israel is in war I mean how will this work [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2059.52s)]
*  but someone who is responsible to this fiasco of the 7th of October how can he be still be popular [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2066.32s)]
*  in Israel and the answer is quite complex it has a lot to do with his personality and his appeal [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2074.32s)]
*  to the lower classes in Israel he continues to present the oppressed ones spiritual quest once [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2084.56s)]
*  he continues to present in their minds their own oppression because he presents himself now as a [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2093.44s)]
*  victim victim of the system victim of the of the deep state victim of everything of the legal system [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2100.56s)]
*  of the media everyone hates him everyone is trying to destroy him and people identify with him and he's [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2108.96s)]
*  a great rhetoric as you know and quite an impressive man and yes it's it's and still [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2117.36s)]
*  it's not a full explanation but what is important for me to stress is that and this should be repeated [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2127.04s)]
*  again and again outside please don't get wrong don't be wrong if Netanyahu will step down one [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2135.04s)]
*  way or the other the alternative will be better but not when it comes to questions of apartheid [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2143.28s)]
*  occupation war crimes of war remember this because I see already the disappointment they all support [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2151.28s)]
*  what's going on in Gaza there is not a single thing for statesmen in Israel who feel that what [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2160.88s)]
*  Israel is doing in Gaza is criminal not single one so things will be better but not much better [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2168.7999999999997s)]
*  when when he will be replaced and therefore I'm not part of this campaign just let us get rid of [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2178.16s)]
*  Netanyahu the demon and after him you know Israel will turn into this paradise [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2183.84s)]
*  the other thing I wanted to ask you about was Donald Trump we're almost exactly at the midpoint [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2192.64s)]
*  between him winning the election and the inauguration he's stuffed his team full of zealots [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2197.52s)]
*  including Christian fundamentalists who you know and it's very interesting because the most [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2205.6s)]
*  uncritically pro-Israel section of the American population are evangelical Christians very unlike [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2211.36s)]
*  Jewish Americans who 40 percent of Jewish Americans under 45 think Israel's committing genocide which [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2218.4s)]
*  is not the case with Christian evangelicals what do you think firstly just with Gaza I'm just [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2224.64s)]
*  interested I'll ask you about the West Bank afterwards but firstly just Gaza what do you think [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2230.4s)]
*  will happen there because there's some conflicting signs there's some of he's he wants to win in a [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2235.68s)]
*  sense of he can say you know he wants things to be wrapped up at the moment Israel is just blowing [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2241.6s)]
*  things up on an apocalyptic wasteland things with no military value slaughtering people as has [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2246.7999999999997s)]
*  happened from the start but with clearly no military purpose of any description it's just [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2253.6s)]
*  a slaughterhouse what do you think I mean then the other is him posting you know woe betide what [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2257.12s)]
*  Gaza if you don't release the hostages what's your sense of what he's likely do you think to do and [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2264.56s)]
*  what Israel's calculating Trump will let them do in Gaza first of all I'm not sure he knows where [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2270.56s)]
*  Gaza is and for sure is no clue what's going on there and the first question is will he [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2278.48s)]
*  decide over Gaza or or his team because his his team makes the biggest racist in Israel [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2288.4s)]
*  to look like liberals this is really a bunch of crazy people but really crazy people is ambassador [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2298.0s)]
*  to Israel I mean he went to the Joseph tomb in the middle of the night with the settlers [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2306.16s)]
*  things that only the most lunatic settlers would dare to do and all kind of things like this I [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2313.2799999999997s)]
*  believe that he will be the one who will decide and for him it seems there is one goal now to [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2319.92s)]
*  put an end to the war because that's a headache for him he doesn't want all this and here comes [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2328.24s)]
*  the one and only advantage of Donald Trump Benjamin Netanyahu is scared of him [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2334.24s)]
*  unlikely Biden who Netanyahu totally ignored unlikely Donald Trump who Netanyahu totally [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2341.2s)]
*  ignored and rightly so because they did nothing they only talked and helped Israel like no one [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2348.08s)]
*  else Donald Trump is someone that Netanyahu has and will have to listen he will not be able to [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2354.24s)]
*  ignore him and if Donald Trump will want this war to end and I must remind you that this end [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2363.44s)]
*  this war will end only when Israel will withdraw from the Gaza Strip which is totally unacceptable [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2369.92s)]
*  on Netanyahu but if Donald Trump will want it it will happen and therefore Netanyahu is very very [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2376.4s)]
*  nervous and careful about what to expect on the other hand you might expect that [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2385.6s)]
*  Donald Trump who has no interest whatsoever in international law human rights minorities [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2392.2400000000002s)]
*  Palestinians occupation apartheid nothing of this vocabulary he talks to him at all [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2399.6800000000003s)]
*  he might just say do whatever you want and exsane the west bank you said will return to the [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2409.84s)]
*  west bank stay in Gaza if it makes you more secure might also be the case so time will show [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2416.88s)]
*  I think my guess is that he will put an end to the war in gas but not much more than this [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2424.8s)]
*  it will be the deal the deal will be go out of Gaza and then exsane the west bank [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2432.6400000000003s)]
*  I mean that's something I was interested in that because that's that that's the argument I made [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2438.2400000000002s)]
*  after he was elected it would be the quid pro quo stop the Gaza stuff annex the west bank [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2442.56s)]
*  I mean this people have raised this but people knew I was speaking to you and they were really keen [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2447.7599999999998s)]
*  for your thoughts on that you've spent a lot of time in the west bank you've done a lot of work [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2452.08s)]
*  there and what I mean some might say if we're gonna frame this properly that in terms of the [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2455.2s)]
*  annexation of the west bank which has been you know the dream partly of a greater Israel that's [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2465.12s)]
*  obviously the first big part of that great Israel project they go well it's already de facto annexed [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2469.04s)]
*  anyway and actually could this rebound on Israel because if you annex it you can't claim there's [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2477.52s)]
*  no way of not pretending it's not an apartheid state you then have three million Palestinian [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2483.84s)]
*  people who are living without citizenship in Israel and Israel can't grant citizenship on [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2489.2799999999997s)]
*  its own terms to those three million Palestinians because then that is a massive demographic threat [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2496.8s)]
*  to the state of Israel as it's currently configured so how does that work because [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2502.88s)]
*  part of me thinks they're not that stupid unfortunately these people are not stupid [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2508.0s)]
*  they're extremely clever people and it seems to me that you know there's an attempt to terrorize [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2511.52s)]
*  the Palestinian population make life completely unbearable there so many of them will flee or [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2516.0800000000004s)]
*  maybe Gaza not quite in terms of obliterating the west bank presumably but you know that [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2520.2400000000002s)]
*  they can't allow the Palestinian population to remain there if they annex it what do you [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2527.1200000000003s)]
*  think will happen there in terms of an annexation and what that means for the Palestinian population [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2531.04s)]
*  throughout the years and still now unlikely many others I'm not threatened by the idea of annexation [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2536.48s)]
*  because the west bank was annexated long time ago go and see the green line is dead totally dead [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2546.0800000000004s)]
*  there is nothing remains of being not annexated the Israeli law anyhow is practiced in the west [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2554.7999999999997s)]
*  bank the apartheid is there with an exception without it when there are two villages and one [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2566.7999999999997s)]
*  village where Jews are living they have all the rights including the right to to elect [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2574.4s)]
*  to the parliament and to be elected and the next village the neighboring village has no rights and [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2580.96s)]
*  no resources this is the case for decades not only this it's not temporary anymore for many [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2586.16s)]
*  years we claim this is occupation but occupation is by definition a temporary phenomena by the [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2594.72s)]
*  international law you cannot call after 50 years you cannot call it military occupation it is [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2601.36s)]
*  already apartheid so the annexation doesn't frighten me because in any case I have the feeling [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2606.72s)]
*  that the occupation is irreversible Israel will never withdraw from the west bank and [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2613.4399999999996s)]
*  Israel will never evacuate the settlers and if this is the case let's get out of the closet [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2619.04s)]
*  let's come out and say now we annexate and we are in apartheid state officially [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2628.9599999999996s)]
*  according to our law according to the declaration of the state we define ourselves [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2635.6s)]
*  as an apartheid state and then we'll see how will the west continue to see Israel as the big darling [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2642.72s)]
*  of the west what will be the the palestinian the dream to transfer the palestinians will never [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2650.72s)]
*  succeed not only because they will always stick to the land not only because for decades this [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2658.96s)]
*  was the zionist dream and it never worked ever since the first nagba but there is also nowhere [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2666.96s)]
*  to send them nobody will accept them look now in Gaza Egypt says no if it would depend on Israel [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2672.88s)]
*  two million will would have been already in the Sinai desert but Egypt says no what is i cannot [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2680.48s)]
*  make a war against against Egypt now so it's not a realistic plan not to speak about the more [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2686.72s)]
*  and legal part of it but it's not realistic where will you send three million people Jordan will not [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2696.48s)]
*  open up to them so i think that we will get into a real apartheid state with all the problems of it [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2701.8399999999997s)]
*  and then it will depend on the international community will it read the second apartheid state [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2711.6s)]
*  as he treated the first apartheid state south africa and then it might be good news or [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2717.6s)]
*  israel will continue to be hugged by the world by the west supplied with all the arms and money and [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2724.72s)]
*  support and and diplomatic support and immunity and and and israel will continue as an official [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2731.76s)]
*  subpar apartheid state but i for me the annexation is not something that threatens me not at all [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2741.36s)]
*  i think it's actually a very wise assessment to be honest um thank you just just very finally very [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2751.0400000000004s)]
*  finally i normally try and end on a kind of hopeful note but actually kind of started there you gave [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2756.0s)]
*  a bit of hope early on so we've dealt with that this isn't a hopeful question i'm not quite sure [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2760.4s)]
*  actually how to frame it it's just something that's on my mind basically and i don't let's [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2764.64s)]
*  just see your response because you're the person definitely the person i'd want to run this by [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2769.44s)]
*  you know you're as far from garza now i'm in central london you're as far from garza as i [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2774.64s)]
*  am from for those familiar with britain redding chelmsford south end on sea places which are [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2781.92s)]
*  extremely close in my mind you know they're practically they're cultural you know these [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2791.28s)]
*  are commuter towns these are people people commute to london every single day from these places [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2796.7200000000003s)]
*  and i can't think of any example in history where you have this tiny strip of land garza the size [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2804.1600000000003s)]
*  of east london for those who don't know i think people often aren't aware of just how small garza [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2811.36s)]
*  which is this apocalyptic wasteland raised from the face of the earth a different color and texture [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2816.48s)]
*  now when looked at from space with most buildings destroyed or damaged severely starving people [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2821.92s)]
*  eating animal gruel in order to live but starving people starving to death the health care system [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2829.04s)]
*  gone basically the apocalypse i think if people could have to kind of imagine the apocalypse [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2835.52s)]
*  garza i think is a pretty good approximation and yet [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2841.12s)]
*  and yet nearby people are eating at sushi restaurants they're going to clubs they're [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2847.92s)]
*  partying they're getting drunk they're living they're going to cinemas they're going to festivals [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2853.44s)]
*  they're going for walks you know they're going to work doing mundane jobs or not mundane jobs [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2858.7999999999997s)]
*  whatever you know they're living the life of a european they're living the life of people just [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2864.16s)]
*  outside my window i can't think of any any example in history actually of that extreme [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2869.2s)]
*  you know to just those alternate alternate realities and i guess maybe it does link back [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2876.7999999999997s)]
*  to what you're saying at the beginning maybe that is about because i don't quite know what the [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2882.64s)]
*  question is but i think about it a lot and i wonder what you think do you think about that a lot [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2885.68s)]
*  and do you think that actually something has to give because i mean there is something [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2890.24s)]
*  particularly unique about that horror i just want to know what your thoughts are [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2895.36s)]
*  yeah first of all i still remember the service taxi who went every hour from tel aviv to gaza [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2900.88s)]
*  it costed 10 shekels like two pounds and they took like one hour drive from jaffa to gaza one [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2911.28s)]
*  hour one hour and 15 for many many years people went there for the shopping people went there for [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2919.68s)]
*  repairing their cars treating their teeth if you ask me about one place on earth that i would like [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2926.24s)]
*  to be now it would be gaza because my heart is is invested there for years i went there at least [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2934.72s)]
*  once a week for years and years and i love this piece of land i know i can't tell it to israelis [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2945.04s)]
*  because they think i'm out of my mind but gaza is so much different than the west bank where i [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2951.2s)]
*  still travel at least once a week gaza is something else and the people of gaza are different they [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2956.64s)]
*  live by the beach they are more open-minded they have sense of humor and above all they suffered [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2963.36s)]
*  much more than the west bank throughout the years and they are much more courageous [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2969.6s)]
*  and there is something in the atmosphere i mean only people who know gaza will understand what [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2974.96s)]
*  i'm talking about now it is one hour away from here i remember times that i used to come back [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2982.7999999999997s)]
*  from there and i was paralyzed at least for one day i couldn't go out because also crossing the [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2989.6s)]
*  border with gaza in times that it was possible was a trauma a shock because you you move from [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=2996.56s)]
*  one world to the other also in better times not only now when it's everything really like hell [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=3005.52s)]
*  like apocalypsa but also in former times it was very hard for me to come back from gaza and to [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=3011.52s)]
*  go out to a restaurant in tel aviv it was really hard unfortunately we get used to everything and [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=3018.96s)]
*  israelis have a lot of agents who make it easier for them and above all obviously the israeli media [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=3027.28s)]
*  which voluntarily doesn't show them gaza and when you don't see it it doesn't exist [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=3033.92s)]
*  so gaza is not in their mind gaza is not in the israeli discourse gaza is just a big [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=3040.88s)]
*  camp of terrorists that should be killed until the last baby there this is the israeli mindset [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=3048.24s)]
*  right now and nobody cares what's going on there and for me i feel more lonely than ever in even [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=3056.3199999999997s)]
*  caring about gaza because i don't have even common learn common language with my friends to speak [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=3067.3599999999997s)]
*  about gaza so very few of them care about gaza now so very few of them are exposed to what's [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=3074.56s)]
*  going on there and really i think that history will not forget history will not forget i hate [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=3080.96s)]
*  to compare with the show with the holocaust because it's always wrong morally and factually [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=3090.4s)]
*  it's a wrong comparison but i must remind you that also the holocaust next to those [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=3097.92s)]
*  extermination camps there was normal life dacha was a concentration camp and next to dacha it was [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=3105.44s)]
*  the ones there was ordinary life including this wonderful film about the family of of the commander [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=3113.92s)]
*  of of of the of the dacha who had this normal life or the commander of other camps who had [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=3123.68s)]
*  exactly yes rudolph was the commander and continuous life and you could hear the noise [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=3135.68s)]
*  also tel aviv hears the noise of gaza if it wants but it's not ready to hear and the heart [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=3146.3199999999997s)]
*  is not open to to absorb and it turns only on the level of blindness [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=3153.44s)]
*  it tells only about the moral profile of israel today it really lost it it lost any humanity [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=3165.6s)]
*  this indifference to what's going on in gaza is unforgivable nothing to compare to all the [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=3173.52s)]
*  other phenomena that we know from the west bank from lebanon but this ignorance this ignoring [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=3179.28s)]
*  of gaza in the israeli mindset is something that will accompany us many many years a big heavy [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=3188.4s)]
*  shadow on our moral profile to be so indifferent to the suffer which is made by us one hour away [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=3197.6800000000003s)]
*  from our homes this should be unforgivable and it is unforgivable [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=3207.12s)]
*  amen and you know what i always find it very moving speaking to you gilbert hope you don't [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=3214.88s)]

*  they'll know that there were isolated people with more courage and consistency who spoke out when [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=3244.16s)]
*  it was hard to do so and i think people obviously will be as people often should be in terms of [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeGmyL_5Kc&t=3250.96s)]
