# Israels' FORGED Documents Exposed - The Lies Never End
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [September 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRZxUAUvuSg)
*  The Israeli authorities lie and lie and lie and lie again. This has been documented so
*  many times now, not least after the Israeli state commits war crimes, atrocities in order
*  to deflect responsibility, deny what actually happened, muddy the waters, sow confusion,
*  leave people concluding that it's all too complicated to really know what actually happened,
*  and they've used deceits over and over again in order to justify their genocidal onslaught
*  against Gaza. Now, we have the latest example of this. The Israeli state caught red-handed
*  spreading deceits using supportive newspapers. Let's put it that way. The Israeli newspaper
*  Yedid-Avonov has published a news story showing that what was presented as leaked Hamas documents
*  in Western media outlets, revealing supposed Hamas plans to smuggle Israeli captives out of Gaza,
*  were in fact forged. As Middle East Eye report, these documents were leaked in order to influence
*  public opinion and present a view that Hamas and its leader Yair Sinwar were not interested
*  in a ceasefire deal. And they were going to pin the failure on reaching such an agreement on
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, of course, Israel's prime minister. Now, notably, two Western newspapers
*  published these documents. One was Germany's Build, the other was the Jewish Chronicle in
*  the UK. Now, the 287,000 plus strong Jewish community in the UK, like all minorities,
*  need publications to cater for them. The Jewish Chronicle, however, has had a ragingly right-wing,
*  militantly pro-Israel editorial, which many Jewish Brits have spoken out and condemned
*  and said over and over again, not on our name. Now, its editor, the editor of the Jewish Chronicle
*  here has tweeted such delights as, we need to face reality, much of Muslim culture is in the grip of
*  a death call that sacralises bloodshed. Not all, but many Muslims have brainwashed it. That is a
*  big part of the problem. Now, he deleted this particular charmer, but that gives you a flavour,
*  the sorts of things he clearly believes. Now, he became Edison in 2021, but it's worth noticing
*  that last year, 15 people who won Ipsos complaints, that's the independent press standards
*  organisation, or libel sentiments against the Jewish Chronicle since 2018 overall,
*  wrote to the regulator asking for action. Now, as the Middle East Eye reports, the Jewish Chronicle
*  said that documents seized by the Israeli army in Gaza at the end of August showed a plan to smuggle
*  captives from Gaza to Egypt across the Philadelphia corridor buffer zone and then to Iran. Now, this is
*  a zone which Netanyahu wants under permanent Israeli occupation. One of the key stumbling
*  blocks to getting any lasting ceasefire, not just Hamas, but Egypt are standing against such a
*  proposal, permanently occupying the border with Egypt, which is of course part of a long-term
*  occupation of Gaza itself. Now, it was said that Sinwar was planning his own escape this way, but
*  the Israeli newspaper Yediyov Aronof say the military intelligence directorate in Israel
*  weren't aware of the document used by the Jewish Chronicle. They quote, neither the document nor
*  the narrative attributed to Sinwar, who suddenly decided to escape are known to anyone in Israel.
*  That's what military sources told the newspaper. Now, according to Build, meanwhile, a quote from
*  the document supposedly said this showed Hamas's lack of interest in a deal, but those remarks
*  didn't exist either. As Middle East Eye also report, this comes after Netanyahu publicly stated
*  he would not allow Israel to withdraw from the Philadelphia corridor. That's what borders Egypt,
*  because it would allow Hamas to sneak captives out of Gaza. So very convenient, isn't it? Extremely
*  convenient for these documents to be leaked at the very time Netanyahu is making the same claims.
*  Now, crucially, Yediyov Aronof report the forged documents cause great concern and anger in the
*  security establishment in Israel, and it's assumed it will heighten the tensions between them
*  and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his men. Well, you just need to apply Kui Bono,
*  who benefits to this. Netanyahu was trying to prevent a ceasefire deal, and he's also trying
*  to blame Hamas for that, to allow him to continue his genocidal campaign. It is frankly
*  a risable failure in journalistic standards to publish false documents like this, especially
*  ones which have, which as we can see, serve the war aims of a foreign state. Now, Israeli analyst,
*  brilliant analyst, Ari Goldberger, I've interviewed on this channel twice, I think now, has an
*  interesting thread as ever. He talks about unnamed Israeli sources seem to have manipulated now,
*  like forged Hamas documents that revealed Hamas policy to be exactly what PM Netanyahu said it
*  is intentional obstructionism and releasing footage of hostages meant to, in quotes, weaken
*  Israeli resolve. On the ceasefire itself, the brilliant journalist, Jeremy Scarhill, wrote a
*  piece for Dropsite News at the beginning of this month entitled How the US Enabled Netanyahu to
*  Sabotage a Gaza Ceasefire. It revealed that internal ceasefire documents showed Hamas accepted the
*  ceasefire hostage framework put forward by Israel and the US on the 24th of June. Let me read that.
*  At the time, it says Hamas negotiators indicated they were open to a three phase deal that would
*  not require immediate commitment to a permanent ceasefire and complete withdrawal of Israeli
*  forces from Gaza as a precondition to move forward with the process. Prior to this, Hamas insisted
*  any agreement must include clearly defined steps that would shorten and end to Israel's war.
*  Dropsite News has reviewed internal documents from the negotiations showing that on July the 2nd,
*  Hamas formally informed international mediators that it had accepted the framework, which Hamas
*  says it was told had been amended by the US and approved by Israel on the 24th of June. This
*  amendment removed language Hamas had previously insisted on that called for negotiations no later
*  than 14 days into the first phase of a deal on the necessary arrangements for the return of a
*  sustainable calm. Peaceful permanent ceasefire in brackets, according to this draft that Dropsite
*  News saw. They report that Hamas believed this compromise was strong evidence of their desire
*  to reach a deal. They quote a member of Hamas' political bureau, Bassem Naim, saying,
*  If you draw a timeline for the negotiations along the last 10 months, you will observe a
*  consistent pattern of the Israelis. Each time we are near to reach an agreement, either they commit
*  new massacres or backdrop for the deal and add new conditions. It's clear from the start that Israel
*  had no intention of prioritizing its own hostages' lives and getting a deal to get them home, let
*  alone preventing the Palestinians being butchered in Gaza in their tens of thousands.
*  The Israeli state's key aim was to replicate a US administration under growing pressure from
*  US voters at home. The US administration's position was locked. We've got mounting pressure on us
*  from key voters who need to come out and vote for us. They're upset about this genocide. Please
*  give us something. That's what this heist far deal has been about. Nothing more, nothing less.
*  Speaking of Israel's lies, what of Aisner Aigyi, the American citizen shot dead by Israeli army?
*  The claim of the IDF was when they shot her, troops responded by shooting at a key instigator
*  who'd been throwing stones at the forces and posed a threat to them. But according to Israeli
*  newspaper Haaretz, three new eyewitnesses present at the process in the West Bank town of Baytah
*  were 26-year-old American Turkish human rights activists who shot dead on Friday told Haaretz
*  that Israeli troops shot her for no reason and there'd been no clashes at the time.
*  It further says, according to Haaretz, the soldiers were positioned in a way that allowed them to
*  clearly see Aisner Aigyi, the activist who was shot. Or how about this paragraph, the activist
*  said Aigyi was not confronting the troops and hadn't been throwing stones at any point during
*  the process and it was that at the time of the shooting it was calm. Adding that even if one of
*  the protesters had been throwing stones, the soldiers were so far away they couldn't have been
*  struck and could not claim self-defense. The Israeli state likely lies and lies again,
*  and yet Western media outlets treat the Israeli authorities as though they are respectable and
*  credible. That's not how they treat, quite correctly, the Russian authorities, for example,
*  there's an understanding that they lie, they make false claims, spread misinformation,
*  can't be trusted. Not so with the Israeli state, even when they murder US citizens. Well, once again,
*  for everybody else a reminder, the rulers of this state are obsessive liars and their lies,
*  as they commit one of the worst crimes of our age, must be exposed.
