# Has Trump TURNED ON ISRAEL? w/. Jasmine El-Gamal
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk)
*  Wow, it is all kicking off. Donald Trump, has he fallen out with Netanyahu? Is he turning on Israel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=0.0s)]
*  in a way you wouldn't expect from a US president? Or is this just theatre? Where do you think stand [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=5.76s)]
*  now with this so-called ceasefire? We do know how Israel has interpreted ceasefires. Clue, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=10.32s)]
*  it generally doesn't involve ceasefire. What happens next in terms of Iran, the whole question [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=16.48s)]
*  of nuclear bombs and all the rest of it, but also Gaza, Palestine completely erased from the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=24.88s)]
*  headlines and already been dropped out. Israel is not exactly gutted about this. No better person [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  to speak to than Jasmine Al Gammah, who is a brilliant foreign policy analyst, but also a [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=36.32s)]
*  former Pentagon Middle East advisor. So has a particularly, I would say interesting vantage [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=42.0s)]
*  point in all this. How are you doing? Great to see you. Good to see you, Owen. I just want to start [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  with what you, just in terms of the bigger picture there, because I know that this is a discussion [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=52.96s)]
*  which has been ongoing in the last few days, but I haven't spoken to you about this specifically. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=60.56s)]
*  And you do have that vantage point. What do you make of the, as a former Pentagon Middle East [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=64.72s)]
*  advisor, the case that was made that Iran was weeks away potentially from having a nuclear bomb? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=73.28s)]
*  Yeah. Listen, it's not just from my vantage point as a former Pentagon advisor. So I advised on the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=82.16s)]
*  Middle East in the office of the secretary of defense during the Obama administration. I was [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=88.0s)]
*  a civil servant, but my time coincided with the Obama administration. But this actually brings me [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=92.4s)]
*  back even way before that to the Iraq war, which I'm sure that you remember, and witnessing [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=98.8s)]
*  Bush administration officials, Condoleezza Rice and Colin Powell and all that cast of characters [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=106.56s)]
*  go on TV and basically make this case using intelligence that we later found out was deeply [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=112.8s)]
*  flawed. And that idea that when a political decision has already been made to go to war, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=119.12s)]
*  it is really, really, really dangerous because then you take that intelligence and then you shift it [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=127.12s)]
*  and shape it basically to bolster your case. Now, when we talk about intelligence for people who [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=131.76s)]
*  don't know what intelligence means, it's really data points. This person went here, this person [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=138.88s)]
*  spoke to this person on the phone. These things, we can see them happening. But what does it all [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=144.72s)]
*  mean? That interpretation of the intelligence is what differs from situation to situation, from [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  intelligence agency to intelligence agency from country to country. And so when you as a political [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=158.08s)]
*  leader have already decided that you want to go to war with X country, it's really, really easy then [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=165.52s)]
*  for you to take all these random data points that you see in front of you and decide that you're [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=171.84s)]
*  going to put it together in a way that fits your narrative. You see what you want to see basically. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  I mean, Tulsi Gabbard, who obviously was appointed as the head of national intelligence by Donald [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=182.56s)]
*  Trump himself. I mean, back in March, she said that it was her assertion that Iran wasn't, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=188.16s)]
*  sorry, the conclusion of the US intelligence community is that Iran wasn't building a nuclear [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=194.88s)]
*  bomb. And then Trump carrying out said she was wrong, which is extraordinary because she pointed [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=199.44s)]
*  him to that. He appointed her to that position. But then she suggested actually, you know, this [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=204.32s)]
*  was our context and all the rest of it. What do you think about what happened there? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=210.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, I don't know if you remember a few weeks ago, there was a story going around [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=214.16s)]
*  about how Tulsi Gabbard was considering hiring a camp, like making the presidential daily brief, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  almost like Trump would be watching television because that's how he usually gets his news and [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=228.72s)]
*  his intelligence. And he has such a short attention span. So she was trying to find ways to make it [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=233.2s)]
*  more interesting for him. I mean, this is not a president that is known in this term or his last [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=237.92s)]
*  term for being a really detail oriented person. He gets bored quickly. And so I don't imagine that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=244.23999999999998s)]
*  he himself had really been paying attention and pouring over these intelligence reports [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=250.56s)]
*  and these data points. Like I said, he probably was just asking people that he trusted, you know, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=255.67999999999998s)]
*  what do you make of this? What do you think of this? But you're right, Owen. The fact is that [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=260.8s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, who's now the director of national intelligence, had said that the intelligence [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=266.16s)]
*  community assesses that Iran was not trying to actively seek a nuclear weapon. And that remains [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=273.6s)]
*  the intelligence assessment. There was an article recently in The Economist where they actually [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=280.56s)]
*  spoke to people who had seen the Israeli intelligence that was shared with the Americans. And [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=285.44000000000005s)]
*  like I said, it could be interpreted very differently. There were a lot of, you know, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=291.76s)]
*  things about meetings, about conversations. But in order to assign intent to those data points, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=296.72s)]
*  it really was about whether you wanted to go to war or not. So the intelligence didn't match up. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=307.44s)]
*  And it became quite clear that the intelligence was being used to justify an already made decision. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=313.04s)]
*  Before I ask you about the shenanigans, let's put it that way, involving Trump today, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=319.6s)]
*  I mean, because you mentioned the specter of Iraq, which obviously has been looming over all of this [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=323.68s)]
*  for the last few days, and marshaling of intelligence. I mean, there have been [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=330.4s)]
*  reports that Donald Trump wanted this attack on Iran since last year, that he was always gearing up [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=335.84s)]
*  to do this, rather than, and this was just an opportune moment. So kind of, I guess, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=342.24s)]
*  his interests and those of Israel's at this particular juncture happened to coincide. It [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=347.36s)]
*  was opportunistic. Yeah, you mean Benjamin Netanyahu, not Donald Trump. Oh, sorry. Yeah. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=352.08s)]
*  Sorry, no, Donald Trump wanted a strike on Iran. But obviously, Benjamin Netanyahu's wanted this [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=357.2s)]
*  forever. What do you think? Do you think Donald Trump actually was always after a strike on Iran? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=364.56s)]
*  And actually, all of that is theatre. And actually, you know, Benjamin Netanyahu then [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=369.44s)]
*  presented an opening for what Donald Trump always wanted to do since he became president the second [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=374.4s)]
*  time. Do you know, I don't really agree, actually. And I know there are disagreements about this. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=379.44s)]
*  The way I read it is that Donald Trump preferred not to strike. I think that he's made it very [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=384.64s)]
*  clear. And, you know, this is something about me, he doesn't like conflict. I mean, I'm not a fan, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=393.04s)]
*  first of all, I have to caveat that to your audience. And I think he makes horrible decisions [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=398.71999999999997s)]
*  a lot of the time. But I actually don't think he wanted to go in and strike Iran. I think that [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=403.76s)]
*  he found himself in a position where people around him were leading. And it felt a little bit like [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=410.15999999999997s)]
*  he was always catching up. You know, he was in the middle of negotiations with Iran. Steve [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=418.08s)]
*  Whitkoff was due to go to Oman for the sixth round of talks. I had spoken to one of the Omanis [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=423.2s)]
*  that had really close knowledge of the negotiations very recently. And he told me that they were really [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=429.92s)]
*  impressed with Steve Whitkoff and how he was handling the talks and talking about how everyone [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=436.24s)]
*  was negotiating in good faith. And so when the Israelis decided to strike, I think, and there [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=440.88s)]
*  was a lot of pressure from the lobbies in Washington, D.C., the hawks, the pro-Israel lobbies [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=448.4s)]
*  who had been waiting for this moment for so long, ever since I lived in Washington, D.C., and worked [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=455.84s)]
*  at the Pentagon, which was over 10 years ago. They saw this as the perfect moment. Certainly [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=460.71999999999997s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu saw it as a perfect moment. He has seen it as the perfect moment for a while. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=467.03999999999996s)]
*  Hezbollah has decimated. Hamas has almost decimated, pretty much decimated. And so everyone [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=472.32s)]
*  who had been clamoring for a strike against Iran did not want to miss this moment. And I think [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=478.48s)]
*  Donald Trump felt a little bit like he was, you know, not coming across as the one making decisions. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=484.32s)]
*  And he wanted to get back in that position where he was the decision maker and he was the one who [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=490.32s)]
*  was running the show. So on that, Donald Trump posted on CheesSocial. This was this moment when [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=494.96000000000004s)]
*  people on, you know, that GIF, everyone just staring at a camera. I think it was in the office. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=500.0s)]
*  Anyway, Israel, do not drop those bombs. If you do, as a major violation, obviously Donald Trump [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=504.16s)]
*  is all in capitals. Bring your pilots home now. Donald J. Trump, President of the United States. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=509.36s)]
*  He also then had, for the standings, I would say, of the US president, regardless of Donald Trump [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=514.0s)]
*  himself and his own defiance of norms, pretty spicy language. Let's just hear what he said. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=519.84s)]
*  The [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=530.0s)]
*  biggest load that we've seen. I'm not happy with Israel. You know, when I say, okay, now you have [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=545.36s)]
*  12 hours, you don't go out in the first hour and just drop everything you have on them. So I'm not [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=550.64s)]
*  happy with them. I'm not happy with Iran either. But I'm really unhappy if Israel's going out this [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=555.68s)]
*  morning because the one rocket that didn't land, that was shot, perhaps by mistake, that didn't land. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=561.3599999999999s)]
*  I'm not happy about that. You know what? We have, we basically have two countries that have been [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=567.4399999999999s)]
*  fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing. Do you understand that? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=574.64s)]
*  What do you make of that? Because I guess a lot of people, you can just interpret this as [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=586.56s)]
*  theater and all the rest of it. A US president talking about Israel in those terms is not [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=593.28s)]
*  something actually you expect. And I don't want to, should have carried this because actually, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=600.9599999999999s)]
*  you know, I mean, infamously in the early 2000s, when Israel struck a Hamas leader and killed [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=604.8s)]
*  several civilians, George W. Bush's administration reprimanded Israel on that, but not in as forceful [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=612.32s)]
*  language. I mean, that just shows how far things fell, including not least under Joe Biden. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=618.4000000000001s)]
*  That was what, you know, George W. Bush, you know, and that was, but I think, is that a schism? I mean, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=622.5600000000001s)]
*  is there something, is it a genuine fissure there which could become something bigger, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=629.12s)]
*  or does it not mean very much? What do you think? Yeah, you know, it's not just George W. Bush. I [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=634.32s)]
*  mean, Ronald Reagan, you know, with Lebanon, you had George W. Bush, you know, Biden. But that was [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=639.68s)]
*  private. Reagan, I know he said, exactly. I was going to say that to your point, it's, you know, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=647.4399999999999s)]
*  US presidents have expressed intense displeasure with Israelis before, and especially Benjamin [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=654.4799999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu. But you're right in that it wasn't, it wasn't that public and direct. I mean, the [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=659.68s)]
*  Biden administration would leak it, but we never actually heard him say it. So this was, you know, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=665.52s)]
*  people think this is a big deal. To be honest, Owen, I wouldn't read too much into it in terms of [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=672.64s)]
*  whether it has any broader strategic meaning. I think Donald Trump was tired. He was grumpy. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=680.96s)]
*  He hates the situation that he's in. He hates continuing to get dragged back into conflict, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=687.84s)]
*  especially in the Middle East. He wants to get on with things. He probably hadn't slept very much. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=693.84s)]
*  I think I heard Steve Bannon talking about how he had slept for like two hours or something the [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=699.0400000000001s)]
*  night before. I mean, you know, at the end of the day, these people are human also. Imagine how, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=703.2s)]
*  you know, grumpy you would be and frustrated and you just let the F-bomb slip out. But I don't think [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=708.5600000000001s)]
*  it has any strategic, you know, impact when it comes to the US-Israeli relationship or anything [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=713.6800000000001s)]
*  like that. I mean, listen, I think the more interesting thing that came out of this, I [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=721.04s)]
*  haven't really seen people talking about it, is that when Trump picked up the phone and said, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=726.3199999999999s)]
*  you know, I want you to wrap this up, you know, wrap this up, and he got so angry when they didn't, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=732.16s)]
*  I, what I thought of was, oh, so you can also just pick up the phone and tell him to wrap up Gaza [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=737.8399999999999s)]
*  and just get out and stop and he would listen to you, right? That's what I thought of rather [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=744.16s)]
*  than just making a big deal out of that word. It's interesting, I've got ADHD and the more I speak to [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=750.0s)]
*  and starting to diagnose Donald Trump with ADHD, to be honest. Mohamed Shahadeh is a brilliant [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=755.44s)]
*  Palestinian analyst for Gaza. I mean, he kind of, he's kind of echoing what you said there. So I'll [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=761.68s)]
*  just read what he said, because he said, he said this is called, firstly, he said this is called a [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=766.72s)]
*  face save, sorry. Firstly, this is called a safe face stunt. Trump realized he'd messed up with [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=770.88s)]
*  entering war, upset his base, didn't eliminate Israel's nuclear program and now wanting to take [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=776.5600000000001s)]
*  credit for ending it protecting the ceasefire, don't fall for another Trump Net Yahoo beefing. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=780.5600000000001s)]
*  He also said, and this speaks specifically to what you said, imagine if him or Biden did the same [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=783.9200000000001s)]
*  about Gaza, how many of our loved ones would still be with us today? The US president can end the [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=788.96s)]
*  genocide in a moment, but both Republican Democrats don't want it. What do you think of that? Do you [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=793.2s)]
*  think partly because some MAGA people, and you mentioned Steve Bannon, he wasn't happy, and took [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=797.04s)]
*  a Carlson again. I mean, I know Trump, I can't remember what he was, I like his nicknames. He's [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=803.44s)]
*  made camp Donald Trump as well, ADHD and camp. He said something about Tucker that I can't remember. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=809.6s)]
*  It was like, it was quite funny because he's quite funny, unfortunately. He should have been [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=816.96s)]
*  a drag queen, unfortunately. But no, but I mean, he said, I mean, just those points there about, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=820.5600000000001s)]
*  do you think this is kind of, and also, you know, that point, did he really, the suggestions, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=826.8000000000001s)]
*  the nuclear program hasn't actually got rid of how much damage has actually been done. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=831.76s)]
*  That's quite a lot to throw at you. So maybe we'll start with a few of that. I mean, what do you [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=836.24s)]
*  think about, yeah, he's upset his base. Let's start with that before we do Gaza. He's upset his base [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=838.8s)]
*  and not necessarily destroyed the nuclear program. Do they really know? Can US intelligence work that [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=844.24s)]
*  out, do you think? Yeah, on the damage, you know, usually when something like this happens, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=849.4399999999999s)]
*  um, something called a battle damage assessment is done and you have to go in and really see, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=857.4399999999999s)]
*  you know, what happened, what the ramifications are. And that hasn't really been done. Um, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=862.24s)]
*  we still don't really know the extent of the damage. And of course, the Iranians are saying [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=868.24s)]
*  that it wasn't that much and they were able to go into Fordo beforehand because they knew it was [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=872.9599999999999s)]
*  on the target list and take out some of that enriched uranium. And now they have it stored [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=877.4399999999999s)]
*  somewhere else. The picture is still really murky and every actor in this scenario is saying what [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=881.92s)]
*  they need to say to justify what they did and to come out as the winner. So I think we're really [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=887.8399999999999s)]
*  still very much in a fog of war situation right now. And we don't really know when the dust settles, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=893.52s)]
*  if this will have all been worth it because everything that's been achieved now, could it [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=898.9599999999999s)]
*  have just been achieved through negotiations? Um, was it worth the lives of over 500 people, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=904.88s)]
*  you know, Iranians, Israelis who are killed? Um, that's a question that I think people are [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=910.72s)]
*  going to have to answer for. And, um, I saw that the administration is now going to have to go [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=915.44s)]
*  into Congress and give a classified briefing on that intelligence that was used, um, and justify [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=921.6s)]
*  why the U S went in and struck Iran. So I think we're going to see trickles of information coming [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=927.6800000000001s)]
*  out over the next week or so, um, regarding the battle damage assessment. Um, that was that, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=932.64s)]
*  what was the other question? Yeah. And then just about his base, you know, kind of, cause that's [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=940.48s)]
*  a really, that's a really interesting question. Oh, and it's a really good question. The way I [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=944.08s)]
*  think about it is, um, I want people to think about Donald Trump's base as, uh, a child and he's the [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=947.84s)]
*  parents. So no matter how angry the child gets at their parents, they're never really, well, rarely, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=956.88s)]
*  they're not really going to disown them. They're not going to leave the house because they depend [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=963.12s)]
*  on the parents, feed them, to clothe them. It's like a little child. So the MAGA base, it depends [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=966.96s)]
*  on Donald Trump. He is the source of their power for many people inside the administration right [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=973.9200000000001s)]
*  now, from the lowest positions to the cabinet officials. Many of them wouldn't have those jobs [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=979.52s)]
*  in a million years. If it wasn't for Donald Trump, a lot of them are way under qualified. Um, and so, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=984.48s)]
*  so they owe him, they're dependent on him. So they may get angry at him, but it's not likely [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=991.2s)]
*  that they're going to leave or take anybody with them or do any significant political damage to him. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=996.96s)]
*  What do you think, I mean, in terms of how, you know, the Israel position, they'd say, well, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1003.92s)]
*  Iran got humiliated. They got a kicking. They got obviously severely bombed, including by the US. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1009.36s)]
*  Do you think that's totally true? I mean, cause I mean, again, JD Vance, by the way, himself, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1016.5600000000001s)]
*  the vice president had said, um, you know, did suggest actually that their stockpile is still [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1020.0s)]
*  intact. We don't know basically, but that makes it ambiguous. It's not, you know, if, if, if they [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1025.44s)]
*  objectively have wiped that out and we knew that as a fact, then you'd say that's a comprehensive [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1031.04s)]
*  strategic question. We don't actually know that at all. I mean, what do you think in terms of, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1035.68s)]
*  I mean, they also did inflict quite a lot of damage, certainly on Israel, a lot more than any [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1041.36s)]
*  other actor has managed. Yeah. What do you, what do you think? What do you think about kind of [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1048.0s)]
*  Iran's position and internally, what do you think about where the balance of power within the, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1054.48s)]
*  within Iran now falls? I think, um, this is a situation where, and I guess maybe the Middle [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1059.04s)]
*  East tends to bring this out, you know, people on either side are going to see what they want to see [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1066.72s)]
*  and claim that their side was the winner. But if you look at it objectively, it is true that Iran [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1071.8400000000001s)]
*  was humiliated. I mean, it's been humiliated over the last couple of years, time and again, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1077.2s)]
*  you know, Ismael Haneya, the head of Hamas was assassinated, you know, when he was Iran. I mean, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1082.4s)]
*  the fact that you can't keep your guests and visitors safe in your own country. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1087.44s)]
*  Inside job, they can just do inside jobs. They penetrate. Yeah. The level of intelligence [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1092.16s)]
*  penetration that Israel has achieved, it's humiliating because you don't even know if [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1098.0s)]
*  your own people are with you and your own regime. And we're talking about high level [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1103.44s)]
*  penetration here. Um, so it's very embarrassing. And then of course, being involved in negotiations, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1108.3200000000002s)]
*  going along with what the Americans have asked you to do, which has come to the table and then be [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1114.8s)]
*  struck by Israel, then get, you know, a two week deadline from the American president and then get [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1119.68s)]
*  struck by the Americans. I mean, it just seems that they were just getting one blow after the other. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1125.1200000000001s)]
*  But on the other hand, what we saw coming out of Tel Aviv, those images, those bombings, the missiles, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1130.64s)]
*  people getting hurt in a way we really haven't seen. And, and you know, Israel is a really small [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1137.44s)]
*  country and, and, and they're not used to, um, to seeing and experiencing all of that. So that was [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1142.64s)]
*  really awful as well. And I think that that really, also this is a continuation. I think this has [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1149.12s)]
*  happened over the last two years as well, is that there's been a steady degradation of this image of [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1156.0s)]
*  Israel as untouchable. It is not untouchable. The fact that it hasn't been able to defeat Hamas [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1162.88s)]
*  in two years, you know, the fact that it keeps having to go back and strike Lebanon again, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1170.72s)]
*  you know, it can't abide by any ceasefires. That's not the action of a country that is [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1176.3200000000002s)]
*  strong and secure in itself and its capabilities. So I think both countries suffered a huge blow [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1181.52s)]
*  in their own way and proportional to their own capabilities. You know, these are not two countries [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1188.6399999999999s)]
*  that have parity. They're not equal, but relatively speaking, they both suffered major damage. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1193.92s)]
*  Before I just ask you about Gaza, I mean, in terms of just finally on Iran, I mean, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1200.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, where do you think this leaves the, I'm going to say the international order such as it [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1205.76s)]
*  exists. But in terms of the UN charter, I mean, actually it's interesting, President Macron, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1212.0s)]
*  I think I'd call him a slimy sir, and so he's not unfair given he started this by expressing [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1219.04s)]
*  profound sympathy with Israel's decision to strike Iran and now he's saying it was illegal, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1224.6399999999999s)]
*  which of course it was illegal. It was illegal under the UN Charter. You can't attack a country [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1228.56s)]
*  on a claim future threat. I mean, that's Russia's justification for invading Ukraine. You can't do [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1231.84s)]
*  that. It's illegal. If there's an imminent, if you can collect, if there's an absolute imminent [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1236.9599999999998s)]
*  armed threat, which you can prove, you know, that's different. But in any case, you can't do a [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1240.48s)]
*  defensive maneuver and attack a country based on, you know, anyway, we did the basis is beyond [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1244.8s)]
*  questionable. But what do you think, I mean, in terms of where that leads the kind of what other [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1252.3999999999999s)]
*  countries now do because what we're seeing, what we've seen even before obviously the genocide [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1257.52s)]
*  began in Gaza, but just the destruction of any basic norms. I mean, you know, because you know, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1261.76s)]
*  you just legitimized the trashing of any rules whatsoever because even, you know, we took about [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1267.1200000000001s)]
*  the run up to Iraq. I mean, I know it was a land invasion, but you know, George B. Bush's people, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1271.92s)]
*  who we rightly look back and consider maniacs, they, you know, they went through, they went [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1276.3200000000002s)]
*  bent over backwards in theater, at least to go through the United Nations. Yeah, people kind of [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1280.48s)]
*  forget that often, you know, there's a whole drama about the second resolution. I know that [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1285.6s)]
*  didn't happen. But, but I mean, what do you think in terms of and where does this leave a kind of [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1290.08s)]
*  the lessons learned by other countries where they think actually, to be honest, you need to get [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1294.6399999999999s)]
*  yourself a nuclear bomb if you don't want to get attacked. I mean, that is the you know, where does [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1299.6799999999998s)]
*  the nonproliferation treaties, you know, land in this? Oh, totally. I mean, this isn't just about [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1304.1599999999999s)]
*  the last 12 days. This is about decades, if not, if you know, it's, but we won't go into decades. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1311.04s)]
*  Let's just talk about the last two years. Let's just talk about post October seven. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1317.2s)]
*  There, you know, international law is such a, it's so pathetic, to be honest, to talk about [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1322.56s)]
*  international law these days, to hear Europeans, to hear Americans come out and talk about [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1330.24s)]
*  international law is is pathetic. I don't really have another word for it. There, there has been [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1336.16s)]
*  absolutely uneven application of law. If you just compare the western reaction to the Russian [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1344.24s)]
*  invasion in Ukraine and Israeli actions in Gaza, I mean, we have a situation now where I mean, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1352.24s)]
*  I know you've talked about and you were one of the early ones, you know, using the word genocide. And, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1359.6000000000001s)]
*  you know, before it became very fashionable to say genocide now. The fact is that there is almost [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1364.88s)]
*  a wall to wall consensus now with international experts, human rights expert, genocide experts, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1371.0400000000002s)]
*  historians who are saying that what is happening is a genocide. And so to have that happen, you know, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1376.0s)]
*  and live streamed, by the way, so not like, oh, we didn't know. Oh, we didn't see. And to have the [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1384.0s)]
*  standard almost robotic response over and over again to anything to be, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1392.8000000000002s)]
*  we believe in Israel's right to defend itself. It's almost comical because sometimes the [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1399.52s)]
*  the statements don't even match the question. They're asked a question about something and then [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1405.52s)]
*  they'll say Israel has a right to defend itself. And that frankly does a disservice to Israelis. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1409.44s)]
*  You have you have thousands of Israelis who are protesting in their streets, who I speak to almost [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1415.1200000000001s)]
*  on a weekly basis, who are saying your support, your uncritical support for this Israeli government [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1423.76s)]
*  is harming us. So you think you're being a friend to Israel, you're not. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1437.92s)]
*  So all of this is really just to say that we have seen this steady erosion of norms [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1445.8400000000001s)]
*  over the last couple of years and it's culminated. And of course, not to mention the extrajudicial [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1452.4s)]
*  assassinations that have been happening, you know, assassinations in Lebanon, assassinations in Iran, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1457.68s)]
*  assassinations all across the region. Can you imagine, Owen, and this is take away what you [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1462.24s)]
*  think about Iran and Iran is no innocent saint in all of this. I mean, Iran has sown destruction [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1468.88s)]
*  and death in the region for decades. This Iranian regime, not innocent, but just imagine what it [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1474.88s)]
*  what the world would look like if every country decided to just whack any leader that they didn't [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1482.16s)]
*  like or just to go in and quote unquote prevent something that they thought might one day happen. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1488.32s)]
*  What would that world look like? Right. And so if you look at where we are now, we are in that world [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1495.12s)]
*  where people who enter into negotiations get bombed, where you can get a deadline from the [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1501.4399999999998s)]
*  U.S. president to think about something and get bombed, where countries that have nuclear weapons [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1507.52s)]
*  or that have a massive amount of economic power don't really get messed with and countries that [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1514.64s)]
*  don't become scapegoats. So the natural conclusion that you would come to if you were a world leader [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1520.4s)]
*  is we better amass some power now because if we don't look at what's happening to everyone around [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1526.96s)]
*  us who doesn't. And that's a really dangerous world to live in. Just finally Gaza, which you [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1534.0s)]
*  talked about there. I mean, we've already had, I don't know how many months it is now, it's getting [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1540.08s)]
*  on for 21 months in a couple of weeks. So it's 20 and a half months. Yeah. Or just, as you say, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1549.1999999999998s)]
*  live streams daily, genocide, depravity. And, you know, as again you alluded to, I mean, the most, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1556.48s)]
*  no crime has been as documented as it actually happened. I mean, all the evidence is just there. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1567.04s)]
*  Not all the evidence. We should be clear about that actually. I mean, we don't know actually, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1572.4s)]
*  you know, it's the tip of the iceberg in a sense. It's not like every crime in Gaza committed by [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1576.0s)]
*  the Israeli state, I'm afraid, is being videoed or is being videoed in the footage. You know, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1580.96s)]
*  the people killed just after they filmed it. We don't know. We're going to find out a lot more [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1586.4s)]
*  after this is all over. Absolutely. But we know every war crime under the sun has been committed [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1590.56s)]
*  and we know as Iran was being attacked and that mini war was going on, every single day, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1595.2s)]
*  starving Palestinians were being massacred as they sought food. I'm just wondering, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1603.2s)]
*  just in terms of what's happened there, in terms of Gaza being driven off the agenda, but also, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1607.28s)]
*  I mean, is there any hope? Is there actually, does this now with Israel mean they, you know, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1612.64s)]
*  if they have to go, we declare victory with Iran, regardless of whether or not there is a victory or [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1618.32s)]
*  not, but if they, for political reasons, have to do that, you know, it's a total victory, etc. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1623.44s)]
*  Doesn't that increase pressure on them to cease the genocidal onslaught in Gaza? What do you think? [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1630.16s)]
*  Just in terms of what's happening in terms of Gaza being driven off the agenda, but do you think [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1638.96s)]
*  there's, could there be an opening for something, for this to stop? I think I said this months and [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1642.24s)]
*  months and months ago, and I don't remember where I said it or if I posted it, I said that this will [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1650.24s)]
*  end when Benjamin Netanyahu wants it to end. And I hate saying that. I actually have a really hard [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1654.8s)]
*  time, you know, the more, as you said, the more it goes on, the more, even as an analyst, you're [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1662.16s)]
*  just like, what do you say? You know, what is there left to say? What is the one thing you can say that [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1667.68s)]
*  will resonate with someone who still thinks that this is not a genocide or that this is [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1673.76s)]
*  okay to keep going or that says, oh, you know, whatever, I just, I won't think about it. It's [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1680.32s)]
*  just too much, you know. So it is really difficult to talk about it, but we have to, of course, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1685.84s)]
*  we have to, because there are people, you know, Palestinians in Gaza who are dying every single [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1690.48s)]
*  day, dying of hunger, dying because they're being murdered, you know, imprisoned. And of course, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1698.0s)]
*  this is not to say anything about the West Bank, which is horrendous as well. Just because it's [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1704.88s)]
*  not a genocide there doesn't mean it's not horrendous. So there's still ethnic cleansing, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1711.04s)]
*  there's forced displacement, 40,000 people forced to leave their homes in recent months and told [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1716.32s)]
*  they can't come back. This stuff is not normal stuff that human beings are meant to be able to [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1723.36s)]
*  process in any capacity. And so there is this strategy of just overwhelming the mind, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1730.8799999999999s)]
*  overwhelming the capacity of anyone to say or do anything about it. And then there was also this [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1740.4799999999998s)]
*  distraction with Iran. And then we can't not speak about Netanyahu's political troubles at home [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1746.24s)]
*  and how that's a distraction from that as well. Bill Clinton, of all people, just came out recently [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1752.72s)]
*  and said, Netanyahu needs war with Iran to survive politically. Right? So it's not a secret, right? [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1757.68s)]
*  It's not, this is about a man, this is about a government, it's about a deliberate decision to [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1763.44s)]
*  ally with the most extremist elements of Israeli society who mistreat their own people, who don't [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1770.88s)]
*  care about their own hostages. And so I think to this day, Owen, the Israeli government has not [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1778.24s)]
*  been held accountable in any way for anything they've done over the last 21 months. I mean, [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1789.36s)]
*  the UK government just barely sanctioned, you know, what was it two weeks ago they sanctioned [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1796.4s)]
*  Ben Gavir and Smatric after 20 months? And convenient bogeymen, let's just be honest. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1801.84s)]
*  Convenient, right? Let's make it about them rather than, you know. Yeah, it's a badge of [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1806.8799999999999s)]
*  honour for them anyway, you know, to their constituents. So was it a welcome move? Of [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1812.8799999999999s)]
*  course, every move towards accountability is welcome. But let's be serious here. I mean, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1819.2s)]
*  what really has been done when it comes to accountability? Benjamin Netanyahu still travels, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1823.52s)]
*  Yoav Galant was in Washington DC sitting and doing panels on talking about, you know, so- [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1828.48s)]
*  And to be clear, let's just overrun the members. That's the former defence minister who, along with [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1834.48s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, has been indicted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes and [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1838.16s)]
*  crimes against humanity. And so, you know, and the more this goes on, of course, the more violence it [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1842.48s)]
*  creates everywhere. I mean, we're seeing now, look at the mayoral race in New York and the issues [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1850.08s)]
*  that are coming up related to the war and to Israel and Islamophobia, the anti-Semitism. I mean, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1855.84s)]
*  this is something that is like a poison seeping across so many issues and so many borders and so [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1861.28s)]
*  many people. And when is it going to stop? We just talked about this earlier in the episode. We said [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1868.0s)]
*  it could stop when Donald Trump picks up the phone and tells Netanyahu to stop. But at the end of the [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1876.3999999999999s)]
*  day, it's Benjamin Netanyahu that has to decide that he's going to stop. And what amount of [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1881.68s)]
*  pressure needs to be put on him in order for that to happen? I don't know. I'm frankly speechless. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1886.56s)]
*  I mean, you can see that I'm having a hard time even trying to, like, articulate this because I [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1893.6s)]
*  am in such shock. I've been in Middle East policy for over 20 years, and I'm in shock as to how [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1897.9199999999998s)]
*  this has been allowed to happen and how we have gotten here. And I think we'll be grappling with [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1906.32s)]
*  this just as human beings for a really, really, really long time. You know, every day I say to myself [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1912.4s)]
*  whatever knowledge we may all have about the context, the dynamics, that is so important to [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1923.0400000000002s)]
*  say to yourself, I cannot believe this is actually happening. And I think that's important in terms of [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1929.1200000000001s)]
*  not normalising what has happened. And also to keep our own humanity, to be honest. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1935.36s)]
*  I speak to people every day in Gaza, and, you know, a UN official just said, you know, it's [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1943.1999999999998s)]
*  worse than hell on earth. There isn't the language. There aren't the words in the language [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1951.6799999999998s)]
*  to describe the horror. And, you know, I'm not in Gaza, obviously. And everyone I speak to who has [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1958.32s)]
*  been to Gaza says there's just nothing you can say that can in any way accurately convey [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1964.56s)]
*  what is being done to the people there and the actual conditions there. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1971.44s)]
*  – And by the way, Owen, that is, because this is a really important point, that everyone who has been [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1974.48s)]
*  there and seen what is happening with their own eyes, because look, I mean, you can turn away from [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1981.04s)]
*  the videos, you know, for your own mental health. I always tell people, like, if you can't do anything [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1985.2s)]
*  about it, don't feel guilty about not watching the videos, because that can do serious damage to you [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1990.32s)]
*  mentally. You can do everything and you can support and go out and protest and you can do [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=1995.6799999999998s)]
*  everything that, but you don't have to, you know, you have to take care of your own mental health [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=2002.08s)]
*  also, because, you know, everyone is needed at this moment. But on the point about people who do [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=2006.48s)]
*  go there, the doctors who volunteer, the humanitarian officials, all of that, and what they come back [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=2013.84s)]
*  with having changed as human beings, right, that is precisely why the Israeli government is not [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=2018.48s)]
*  letting international journalists into Gaza, because they know that they can easily dismiss, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=2027.3600000000001s)]
*  and this is because of racism and dehumanization towards people in the Middle East, that people can [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=2033.92s)]
*  believe, they will believe, there's always going to be a sliver of a doubt that that [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=2040.56s)]
*  Gazan journalist is Hamas. It's easy for people to believe that, and maybe they believe that just [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=2045.04s)]
*  to let themselves off the hook. It's less easy to believe that if someone who looks like you, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=2051.04s)]
*  who you trust, goes there and tells you and shows you what they have seen, and that's why [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=2056.16s)]
*  international journalists are not allowed into Gaza. Amen, and just so everyone knows, on Thursday [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=2062.32s)]
*  I'm interviewing Dr. Mohammed Mustafa, who is a British Australian emergency doctor of Palestinian [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=2068.88s)]
*  heritage, and the US surgeon Dr. Mark Poulmulte, who is a Jewish American doctor, both of whom [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=2073.52s)]
*  served in Gaza, and the Mark Poulmulte has spoken about the deliberate shooting of Palestinian [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=2080.72s)]
*  children, he's absolutely sure of the fact that Palestinian children deliberately being shot, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=2087.28s)]
*  and he said no child gets shot twice by mistake. Talking sniper shots of course to their heads [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcoZp5gUMZk&t=2092.16s)]
