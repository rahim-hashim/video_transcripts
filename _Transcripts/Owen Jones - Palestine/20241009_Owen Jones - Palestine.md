# Israel Is Liquidating Northern Gaza - And Boasting About It
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Fv4ZynyLrM)
*  ethnic cleansing of the surviving Palestinian population of northern Gaza by the Israeli state.
*  All the signs are pointing in that direction in terms of that happening right now. Now given
*  Israel's escalation of the onslaught against Lebanon, the risk is this will be buried. Buried,
*  much like thousands of Palestinians under the rubble of Gaza, many long dead, for months even,
*  yet still classified as missing, excluded from the official death toll.
*  In this context, let me bring up the name of Gior Ireland, a retired Major General of the
*  Israel Defense Force, so called, and former head of the Israeli National Security Council,
*  who has been serving as an advisor to the Israeli Defence Minister, Yoav Galan.
*  Last October, he wrote a column published in Fathom Journal, which is an outlet
*  which is published by BiCom, the British Israel Communications and Research Centre,
*  or the main pro-Israel lobbying group here in Britain. Now, this is quite an extraordinary
*  piece to say the least. In it, he declared his support for the total siege of Gaza,
*  that itself is illegal under international law. He called it, called for even, a dramatic, continuous
*  and strict siege of Gaza. He said, this is what Israel has begun to do. We cut the supply of
*  energy, water and diesel to the strip, all war crimes. He added, in order to make the siege
*  effective, we have to prevent others from giving assistance to Gaza. Israel sent a clear message
*  that even if they want to sell containers with diesel and other energy, we will not let it happen
*  and if needed, we will bomb those containers. Since he wrote those words, we've seen the biggest
*  mass slaughter of aid workers in recorded history, including the killing of foreign aid workers,
*  such as, for example, the world set above all else, the world central kitchen attack, back in
*  April. If you look at the evidence there, could only have been calculated. For example,
*  their route was coordinated in advance with the Israeli military. That led to other aid agencies
*  suspending their operations in Gaza, contributing of course to the policy of starvation.
*  In the piece, Kira Ireland wrote, people might ask whether we want the people of Gaza to starve.
*  We do not. Therefore, the people of Gaza will have to leave, either temporarily or permanently,
*  via the border with Egypt. When the people have evacuated and the only ones left in Gaza are Hamas,
*  when food and water has run out, and we can also bomb the water facilities in Gaza so there will
*  be no water, then at some point Hamas will either be completely destroyed or surrender or agree to
*  evacuate Gaza, just as Arafat was forced to leave Beirut under an Israeli siege. Any other measure
*  short of this will not be effective. Israel should not allow any economic assistance. People should
*  be told that they have two choices, to stay and starve or to leave, to stay and to starve or to
*  leave. If Egypt and other countries prefer that these people will perish in Gaza, that is their
*  choice. I prefer something that is more reasonable. He then goes on to demand the destruction of all
*  the water facilities in Gaza. To be very clear, what he was agitating for here were serious grave
*  war crimes, murderous mass ethnic cleansing, what would be in practice the mass slaughter of
*  hundreds of thousands of civilians, violently, because obviously huge numbers of people would
*  never agree to leave their homes permanently like that. He justified all this on the grounds
*  of preserving the lives of Israeli soldiers. We can see, of course, elements of what he called
*  for having been executed, implemented by the Israeli state. This article cited in South Africa's
*  case the International Court of Justice, which alleged genocide against Israel, in the section
*  outlining intent. Now, fast forward, 22nd of September this year, CNN's headline was Netanyahu
*  considering plan to force all Palestinian civilians out of northern Gaza to besiege
*  Hamas. It noted that it wasn't clear how many Palestinian civilians remain, but estimates run
*  into hundreds of thousands. It added, the plan does not mention whether, when or how civilians
*  would be allowed to return to northern Gaza. After nearly a year of war with no part of Gaza immune
*  from Israeli airstrikes, Palestinians have been increasingly unwilling to heed Israeli demands
*  to relocate. It then notes this plan came from a certain Giora island. In a video he made,
*  he declared, those who leave will receive food and water, but in a week the entire territory of
*  the northern Gaza will become military territory, and this military territory, as far as we are
*  concerned, no supplies will enter it. To be clear, this is a grave war crime being outlined.
*  You can't just demand a civilian population just leaves their homes, or the remains of their homes,
*  or whether they happen to be under threat of violence and death. Indeed, regardless of their
*  circumstances, you cannot then declare that anyone who remains as a legitimate military target,
*  which is what's suggested here, a civilian always remains a civilian. Strikingly, the Israeli
*  national broadcaster Can reported, CNN notes, that Benjamin Netanyahu in a closed door meeting
*  with the Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, Knesset's Israeli parliament, said
*  the plan makes a lot of sense. Netanyahu was quoted as saying, it is one of the plans being
*  considered, but there are several others. We are committed to dismantling the civilian control of
*  Hamas. 27 members of the Knesset, including three sitting ministers, wrote urging the government to
*  accept the plan. The Guardian similarly reported that Avicai Bowen, an MP belonging to the ruling
*  Likud party, said the plan was currently being evaluated by the government. Echoing this commitment
*  to a serious war crime, he said, according to the plan, the IDF will evacuate all the civilians who
*  are in the north of Gaza from the border to the Gaza city, and after they will evacuate, the IDF
*  will assume that only the terrorists will remain. When the civilian population is left, you can find
*  and kill all the terrorists without harming the civilians. Again, he must know many civilians will
*  remain, or refuse to leave. And international law does not allow you to simply badge those civilians
*  as military targets. So what's happening? What's happening right now? The IDF has ordered the
*  closure of several hospitals in northern Gaza, including the Kamal Adwan. As the project coordinator
*  for the NGO Medecins Sans Fronti√®res says, the latest move to forcefully and violently push
*  thousands of people from northern Gaza to the south is turning the north into a lifeless desert,
*  while aggravating the situation in the south. Access to water, healthcare and safety is already
*  almost non-existent, and the thought of more people fitting into this space is impossible to imagine.
*  People have been subjected to endless displacement and relentless bombing for the past 12 months.
*  Enough is enough. This must stop now. Just take a moment here. Imagine a state hostile to the west
*  ordered a hospital in a war zone to be emptied of all its patients. Newborn babies in incubators,
*  pregnant women, the severely wounded, the unconscious, those in ICU. It would lead the
*  news as a hideous crime condemned in the most grave tone imaginable by western politicians.
*  But with Israel as normalised, let's just see how the injured are being evacuated.
*  The injured lady tried to get out of the camp. The fire was fired at her.
*  The situation is very difficult and severe.
*  Any vehicles or vehicles will be evacuated.
*  The IDF has encircled Jabalia in northern Gaza, launching ground operations there,
*  justifying that on the grounds Hamas are re-gripping. Over a year of this genocidal
*  mayhem and lo and behold, areas they've already raised from the face of the earth
*  are falling under Hamas control, they're declaring. Because Israel is never going to
*  militarily defeat Hamas, which even some of their own security officials realise you cannot defeat
*  an idea, if you wage a genocidal war against an entire people, then young men in particular
*  are going to take up arms and keep fighting you. It is obvious to anyone with any basic sense.
*  In the midst of this latest onslaught, large numbers are reported killed by Israeli airstrikes
*  on a mosque and a school. Just look at this.
*  That was the only flower warehouse in Jabalia camp, bombed and burned, which can only be
*  understood as a deliberate attempt at starvation. As the author Ahmed Massoud, a brilliant Palestinian
*  writer from Jabalia who I interviewed tweets, thousands of people are surrounded by Israeli
*  tanks in Jabalia, including my sister and my nephew's nieces. Israel is shooting anyone
*  who is trying to leave. They've run out of food or water, how can this possibly be allowed to happen?
*  As a Palestinian Christian human rights activist, Ihab Hassan writes, an Israeli airstrike on Al
*  Yaman Al Saeed hospital in the Jabalia camp north of the Gaza Strip has resulted in initial reports
*  of 21 people killed. The images and footage coming from there are horrifying. Bodies scattered,
*  charred, torn apart, devastation everywhere. This is the only photo I can share. The destruction
*  is unbearable. Meanwhile, the mass slaughter of journalists continues after Israel has already
*  perpetrated the biggest massacre of journalists in recorded history. Few journalists remain alive
*  in northern Gaza. They've mostly been killed. Today, they injured Tamer Labed and the Al Jazeera
*  cameraman Fadi Al Wahidi who was shot in the neck and they killed Mohammed Al Tanini. All of this
*  being facilitated, armed, backed, made possible by the US state. So it was satisfying to see US
*  State Department propagandists Matthew Miller challenged over this. This administration has
*  financed a genocide in Gaza for the last year and every day you're up there denying accountability
*  for it. So I mean, what gives you the right to lecture other countries on their moral? So if you
*  have a policy question for me, I'm happy to take it. If you want to give a speech, there are plenty
*  places in Washington where you can give a speech. Yeah, but people are sick of the
*  bullshit in here. I mean, it is a genocide. You are abetting it and you are risking nuclear war
*  in Ukraine for this. Plenty of other places to give a speech. Go ahead. It's difficult to know
*  what to say. The worst crimes of our age committed over and over and over again in full public view,
*  live streamed on a daily basis, facilitated by the US administration and other Western governments.
*  Well, we have to keep bearing witness. We have to keep speaking the truth because this is a
*  grave crime. One of the worst crimes of our age, a deliberately executed crime. And we must not give
*  up the fight for accountability and justice. Please like and subscribe. Do you have your
