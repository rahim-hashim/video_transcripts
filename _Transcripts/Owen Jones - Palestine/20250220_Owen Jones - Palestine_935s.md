# The Gaza ‘Ceasefire’ Is A RACIST LIE
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04)
*  The so-called ceasefire in Gaza is a racist lie. It's important to discuss this because this so-called [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=0.0s)]
*  ceasefire will soon give way to renewed genocidal violence from Israel. I'm sorry to have to state [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=5.84s)]
*  some gruesome truths here. As Al Jazeera reported on Tuesday, Palestinian security sources told them [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=12.24s)]
*  they had registered 266 violations of the ceasefire agreement which came into force on the 19th of [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  January 32 days ago. Now to be clear, I can't verify all of these. I'll go through them myself [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=25.04s)]
*  to see if they're all accurate. What I would note is these ceasefire violations include the killing [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=31.28s)]
*  of at least 132 Palestinians with more than 900 Palestinians injured and there was a breakdown [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=36.4s)]
*  of those killings to offer up the evidence for them. Now imagine if just one Israeli had been [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=43.68s)]
*  killed in Gaza in this period. If just one had been killed, our media outlets and politicians [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=48.64s)]
*  would not be talking about a ceasefire. Quite the opposite. The killing of that one Israeli would [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=54.0s)]
*  be plastered over news bulletins and front pages. Politicians would be denouncing it. Israel would [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=57.44s)]
*  use that killing as justification for pummeling Gaza all over again. The Palestinian life you see [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=63.36s)]
*  is judged to be meaningless, to have less worth than the common housefly. And when I say no [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=69.28s)]
*  Israelis had been killed during the ceasefire, well that's not entirely true. An Israeli contractor, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=74.56s)]
*  39 year old Jacob Avitan, was killed last Tuesday. He was there demolishing structures, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=79.12s)]
*  according to the Times of Israel. I'd suggest that meant helping to destroy civilian infrastructure. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=84.4s)]
*  We know contractors are doing that. But in any case, who killed him? Well the Israeli army, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=88.80000000000001s)]
*  of course, because they thought he was a Palestinian. Underlying once again how [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=93.68s)]
*  Palestinian civilians have no chance because the Israeli army has repeatedly fired killing [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=97.36000000000001s)]
*  on its own. Presuming they're Palestinians. Indeed, in the first two months of Israel's ground [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=102.96s)]
*  offensive, of the 170 Israeli soldiers killed, 29 were killed by so-called friendly fire and other [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=108.32s)]
*  accidents. Now it's worth just focusing on what may become the pretext to destroy the ceasefire [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=115.11999999999999s)]
*  and unleash genocidal fury against the Palestinian people of Gaza. And that is the tragic fate of the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  Bibbous family, an Israeli family who were taken hostage on the 7th of October. Their father, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=126.4s)]
*  who has now been released, and the mother Shiri, 4 year old Ariel and baby Kefir. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=133.36s)]
*  I've been very clear about this from the very start. Taking civilians hostage is a grave war [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=139.6s)]
*  crime for which there is no excuse or justification. That particularly applies to children and indeed [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=144.08s)]
*  this baby. They should never have been abducted. And in this case, likely by the so-called Mujahideen [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=149.28s)]
*  brigades who were close to Islamic Jihad, they should always have been released. The parade today, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=154.4s)]
*  featuring four coffins on a stage, was grotesque. It should be noted as the telegraph say the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=158.72s)]
*  coffins on stage appeared to be props as different coffins were seen being handed over to the Red [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=163.76s)]
*  Cross by Hamas fighters dressed in black. I say that because it really would have just been beyond [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  grotesque if those coffins contained the remains of people. Now their bodies have now been returned [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=172.96s)]
*  to the Israeli authorities. The three of them of the Biba's family included there. Three, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=180.64s)]
*  the mother and the baby and the small child. Now their fate has become a focus of those Israelis [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=187.67999999999998s)]
*  who wish to avenge their deaths with what in practice would be the mass slaughter of even more [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=195.04s)]
*  babies, children, mothers and other innocent civilians. As the Palestinian analyst Mohamed [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=200.23999999999998s)]
*  Shahada writes in his Zetiyah note, Elon Levy, the former spokesperson of Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=205.76s)]
*  has vowed hell and fury if the Biba's family came back dead. Now firstly, the Israeli state has [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=210.56s)]
*  known that Shibi and his two children have been dead for a long time. In late 2023, Hamas said [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=216.39999999999998s)]
*  that the three Biba's family members had been killed in an Israeli airstrike. To be clear, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=221.6s)]
*  the evidence wasn't provided for that. We'll come on to that. However, there was nothing to be [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=225.35999999999999s)]
*  gained clearly from falsely claiming they were dead at that point. As a senior Israeli official [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=229.36s)]
*  close to Netanyahu apparently told Mohamed Shahada, he promptly conceded they were killed, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  denied that Israel was hiding their fate for propaganda purposes and said the reason their [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=240.32000000000002s)]
*  fate wasn't made official is purely bureaucratic. The military's chief rabbi needs to make this call [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=244.72000000000003s)]
*  and he hasn't, the official apparently told him. Shahada also asked other sources, including the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=249.12s)]
*  Israeli opposition, who confirmed their deaths as well, as well as what he says were two [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=254.0s)]
*  senior Palestinian officials directly involved in the ceasefire negotiations who claimed they'd [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=259.2s)]
*  been killed in an Israeli airstrike just prior to their planned release during the first temporary [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=263.04s)]
*  ceasefire of November 2023. We can hear this from Diana Magne, a Sky News international [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=267.44s)]
*  correspondent this morning reporting from Jerusalem. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=273.68s)]
*  Indeed, the Israeli journalist Yuri Mizgav is amongst those who have stated that the three [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=284.0s)]
*  were killed by Israeli missile strikes. Now, the charge there is that the Israeli state knew [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=300.96s)]
*  all along that the three Bibas family members had been killed and they pretended otherwise as part [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=306.32s)]
*  of a cynical disinformation campaign to focus Israeli minds on the alleged continued captivity [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=310.72s)]
*  of these children, their deaths now being used to build support for a new genocidal onslaught. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=316.16s)]
*  Now, to be clear, obviously I don't know how the Bibas family members were killed, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=321.76000000000005s)]
*  clearly I don't have the evidence. We do know that multiple Israeli hostages have been killed [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=325.6s)]
*  by the Israeli state and that is a fact. There was notoriously, of course, the three Israeli [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=330.96000000000004s)]
*  hostages shirtless and thus clearly unarmed, waving away white flag and yelling in Hebrew [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=335.52s)]
*  who were killed by the Israeli army in December 2023. We know that last September the Israeli [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=341.2s)]
*  army said there was a high probability that three hostages found dead in December 2023 were killed [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=346.71999999999997s)]
*  in Israeli airstrike, which itself took place in November 2023, striking that apparently took that [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=352.32s)]
*  long for the Israeli army to confirm this. In December, the Israeli military announced that [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=358.56s)]
*  the deaths of six hostages recovered from Gaza were probably linked to an Israeli airstrike [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=362.88s)]
*  against Hamas near where they were being held. Those bodies were recovered in late August. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=367.12s)]
*  The airstrike took place in February 2024. In a statement, the military said at the time of the [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=371.6s)]
*  strike, the military had no information, not even a suspicion that the hostages in the underground [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=377.52s)]
*  compound with its vicinity had such information been available, the strike could not have been [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=382.15999999999997s)]
*  carried out. Well, I don't really need to tell you that if Israeli hostages are being killed in [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=386.4s)]
*  that manner. And such attacks with the Israeli army then claiming they had no idea they were [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=390.08s)]
*  there. What hope for Palestinian civilians. Indeed, an investigation by the Israeli-Palestinian [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=394.24s)]
*  media outlet plus nine seven two magazine detailed the killing of three Israeli hostages by Israeli [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=398.71999999999997s)]
*  attacks. As one Israeli intelligence sources quoted as saying, while attacks were aborted when there [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=403.76s)]
*  was specific definitive intelligence indicating the presence of a hostage, the army routinely [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=409.03999999999996s)]
*  authorized strikes when the intelligence picture was murky and there was a general likelihood that [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=413.76s)]
*  hostages were present in the vicinity of a target. And the intelligence source told them mistakes [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=418.24s)]
*  definitely happened and we bombed hostages. But nine seven two magazine also say the following. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=422.88s)]
*  However, plus nine seven two and local call have learned that the military's claims that it had no [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=428.8s)]
*  intelligence that hostages were being held near Gando is false. This is one of the strikes. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=433.12s)]
*  Three security sources with knowledge of the attacks planning revealed that the Shin Betts [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=437.44s)]
*  operation division, which led the strike, had received additional vague intelligence that could [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=441.28000000000003s)]
*  indicate a medium likelihood of hostages presence at the site. They further say that according to [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=445.68s)]
*  the Israeli intelligence sources, the large gray area between having a positive indication of the [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=451.2s)]
*  presence of the hostages and being able to rule out the presence enabled dozens of strikes that [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=455.92s)]
*  endangered and killed hostages. Indeed, when Israeli hostages were released during the December [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=460.64s)]
*  twenty twenty three ceasefire, they repeatedly told media outlets that they were terrified by [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=465.52s)]
*  Israeli bombings and feared the Israeli airstrikes would kill them. Well, let's be blunt here. This [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=470.32s)]
*  really is just stating the obvious. The Israeli state has carpet bombed Gaza. Gaza is no bigger [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=474.4s)]
*  than East London. Israel has launched weapons against this tiny strip of land with the combined [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=478.79999999999995s)]
*  explosive power of several Hiroshima bombs. That has resulted in the mass slaughter of so many [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=484.4s)]
*  innocent Palestinians, including Palestinian babies, toddlers, children, teenagers, men, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=489.35999999999996s)]
*  women, the elderly, the infirm, the disabled. Clearly several Israeli hostages were always [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=493.84s)]
*  going to be killed given that level of criminal bombardment that doesn't absolve the captors of [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=499.6s)]
*  the crime of kidnapping civilians. It's to point out that a genocidal frenzy, which was justified [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=504.8s)]
*  by retrieving hostages, actually endangered those hostages to bring them home was a lie as far as [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=509.92s)]
*  the Israeli government were concerned and that more Israeli hostages have been killed by the [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=516.0s)]
*  Israeli army than have been rescued by military means by Israeli army. Obviously, significant [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=519.76s)]
*  numbers of Israeli hostages have only been released as part of ceasefires in which [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=524.88s)]
*  prisoners, Palestinian prisoners, many of whom should be considered hostages have been released [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=530.88s)]
*  as well. Well, the return of the bodies of the Bibas family has reignited genocidal fervour. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=535.52s)]
*  The Republican majority of the House Foreign Affairs Committee in the U.S. tweets, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=540.96s)]
*  Hamas executed a mother and her two children in cold blood. This is barbarism. Israel has every [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=545.52s)]
*  right to finish the job and eradicate these terrorists from the face of the earth. Well, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=550.64s)]
*  they don't have any evidence or providing evidence that Hamas did that. In any case, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=555.04s)]
*  every right to finish the job in practice means given what's already happened to Gaza, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=560.8s)]
*  I mean, just mass extermination. The Israeli actor Yigal Adika posted, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=566.96s)]
*  if children are not coming back alive, Gaza has no right to exist. Other accounts of ASC say, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=572.08s)]
*  Israel can do whatever they want to do to Gaza as far as I'm concerned. Another flattened Gaza, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=576.88s)]
*  I don't give a fuck. Honestly, there's endless amounts of this. Now here's the thing. I'm on [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=581.92s)]
*  Team Don't Harm Children as well as Team Don't Harm Innocent Civilians. At the beginning of this [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=586.96s)]
*  year, according to the official figures, which expert studies have repeatedly shown to be likely [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=591.92s)]
*  severe underestimates, 1,091 Palestinian babies have been killed by Israeli violence since October [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=596.48s)]
*  2023, including 238 babies who were born after 7th October. Many of these were in bombings where [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=603.12s)]
*  the Israeli army knows there are babies and indeed children who are they going to blow up. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=610.88s)]
*  You see, the Israeli army preferred to attack their targets chosen through artificial intelligence [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=615.36s)]
*  and arbitrary criteria when they returned to their family homes, often of course, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=620.64s)]
*  where their children were, where their babies were. And do you know what? They called that [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=625.36s)]
*  automated system, tracking targeted individuals and blowing them up when they got home as plus [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=629.6s)]
*  972 magazine exposed. Where's Daddy? What do you even say? So many Palestinian babies, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=634.32s)]
*  burned alive, choked to death under rubble, their little frail bodies blown apart. No fury, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=643.52s)]
*  no outrage for those babies and children, like little Osama who liked to play with his parents. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=648.08s)]
*  Like ISIL and Assad, baby twins. Their father went to get their birth certificates as he left, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=654.08s)]
*  the Israeli army blew up his home, killing those twins and their mother. He had to go and get [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=659.36s)]
*  their death certificates instead. Like 5 year old Hin Rajab and her four cousins, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=664.16s)]
*  as well as their aunt and uncle. As an expert study by Forensic Architecture found, there's [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=668.64s)]
*  no way the Israeli army could not have known who they were slaughtering, it was broad daylight, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=672.72s)]
*  the tank was right next to the car and the tank repeatedly fired on that car. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=676.72s)]
*  Which brings us back to the naked racism of all of this. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=680.96s)]
*  If you're a decent human being, if you're humane, if you're the most basic more compass, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=684.4000000000001s)]
*  then you believe that all babies, all children have equal worth, have equal value. You believe [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=689.6s)]
*  that the life of a Palestinian baby has just as much worth as an Israeli baby. Those now using [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=694.6400000000001s)]
*  the fate of the Bibi Asse family to justify the renewed slaughter of Gaza don't care at all about [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=701.12s)]
*  those Palestinian babies, and do you know what? They're not even pretending to. Literally, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=706.72s)]
*  no emotional reaction whatsoever. They are actively cheering on a renewed onslaught which they [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=711.76s)]
*  know as a fact would kill so many more Palestinian babies and children. I'll be honest with you, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=716.4s)]
*  it chills me to my bone, it makes me nauseous, it disgusts me. These people have allowed their [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=722.64s)]
*  humanity to rot away and their souls are black. I can't even imagine being these people. It's like [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=727.36s)]
*  an alien species. If you showed one of them a photograph of a slaughtered baby, a heinous [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=735.9200000000001s)]
*  thing to do, I accept, and you told them it was an Israeli baby killed by Hamas, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=742.64s)]
*  they would feel anger, disgust, grief, revulsion. If you then told them it was actually a Palestinian [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=748.08s)]
*  baby killed by the Israeli military, what would happen? I'll tell you, those emotions would [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=752.72s)]
*  immediately vanish. That's the truth. How disturbing is that? Indeed, this fleshes out what the [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=756.48s)]
*  Palestinian-Canadian lawyer Dianna Buti said about how nothing justifies 7th October, but [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=763.44s)]
*  everything can be justified by 7th October. To those responding to the news about the [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=768.5600000000001s)]
*  Bibas family by making it clear they support flattening Gaza, unleashing hell against Gaza, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=773.2s)]
*  in other words, objective grotesque war crimes which would kill so many more innocent people. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=778.96s)]
*  When Palestinian militants who committed war crimes in 7th October justified those crimes by [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=784.0s)]
*  pointing to Israeli atrocities, how did you respond to that exactly? In just 2023 alone, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=788.4000000000001s)]
*  around 40 Palestinian children alone had been killed. And that's without talking about decades [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=794.1600000000001s)]
*  of ethnic cleansing, brutal occupation, siege, colonisation, apartheid, land theft, mass [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=800.96s)]
*  incarceration, the slaughter of thousands of Palestinians before 7th October. In your case, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=805.44s)]
*  you look at the fate of the Bibas family and say, unleash hell against Gaza, making clear you do not [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=811.36s)]
*  care it was killed as a consequence, but you would find such justifications for 7th October obscene. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=816.6400000000001s)]
*  And you know what, if anyone in this country tried making those justifications, they wouldn't just [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=822.1600000000001s)]
*  have their career ended, they'd go to prison, or they'd be arrested. The psychology of racism, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=827.9200000000001s)]
*  the depravity, the inhumanity of it will never, never stop disturbing me. This whole genocide [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=834.5600000000001s)]
*  has been a carnival of the most obscene and shameless racism, with Palestinian life, up to [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=841.76s)]
*  and including babies and children treated as utterly meaningless, without any pretense, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=847.36s)]
*  no attempt to disguise it. Well, I'm afraid this so-called ceasefire is going to fall apart when [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=852.64s)]
*  Israel finds an excuse to unleash vicious genocide or bloodshed and try and enact the plan of Donald [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=857.04s)]
*  Trump to empty out its survivors, which itself would only happen with unbelievable amounts of [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=863.04s)]
*  murderous violence. The fate of the Bibas family is partly being used to justify that, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=871.12s)]
*  but that is not how the deaths, the killings of children should ever be used, not to argue [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=878.0s)]
*  for the killing of even more, far more children and babies. That's genocidal racism, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ3jAmC5X04&t=886.72s)]
