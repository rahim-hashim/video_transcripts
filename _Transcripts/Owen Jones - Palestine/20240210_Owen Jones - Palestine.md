# Israel's Allies Panic In Desperate Effort To Deflect Blame
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [February 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRTHMRKqA2I)
*  Too late. Much, much too late.
*  Those western states who have aided and abetted Israel's crimes from the very start
*  are trying to parade their consciences to the world.
*  They're panicking a bit.
*  Why?
*  Because they're now fully aware that the sheer scale of horror being unleashed against the Palestinian people
*  by the Israeli state is impossible to suppress
*  and that even greater horror is yet to come.
*  And they know that, as it turns out, their voters aren't all a bunch of sociopaths,
*  that despite the monstrous dehumanisation of the Palestinian people,
*  despite the media coverage which has been overall, with brave exceptions,
*  nothing short of a disgrace,
*  erasing the actual scale of the atrocities being committed,
*  that despite all of that,
*  most people don't actually like watching tens of thousands of innocents Irileans,
*  many of them children, being butchered and starved to death.
*  Let's listen first to Joe Biden, who has been nicknamed Genocide Joe
*  because of how he has directly aided and abetted this from the very start.
*  I'm of the view, as you know, that the conduct of the response
*  in Gaza, in the Gaza Strip has been over the top.
*  Over the top. Over the top.
*  That's one way of putting it.
*  And we'll come on to what over the top means right now in practice
*  and crucially what the involvement of Biden and the US has been in this over the top response.
*  Meanwhile, John Finer, a deputy national security adviser,
*  reportedly told Arab-American leaders in Michigan,
*  crucially in a closed meeting,
*  obviously you can't say this in public,
*  that the administration had made mistakes,
*  We are very well aware that we have missteps in the course of responding to this crisis
*  since October 7th.
*  Missteps. That's one way of describing what's happened.
*  Woefully too little. Woefully too late.
*  Who next? Oh, the German state. Let's talk about them.
*  Their foreign minister is Annalena Baerbüch.
*  And she tweets,
*  A large scale IDF offensive in Ra'athat would be a humanitarian catastrophe in the making.
*  The people of Gaza cannot vanish into thin air.
*  She goes on,
*  Israel must defend itself against Hamas.
*  At the same time, it must do whatever it can to alleviate civilian suffering.
*  That's why another humanitarian pause is needed.
*  Also to finally get the hostages home.
*  How to get there will be on my agenda when I visit Israel next week.
*  Let's just deal with the first part, shall we?
*  Germany has backed Israel's mass slaughter from the very beginning.
*  Why? Because within living memory,
*  the German state attempted to exterminate the entire Jewish population of Europe
*  and murdered two thirds of them
*  and then elected to make the Palestinian people pay for that crime.
*  Well, Annalena Baerbüch, the people of Gaza, of course, will not vanish into thin air.
*  And you know that. They will suffer hideous violent deaths at the hands of the Israeli state.
*  They will be blown apart by bombs or riddled with bullets.
*  They will be starved, deprived of clean water, exposed to the elements for lack of shelter.
*  They will die of treatable medical conditions
*  because Gaza's medical system has been destroyed by the Israeli state.
*  All of this in part because of you.
*  The German state, both historically, but crucially in the here and now
*  because of the cover you have offered the Israeli state.
*  And more to the point, your authorities have targeted and silenced over and over again
*  those voices who have sought to oppose the mass murder you now fret over,
*  including, it must be said, hugely courageous Jewish people who have spoken out.
*  You say Israel must defend itself against Hamas, followed by at the same time,
*  it must do whatever it can to alleviate civilian suffering,
*  even though, as anyone by this point knows,
*  unless they are either terminally disingenuous or terminally stupid,
*  or to be fair, indeed both,
*  mass civilian suffering is integral to how Israel has defined defending itself against Hamas.
*  A humanitarian pause, otherwise known as stopping the killing for a week or two
*  and then regime it all over again.
*  Now, let's just discuss what they're all panicking about.
*  At the very start, the Israeli state ordered the Palestinian population of northern Gaza to flee.
*  This was the war crime of forcible displacement.
*  The claim was that actually the south would be safe.
*  This was a lie.
*  And indeed, by late December, Israel used £2,000 bonds on area it had designated safe
*  for civilians to evacuate at least 200 times.
*  The Palestinian population of Gaza, in large part, were driven to Khan Yunis.
*  Then it was attacked.
*  And then they fled to Ra'afah in the very south, on the border of Egypt.
*  The pre-war population of Ra'afah was 280,000.
*  Now, more than half of Gaza's 2.2 or 2.3 million people have been driven there.
*  So yesterday, the Israeli prime minister's office tweeted,
*  it is impossible to achieve the goal of the war of eliminating Hamas
*  by leaving four Hamas battalions in Ra'afah.
*  On the contrary, it is clear that intense activity in Ra'afah
*  requires that civilians evacuate the areas of combat.
*  Therefore, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered the IDF
*  and the security establishment to submit to the cabinet
*  a combined plan for evacuating the population and destroying the battalions.
*  Where? Where are they supposed to flee to?
*  Where? There is nowhere for them to go.
*  Nowhere. As Germany knows and the United States knows.
*  That's the reason for the pack, isn't it?
*  A ground invasion of Ra'afah would be an epic, horrifying humanitarian catastrophe.
*  Mass death.
*  And indeed, there's every reason to believe Israel is actually seeking
*  to drive the Palestinian population into Egypt's Sinai desert
*  in a murderous act of ethnic cleansing to empty Gaza of its Palestinian population.
*  In any case, this will constitute mass murder.
*  Now listen to the courageous Israeli journalist Gideon Levy who I've interviewed.
*  Do you think US concerns are likely to make any real difference
*  to what Benjamin Netanyahu is planning?
*  No, as long as the US core remarks are only remarks or concerns
*  and they are not followed by practical measures, Israel will ignore it.
*  Excuse me for my voice, but I'm still fine.
*  In any case, Israel learns to ignore advisers.
*  If the United States wants to prevent the next catastrophe
*  and Ra'afah is going to be a major catastrophe,
*  the US has to be precise and take measures.
*  Otherwise, it will not work.
*  So when I just read out the latest line from Israel's Prime Minister ordering his military
*  to plan ways to evacuate civilians in Ra'afah so he can carry out the intention
*  to target Hamas, what do you make of that?
*  Is that just words?
*  Is that to deflect some of the criticism that is already coming his way, do you think?
*  I want to ask you where to?
*  And that's the point.
*  There is nowhere for them to go.
*  But all of this is happening with US complicity because their words mean nothing.
*  They could pull the plug with their actions at any moment, yet they choose not to.
*  Meanwhile, Philippe Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA,
*  the UN mission in charge of the welfare of Palestinian refugees,
*  the main humanitarian agency in Gaza, which Western states have financially throttled
*  based on completely unevidenced Israeli claims,
*  he has declared that Israel is blocking a month's supply of food
*  for 1.1 million Palestinians in Gaza at Ashdod port.
*  Israel has apparently, according to him, ordered the contractor not to move it.
*  According to the UN's humanitarian coordination agency, Oka,
*  more than half the aid missions in northern Gaza were denied access last month,
*  with Israeli forces increasingly interfering with the delivery of aid.
*  Residents are now resorting to grinding animal feed into flour to survive.
*  But they're running out of those grains too.
*  Acute malnutrition amongst the young children of Gaza is surging.
*  As the World Food Programme regional chief, Matt Hollingworth, says,
*  we know there is a very serious risk of famine in Gaza
*  if we don't provide very significant volumes of food assistance on a regular basis.
*  As the Médecins Sans Frontières report, according to UNICEF,
*  at least half of the water and sanitation facilities in Gaza
*  have been destroyed or damaged,
*  while UNRWA reports that around 70% of people in Gaza
*  are drinking salinised or contaminated water.
*  Meanwhile, Israeli soldiers keep broadcasting their war crimes on TikTok,
*  showing how much they are relishing and reveling in the mass slaughter and destruction of Gaza.
*  That means the mass murder of innocent civilians.
*  Let's just talk about one example.
*  On the 29th of January, a six-year-old girl called Haim Rajab
*  rang the Palestine Red Crescent begging them to save her.
*  She was surrounded by the bodies of her dead relatives,
*  her uncle, her aunt, her cousins.
*  Her 15-year-old cousin, Leyan Hamadesh,
*  she'd run them first, telling them her parents and siblings had been killed.
*  They are shooting at us.
*  The tank is next to me, she reported.
*  Her call was cut off by what sounded like gunfire.
*  So this little six-year-old girl rang, begging the Red Crescent,
*  come take me, you will come and take me.
*  I'm so scared, please come.
*  She said it was getting dark and she was scared of the dark.
*  An ambulance crew was sent out to rescue her by the Red Crescent,
*  its coordinates shared with the Israeli military.
*  But contact was lost with them and with Haim.
*  And today, the burned-out ambulance was found,
*  the ambulance workers murdered.
*  And the car just nearby with the badly decomposed bodies of Haim and her loved ones.
*  What do you say?
*  What do you say?
*  What do you say?
*  That such horror on an unimaginable scale is being tolerated,
*  speaks to the total dehumanisation of the Palestinian people.
*  If these were people who were seen as people like us,
*  not even a fraction of this would be tolerated.
*  But crucially, all of this happened and is happening
*  because the United States and its Western allies allowed it to happen.
*  Every step of the way.
*  The Biden administration specifically gave Israel the weapons it needed,
*  bypassing Congress to do so and gave it diplomatic and political cover.
*  Biden himself used his platform, the biggest megaphone on earth,
*  to claim atrocities on 7th October, not to deny that war crime did happen on 7th October,
*  but atrocities which never happened, like the beheadings of palace of Israeli babies,
*  to justify the onslaught against Gaza, which then happened.
*  So yes, a massacre of Rafah now beckons and the US and its allies are very clear about that.
*  The people of Gaza are beginning to starve to death.
*  And so the governments which allowed this to happen are panicking about the reputation
*  of the consequences for them because if they cared about Palestinian life,
*  they would have made very different choices from beginning to end.
*  Well, it's too late.
*  Everything that's happened is on them.
*  And the horrors that are yet to happen are on them as well.
