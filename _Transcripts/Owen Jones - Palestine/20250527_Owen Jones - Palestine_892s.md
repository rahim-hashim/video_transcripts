# Israeli Ex-PM ADMITS Genocide
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M)
*  Israel is waging a deliberate war of extermination. That's according to the former Prime Minister [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=0.0s)]
*  of Israel, Ehud Olmah, who himself, it should be said, perpetrated war crimes against the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=6.4s)]
*  Palestinian people. It's in a devastating piece written for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz and in [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=12.16s)]
*  practice constitutes a confession to genocide. Let's go through what he's written and why this [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  is so important. Now, Olmah says this, the Israeli government is waging a pointless war without a [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=24.16s)]
*  clear goal or plan and without any chance of success. Since its establishment, the state of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=29.92s)]
*  Israel has never initiated such a war. In this too, the gang of criminals headed by Benjamin [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=35.2s)]
*  Netanyahu has set a precedent that is unparalleled in the history of the state. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=40.72s)]
*  Now, I should just quickly note, other than the revisionism there, the air rushing of Israeli war [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=45.6s)]
*  crimes throughout its entire history, I should quickly note that Olmah was a member of Netanyahu's [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=50.64s)]
*  Likud party for over three decades. From 1973, the year was founded until 2006. He then went off [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=56.24s)]
*  to join Kadima, which was presented as a so-called moderate party, despite being led by Ariel Sharon, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=63.84s)]
*  a right-wing war criminal. He goes on to say this, what is happening in the Gaza Strip in recent [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=69.92s)]
*  weeks has nothing to do with the goal of a legitimate war. Our fighters are being sent by [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=75.68s)]
*  the state leadership and the army leadership that obeys it to rampage in the neighborhoods of Gaza [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=81.28s)]
*  City, Jabalia and Karn Younis in an illegitimate military campaign. This is now a political [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=85.92s)]
*  private war and its immediate result is turning the Gaza Strip into a humanitarian disaster zone. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=92.48s)]
*  He goes on to say that he has, until this point, rebutted accusations made against the IDF and [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=99.52s)]
*  the Israeli state in terms of conduct in Gaza, including accusations of genocide and war crimes. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=104.48s)]
*  He puts himself forward for interviews for Western media outlets, saying, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=112.64s)]
*  More than once in interviews, I disappointed those who invited me when I firmly claimed [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=116.4s)]
*  that Israel was not committing war crimes in Gaza. Excessive killings? Yes, an unimaginable [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=121.04s)]
*  number of uninvolved victims, including children, women and the elderly, did occur. But I argued [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=125.84s)]
*  firmly and with self-convincing conviction, in no case was an order given by a decision-maker at [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=132.24s)]
*  the political level to harm civilians in Gaza without distinction. The large number of uninvolved [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=140.0s)]
*  civilians killed in Gaza was unreasonable, unjustifiable and unacceptable, but all of them, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=144.8s)]
*  I said, in every media channel in the world, were the result of a brutal war. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=149.76s)]
*  Al Mubarak is saying that he used his position and authority to push back at those of us who [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=154.96s)]
*  have been saying very clearly and obviously since the genocide began that Israel was committing [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=159.36s)]
*  and is committing heinous war crimes on a daily basis. That's because of the overwhelming evidence [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=164.24s)]
*  and indeed the publicly repeated statements of genocidal and criminal intent by Israeli leaders [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=169.6s)]
*  are not engaged in atrocity denial in the face of all the facts and should be made to account for [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=175.04s)]
*  that. That doesn't mean what should be regarded as a confession of Israeli crimes and genocide [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=180.0s)]
*  isn't important given who he is. Now he says this war should have ended as early as early 2024 and [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  it continues without justification, without a defined goal or without a political vision [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=191.84s)]
*  for the future of the Gaza Strip and in time at least. He also says that he had argued that the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=196.0s)]
*  Israeli army did not operate an order or directive or intention from a senior command echelon to harm [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=200.32s)]
*  civilians indiscriminately. Therefore, he says, as he had stood at the time, no war crimes were [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=206.4s)]
*  committed. He goes on to say that he had denied the crimes committed by Israel, but in recent weeks, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=211.28s)]
*  I have been unable to do so. What we are doing in Gaza is a war of extermination, indiscriminate, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  unrestrained, cruel and criminal killing of civilians. We are doing this not because of an [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=221.84s)]
*  accidental loss of control in a certain sector, not because of a disproportionate outburst of [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=226.96s)]
*  fighters in some unit, but as a result of a policy dictated by the government knowingly, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=232.0s)]
*  intentionally, viciously, maliciously with recklessness. Yes, we are committing war crimes. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=237.12s)]
*  So there it is, a war of extermination. That's what he says. Israel is perpetrating an indiscriminate, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=244.48000000000002s)]
*  unrestrained, cruel and criminal killing of civilians. And he makes clear this is not [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=250.72s)]
*  happening because of some sort of breakdown in discipline, but because of an intentional [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=255.76s)]
*  deliberate policy directed by Israel's rulers. This is a crucial admission because this former [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=259.84s)]
*  Israeli prime minister, who has knowledge, of course, of running the Israeli state machinery, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=265.2s)]
*  of directing the army, has insight and understanding of Israeli politics. He's no fringe [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=268.88s)]
*  figure in Israeli society, but a politician who emerged from the Israeli rights. He's telling the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=273.44s)]
*  world that Israel is deliberately waging a war of extermination against civilians at the direction [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=278.8s)]
*  of the Israeli government. He goes on, first, the starvation of Gaza. On this issue, the position [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=284.0s)]
*  of senior government officials is open and clear. Yes, we are depriving the residents of Gaza of [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=289.04s)]
*  food, medicine and minimal means of subsistence as part of a declared policy. Netanyahu is trying, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  as usual, to obscure the nature of the instructions he gives in order to evade his legal and criminal [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=299.28000000000003s)]
*  responsibility when the time comes. But some of his eunuchs say it openly and publicly and even [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=304.08s)]
*  proudly. Yes, we will starve Gaza because all the residents of Gaza are Hamas and therefore there is [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=309.91999999999996s)]
*  no moral or operational limit to destroying them all. More than two million people. Israeli media [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=315.84s)]
*  channels, each for their own reasons, some of which are understandable, are trying to moderate [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=321.28s)]
*  the picture of what is happening in Gaza. But the picture seen in the world is much broader and, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=324.71999999999997s)]
*  above all, shocking. It is impossible to be even-handed and indifferent to it. It is no longer [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=329.03999999999996s)]
*  possible to ignore and shake our heads as if the world's reaction to what is happening there is [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=333.52s)]
*  simply a widespread outbreak of antisemitism because, after all, everyone hates us and everyone [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=338.32s)]
*  is anti-Semite. Everyone is anti-Semitic. So here the former Israeli prime minister makes [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=343.35999999999996s)]
*  clear that the Israeli state is deliberately starving Gaza, which is a grave war crime and, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=348.47999999999996s)]
*  indeed, forms the central basis of the arrest warrants for war crimes and crimes against [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=353.2s)]
*  humanity against Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence minister, Yov Galan. I'm not [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=357.84s)]
*  though suggesting that, indeed, Netanyahu may well face trial. He may well face justice for [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=362.08s)]
*  what he has done, that he's trying to, in some way, cover his own backside because of future [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=369.03999999999996s)]
*  legal proceedings. Though, I mean, the evidence is so overwhelming, what is the point, frankly? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=374.8s)]
*  And as he notes, as the repeated statements by Israeli leaders and officials have made clear, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=379.84s)]
*  they see no distinction at all between the civilian population of Gaza and Hamas, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=385.12s)]
*  those they deem military targets. And when he says there is no moral or operational limit to [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=389.52s)]
*  destroy them all, more than two million people, he could not be clearer. That's genocide. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=394.4s)]
*  The Genocide Convention states that genocide constitutes acts committed with intent to [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=398.4s)]
*  destroy in whole or in part a national, ethnical, racial or religious group. He refers to the [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=403.44s)]
*  evidence for the shocking plight of Gaza that the world has access to and also refers to the [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=409.35999999999996s)]
*  malicious and false use of antisemitism to shut down any scrutiny of Israel and its crimes. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=413.92s)]
*  He goes on to note European leaders, he calls Friends of Israel breaking ranks [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=420.08000000000004s)]
*  to condemn its murderous behaviour. He goes on to say we continue to massacre [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=424.56s)]
*  Palestinian civilians in the West Bank as well. He says that the declaration by the head of the [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=428.96000000000004s)]
*  Samaria Regional Council, Yossi Dagan, that Palestinian villages should be annihilated [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=434.48s)]
*  is a declaration of genocide. He further makes the point that the pogroms taking place in the [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=439.28s)]
*  West Bank are not isolated incidents. He says when a Palestinian village is burned, and quite a few [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=445.35999999999996s)]
*  have already been burned, they would explain to us that the perpetrators are a small violent group [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=451.03999999999996s)]
*  that does not represent the residents of the territories. This is a lie. They are many. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=455.52s)]
*  He says it's impossible to ignore the behaviour of certain units in the IDF, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=461.11999999999995s)]
*  including what he describes as the elite units where the best and most courageous fighters serve. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=465.28s)]
*  He says there are too many cases of brutal shooting of civilians, of destruction of property [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=470.32s)]
*  and homes, even when this should not happen. He discusses the looting of property thefts from [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=475.76s)]
*  homes, which in many cases IDF soldiers have also taken pride in and published in personal posts. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=479.91999999999996s)]
*  We are committing war crimes. He's alluding there to IDF soldiers boasting of their war crimes. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=485.52s)]
*  Never has a crime been so confessed to and boasted about as it was actually happening. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=492.24s)]
*  That's what we see all the time. IDF soldiers have posted online because they're high on their own [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=498.08s)]
*  hubris. They're high on their sense that nothing will ever happen to them, so they can flout [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=503.59999999999997s)]
*  their criminality, their genocidal mania. He notes too, of course, the pogroms in the West Bank, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=509.2s)]
*  which must not be neglected. The murderous rampage taking place in the West Bank itself. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=515.1999999999999s)]
*  Which, as he notes, is not isolated incidents, but systemic. On one level, it's frankly ridiculous [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=521.76s)]
*  that we have to engage in a debate about whether the Israeli army is waging a war of extermination [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=529.4399999999999s)]
*  against the Palestinian people and committing the most depraved, imaginable war crimes. It's like [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=533.28s)]
*  arguing about whether the earth is flat or not, except it's about death on an unimaginable mass [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=537.92s)]
*  scale. What's absolutely important right now is that we build an absolutely undeniable consensus [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=543.28s)]
*  that these war crimes and indeed genocide is taking place, both to stop the West facilitating [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=548.56s)]
*  this abomination, for example, through arms sales and diplomatic support, and to get accountability [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=553.4399999999999s)]
*  and justice for those who have facilitated this genocide, not just in Israel, but of course across [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=558.4799999999999s)]
*  the West. I would note that for saying the sorts of things this Israeli former prime minister has [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=563.4399999999999s)]
*  said, people are being threatened, deplatformed, silenced, sacked, arrested, and even faced with [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=568.2399999999999s)]
*  deportation. I would also note the minimal coverage in the Western media about this. It's [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=574.4s)]
*  ridiculous. I mean, the former Israeli prime minister has just gone out and said that Israel [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=579.68s)]
*  is committing genocide, a war of extermination, terrible war crimes, an Israeli prime minister who [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=584.48s)]
*  was in Benjamin Netanyahu's own party for over three decades. Why isn't that newsworthy? Why [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=592.24s)]
*  isn't that plastered everywhere? I think, to be honest, because it would just show the, or expose [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=597.68s)]
*  the catastrophic failure of coverage. It's not failure, I know it's a mistake. There's a systemic [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=605.04s)]
*  problem in the Western media, instead of how they've covered this, because it's so blindingly [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=610.8s)]
*  obvious what Israel is doing. This would just emphasize to Western audiences how they've been [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=614.4799999999999s)]
*  deliberately misled by the Western media about what's taking place. It also exposes, of course, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=619.28s)]
*  Western leaders because they have facilitated all of this. They armed and backed it all the way [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=624.4s)]
*  through, despite all the overwhelming evidence which even the former Israeli prime minister, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=628.0799999999999s)]
*  Ehud Elmah, can see for himself. This itself exposes them criminally for what they've done. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=632.72s)]
*  Now, we should note that where Elmah was Israeli prime minister, he committed war crimes in Gaza, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=640.88s)]
*  specifically in the 2008-2009 onslaught. In fact, he even declared at the time, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=645.52s)]
*  we've said that after this rocket fire against the south of the country, there will be a severe [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=650.08s)]
*  and disproportionate Israeli response to the fire on the citizens of Israel and its security forces. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=654.0s)]
*  Outright coming out and committing to a disproportionate response is itself a [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=659.04s)]
*  confession of war crimes. The point is that even this former Israeli prime minister has come out [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=662.32s)]
*  and said what is undeniable. And the cracks continue to emerge. The German state, which has [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=666.72s)]
*  a history of committing genocide, of course the Holocaust, the industrialized extermination of the [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=671.2s)]
*  Jewish people, as well as Roma, others classed as undesirable. And of course, in Africa, with the [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=676.0s)]
*  Herero and Nama genocides, it's continued that theme, of course, by backing and facilitating [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=682.24s)]
*  Israel's genocide. Well, now its right-wing chancellor, Friedrich Meyers, a militantly pro-Israel [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=686.48s)]
*  politician, says he could frankly no longer understand the goal of what the Israeli army [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=691.28s)]
*  is doing in the Gaza Strip. To harm the civilian population in such a way, as has increasingly been [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=696.48s)]
*  the case in recent days, can no longer be justified by a fight against Hamas terrorism. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=700.96s)]
*  Once again, captain obvious there. And the way he makes it out was that this is a recent phenomenon. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=706.72s)]
*  I mean, Israel is doing what it's done from the beginning. This isn't, I mean, they're trying to [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=711.76s)]
*  make it out like, well, this was one thing before, it was a military campaign that's sort of gone off [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=715.84s)]
*  the boil. It's gone extreme. It's gone, it's spun out of control recently. This has been a criminal [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=720.88s)]
*  genocidal onslaught from the beginning. And they're trying to pretend that isn't the case [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=728.72s)]
*  because it exposes them. But this does again underline how it is all falling apart. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=736.16s)]
*  Now Israel continues to commit the most obscene crimes imaginable in front of the whole world. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=742.96s)]
*  This weekend, dozens of Palestinians were slaughtered when the Israeli military struck [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=748.16s)]
*  Fahmy al-Jaghari school in Gaza. Children were burned alive on camera. Palestinian children [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=752.4s)]
*  burned alive by the West. Let's be clear, that's what's happening here. The West is responsible for [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=760.64s)]
*  this. It is a Western crime. The whole world can see it. And if you think the West will escape the [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=766.16s)]
*  inevitable consequences, then naivety doesn't even cover it. Soaring, then the reaping. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=770.64s)]
*  The mass butchery of innocent people, including children, has been a central feature of Israel's [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=777.1999999999999s)]
*  genocide. On Friday night, one of those children killed was 11-year-old Yakin Hamad, known as Gaza's [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=781.6s)]
*  youngest influencer. She offered practical tips on survival with smiling, happy videos in unbearable [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=789.28s)]
*  circumstances. Ice cream. Today we are distributing to the students of Aisha and the children of Gaza. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=796.88s)]
*  The invention of war. Didn't they cut off our gas? Here we made gas and are putting wood here. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=805.52s)]
*  And we boil everything on it. Gaza, no to the impossible. How was a crime so monumental, so [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=811.76s)]
*  obscene, so shameless, ever possible? Future generations will debate this at length. Entire books, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=818.0s)]
*  conferences will be dedicated to this. Entire fields of study. So let those future generations [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=822.96s)]
*  know the evidence at the time all the way through was overwhelming. There was no excuse for not [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=828.5600000000001s)]
*  knowing from the very start what was happening. Don't indulge any future lies or current lies [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=833.0400000000001s)]
*  about people with power and influence, not knowing what was really going on. They knew. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=838.4s)]
*  They knew everything. This genocide happened because Western states consciously made it happen. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=843.1999999999999s)]
*  They directed it in practice. And it all happened with the direct facilitation of the Western media. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P47k9v-vd1M&t=849.36s)]
