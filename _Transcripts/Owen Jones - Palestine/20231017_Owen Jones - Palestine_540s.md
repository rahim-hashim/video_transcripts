# Tory MP SLAMS Government For GAZA WAR CRIMES
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7l9zZIHgpI)
*  What does it come to when it takes a Conservative MP to speak more sense on issues of war and peace,
*  of saving human life, on injustice, than not just the Conservative leadership, but the Labour
*  leadership as well? Now this, I'm afraid, is currently the timeline we're living in, the most
*  hellish of all the timelines. Let's just listen now to the Conservative MP Crispin Blunt speak
*  huge amounts of good sense. He is the former chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee.
*  The United Kingdom Government has given unequivocal support to the state of Israel,
*  a statement repeated by the Prime Minister yesterday, and I'm uncertain that they fully
*  understand the implications of the development of international law, whereby if you are encouraging
*  a party to undertake a war crime, you become complicit in that crime itself.
*  It's absolutely clear now that what is happening in Gaza does amount to a war crime,
*  because it is disproportionate and it does not distinguish the targets it is taking out. Hence,
*  a terrible number of children that have been killed, and what we've just heard from the
*  World Health Organization and the concerns about the effect of the transfer on the hospitals.
*  But you will know that a forced transfer of 1.2 million people is an absolute crime under the
*  laws of war. You are simply not allowed to do it, as indeed is the collective punishment of the
*  people of Gaza with a siege and the imposition of no food and no water and no relatives. Now this is
*  the moral clarity which is missing from a Labour leadership which justified cutting off water and
*  energy to a civilian population and refused to condemn other war crimes such as the forcible
*  expulsion of a civilian population. And what does it come to when this is like coming up for air,
*  when all he's actually doing is stating a basic legal position, it's not simply a humanitarian
*  position, a legal, a basic legal position about how the British government should abide by
*  international law when it comes to the waging of war. Now let's also listen to him on Good Morning
*  Britain.
*  So, what does it mean to you when you say that the British government should actually
*  consolidate or grow in an attempt to obliterate them? And we don't know, and we don't know which
*  way that is going to go. All we do know is that after the operation on Saturday, it should have
*  been pretty clear how shameful and shocking that was to almost every person, certainly all Palestinians,
*  what was going to be their attitude towards the authors of it. If there is immediately a massive,
*  disproportionate criminal response to that and mass slaughter of Palestinians by the Israelis as a
*  response, which way do you think Palestinian opinion might jump? And that's where we need to take
*  last Saturday's appalling events and put them into the context of what has happened to the
*  Palestinian people over 100 years. And we need to understand the history and the background to this.
*  All right. Now, of course, it's obviously true that the Palestinian people have repeatedly been
*  driven into the arms of Hamas by the treatment imposed on the Palestinian people. The Palestinian
*  Liberation Organisation, the secular movement, led of course by Yasser Arafat, abandoned the
*  arms struggle in 1993 and pursued a policy of nonviolence. And what did they end up showing
*  for it? Now, when Palestinians saw peaceful struggle, they were often attacked and killed.
*  So I'll give you an example. The Great March of Return, a series of demonstrations held on each
*  Friday in the Gaza Strip years ago, protesting the siege against Gaza and demanding the right of
*  refugees to return. 223 Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli forces. Now, there's also a history
*  of the Israeli state promoting Hamas and its predecessors to undermine the Palestinian resistance.
*  Don't take my word for it. Listen for a start to The Telegraph, which says, for years,
*  the various governments led by Benjamin Netanyahu took an approach that divided power between the
*  Gaza Strip and the West Bank, bringing Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to his knees
*  while making moves that propped up the Hamas terror group. This is them quoting the Times of Israel.
*  The idea was to prevent Abbas, or anyone else in the Palestinian Authority's West Bank,
*  from advancing towards the establishment of a Palestinian state. And they also carry on
*  saying that Netanyahu had pursued, they're creating Haritz, a leading Israeli newspaper,
*  and had pursued a positive diplomatic paralysis in order to avoid negotiations with the Palestinians
*  over a two-state solution, a solution despised by the country's extreme right. And this flawed
*  strategy turned Hamas from a minor terrorist group into an efficient lethal army with blood
*  thirsty killers who mercilessly slaughtered innocent Israeli civilians. And indeed,
*  Haritz suggested that Netanyahu himself told the Israeli cabinet that the way to stop
*  Palestinian statehood was to bolster Hamas. Now, as well as the massacres Palestinians have suffered,
*  apartheid, settlement, there's lots of reasons, of course, why people, Palestinians, were driven
*  into the harms of Hamas. But of course, these war crimes should be opposed regardless of the effect
*  on Palestinian opinion. Now, Chris McBloot is correct that our government is directly complicit,
*  alongside invaluable diplomatic cover. Britain has licensed at least Â£442 million worth of arms
*  to Israel since 2015. While our chief ally, the US, provides more than $3 billion in military
*  assistance each year, as he rightly says, the fact of being complicit makes you equally guilty
*  to the party carrying out the crime. So that's when people say to us, why aren't you marching
*  against Hamas? Hamas' atrocity was roundly condemned, including by our own rulers in the
*  strongest possible terms. They're not being armed and backed by us. So when you see the likes of
*  David Frost, for example, who's a very right-wing conservative lord, people may remember him from
*  Brexit, he says, I know the Conservative party is a very broad church nowadays, but a Tory MP
*  threatening to prosecute the PM and Foreign Secretary for war crimes surely crosses some
*  sort of threshold, doesn't it? Well, I think the threshold which is actually being breached here
*  is the support of the British government for war crimes. That's the point. These are our allies.
*  And yes, actually, we should go further. We should go further because of what happened, of course,
*  in the likes of Iraq, which the UN Secretary General at the time, Kofi Annan, said was against
*  international law, which makes it, of course, a war crime, as well as the horrors that were
*  unleashed on Iraq. For example, white phosphorus used by the United States, that's illegal when
*  used against a civilian population, widespread reports of civilians being tortured and murdered
*  in egregious ways by the occupying forces, as well as what happened in Afghanistan.
*  But also, I mean, we should go further. Our support for Saudi Arabia, as it pummels Yemen
*  with British arms and US arms, and I've been to a Yemeni refugee camp, seen the consequences of
*  that slaughter, which includes Saudi bombs being dropped on school buses and murdering huge numbers
*  of children. And, you know, the point is they get away with this over and over again because they're
*  not held to account. And that's why it's so important that Crispin Blunt speaks out like this.
*  It's also striking that a team of international or sorry, a large number of scholars and experts on
*  international law have written a letter to the Labour leadership asking if they are endorsing
*  war crimes. What does it come to when it when leading international law legal scholars are
*  forced to write to the Labour leadership to ask them if they're abiding by international law and
*  opposing war crimes? It's so important that we have, you know, a conservative MP in this particular
*  case speaking out because it any pressure that is brought to bear on a government such as our own
*  supporting war crimes is a matter of life and death. So let's hear far more from the likes of
*  Crispin Blunt and let it spur on and encourage other MPs to speak out about what's happening.
