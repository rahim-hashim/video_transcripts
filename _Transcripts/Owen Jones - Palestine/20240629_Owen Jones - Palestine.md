# Courageous Israeli Journalist EXPOSES Netanyahu's Hideous Plan - w. Gideon Levy
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [June 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVkgHDYYRxo)
*  I'm really delighted again to be joined by the brilliant Gideon Levy, who has been one
*  of the most important voices throughout this horror.
*  More clarity, as I always talk about, is essential when we're talking about this.
*  And Gideon always, all his contributions, more clarity in spades.
*  Gideon, how are you doing?
*  Thank you, Owen.
*  Thank you for having me again.
*  Always a pleasure.
*  Always a huge pleasure.
*  So much has happened since we last spoke.
*  I'm just quite interested in terms of, firstly, just in terms of the dynamics within Israeli
*  society as regards a war which has gone on now since, if we call it a war, it's probably
*  not really an accurate description, but since, well, we're getting on for nine months.
*  And I'm just interested because Israel's official war aims haven't been met at all.
*  Hamas has not been destroyed.
*  The hostages have overwhelmingly not been returned by military force.
*  War have been, far more likely, been killed just by air bombing than have been rescued.
*  Obviously, the big exchanges happen through a ceasefire deal and a prisoner exchange.
*  I'm just trying to understand how much that's cut through in Israeli society, that general
*  sense of what was promised at the beginning and now we're nine months in, that those official
*  war aims have failed pretty badly, I would say, on their own terms.
*  The Israeli mindset is still very, very limited and very limited to certain points of view.
*  And all the rest don't interest most of Israelis.
*  Namely, they see this war as a failure, no doubt about it, but it is a failure only because
*  it did not achieve the Israeli goals.
*  And above all, Israel failed in releasing the hostages.
*  But this war is not only about the hostages, but it's quite amazing how nine months of
*  killing and destruction in Gaza didn't change anything in Israel's mindset about the price
*  that Gaza is paying.
*  I would expect that in a certain stage, you know, in the beginning, it was all about taking
*  revenge.
*  Really, blood was really boiling here, as we say, after the 7th of October, people looked
*  for revenge, looked for punishment, looked for aggression because they felt beaten, humiliated
*  and also mourning.
*  And this was maybe understandable.
*  But after nine months, nothing changed.
*  In former wars, there was some kind of dynamic, always in the beginning, supporting anything
*  Israel is doing.
*  And then gradually, you get the critics about what are we doing and what for are we doing
*  it and above all, aren't there any limits?
*  This time, we still are in the same place.
*  Netanyahu must go, the hostages must be released, and that's our only problems in this war.
*  It is the human cost.
*  I mean, there's been a discussion here, and I've seen some say, well, actually, people
*  in Israel aren't seeing the human cost.
*  It's not being presented on the news.
*  I guess my worry always about that kind of argument is that everyone has internet connections.
*  I mean, even here, the vast majority of the horrors in Gaza aren't being shown on mainstream
*  TV channels.
*  You just see them on social media.
*  I'm just wondering, how much is there just a...
*  In terms of, we're talking potentially 14,000 children minimum have been killed.
*  Even notwithstanding that immediate aftermath after 7th October and that kind of mentality,
*  I mean, we're so far in and there's been just some of the great atrocities, I would say
*  the 21st century.
*  Has any of that caught through at all?
*  I mean, how much has the...
*  In Israeli society, look at this, whatever has happened to us, look at this horror.
*  I mean, has that not changed at all?
*  I wish I could give you another answer, but the answer is still nothing penetrates the
*  Israeli conscience.
*  I say it with not only pain, but I'm even surprised.
*  me who is suffering, really suffering for years of Israel's apathy and Israel dehumanizing
*  the Palestinians and ignoring their suffer for decades.
*  And still I can tell you what is happening this time shocks me in the level of blindness
*  of not wanting to know.
*  And above all, this level of justify everything, every atrocity, every crime that the Israeli
*  army is committing in Gaza will immediately be justified by, I would say, 95% of the Israelis
*  immediately automatic.
*  You don't even ask what, why it will be justified to release for hostages and to kill 200,000
*  Palestinians totally justified.
*  And would it be 1000 Palestinians?
*  It would have been also justified to get into some neighborhoods to look for bodies of Israeli
*  hostages and by the way, to kill tens and maybe hundreds of Palestinians justified.
*  15,000 children justified.
*  No doubt, no cracks in this position.
*  And you really think what happened here this time, which is still different because in
*  the former wars, there were more voices who really felt some kind of human feelings also
*  toward the Palestinians.
*  Here Israel is still on the 7th of October, on the eve of the 7th of October, 7th of October
*  in the evening.
*  We are still there.
*  We still remember only what happened on the 7th.
*  Back then there was an Israeli peace movement.
*  It was large.
*  It brought huge numbers of people to the streets, including, for example, the war in Lebanon
*  in the 1980s.
*  There are extremely courageous voices like yourselves.
*  There's very courageous Israelis, but they're courageous, I suppose, because they're so
*  marginalized.
*  But there's not even the seeds, as far as I can tell, of even what we had in the 1980s
*  in Israel.
*  The big peace now demonstrations.
*  You can't even compare it to when Israel committed, not committed, but was a partner to the massacre
*  in Sabra and Shatila.
*  A passive partner.
*  No Israeli soldiers participated.
*  There were 400,000 people in the streets only for this, not for nothing else, not changing
*  the government, not hostages, only for the killing of Palestinian refugees, the slaughtering
*  of them in Sabra and Shatila.
*  People went and protested against the killing, against the crime.
*  Today you will not get 400,000 for the same crime.
*  We've heard, just in terms of the broader context, the West Bank, and there's been,
*  I mean, I know this is coming from Smotrich, he's one of the more extreme elements of an
*  extreme government, talking about the potential annexation of the West Bank and even suggesting
*  that Benjamin Netanyahu approves of that.
*  It does strike me that actually, when you hear that, it's not just Sabra rattling, eventually
*  the general direction is this, the annexation of the West Bank in which there are three
*  million Palestinians living, I mean, huge numbers of illegal settlements, I think 700,000
*  Israeli settlers.
*  Do you think that's where partly, we've seen huge numbers of people, hundreds of
*  Palestinians have been killed on the West Bank, very little media attention, people
*  driven from their homes.
*  In terms of just the general context at home, I mean, do you think that's plausible?
*  And do you think Israeli society again would generally approve of that?
*  It's not a question because it is happening.
*  It's not like it is only a play.
*  While we are speaking, it is happening and not only the West Bank.
*  Don't underestimate the plans about the Gaza Strip.
*  I don't see that the northern part of the Gaza Strip will remain Palestinian after this
*  war.
*  I will not exclude the possibility of settlement even there.
*  They have their plans and trust them.
*  They know what they are doing.
*  They are devoted and the government and all the institutions of the government are supporting
*  the military, police, everything.
*  And same now, obviously, in the West Bank.
*  Smotrich has a plan and it was just revealed recently.
*  And don't underestimate his capabilities because there is on one hand total apathy about what
*  is going on in the West Bank and those who care, only the settlers, and they are ready
*  to do anything and they are doing anything.
*  I don't know when you have been, when have you been last time in the West Bank, but I
*  go every week and from week to week I see new scenes there.
*  From week to week.
*  It's not something to be happened for the future.
*  It's something that is happening right now, including many, many new outposts.
*  Each outpost means more land which will be confiscated.
*  And finally it goes towards an annexation, if not the legal one, and the factor one.
*  From my point of view, the annexation happened a long time ago, by the way.
*  I don't think that anyone can reverse and make the West Bank Palestinian again.
*  I don't see how to make it.
*  Because I mean, the whole point of vision about the disengagement so-called from Gaza
*  was to the real jewel in the crown was the West Bank, wasn't it?
*  That was the whole point for the Israeli withdrawal back nearly two decades ago.
*  It was to cement the project to essentially annex the West Bank.
*  I don't know.
*  I think that the main issue was that Sharon realised that Israel cannot hold the Gaza
*  Strip.
*  The price will be too heavy, especially, as you say, if you want to maintain the West Bank.
*  And he decided, yes, he decided to sacrifice the Gaza Strip, not for the sake of the Palestinians,
*  by all means not.
*  To sacrifice the Gaza Strip, sacrifice in terms of Israeli interests, in order to guarantee
*  the control of the West Bank.
*  And this is what happened.
*  But you raised that aspect of the annexation of at least large parts of Gaza.
*  When we say large parts of Gaza, Gaza is a small strip of land.
*  It's the size of East London.
*  2.2 million people before the war live there.
*  We have no idea what the horrible clinical term excess death toll is, which takes into
*  account not just those killed by direct violence, but there are thousands of cancer patients
*  in Gaza who haven't been treated.
*  I'm just throwing one example into the mix in terms of how the general long-term death
*  toll.
*  We just had this, I'll just say it, a catastrophic performance by Joe Biden in the debate against
*  Donald Trump.
*  There's a presidential election in June, in the beginning of November.
*  It's not long away.
*  Do you think Netanyahu is just waiting out for that US presidential election with a possible
*  Trump victory in which he thinks then he could get away with, for example, annexing large
*  parts of Gaza, driving its people out, maybe Trump doing some sort of deal with the Egyptian
*  dictatorship to get some of them driven out into the Sinai desert?
*  I mean, what do you think?
*  Is there a kind of, there's a holding pattern until the presidential election and then the
*  full planning Gaza can be executed?
*  No doubt that Netanyahu is really counting the days for the elections in the United States
*  because there is a chance that things will be easier for Israel after, even though Trump
*  is unexpected and I wouldn't count on him on anything.
*  But yes, from this point of view, the plans are very clear.
*  It is a wide zone, security zone, separation zone, along the entire Gaza Strip and the
*  northern part of the Gaza Strip will remain Israeli, Jewish, not Palestinian.
*  That's the plan.
*  By the way, by the time we are talking, they are destroying in southern Lebanon systematically
*  villages and houses in order to have this same security zone also in Lebanon.
*  So it's the same strategy, which by the way, doesn't guarantee any security for sure, not
*  in times of long range missiles.
*  What does it mean 20 kilometers, 10 kilometers?
*  I mean, it's relevant only to certain kind of weapons.
*  I say the bottom line, I don't see Israel leaving Gaza in the coming years.
*  And that's a catastrophe by itself.
*  But before I ask you about Lebanon, I mean, just in terms of, we discussed obviously a
*  peace movement in Israel, which once did exist, non-existent in any meaningful mass form, at least.
*  When we had that rescue operation in which four Israeli hostages were rescued, about 300
*  Palestinians were slaughtered, including many kids in the process.
*  Because obviously you do have within Israeli society, those who will prioritize rescuing the
*  hostages, returning the hostages to their loved ones over wiping Gaza off the face of the earth.
*  I mean, there is at least that contingent of Israeli society.
*  But has that been marginalized basically by that successful hostage deal, which then ironically
*  means less hostages get saved because obviously the vast majority of hostages are only ever
*  going to get released by these prison exchange deals.
*  Has that just basically that fact, particularly the families of the hostages,
*  they've often been a moderating force on the Israeli government?
*  Has that just been, you know, any prospects of that deal now is just dead?
*  Yes, but you describe reality as it is.
*  Most Israelis don't see reality as it is because it is being presented to them, introduced to them
*  by the Israeli media, who shows an entire different picture.
*  You mentioned the release of the hostages, which I mentioned also before.
*  In Israeli eyes, this was a hell of a success.
*  Israel was in Euphoria for one of the days.
*  It's not that people were happy that 200 to 300 Palestinians were killed.
*  They didn't care about it.
*  It was so marginal that it was hardly mentioned, which in many ways is even worse.
*  It was hardly mentioned.
*  It was only mentioned.
*  They even had the chutzpah to call it a surgeon, a very
*  chirurgic operation, a very precise one.
*  Nothing to do with 300 or 200 people who were killed.
*  I mean, it is not in the discourse at all.
*  It's very hard to describe it to people outside because it's hard to believe
*  that that's the discourse.
*  It's hard to believe.
*  But take my word that this cause is totally different than you imagine yourself and
*  totally different than it should be or than it is in Europe, in the United States or elsewhere.
*  Therefore, those questions are not being raised at all.
*  Because obviously, I would expect that the Palestinian life is worth being completely
*  ignored and marginalised.
*  I get that.
*  I suppose what I mean is, before there was a sense of, look, if we're going to get our
*  hostages out, we have to do a deal.
*  We don't like it, but that's how you do it.
*  Does the success of getting four, I mean, obviously, no one's talking about the
*  Palestinian mass killings.
*  But basically, is there a sense of that's how we get the hostages?
*  We go and we're going to rescue them.
*  We don't need to do a deal.
*  Has that basically, is that now the consensus?
*  Not for the families.
*  Yeah, most of them.
*  Most of them are clever enough to understand and they say it again and again, and they keep on
*  saying it that only a deal will bring to the release of their beloved ones.
*  The problem is that the hostages are not the political basis of this government.
*  It became a political issue.
*  And therefore, the government can totally ignore their protest.
*  Again and again, I'm being asked, does the protest risk the government?
*  Does it influence the government?
*  Not at all.
*  They can totally ignore it because in any case, that's not their political basis.
*  Almost most of them are not from their political basis.
*  Would it be settlers taking hostages?
*  Believe me, they would have been already released months ago.
*  Months ago.
*  That's not the political basis.
*  Those are kibbutzniks, leftists, or those, I don't know.
*  They were obviously also Likud supporters among so many Israelis,
*  but they are not perceived as rivals to the, as endangering the government because in any case,
*  they wouldn't vote for this government.
*  And as you know, finally, so much is decided in Israel by domestic politics.
*  I mean, on that, Benjamin Netanyahu, because clearly after 7th of October,
*  deeply unpopular, blamed for the facts for the basic security failures,
*  which obviously led to a mass slaughter.
*  So within Israeli society, there was a broad consensus.
*  It does strike me that he's clawed that back.
*  I mean, there's always been this mistaken narrative indulged here
*  in Europe and the United States that the problem is Netanyahu.
*  But clearly that's not true.
*  That's a very, he's a very convenient bogeyman.
*  But it strikes me that actually he's outmaneuvered his opponents
*  and he's clawed back support within Israeli society.
*  Certainly in a kind of, you know, keep hold of nurse for fear of something worse, perhaps.
*  That's the mentality in Israeli society.
*  Is that true?
*  Is Benjamin Netanyahu, is he essentially outmaneuvered his opponents
*  and consolidated his support in enough of Israeli society
*  that if there were elections, there's a very good chance
*  he'd end up being prime minister again.
*  I couldn't describe it better than you.
*  He is recovering.
*  He didn't make it yet.
*  But no doubt that he went a long way ever since the first weeks
*  after the seventh in which it was clear that his career is over.
*  Things look different and he has many explanations.
*  Not only one explanation.
*  Don't forget that in front of him, against him, around him, there is no one.
*  The alternatives are so weak.
*  And by the way, not very different from him when it comes to core issues.
*  There is not a real alternative to Netanyahu.
*  Yes, the others would be more decent.
*  They will be less corrupted.
*  They will behave in a more human way, maybe.
*  At least our hostages, families and so.
*  They will be very nice with the Americans.
*  They will even negotiate with the PA.
*  But by the end of the day, who is the alternative?
*  The alternative in Israel, the opposition in Israel
*  supports this war, supports the occupation, supports the apartheid.
*  So what are we talking about?
*  So when the alternative is so weak and not really an alternative.
*  And Netanyahu has what Netanyahu has.
*  You cannot undermine his capabilities.
*  And yes, it might be.
*  Don't forget that he has a whole operation.
*  He increased his power in certain media outlets,
*  which are quite influential, which he didn't have a few years ago.
*  There are now more and more outlets which really serve him,
*  him personally, even though the right wingers, him personally, in a very efficient way.
*  So the game is open in Israel, even if there will be elections.
*  People saw that recently that the elections mean the end of his career.
*  Not sure anymore.
*  I mean, on that, there's a certain type of political tendency within Britain and elsewhere
*  who are more focused on tone or vibes, if you like, than substance.
*  So for example, this is why you end up with a rehabilitation with George W. Bush,
*  responsible for terrible, terrible crimes.
*  But suddenly he's less vulgar than Trump.
*  He doesn't do these vulgar, embarrassing tweets, for example.
*  He may have laid waste to Iraq, Grand Tile, all is forgiven.
*  Isn't there a bit of a similarity there, basically, which is Netanyahu is just too crude and vulgar.
*  And actually, you replace him with someone else who would just continue the same approach,
*  but it would be less, he'd be less of an embarrassment almost.
*  But I mean, there's no real divide within Israeli politics.
*  The same policies would continue.
*  The same view of collective punishment and collective guilt, for example, will continue.
*  Absolutely.
*  I'm not sure that Netanyahu is vulgar.
*  That's not his, I mean, Donald Trump is vulgar.
*  No, but corrupt.
*  I know what you mean, exactly.
*  In his case, he's corrupt.
*  Yeah, but he's more sophisticated and more educated and more knowledgeable
*  and more impressive, by the way.
*  He's a good performer.
*  Absolutely.
*  Much more than Donald Trump or George W. Bush.
*  But by the end of the day, that's the biggest weakness of Israeli society today,
*  that it has no alternative plan, except of the plan of the right-wingers.
*  And then it doesn't matter much who will be the prime minister when it comes to the core issues.
*  And then also people say, okay, let it be Netanyahu.
*  I mean, who else?
*  They don't offer us any, anything.
*  Give me one thing that people like Gantz, Lapid, even the Zionists left,
*  who do they suggest which will look different?
*  Did one of them call to stop the war?
*  One of them?
*  Is one of them ready for the two-state solution, but ready to go for it now?
*  Is one of them even ready to bring the PA together,
*  all kinds of ideas which I don't support?
*  But at least it is a plan.
*  Nothing.
*  So therefore, we are facing not only Netanyahu,
*  we are facing a society which will not be able to change in the coming future
*  without a real change in its leadership.
*  And this change is not foreseen by any direction, by any candidate.
*  The British government is about to be wiped out essentially in our parliamentary elections next
*  Thursday. It's going to face a catastrophic landslide defeat.
*  For pretty obvious reasons. It's had a ruinous 14 years in power.
*  As a parting gift, it has intervened in the international criminal courts case,
*  where the chief prosecutor's request for arrest warrants against Benjamin Netanyahu
*  and his defence minister, Jobe Gallant, in order to claim that the ILO is not going to be able
*  to take power in a week.
*  I mean, I would imagine that I have no faith in the Labour government reversing that when
*  they take power in a week's time.
*  I mean, I'm just wondering just your general thoughts about what that represented.
*  But within Israeli society, in any case, this is just a big conspiracy against Israel.
*  That's the general just kind of gist, isn't it?
*  I'm interested in your thoughts about the British government intervening as well in order to protect
*  Netanyahu, Gallant and the Israeli state from claims of, obviously, well-grounded crimes
*  against humanity and war crimes.
*  I think the UK is only the first one, but not the last one.
*  I don't see any Western European country, maybe Spain, I don't know, maybe Ireland.
*  I don't see any one of them collaborating with the resolution of the ICC.
*  But something must be said.
*  It changed the atmosphere.
*  Even if we are not expected to see neither Netanyahu, no guns being brought to justice
*  in The Hague, I don't see it happening.
*  But it changed something in the atmosphere.
*  And you know, every time something is happening, people ask me, do you think this will make a
*  change?
*  No, nothing will make a change.
*  And still, it's incremental.
*  I mean, more and more and more developments, more and more changes in the international
*  atmosphere, in the international climate, which finally something will bring a change.
*  But we are not there yet.
*  So neither the ICC nor the ICC will change the picture, not the recognition of 140 states in
*  Palestine, including recently two more European countries.
*  None of this will make the change, will be a game changer.
*  But finally, the atmosphere is changing.
*  And unfortunately, it is changing only outside and not inside Israel.
*  Lebanon, I want to talk about Lebanon.
*  I mean, the statements from Yoav Galan aforementioned there, obviously, there's an
*  attempt by the chief prosecutor of the ICC to have him arrested for crimes against humanity and war
*  crimes.
*  I guess the statements amount to, in terms of Lebanon and Hezbollah, nice country you've got
*  there, shame if something happened to it.
*  And talk of, we don't want to, but we have the capability of reducing, sending Lebanon back to
*  the Stone Age.
*  I googled that.
*  It's a phrase he's used before, repeatedly.
*  In fact, before the 7th of October, Yoav Galan has menacingly spoken about returning Lebanon
*  to the Stone Age.
*  I mean, that's implicitly a genocidal act, clearly.
*  It certainly would involve a litany of war crimes.
*  How serious do you think it is with Lebanon?
*  Because actually, Hezbollah is not Hamas.
*  And obviously, we've seen throughout Hezbollah, because they're justified based on Gaza.
*  But I mean, they have the potential capacity to overwhelm Israel's air defenses.
*  So it's just not the same thing at all.
*  What do you think would happen?
*  Do you think, actually, Israel doesn't actually want that confrontation for that reason,
*  because it's nothing like Hamas?
*  Or do you think it's inevitable at this point?
*  The key is in Gaza.
*  And people tend to ignore it.
*  Hezbollah, as usual, was very clear.
*  Stop the war in Gaza, and we will stop the war in Lebanon or in the Galilee.
*  But Israel is not ready to stop the war in Gaza.
*  And therefore, the fight must be over stopping the war in Gaza, which is a precondition
*  for stopping the war in the north.
*  Again, I can hardly understand my fellow Israelis.
*  The dangers are really screaming from the walls.
*  War with Hezbollah can be a real catastrophe, not only in the north,
*  but in the place that I'm sitting now, in the center or in the north part of Tel Aviv,
*  which is peaceful and life is as usual, almost as usual here.
*  This will not continue if there will be a war with Hezbollah.
*  And still, there is this sense of apathy.
*  Okay, no other choice.
*  We have to fight also in Lebanon.
*  We have nothing.
*  There is no way to stop it.
*  There is no solution.
*  A war will be a solution.
*  You ask people, okay, there will be a war.
*  What do you think will be after this?
*  What will be?
*  You will gain exactly and achieve exactly what you achieved in Gaza, namely nothing.
*  You will only lose.
*  And here, the sense of apathy, of fatalism, no other choice.
*  We have to fight.
*  We have to show them.
*  We have to get some deterrence.
*  I mean, all kinds of really rubbish, which are put in the mind of people here,
*  and nobody stops for a moment and asking them, just a second, it's our sons, it's our lives.
*  Are we really ready?
*  And the answer is yes.
*  I wonder if, what are your thoughts about this?
*  There's actually a crisis there in that, as things stand, I mean, it's reported this week
*  that in the first six months since 7th October, over half a million Israelis left the country.
*  And this is a population of nine and a half million.
*  So that's a very substantial chunk of the population.
*  And obviously, the Israeli projects is based on the idea of the so-called right to return.
*  It's based on the idea this is a sanctuary for the Jewish people.
*  You know, obviously, it would be much safer to be in the United States, for example,
*  or in a European country than Israel, just objectively.
*  But actually, I mean, isn't that a potential danger that you end up, for example,
*  if that's half a million since, you know, vis-a-vis Gaza, if you have that kind of
*  armed confrontation with Hezbollah, just a lot of Israelis may just vote with their feet,
*  even if they don't actually, even if they feel, and they'll still, they might not change the
*  political views. What do you think? I mean, could that actually unravel the Israeli project to a
*  degree just by net migration becoming, you know, depleting the population?
*  No, but it will change the face of Israel. Because who lives? Lives anyone who, first of all,
*  can live. Not everyone can live. This is quite a luxury to relocate. Not everyone can live. Not
*  everyone can find this place in another place. Not everyone can find the job and not everyone can
*  get even the immigration papers off in another place. It's not so easy.
*  Half a million left is a little bit of a misleading figure, because you never know how many of them
*  will come back after the war or not. So it is, it is. I don't ignore, I don't underestimate this
*  figure, but what strikes me much more is the atmosphere. And the atmosphere is of many, many
*  people, mainly young people asking, what do we do here? Are we really going to raise our children
*  here? Do we want to stay here? What are the alternatives? You hear it everywhere.
*  The side guys right now, at least the young generation, is we have to find ourselves an
*  alternative. Like never before, by the way. I'm old enough to remember in the 60s when the joke was
*  that in the Ben Gurion airport there is a sign, please, the last one, please turn off the light.
*  We are not there. We are not there. Israel will not
*  get empty from its Jewish citizens. It will just not happen. I mean, it might be wishful thinking
*  for some, but it will not happen. But Israel will and is already changing its face
*  into something else, not what we knew and for sure not what we wish to know.
*  And those who will stay will be the religious, the orthodox, the militants, the extremists,
*  those who believe in the biblical right of Israel to be here, those who believe in living on a sword
*  and all the rest will gradually, not in one way, if it doesn't happen, those are processes.
*  But those who believe in different life, in normal life, in realising that there are two
*  people here, not only one, those will gradually leave, yes. Or at least are planning to leave,
*  which is bad enough. If you start to plan to leave, it shows that your commitment to this place gets
*  weaker and weaker and it will have many, many consequences. Because you can see, I mean,
*  Hungary is an example of a very reactionary regime and a lot of the more progressively-minded
*  younger people have just left. And obviously that's emboldened the reactionary forces back
*  home in Hungary. So you can see a similar process, the more progressively-minded Israeli citizens
*  leaving and then the growth, the ever, I guess, ascendancy of the most extreme elements.
*  I just want to end by talking about...
*  But sorry to interrupt you on nobody questions that if Hungary will exist in 100 years or 50 years.
*  Of course, yes.
*  This question is being raised here. That's a big difference. Nobody raises the question
*  if Hungary will exist in 100 years. Many ask now the questions, will Israel exist in 50 years?
*  And what kind of Islam?
*  Because before I was going to ask my last questions, that's a really good point. I
*  do want to ask you about that as well. Because actually, the way this could pan out is actually
*  quite disturbing in huge of a way. Because obviously, ideally, you want a land shared
*  on the basis of equality and justice by all its citizens. That land belongs to all who live there.
*  But you have now a kind of Israeli society bubbling over and impunity has allowed that to happen.
*  This is a case study of what happens when you have a society which is overwhelmed by
*  sentiments which are often pretty genocidal, I would say, but there's nothing to keep it in check.
*  It's armed and backed by a superpower. So there's nothing really to keep that in check.
*  It doesn't look sustainable, I have to say. I don't think this sort of mentality is
*  indefinitely sustainable, not least because public opinion of the West is changing anyway,
*  not least in the United States. Not least, I would say, amongst the generation of younger
*  Jewish Americans who are playing a very leading role in the pro-Palestine movement in the United
*  States. So I mean, I'm just interested in that. Could it kick in eventually a kind of,
*  this isn't sustainable and actually this could end up with the catastrophic collapse of the
*  Israeli project. I mean, even things like, in fact, like Egypt, it's just taken as read
*  that Egypt will be indefinitely run by what is actually at the moment extremely unpleasant
*  dictatorship, which is backed and armed by the West itself, which is pliant. But things can change,
*  that's the point. I don't know, what do you think? Is there a sense of at least creeping
*  insecurity that, you know, if we can, if the song will say, well, actually, that's why we
*  have to behave like this. That's why we're going to be violently expansionist. But is there not
*  saner voices which might think, well, that's not sustainable and this could end up with
*  a long-term catastrophe? So that's exactly the division line in Israeli society right now.
*  Those who think that it's not sustainable for a long time and those who think that because it
*  is so dangerous, we should do whatever we're doing. We are doing now that it is an existential war,
*  for example. So you have the two sides of the same coin. The only, the conclusions are opposite.
*  Those who say it's not sustainable and therefore, let's start to consider going somewhere else.
*  And those who say this is not sustainable, so therefore, let's become really crazy and do
*  anything possible to save this country by force, by power, by violating any international laws,
*  by mass killings, by genocide, by anything, because we are living on our existence.
*  And that's a very interesting point because both parties see the picture the same. They only draw
*  different conclusions out of it. The problem is that we should remember that those things take
*  decades. Those are processes. And we always try to see what will be. I mean, after the war, we will
*  stop to exist in 10 years. Will Israel turn? No, it is long processes which are already happening.
*  It's not like we, Israel today is really in turmoil and things are bubbling within the
*  Israeli society much more than we can even admit it. But the question is how will it end?
*  And if there will be no alternative leadership, which I don't see, if there will be no reset or
*  restart for the Zionistic project, then sooner or later, this will be over and something else. I
*  don't say Israel will stop to exist. I don't share this view because Israel is still by far
*  stronger, richer and more supported by the West than any other country in the Middle East.
*  And this will not change so quickly. We know how the United States is changing its policies
*  very, very slowly. It will take decades. But meanwhile, Israel is changing itself from within.
*  It's becoming, obviously for people like me, a less place that you would like to
*  live in or for sure to raise your children or grandchildren. And you hear this, you hear it not
*  from dissidents like me. You hear it from mainstream Israelis, young Israelis. We don't see our future
*  here. We don't want our children to grow into this. You see now soldiers which are removed
*  after nine months in Gaza, they moved them now to Lebanon. Did you achieve something in Gaza? No.
*  Will you achieve something in Lebanon? No. But we go. You know, in a certain stage, this will break
*  because people are, I mean, even I'm shocked that it didn't happen yet. But I know that those things
*  take time. We are not aiming at the good direction. I can tell you only one thing. I cannot think about
*  a promising scenario, about an optimistic scenario for Israel. I cannot see with whom
*  with whom exactly, with whom will come the change only with a massive intervention of
*  the international community, which I don't see happening as well. Well, just finally, I actually
*  want to ask about you if you don't mind me doing so. Because, you know, I've always been interested,
*  you know, throughout history, individuals who speak out when it's extremely difficult to do so,
*  swim against the current. And I know you reported, I mean, you said someone came up to you and called
*  you a traitor. I think this was a little while ago. But I'm just interested in just the atmosphere
*  for someone like yourself speaking out within the context of Israeli society. Often progressives like
*  myself living in Britain, where we've had, you know, we have our political problems and difficulties
*  and the United States even worse, which is often hope lies with the young, for example. I mean,
*  younger people are far more progressive. In other Western countries, that's not true. That's not
*  true in Italy, for example. In Brazil, Bolsonaro's strongest support came from millennial men. So it's
*  not as, you know, it's not a universal rule. Israeli society, younger people are more militaristic
*  and more reactionary than their older generations. You know, I've seen footage of teachers basically
*  nearly getting lynched by their pupils because they've spoken out in support of peace or something
*  mild. I mean, what kind of pressure you under? I mean, do you fear violence, for example? Do you
*  fear the threat of, you know, does your security worry when you speak out in these ways?
*  Not until now. 2014 was much more violent. And I don't have the explanation except of maybe
*  the explanation either that I got older or that the social media is replacing
*  the violence and the violence is there and not in the streets. But except of this, I don't have an
*  explanation. I, and you know, you might feel very secure and you are in danger and you might be very
*  in danger and feel secure. It's not always expected that the same thing, by the way, with my, I
*  continue to travel every week to the West Bank. This is also not very secure on the other hand.
*  Last week I was at the Jenin refugee camp and armed people directed their guns at me when they
*  heard that I'm Jewish. They were in such a shock that the Jew there to enter the camp, they took
*  them some time before they shot until they realized that it's not the Jew they know. But in any case,
*  I still feel free and safe. I must tell you. It was not always very pleasant,
*  but I still feel really free and safe. It's not only about safety, it's also about the possibility
*  to express your views. And in both cases, being a Jew in a real liberal democracy for the Jews,
*  Jews, which has many cracks now, many, many cracks. I know for sure that this should not be taken for
*  granted. And you see the changes even in this. I'm not sure that I will give you the same answer in
*  half a year. But I can tell you that, yeah, because that's the other point which you alluded to that
*  the self-censor, you know, do we, do we sometimes not say what we think because we fear the
*  consequences? It sounds like, I mean, I, you'd never come across like so many self-censors.
*  But we are reaching it.
*  Just funny in terms of what goes to say, because I know looking for hope in the current context is
*  difficult, but the reason I'm just interested what you think about this, the left, as I understand
*  the left, as I was raised in the left, the left would not exist without the contribution of
*  progressive Jews throughout history. One of the reasons anti-Semites would often target Jews,
*  particularly in the first half of the 20th century, was because of the disproportionate
*  Jewish contribution to movements of liberation, of emancipation. And that strikes me, that's
*  because you had a Jewish diaspora in many different countries who understood the danger of
*  nationalism. Because when countries became more nationalistic, it was often Jewish people who
*  ended up being the targets. They were seen as interlopers, aliens, disloyal to the nation they
*  existed. A good example was France during the Dreyfus affair, for example. But that was always
*  a recurring theme in Russia, in the Tsarist Russia and so on. And it strikes me that what Israel tried
*  to do is teach, the conclusion was, we have to be nationalistic like them. We need our own nationalism
*  to defend ourselves. But the consequences are very similar, obviously, for minorities, just as it was
*  for Jewish people in those different countries. But I mean, that international lives on. You can
*  see it in Britain, you can see it in the United States. 39% of young Jews in America think that
*  Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people. If I was an Israeli leader,
*  I'd be worried about those figures, if you get a generation of younger Jewish Americans. So I just
*  think, what do you think? That tradition lives on, and actually it lives on in the United States of
*  all places. And that could be how this ends, because they will build power and pressure within
*  the United States, not just Jewish Americans, other Americans, of course, as well. But they're
*  saying this isn't in our name. What do you think? Is that Jewish tradition is being reborn elsewhere,
*  and that will help end this nightmare? So first of all, we were brought up in a very nationalistic
*  state without knowing that we are brought up in a very nationalistic and militaristic state.
*  By the way, the first years maybe were even worse than now. The only difference was that we
*  were totally unaware. We were brought up into this. We were born into this. If I look now in
*  my childhood, I mean, this was in many ways North Korea, without feeling in North Korea,
*  not in terms of freedom, by the way, no, but in terms of recruiting the young generation
*  for a collective national goal or goals. This was unbelievable. When I look at my childhood,
*  I can't believe how did we, where we brought up in this atmosphere, feeling that we are
*  a small island in an ocean of enemies and everything we were told about our
*  David being David against Goliath and so many other things. So, but it was made in a different way,
*  and it was covered up much better than now. Now, yes, Israel is turning into nationalism like
*  never before in the more aggressive and brutal nationalism, because nationalism must not
*  necessarily become so aggressive and violent and must not necessarily be so blind to the other
*  people around you. You might think that you are the best one. You might think you are the chosen
*  people and still leave some room for the others. Israel doesn't leave any room for the others.
*  This is one aspect. The other aspect is what you have asked about the Jewish community in the
*  world. But don't forget that young Israelis are quite disconnected from the Jewish world,
*  from the Jewish world, Jewish communities outside. It's quite artificial, this connection.
*  What do you think a soldier in Gaza now feels or has in common with a Jewish student in Colombia,
*  even if he's Jewish, so what? I mean, there's not so much in common, much less than you. Okay,
*  we are celebrating the same holiday. They are Americans, we are Israelis, and most of us are
*  also secular. So what do I have in common with them? What should be in mind and is not in mind
*  is that those demonstrators in Harvard and in Colombia are the next Pentagon and the next
*  State Department and the next presidents of the United States. They will all come from this
*  generation. The only problem is you are smiling because younger than me, you have the time to
*  wait for it. I was crossing my fingers. I was crossing my fingers. Exactly, I'm crossing my
*  fingers as well. But I will not see it and you will see it. You will witness it. I will not
*  witness it because it will take time, a lot of time. And here you have a very optimistic ending.
*  It cannot be better than this. I know. And do you know what? It's not always the way we do these
*  interviews. We end often in the most despairing moment. So this is a first. This is a world
*  exclusive. We have a positive ending from Gideon Levine. Thank you very much. Seriously, Gideon,
*  it's always such a pleasure. So much insight. I know you say you don't worry about it, but you
*  are an extremely courageous voice and the pressure that you face within Israeli society just by
*  virtue of being such an isolated voice is obviously immense. Thank you. But I really
*  appreciate it. Please like and subscribe everyone. Do share this video. But Gideon,
*  thank you so, so much as ever for your wisdom. Thank you very much.
