# Israel Is Trying To Start A War With Iran
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m4YK3Orb-4)
*  And so the nightmare only deepens. Iran's military strike against Israel yesterday
*  was inevitable. Israel knew it was inevitable. That's because about two weeks ago, Israel bombed
*  Iran's consulate in Damascus, killing two Iranian generals and five military officers. Now, put
*  bluntly, you only bomb the consulate of a foreign state if you know that that foreign state is almost
*  inevitably going to strike you back. If a foreign state blew up an American consulate somewhere,
*  killing two American generals and five American military officers, we all know what would happen.
*  The US would launch a massive military intervention against the offending nation. If, say, Iran blew
*  up the Israeli consulate somewhere, again, we all know Israel would bomb that country. That is not,
*  by the way, to justify these hypothetical responses, or indeed Iran's military response. Neither is it
*  any sort of sympathy for the Iranian regime, despite the claims of many of my own critics on
*  social media, who, unlike me, do actively support unpleasant regimes like Saudi Arabia, if we're
*  going there. You see, unlike the people who I oppose, I don't support any of these military
*  escalations, whoever does them. I'm on team, stop bombing things. A lot of bombs have been dropped
*  this century. Oh, believe me, a lot of bombs. And those bombs have not made this world a better place
*  to live. Quite the opposite. They have slaughtered huge numbers of people, maimed huge numbers of
*  people, traumatised huge numbers of people, and devastated entire societies. The consequences
*  have been absolutely catastrophic and destabilising, and in all cases, spawned consequences
*  we will suffer for generations to come, including radicalising people, something which we're not
*  even talking about. It's a very obvious point. Israel wants to provoke a regional war. Why, might
*  you ask, would the Israeli state want something so reckless, so disastrous, so inevitably causing
*  slaughter on a massive scale? Well, a few obvious reasons. The onslaught against Gaza is not going
*  well, on its own terms, to say the least. It's been over six months of this genocidal carnage now,
*  and Israel has succeeded in wiping much of Gaza off the face of the earth, killing tens of thousands
*  of Palestinians, including those buried under the rubble, and committing some of the most obscene
*  crimes of the 21st century. It has not defeated Hamas, or even close, because it is not going to
*  defeat Hamas by military means. Indeed, the survivors who watch their kids and their parents
*  and their loved ones and close friends torn apart represent a constant source of replenishment for
*  Hamas militants who've been killed. You cannot defeat an idea, and you cannot simply strip an
*  entire people of hope while you're slaughtering them and expect they will submit to you, because
*  they won't. The consequences of this have been reputationally catastrophic for Israel. In all of
*  the states which arm Israel and offer it diplomatic and political support, polling has swung
*  dramatically against Israel, not least in the United States itself, where polling shows that
*  more Americans than not think Israel is committing genocide against the people of Gaza. That in turn
*  is putting growing pressure on the Biden administration to stop mere hand-wringing
*  and start using the US's massive leverage. Meanwhile, Benjamin Netanyahu is widely blamed
*  in Israel for allowing 7th October to have happened in the first place, and knows that when war ends,
*  he will be thrown out of office. And given he faces corruption charges, may well end up in jail.
*  So Netanyahu calculates that by provoking regional war with Iran, everyone will simply forget about
*  Gaza and Israel's horrendous crimes and strategic defeat. Israel will then can simply present
*  itself as an embattled victim against a deeply unsympathetic enemy and seek to reverse the
*  drastic shift against Israel in global public opinion. Pressure on the US administration to
*  abandon its unequivocal support for Israel will diminish, and Netanyahu will stay in power,
*  preventing him from being kicked out and going down in history even amongst his own people as
*  a catastrophe and ending up in jail. So all this talk today from western states, as though the
*  Iranian regime just launched a random attack for the hell of it, rather than Israel deliberately
*  trying to goad Iran with the Iranian regime it must be saying taking the bait, is ludicrous.
*  It's completely ludicrous. What western states could have done and should have done
*  is condemn Israel for bombing the consulate of a foreign state. You see, letting your allies
*  behave as they wish is not really the smart move you think it is. All it does is lead to these sorts
*  of dangerous escalations as well as setting precedents which your enemies can also act on,
*  encouraging a descent into global lawlessness. Now indeed, NBC News this week reported that
*  President Joe Biden has privately expressed concern that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
*  Netanyahu is trying to drag Washington into a broader conflict according to three people it says
*  familiar with his comments. Where did he get that idea from? Joe Biden? Must be kidding me.
*  Ludicrous to think that Israel would be trying to do that. Now what Biden's team keep doing is
*  leaking this stuff to the press in a deeply cowardly fashion while continuing to offer
*  public and material support for Israel so it can continue to unleash bloody mayhem. So in the
*  article it talks about how they fear this will be a wider regional conflict they're getting dragged
*  into by Israel, hence the senior administration official telling NBC News that Biden had told
*  Netanyahu to call that the US would not participate in offensive operations against Iran and that
*  Israel shouldn't respond by retaliating against Iran. Well, we'll see how that goes, shall we?
*  Because it is absolutely abundantly clear that the Iranian regime doesn't want a regional war.
*  It's got enough of its own problems on its home front, frankly, including economic issues,
*  massive disillusionment with the Iranian regime. That's why it's opted for an entirely theatrical
*  mass drone attack, which it will have known, not least given two weeks of preparation by Israel,
*  Arab states and the United States, that it would have been deterred. Those drones were not going
*  to cause any meaningful destruction. Now, according to the NBC article, US officials
*  had anticipated a response from Iran since Israel's April 1st bombing, as it says, of an
*  Iranian diplomatic compound in Damascus. Well, there we go. They knew what was going to happen
*  because they know if you bomb a diplomatic compound, if you bomb a consulate longing to
*  another country, they're going to hit you back. Now, it says they raised questions not just about
*  the severity of the threat, but how Israel would respond given an overall military strategy that
*  a senior administration official and a senior defense official referencing internal conversations
*  have characterized in interviews with NBC News as poorly considered frenetic and with the potential
*  to be catastrophically escalatory. It also contains this particularly wise contribution.
*  Benjamin Friedman, policy director of the think tank defense priorities, said in a statement that
*  the Israeli government had courted a fight with Iran, perhaps encouraged by the prospect of US
*  help in going after Iran. Instead of talking about ironclad support for Israel, the president
*  should have made clear that US support is limited and does not extend to all circumstances. He also
*  said war with Iran would imperil US security for no obvious payoff. Yeah, well, if reason governed
*  US foreign policy, we wouldn't be in this current mess, would we? Israel knows that it can keep
*  getting away with anything and everything and the US will just wring its hands, whinge privately to
*  media outlets about how annoyed they are in order to stop their disillusioned base from not voting
*  for them, but keep providing arms and public support. Israel's military spokesperson, Daniel
*  Higary, told the media that plans to attack Iran have been approved by a war cabinet meeting with
*  both offensive and defensive action. Israel will unleash this attack knowing, just as it knew when
*  it bombed the consulate, that the Iranian regime will respond again and so the escalation will only
*  increase. Meanwhile, the genocide of war against Gaza will be driven down the agenda, as well as the
*  horrendous pogrom against the Palestinian population of the West Bank. Well, look, finally,
*  I want to say this. The people who are again justifying this latest disgrace are the same
*  people who've spent decades directly causing or cheering on murderous mayhem on a mass scale in
*  the Middle East and beyond. Catastrophe after catastrophe after catastrophe. In a rational world,
*  they would have been driven from public life and in some cases sent to prison. Instead, they are
*  still directing Western foreign policy and demonizing those of us who are tragically vindicated.
*  In the worst possible way, as though we're the extremists, we're the moral disgraces. They trapped
*  us all in a doom loop. Unless we finally have accountability and end the doom loop, then bluntly,
*  a lot more people are going to suffer horrendous, violent deaths. Well, I for one have seen quite
*  enough death and destruction. Thank you very much. We either act and we stop the real extremists,
*  who as you can see are unleashing untold horrors, or we are doomed to keep suffering these horrors.
*  It's up to us. So we've got to be a bit more confident about it and stop allowing these
*  people to present themselves as the respectable, moderate statesmen who know what they're talking
*  about. They don't know what they're talking about. Look at the state of the world. They did this.
