# Cops STORM Gaza Meeting At QUAKERS' HOUSE - And Arrest SIX Young Women
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE)
*  Ever since the genocide began, perpetrated by Israel against the Palestinian people, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=0.0s)]
*  the world has been turned upside down. This is a point I've made over and over again, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=4.32s)]
*  which is that those who support the genocide are treated as mainstream and respectable, and those [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  who oppose the genocide are the ones who are targeted, silenced, deplatformed, sacked, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=12.88s)]
*  arrested, generally persecuted. And here is another striking example. And this is sort of [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=19.04s)]
*  the end which you shouldn't have to do this thought experiment, but you kind of know if this happened [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=24.96s)]
*  in Vladimir Putin's Russia, there would just be general outrage and this would be an example of [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=28.48s)]
*  authoritarianism. Well, this didn't happen in Vladimir Putin's Russia, it happened in Britain [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=33.76s)]
*  under Keir Starmer's Labour government, which is the police raiding the Quaker meeting house, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=38.24s)]
*  which I've been to myself, hosting young people organizing against genocide and arresting them, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=44.72s)]
*  as well as other aspects which we'll talk about. Now, I'm really delighted to be joined by [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=50.24s)]
*  Sam Holland of Youth Demand, that's the movement of activists, young people who've been [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=53.84s)]
*  doing sterling work fighting the genocide being committed with British complicity and facilitation. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  Sam, great to speak to you, how are you doing? Yeah, thank you so much for having us. It's [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=67.76s)]
*  really great to be on the show in the wake of this madness. Well, can you tell me first, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=71.36s)]
*  what was the conference? What was it all about? Yeah, so in case people don't know, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=75.28s)]
*  I'll just briefly recap what Youth Demand is. We've got two demands of the government. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=79.92s)]
*  So we're demanding the government imposes a total trade embargo on Israel, including of weapons. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=84.88s)]
*  And we're also demanding that the UK government raises a trillion pounds by 2030 through taxing [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=90.8s)]
*  the rich and fossil fuel corporations to pay climate damages to the global south. So that's [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=97.12s)]
*  exactly what these young people were speaking about on Thursday, we're speaking about the horrors [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  that we're seeing in the world, how we respond to them as young people as citizens of the UK. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=105.92s)]
*  And yeah, that's when this is exactly what was being discussed when they had a big knock on the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=111.04s)]
*  door. And the police smashed their way through. Yeah, smashed it. It's unbelievable. A place of [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=115.68s)]
*  worship, Westminster Quakers, one of the biggest Quaker meeting houses in London, they smashed down [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=122.08s)]
*  the door, blasted in, arrested all of the six people that were in the meeting, including, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=126.48s)]
*  these are people that are like one person that has never been to a Youth Demand meeting before, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=132.08s)]
*  they just came because they were interested, they were swept up in this. And also a telegraph [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=135.52s)]
*  journalist, we believe, an undercover journalist was also swept up in the operation. And for four [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=139.12s)]
*  of them, four of the six people then had that subsequently had their houses raided overnight. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=145.12s)]
*  So they came back the next morning to, you know, rooms that have been trashed. And yeah, to, you [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=148.4s)]
*  know, and flatmates are obviously pretty terrified. And yeah, and it's not it's not just this, you [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=152.56s)]
*  know, there's, there's been a wider operation. But you know, this is part of the Met have called [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=157.68s)]
*  Operation Vulcan, ominously. And yes, seven other people were also arrested in the last, you know, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=162.4s)]
*  over the last 48 hour period. And yeah, most of these people also had their houses raided. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=168.72s)]
*  And so, yes, unbelievable repression on young people that are trying to stand up and fight this [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=174.32s)]
*  genocidal government. And you know, ultimately, what we're saying is we shouldn't be surprised, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  you know, a government that's willing to sell weapons to a genocidal state will obviously use [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  brute force, you know, whatever it takes to suppress people that are trying to trying to stop [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=187.52s)]
*  them from doing that. And if people want to find out, you know, more about what's happened and get [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=191.36s)]
*  together to discuss how we respond. And yeah, we're running an emergency response zoom on set at seven [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=195.28s)]
*  o'clock on Thursday, I think the link will be in the description. And with the Quakers to think [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=200.56s)]
*  about how we move from here, you know, what do we do as a movement now. So yeah, do click on the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=204.4s)]
*  link, which is in the description. And you can take part in that support. I mean, were you were [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=208.72000000000003s)]
*  you kind of shocked and surprised by this? Or was this do you think kind of the kind of ever creeping [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=215.28000000000003s)]
*  authoritarianism and the repression of the right to protest specifically and particularly the right [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=220.64s)]
*  to protest against genocide? I mean, obviously, we've seen the mass arrest of people taking part [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=226.88s)]
*  in the protest a few weeks ago, on the Saturday against the genocide, those were people laying [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=233.11999999999998s)]
*  flowers for slaughtered Palestinian civilians. So what do you think in that kind of broader context? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's obviously a shock when it happens. But ultimately, we're not surprised, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=246.4s)]
*  you know, we're not surprised. And because, you know, as I mentioned before, you know, what the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=250.8s)]
*  key story here that all that this fits within is that the government, you know, our government is [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=255.76000000000002s)]
*  directly engaged, you know, we're not we're not just using the word and complicit their direct [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=259.68s)]
*  participants in this genocide in Gaza. And, and, you know, the story here is that there's a group [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=263.6s)]
*  of young people, you know, that's the story, right? There's the government's enacting a genocide and [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=268.72s)]
*  a group of young people desperately trying to stop them. And I think, you know, I think it's [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=272.96s)]
*  always crucial that we bring it back to this, you know, the horrors being enacted to really [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=278.16s)]
*  contextualize it. I mean, you know, I'm sure lots of you yourself and your viewers have seen [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=280.88s)]
*  massacres that have happened during the last couple of days, children, intense trying to [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=284.64s)]
*  celebrate with their family and that, you know, the dire conditions that they're in, while starving, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=289.2s)]
*  are being blown to pieces, right? Kids that are, you know, wearing the clothes that they've just [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=293.36s)]
*  been given a need, you know, parents have tried to scrape, scrape together for them in the poverty [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=297.84s)]
*  they're living in and they're being blown up to pieces. And they've been blown up with bombs that [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=301.04s)]
*  have been dropped from, you know, British made planes, right? So that's the context that it [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=305.68s)]
*  happens in. That's, you know, that's what our government's engaged in. And we need, you know, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=310.8s)]
*  in Youth Demand, we spend a lot of time thinking about how, you know, what's our responsibility in [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=313.6s)]
*  the face of this? How do we respond to our government's crimes? And what is our responsibility [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=317.68s)]
*  to those kids that are in the tents, right? In the, in the heat of having bombs dropping all around [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=322.08000000000004s)]
*  them. And, you know, what we think is our responsibility, our main responsibility is to resist, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=326.16s)]
*  is to fight back and use all the nonviolent means that we have at our disposal, including [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=330.88s)]
*  street blockades, blockading infrastructure, bringing London to a standstill, if that's what [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=334.71999999999997s)]
*  it takes. And that's exactly what we're going to be doing in April. We're going to be, you know, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=338.64s)]
*  blockading the streets of London day after day after day, until we get a response from our [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=342.4s)]
*  government, until they end their complicity in genocide. And yeah, people that are listening to [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=346.24s)]
*  this are interested. They can sign up at youthdemand.org to take part in these actions and fulfill [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=350.96s)]
*  our responsibility to those kids that are in those tents right now. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=355.2s)]
*  And as an example, Britain, of course, exports the crucial components for F-35 jets, which [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=358.96s)]
*  rain death and destruction on the people of Gaza, children, women, men alike. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=365.28s)]
*  I mean, do you think part of this is to try and, because rightly what you're doing there is trying [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=370.56s)]
*  to use this as an opportunity to encourage people to get involved. That's the correct response. But [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=375.91999999999996s)]
*  I mean, is the fear that doing this in order to try and intimidate people into not taking part, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=379.28s)]
*  to make an example of people and therefore that will, they hope, deter people from taking part in [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=384.72s)]
*  these protests and direct action? Yeah, I think you're absolutely right. That's what, you know, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=388.88000000000005s)]
*  that's exactly what they're trying to do. They are absolutely terrified of what it looks like when [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=393.6s)]
*  the mass movement that's existed for Palestine escalates its actions. They're terrified of that [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=398.64000000000004s)]
*  because that's what's ultimately going to force them to change their policy. You know, we need to [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=402.88000000000005s)]
*  look, I think, really carefully at this point about what the Palestine movement's done over the last [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=407.12s)]
*  year and a half. You know, what has happened and what can we learn from it? We've obviously seen [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=410.72s)]
*  hundreds of thousands, you know, at its peak, a million people marching on the streets of London, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=415.12s)]
*  which is obviously an important thing to do. And we need to have these mass displays of strength. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=418.64s)]
*  But it's evident now, a year and a half in, that it's not going to force the government to change [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=422.71999999999997s)]
*  its policy. You know, we've had minor wins, minor victories, 15% of weapons, you know, that have [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=429.28s)]
*  been stopped, you know, the government has stopped exporting. But that's, you know, 15% or 10% even. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=433.68s)]
*  8%. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=440.4s)]
*  8%, my bad. And so it's evidently inadequate, right? We're not going to, you know, the mass [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=441.52s)]
*  marches and the things that have been going on are not enough to stop it from happening. So [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=447.28s)]
*  they're terrified, right? Like even a sliver of those people will step up and escalate their [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=450.4s)]
*  actions and move on to doing civil disobedience, civil resistance, which is, you know, exactly what [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=455.03999999999996s)]
*  we think needs to happen. And we're not going to be, you know, we're not going to be intimidated. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=459.59999999999997s)]
*  So again, we're going to, we're still going ahead with our April plans. We will still be out on the [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=462.32s)]
*  streets every single day during April. And people can sign up to get involved in that if they think [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=465.6s)]
*  that, you know, if they agree with the analysis that, you know, what's happened so far, the mass [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=470.32000000000005s)]
*  marches and the rallies are not going to cut the mustard. We need to engage in disruptive, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=473.52000000000004s)]
*  disruptive actions. And they can sign up and join us. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=477.12s)]
*  I mean, just, I mean, you know, the people who've been arrested, what's the new deal on [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=480.48s)]
*  some of their pretty, pretty shaken up by the experience? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=484.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, people are obviously shaken. And yes, it's a very nerve-racking experience. But [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=488.0s)]
*  these are some of the, you know, I think really amazing people, you know, like the people that [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=492.64000000000004s)]
*  are willing to do this, the people that have met doing this work, you know, the people that have [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=495.92s)]
*  the courage to step up and continue going, you know, they're just unbelievable. And that's what [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=499.12s)]
*  we've seen, like a day after some people got out of jail, they were out leafleting on the streets [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=503.04s)]
*  to still try and make this April campaign happen. We've got people, you know, young people going on [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=507.68s)]
*  BBC News night this evening, again, you know, people that were arrested and raided, and, you know, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=511.36s)]
*  they're still going ahead and doing everything they can, everything that's in their power, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=515.52s)]
*  to fulfil their responsibility to those kids in those tents. And that's what, yeah, that's what [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=519.84s)]
*  we think has to happen. We can't be intimidated. We can't let these acts of oppression intimidate [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=524.64s)]
*  us. We won't. We're going to continue going ahead. And so if anything, we thank the Met Police [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=528.16s)]
*  for all the attention you brought on the campaign, for bringing us on the show, for getting us on the [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=532.64s)]
*  front page of the Sunday Times, for getting BBC News night and boosting our action campaign. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=535.44s)]
*  We know our history judges these sorts of incidents, don't we, where at the time, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=540.4s)]
*  the those fighting against injustice are, you know, the full weight of the state comes crashing down [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=547.04s)]
*  on them. And, you know, how history sees those locking them up or arresting them or raiding [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=553.2s)]
*  their homes, and how those are receiving energy judges is quite instructive, isn't it? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=560.5600000000001s)]
*  I think, yeah, I think you're bang on here. And I think you're, you know, you're brilliant at [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=567.12s)]
*  doing this on, you know, with your work, you know, linking what's happening now to the historical [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=570.24s)]
*  context when, you know, historic, you know, horrific acts have been perpetrated. You know, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=574.48s)]
*  what do ordinary people do in those situations? And what's looked back on as, you know, as being [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=578.72s)]
*  the right thing? And you're, you know, you're totally right. Every single time, the people who [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=582.88s)]
*  stood up to resist people who stepped on just doing conventional actions, removing the marches [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=586.32s)]
*  from doing the rallies and went for, you know, went one step further, the suffragettes, the civil [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=590.4s)]
*  rights movements, you know, the South African anti apartheid movement, all these historic movements [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=593.84s)]
*  that we, you know, that we like to like to speak about. And yeah, it's the people that, you know, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=597.52s)]
*  went up and above that we remember as being the heroes, those are the ones that have statues in [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=601.84s)]
*  Parliament Square, you know, Gandhi and, you know, the suffragettes and, you know, so yeah, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=604.88s)]
*  that's exactly what we're trying to do. We're trying to be in that tradition and step into [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=608.96s)]
*  resistance, which means, you know, as I said before, it means causing disruption. It means [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=612.1600000000001s)]
*  bringing business as usual to a halt. It means, you know, actually breaking through the narrative, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=616.08s)]
*  breaking through, you know, just daily life in this country to say, look, we're arming a genocide [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=620.1600000000001s)]
*  that breaks every single human value we have, you know, and that's, so that's what we think we have [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=624.64s)]
*  to do. And again, you know, it's definitely important that people get involved now. We've [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=628.72s)]
*  seen what's happening over the last couple of weeks, and you know, bombing escalating, you know, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=632.72s)]
*  the ceasefire completely breaking down. And so yeah, again, I just can't say enough, we need [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=636.48s)]
*  everyone on the streets to join us, and everyone out in the movement to join us, you can sign up [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=641.52s)]
*  at youthdemand.org and get stuck in. Great stuff Sam. And again, massive kudos for your work. It's [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=645.12s)]
*  so, so important. And, you know, whatever fear people may feel about speaking out, with doing [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=651.6800000000001s)]
*  something about the genocide is nothing compared to the fear that the Palestinian people in Gaza [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=656.96s)]
*  face every single day, knowing that any moment could be their last. And every single day, it is [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=661.6800000000001s)]
*  the last moment for so many Palestinians, including of course, little children, including [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=667.6s)]
*  paramedics a few days ago, who were sent to rescue wounded people, and who were executed one by one [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=672.48s)]
*  and thrown in a mass grave. So the worst imaginable atrocities been committed in full [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=680.0s)]
*  sight of the world. And whilst, you know, we talk about international law, sorry, we talk about the [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=684.72s)]
*  law, international law is being systematically violated by the likes of not just Benjamin and [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=690.1600000000001s)]
*  Yahoo, but the British government. And if anyone should be having their homes raided at the moment [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=696.5600000000001s)]
*  for crimes, it should be those arming a genocide, not those trying to fight it. Please like and [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=702.64s)]
*  subscribe everyone and leave comments because then more people engage. We've got a link to turn up, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=708.24s)]
*  as Sam said, to support on Thursday, the actions. So just click on the link in the video description. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=713.92s)]
*  And do get the message out, share the video so everyone could hear what Sam said. Let's turn [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=720.7199999999999s)]
*  this into a positive. And so we can thank them, please. Not something I normally say. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=725.76s)]
*  Sam, thank you very much and well done for your work. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku33Ghi9CTE&t=733.28s)]
