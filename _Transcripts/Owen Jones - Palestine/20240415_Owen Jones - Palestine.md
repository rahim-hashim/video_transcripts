# Hypocrisy Over Iran Becomes Total Carcrash
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIxe3Eb9T40)
*  This is incredible. No notes. Absolutely genius. Unintentionally so, admittedly. And it just exposes
*  the completely ludicrous and patent hypocrisy of the latest crisis. Now, a little recap.
*  At the beginning of April, the Israeli state blew up Iran's consulate in Damascus,
*  Syria, killing Iranian generals and army officers, violating international law,
*  and intentionally trying to provoke a military response. Now, how do we know that Israel was
*  intentionally trying to provoke a military response? Because you don't bomb a foreign consulate
*  and kill a foreign state's generals and army officers without being fully aware that they are
*  inevitably going to strike you back. And the Israeli state wants to deflect from its strategic
*  failure in Gaza, reverse the calamitous public shift against it in the states, which arm and back
*  it, stop the US administration backsliding in support for Israel, and drag war out so Netanyahu
*  can stay in power and avoid getting locked up for corruption. So the Iranian regime then did a
*  counterattack, which was superficially very big, but it knew was deemed a failure, which I'll come
*  on to. And now Israel, which doesn't even officially acknowledge it blew up Iran's consulate,
*  pretends it was some unprovoked attack that came out of nowhere so it can continue its policy of
*  escalation for the reasons stated above. Anyway, Lord David Cameron, our Foreign Secretary, was
*  asked about all of this on television, which was actually a refreshing example of the media doing
*  its job. Let's listen to this excerpt from his interview on Sky News with presenter Kay Burley.
*  Is it bad judgment or good judgment to hit Iranian sovereign territory in Damascus?
*  That was something the Israelis decided to do. We haven't made a... I know, well I'll answer the
*  question, which is I can completely understand the frustration the Israelis feel when they look at
*  the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and they look at the terrible things that they have done
*  all over the world, including the support they give to Hamas. And of course Hamas were responsible
*  for October the 7th and that is where all of this begins. So you can completely understand
*  the frustration. Yeah, but what about Iran's frustration at part of its sovereign territory
*  being flattened? Well I would argue there is a massive degree of difference between what Israel
*  did in Damascus and as I said, 301 weapons being launched by the state of Iran at the state of
*  Israel for the first time, a state-on-state attack, 101 ballistic missiles, 36 cruise missiles,
*  185 drones. That is a degree of difference and I think a reckless and dangerous thing for Iran to
*  have done and I think the whole world can see all these countries that have somehow wondered, well
*  you know, what is the true nature of Iran? It's there in black and white. What would Britain do
*  if a hostile nation flattened one of our consulates? Well we would take, you know, we would take the
*  very strong action. And Iran would say that that's what they did? Well what they did as I said was a
*  massive attack. So they were right to respond but they overreacted, is that what you're saying?
*  What I'm saying is that the attack they carried out was on a very large scale, much bigger than
*  people accepted. Do they have a right to respond? Well countries have a right to respond when they feel they've
*  suffered an aggression, of course they do, but look at the scale of that response. Had those weapons
*  not been shot down, there could have been thousands of casualties, including civilian casualties. I
*  think that's a really important point to take into account. Amazing, just amazing stuff here. So David
*  Cameron here says that if a UK consulate was bombed by a foreign state, the UK would take very strong
*  action. Well you can say that again, the UK would bomb them. Very clearly that's what would happen.
*  We all know it, might as well just say it out loud. If a US consulate was bombed, wiping out US generals
*  and army officers, exactly the same thing would happen. That would be regardless by the way of
*  how many war crimes in say Iraq or Gaza right now those generals were objectively involved in. If
*  we're going to use the defence here of the terrible things these Iranian officers are alleged to be
*  involved in. Speaking of someone who clearly has no truck whatsoever with Iran's regime. But actually
*  what he says here is so ludicrous when you give it more than 20 seconds of basic scrutiny. You see,
*  David Cameron knows full well that Iran choreographed an attack which was superficially
*  very big but which was doomed to failure having given Israeli, Arab states and the US ample time
*  in which to prepare. So by his logic if the Iranian regime had launched a much smaller,
*  unexpected targeted attack which say successfully built on an Israeli military base, that would have
*  been legitimate. But this superficially larger but very clearly all for show attack wasn't legitimate.
*  Well anyway, Iranian news channels have been broadcasting the clip of David Cameron saying
*  the UK would take very strong action if a hostile power flattened a British consulate. Well obviously
*  because as far as Iran's concerned that automatically buries western hypocrisy on the issue. Now you
*  don't actually have to be tinfoil hat wearing conspiracy theorist to believe that Israel is
*  very clearly and obviously trying to provoke an armed confrontation with Iran and trigger a regional
*  war which would have truly horrible consequences and which would drag in the United States. And in
*  fact that is exactly what the US administration themselves think which we know because they've
*  been very cowardly in a very cowardly way linking this in terms of what they think Netanyahu is
*  trying to do to NBC News because they think winking at voters disillusioned with the triviality of
*  their government being complicit in genocide will make them go and get over all of that and
*  vote for Biden come the presidential election. Now let's just listen to this Sky News military
*  analyst. I'm joined now by our military analyst Professor Michael Clark.
*  Michael talking to Danny Eilon there he said that there should be ramifications in his words
*  and that Israel has never wanted conflict with Iran. Some would gently push back on that. I mean
*  how likely would you say an Israeli response to these missile attacks are? Yeah well I wouldn't
*  gently push back on that. I would assertively push back on it because the Netanyahu government has
*  been saying for 20 odd years our real enemy is Iran. You know the Palestinians are just a problem
*  they're a nuisance and we ultimately we don't have to really deal with the Palestinians that's been
*  his view but that Iran is our real enemy and the Iranian revolution of 1979 set off an anti-Israel
*  rhetoric across the region that we have to do with so yeah I think they do want conflict with
*  Iran if they could manage it that's fine if they have to fight it they will at some point in the
*  future I think that's the view. Yes well duh this is one of these completely ludicrous situations
*  where everybody absolutely everybody knows what's happening the British government is painfully aware
*  of what the Israeli state is doing they're not actually completely thick and they also have a
*  whole range of diplomats and intelligence people to tell them what's what this is all theatre they're
*  just bending reality for the sake of defending an ally which frankly is causing a western power block
*  already catastrophically damaged by the multiple failed military adventures of the 21st century
*  irreversible reputational harm. Let me also quote from the courageous Israeli journalist
*  Gideon Levy who I interviewed on this channel a week and a half ago in his latest column in
*  the Israeli newspaper Haaretz given the narrative that actually Israel wiped out a foreign consulate
*  in another foreign country because it was responding to Iranian aggression he says
*  for several years now Israel has provoked Iran constantly in Lebanon Syria and also on Iranian
*  soil and has not paid any price it would be foolish to believe that the rope Israel has
*  stretched will not break that moment may have come he adds it takes an insane amount of arrogance
*  to think that Iran will never react to these provocations now that might seem like a outrageous
*  thing to say in the context of the current so-called debate or discussion on these issues
*  but it is transparently just the truth now what's actually the legal rights and wrongs of all this
*  now as legal scholar Craig Martin a US professor of public international law and the law of
*  armed conflict puts it in a very useful twitter thread Israel's airstrike on the Iranian consulate
*  in Damascus was a use of force against both Syria and Iran and a violation of article 2 in brackets
*  4 of the UN Charter's prohibition on the use of force he goes on to say Iran's response with drone
*  and missile strikes against Israel does not satisfy the requirements of necessity or
*  proportionality as an exercise of self-defense under article 51 and so it too was an unlawful
*  retaliation in violation of article 2 in brackets 4 of the UN Charter he adds but the US and other
*  western states have engaged in similar uses of force in unlawful retaliation including against
*  Iran under the pretextual rationales of exercising self-defense he adds and the condemnation of Iran
*  strikes while turning a blind eye and thereby condoning the Israeli strikes further creates
*  perceptions of double standards hypocrisy and western instrumental and unprincipled use of law
*  as a blunt instrument of power finally he says particularly against the backdrop of silence on
*  Israeli violations of international humanitarian law in Gaza while condemning among others Russian
*  conduct in Ukraine so nothing less than the integrity and viability of international law
*  and the rule of law at stake and western governments need to be more principled if they
*  do not want to be the cause of its demise global south states are now defending international rule
*  of law well yeah quite personally i'm on the side of not having military escalation armchair
*  warmongers to be perfectly frank repulse me people who just sit casually in their comfortable western
*  living rooms talking about how we need to reign some more bombs and some other people
*  that is if we're going to be blunt explosives which rip people's brains out of their skulls cook
*  babies alive and rip the limbs off elderly women those people disgust me i just don't live in the
*  same moral universe as these people just be frank about it i'm not a pacifist by the way except
*  violence in some circumstances is absolutely unavoidable given the risk of greater violence
*  but it is always a hideous evil and the violence being whipped up here is not about preventing
*  violence it's actually the opposite it's intentionally whipping up violence risking the
*  lives of huge numbers of people in the process when already on a daily basis huge numbers of
*  people are being slaughtered by the israeli state in gaza with the direct complicity of western
*  states so as well as condemning israel for initiating this military escalation neither
*  do i support iran's armed response even as per gideon levy and this legal expert i think was
*  absolutely inevitable and the west determination to repeatedly defy international law to just
*  cherry pick it to use it when it's useful to condemn its enemies and then ignore it when it
*  gets in the way of what the west thinks is his own strategic interest which actually much of the time
*  it isn't unless people think that illegally raiding iraq was somehow some great win for the west but
*  it also they allow their allies to do it e.g israel to pick and choose but then use international
*  law when it suits them as well as the west complicity and gross human rights abuses has very
*  predictably destabilized the global order yeah this is a mess and you know what is a mess that
*  is going to get worse and kill a lot more people and i resent having to say things which by the way
*  are completely and utterly predictable i'm not a prophet i'm not some great analyst with huge
*  insight into what's happening i'm just using basic precedent and common sense we just have to
*  constantly sit here and watch what we all know will be bloody calamities as we predicted with iraq
*  and afghanistan and libya and indeed gaza all turn out to be bloody disastrous calamities it's like
*  watching the film titanic knowing the film will end with the titanic sinking with a huge number of
*  people being killed with a slightly unfortunate difference that this is not in fact a film and
*  the ending would not be inevitable were our leaders to make different choices but we know
*  they won't so all i can do is sit here talking to you on a youtube channel saying the blatantly
*  obvious about what's going to happen which you know is what's going to happen with absolutely
*  zero satisfaction because the net result will just be lots more dead people so there we have it our
*  rulers molded graces and hypocrites with a lot of blood on their hands and so much blood yet to come
*  and we either stop this madness with our own collective power or we sit here watching the
*  world descend even further into violent chaos all i'm saying guys is something has to give
*  please like and subscribe do leave your comments and love to hear your thoughts
