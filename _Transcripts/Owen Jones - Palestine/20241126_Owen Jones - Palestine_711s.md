# US In MELTDOWN Over Netanyahu Arrest Warrants -
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [November 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1WjbNvrsPQ)
*  How do you define a rogue state? A quick search on Google produces the following handy definition.
*  A national state regarded as breaking international law and posing a threat to the security of other nations.
*  That seems like a perfectly reasonable definition to me.
*  Now normally the term rogue state is only bandied around to mean states deemed hostile to Western interests.
*  I mean, Israel is a Western ally. It's also an egregious and systematic violator of international law.
*  You don't hear it being called a rogue state, generally speaking, do you?
*  If you leave aside Israel's genocide and law against Gaza, you have the occupation of course of the West Bank,
*  the longest belligerent occupation in modern history and the colonisation of this Palestinian land.
*  Now the International Court of Justice, the world's highest court, recently made clear that this represented systematic violations of international law.
*  But what of the United States itself, the world's only hegemon, albeit a power in decline?
*  Its position has been very clear for a long time.
*  International law for the United States is a bit like a buffet you pick and choose as it suits you.
*  If it's useful at any given moment to take action against a hostile state, very convenient.
*  Otherwise it's to be ignored. International law is for thee, not for me.
*  Now the response to the International Criminal Court is instructive.
*  Unlike most of the world's states, the US refuses to be a signatory because it knows full well
*  that it is guilty of multiple infractions of international law, including repeated war crimes.
*  Including for example the illegal war of aggression that was the catastrophic invasion of Iraq in 2003.
*  Now the US response to the ICC's belated decision to issue arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*  and his former defence minister Yoav Galant has all the hallmarks of the behaviour of a rogue state.
*  Let's start with the Republican Senator Lindsey Graham.
*  So to any ally, Canada, Britain, Germany, France, if you try to help the ICC, we're going to sanction you.
*  Well that means I want every ally. And you saw little Justin in Canada and his position.
*  What should the penalty be?
*  We should crush your economy because we're next.
*  Why can't-
*  In this case he's openly declaring the Republican administration would crush the economy of US
*  allies if they abided by their legal responsibilities as signatories to the International Criminal Court
*  after it issued arrest warrants based on overwhelming evidence.
*  Which went of course through the Chief Prosecutor, an independent panel of eminent lawyers,
*  the three pre-trial judges from different countries.
*  What he says is striking that the US would need to crush the economy of say Canada or Britain
*  because otherwise we are next.
*  Here's the fear clearly expressed.
*  That world order in which the US and its western allies can act with impunity
*  as above the law where they can't be held accountable.
*  That this world order is crumbling.
*  That maybe, just maybe, one day western leaders won't be able to spread death, destruction and
*  chaos in pursuit of their own perceived narrow interests without facing personal consequences.
*  And that indeed the gravity of Israel's genocide in Gaza is simply too extreme,
*  too shameless to confess to.
*  And it may not be just Israeli leaders one day issued with arrest warrants but also
*  the western leaders who gave them weapons as well as aid, as well as diplomatic cover,
*  as well as political support.
*  Now back in May this year, before the requests for arrest warrants were submitted by the Chief
*  Prosecutor, 12 Republican senators sent a threatening letter to him in which they said
*  any warrant was not only a threat to Israel's sovereignty but to the sovereignty of the United
*  States, adding target Israel or we will target you.
*  It ended you have been warned.
*  I mean forget rogue states, that's a gangster state.
*  That sounds like a gangster.
*  That's how gangsters speak.
*  And then just before the warrants were issued, the incoming Republican Senate majority
*  leader declared the US must pass legislation threatening the ICC with sanctions if warrants
*  were issued.
*  The legislature in the US has already passed law legislation cancelling the US visas of
*  ICC officials and placing financial restrictions on court officials.
*  Now it's not just right wing Republicans kicking off.
*  The Washington Post purports of course to be a bastion of US liberalism.
*  Its editorial board has issued its own stance headline,
*  The International Criminal Court is not the venue to hold Israel to account.
*  The subheading, the ICC is needed to help resolve war crimes in Russia, Sudan, Myanmar.
*  Targeting Israel makes that harder.
*  I mean astonishing.
*  I mean talk about saying the quiet part out loud.
*  The International Criminal Court is only supposed to be for Africans and Russians.
*  It's not supposed to be people we consider as being like us.
*  What's so wild about this is the following.
*  Let's just listen to Karim Khan, the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court,
*  being interviewed back in May, six months ago.
*  The court is built for Africa and for thugs like Putin was what one senior leader told me.
*  We don't view it like that.
*  This court is the legacy of Nuremberg.
*  This court is a sad indictment of humanity.
*  This court should be the triumph of law over power and brute force.
*  Grab what you can, take what you want, do what you will.
*  And we're going to simply be, we're not going to be dissuaded
*  by threats or any other activities because in the end we have to fulfil our responsibilities
*  as prosecutors, as the men and women of the office, as judges, as the registry.
*  So that's when he issued requests for arrest warrants.
*  So Karim Khan rightly damns a western leader,
*  anonymously, we don't know who that western leader was,
*  who told him that the ICC was built for Africa and thugs like Putin.
*  And then the Washington Post just literally comes out and says it.
*  This frankly deranged Washington Post editorial suggests the Israeli state
*  can be trusted to investigate its own actions,
*  which they can't bring themselves to say are war crimes and war crimes against humanity.
*  They clearly don't believe that officially.
*  Despite no meaningful evidence in Israel's history that they would actually take any meaningful
*  action, not least against their leaders.
*  This is a society currently in the midst of genocidal mania.
*  It's just insulting nonsense, of course.
*  Meanwhile, Biden's administration has come out and fiercely denounced the ICC arrest warrants,
*  with Biden denouncing it as outrageous.
*  Let's listen to his spokesperson, shall we?
*  We fundamentally reject the court's decision to issue arrest warrants for senior Israel officials.
*  We remain deeply concerned by the prosecutor's rush to seek arrest warrants and the troubling
*  process errors that led to this decision.
*  The United States has been clear that the ICC does not have jurisdiction over this matter.
*  You've heard us say this before.
*  Whatever this prosecutor might imply, there is no evidence, none,
*  between Israel and Hamas.
*  There's just none.
*  In coordination with partners, including Israel, we are discussing certainly those next steps,
*  but that's going to look like, and to your question about sanctions,
*  that's basically kind of just answered it in that last part of what I said.
*  We are in consultation with our partners,
*  and also, which include Israel, about our next steps.
*  We fundamentally, fundamentally reject that the ICC has jurisdiction over this situation.
*  What are you even talking about?
*  Do you even know what you're talking about?
*  Firstly, she talks about the prosecutor's rush to get arrest warrants.
*  Now firstly, the state of Palestine joined the ICC in 2015,
*  years before Karim Khan was chief prosecutor.
*  A preliminary investigation into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity
*  in the East Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza began in 2015.
*  Khan's predecessor announced in 2019 that the criteria for a full investigation was then met,
*  but she said the question of jurisdiction wasn't settled.
*  In 2021, the ICC pre-trial chamber voted to agree that the court did have jurisdiction,
*  and so an investigation was then opened again under his predecessor.
*  This has been going on for years.
*  As regards to these specific horrors which began after the 7th October,
*  it took six months of some of the most depraved atrocities being committed every single day in
*  full view of the world before the chief prosecutor submitted his request for arrest warrants,
*  which for good measure he submitted to a panel of esteemed lawyers for their approval.
*  It then took another six months until the requests for arrest warrants were accepted
*  by three pre-trial judges way longer than it took in the case of Vladimir Putin
*  over the invasion of Ukraine.
*  Is that really a rush?
*  What process is she talking about?
*  Why is she going on about the prosecutor when this had to go through
*  three pre-trial judges?
*  She's behaving as a one-man expedition rather than a system.
*  Now she says the ICC has no jurisdiction over this matter.
*  Total nonsense.
*  The state of Palestine is a signatory to the ICC,
*  thereby war crimes and crimes against humanity involving Palestine fall under its jurisdiction,
*  as indeed the court found after lengthy deliberation and wrecking attempts from,
*  for example, the British government.
*  She says whatever this prosecutor might imply,
*  there is no evidence between Israel and Hamas.
*  There is just none.
*  I presume she meant equivalence there.
*  I'll let it slide.
*  I mean firstly, none of this is about equivalence.
*  The question facing the court was did both Hamas and the Israeli state commit war crimes
*  and crimes against humanity on their own terms?
*  It's not in the case of the law.
*  You don't have a criminal system going,
*  well, we'll only charge some people based on the gravity of what they've done,
*  but we won't bother with anyone else because it might make it look like they're on the same level.
*  I mean, the answer is yes as far as the court is concerned
*  in terms of the burden of evidence, hence arrest warrants were issued for both.
*  And if we're going to talk about the question of equivalence,
*  I've been clear from the start Hamas did commit grave war crimes on the 7th of October,
*  for which there's no justification whatsoever.
*  If we're talking about scale, let alone the inherent dynamics involved here,
*  occupied, occupier, military superpower, guerrilla army,
*  Israel has objectively committed far deadlier and more destructive war crimes on a much bigger scale
*  for a much longer period of time.
*  Those are just the facts and facts are facts, I'm afraid.
*  Now Biden has apparently called Macron to tell him that Netanyahu was right to be angry
*  since France had accepted or declared that it would implement the ICC arrest orders,
*  that is abiding by its legal obligations.
*  That man's a joke, a pathetic joke, not a funny joke,
*  a monster who'll go down in history as a war criminal for his involvement in this obscenity,
*  using what the mailing time he has in high office to lobby for Israel's right to be protected
*  and accountability as it commits heinous atrocities.
*  You can see why the US is threatened.
*  This wasn't supposed to happen.
*  These arrests are a sign of a shift in the balance of power,
*  albeit in a world still dominated by a thuggish superpower
*  determined to destroy what remains of the international order to defend genocide.
*  But the US is rattled, it's panicking,
*  and despite the horrors to come under Donald Trump,
*  the genie's out of the bowl and what's more, they know it.
