# Biden ADMITS Netanyahu DRAGGING OUT War
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [June 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXVuU-8C0ts)
*  Finally, some of the first honesty that we've seen from the US President Joe Biden about
*  Israel's genocidal onslaught against Gaza, which he has directly facilitated from day
*  one. In an interview with Time magazine, he was asked, some in Israel have suggested that
*  Netanyahu is prolonging the war for his own political self-preservation. Do you believe
*  that? He responded, I'm not going to comment on that. There is every reason for people
*  to draw that conclusion. I like that. It's funny. I'm not going to comment on that.
*  He immediately comments and offers the main takeaway of the entire interview. Look, if
*  I'm honest, that is amongst the most lucid parts of that particular interview. Amongst
*  other things, he refuses to answer one question with a response, if I tell you, you'll write
*  it, it's not time for you to write it. He mixes up, apparently, the Chinese ruler with
*  Vladimir Putin. When asked about his age in the context of running for a second term as
*  president, he says, I can do it better than anybody you know. You're looking at me. I
*  can take you too. He approvingly refers to a phone conversation with the murderous war
*  criminal Henry Kissinger a few days before he died and then says, and he uses, he used
*  the following comment. He said that not since Napoleon has Europe not looked over their
*  shoulder at dread with what Europe, what Russia may do until now, until now you can't let
*  change. I must ask you, what does that mean? Various kind of negatives, slightly confusing
*  forms of phraseology. Europe presumably isn't looking at dread at Europe. If he means Russia,
*  then why refer to Napoleon, emperor of the French Empire, who got defeated while trying
*  to invade Russia. If he means Russia, well, to be fair, there was a lot more dread in,
*  I don't know, what the Cold War, but whatever. I'm not sure he knew what he was saying there,
*  if we are honest. Now, the fact that he didn't has conceded what he must know, even as he
*  refutes particular claims of genocide is that this horrendously murderous war is being
*  likely dragged out because of the perverse self-interest of Israel's ruler is disturbing
*  given he has thrown all the weapons at Israel that it needs to make that happen, butchering
*  tens of thousands in the process. So why then is the same White House trying to claim that
*  a peace deal that Joe Biden claimed was Israel's peace deal, which then Israel's leader Benjamin
*  Netanyahu and his allies started publicly tearing to pieces. Why did he claim that was
*  being blocked by Hamas despite Hamas having already outlined and supported almost the
*  same peace deal a few weeks ago, which Israel publicly rejected and then went on to slaughter
*  a lot more innocent people in the process, not least in Rafa when they burned alive and
*  decapitated children with their weapons. I appreciate that's all confusing, but by definition
*  it is deeply confusing because when we have to sift through this level of gaslighting
*  and deception and distortion, it becomes quite hard to actually neatly package what
*  the hell is actually happening. Does anyone have an answer? None of this is apologies
*  over Hamas, it's just a fact. Last month, Hamas said it had accepted a ceasefire deal
*  proposed by Egypt and Qatar, which would involve a ceasefire in stages where Hamas would release
*  hostages, Israel would release prisoners and pull troops back from Gaza, humanitarian aid
*  would be allowed in, while Palestinian civilians would be allowed to return to whatever remains
*  of their homes, there would then be a return to a sustainable calm, which is defined as
*  a permanent cessation of military and hostile operations, that is ending this so-called
*  war. So then Biden comes out with a deal which is basically identical and claims it's an
*  Israeli deal, weird. Now given Israel has failed in its military objectives, returning
*  the hostages by military means, having killed far more hostages than they've rescued with
*  significant releases only coming through ceasefire and exchange, indeed they have failed to defeat
*  Hamas, which has an endless supply of recruits thanks to Israel's genocidal onslaught, you keep
*  having Hamas restoring control over areas which Israel had previously claimed Hamas had been
*  defeated in. On top of the fact that the Israeli state is more isolated and frankly reviled
*  globally than it's ever been, you'd think maybe it's time for Israel to call its losses.
*  So Biden comes out and offers a deal which he claims is Israeli and demands Hamas accepts it,
*  and then they say they view the proposal positively, not that surprising given it's pretty much the
*  same as the one they already accepted weeks ago. Then Netanyahu comes out and casts doubt on the
*  deal, declaring there won't be a permanent ceasefire in Gaza until Hamas is destroyed,
*  so thus crushing a pretty central element of the deal I would say. Indeed Netanyahu says his
*  conditions for ending the war haven't changed, the destruction of Hamas' military and governing
*  capability, and says Israel will continue to insist these conditions are met before a permanent
*  ceasefire is put in place. For some reason, Hamas won't accept a condition of we must be permanently
*  destroyed before there's a ceasefire with us, which would be redundant anyway because we would
*  be destroyed. I know we had, which as I've said is a nonsense because the key cause of all this
*  violence in any case is the brutal subjugation of the Palestinian people which Hamas obviously
*  feed off, but in any case they've clearly suffered thousands of losses in terms of their fighters,
*  but equally people keep joining them because they have this objection to their homes being incinerated
*  with their loved ones slaughtered, many of them kids being butchered and horribly maimed.
*  Weirdly that offers an endless supply of recruits for a force fighting against those responsible.
*  I know, weird. Don't have to be military experts who worked that out or even just be aware of every
*  historical precedent going. It's common sense that was going to happen wasn't it?
*  Now Netanyahu's even more extreme partners, principally Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister
*  and the national security minister Itamar Ben-Ghivir have threatened to resign and collapse the government
*  if Netanyahu signs up to it. Members of Netanyahu's ruling Likud party have also threatened to resign
*  over too. So now let's listen to the US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller, always a
*  pleasure never at all. It offers a roadmap for a permanent ceasefire and an end to the crisis.
*  The world should know, the Palestinian people should know, that the only thing standing in the
*  way of an immediate ceasefire today is Hamas. The proposal on the table is nearly identical to what
*  Hamas said it would accept just a few weeks ago and it is now time for them to act. It is time for
*  them to accept the deal. It is time to finalise this agreement and put an end to the suffering
*  of Israelis and Palestinians alike. So he says the only thing standing in the way of an immediate
*  ceasefire is Hamas. The only thing, even if he was going to say Hamas haven't properly signed up to
*  it, could he really justify the claim they're the only reason? As he notes they already backed a
*  deal that's nearly identical. So Matt, why didn't that deal happen then? If as you know Hamas backed
*  it, what happened? Surely if they're the only roadblock, they'd be peace by now. Matt? Hello?
*  Hi. Are you there Matt? Matt I'm trying to have a conversation with you. Answer the question.
*  To be fair, he can't hit me. He's unlikely to be a subscriber for a start. His loss. This is purely
*  a rhetorical exercise on my part. Now I mean just now to return to Joe Biden's time interview
*  because he's quoted in response to the question and whose fault is it that that deal, the ceasefire
*  for hostages has not been consummated? Is it Hamas or Israel or both? And he says Hamas. Hamas could
*  end this tomorrow. Hamas could say unintelligible and done period. Cool. That's really helpful.
*  Thanks Joe. I had all sorts of questions but that certainly answered those. The clarity in
*  situations of one piece, life and death on a colossal scale is what I think is truly appreciated
*  here from the most powerful man on earth. Let's be clear, they're all clearly gaslighting us here.
*  I mean for a start, we need clarity by the way on the claim by Osama Hamdan, one of Hamas's
*  leaders that Israel's response conveyed to them involved reopening all files and didn't accord
*  with what Biden said. I'm certainly not here to pass off Hamas claims as facts. That claim needs
*  to be interrogated. We need some clarity. But the question is, is it the same deal which Biden has
*  proposed just a few days ago? Now, what was outlined should be accepted. Israel's genocide
*  long-sought must be ended. The Israeli hostages which were taken, and that was a serious war crime,
*  who are still alive, must be returned to their loved ones. Palestinian prisoners must be released.
*  Humanitarian aid needs to get into Gaza to stop famine. We could go on. But let's be clear here,
*  Israel has lost, badly lost. My big fear however is this. This may only end up being a pause with
*  the genocide of rampage only to continue. But also the possibility of a war with Lebanon looms,
*  with one Israeli leader demanding that it all burns. That is the total destruction of Lebanon.
*  Their genocidal aspirations are not simply contained to Gaza. This I fear has a long way
*  to run. But anything that stops this horror in Gaza in the here and now should be welcomed. So
*  let's dare to dream, but never give up on our critical faculties or stop holding those who have
*  committed terrible crimes with direct complicity of our government to account. Please like and
