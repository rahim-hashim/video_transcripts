# Israel On RAMPAGE In Gaza - And Our Media Covers It Up
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA)
*  Israel is currently on the rampage in Gaza and the Western media are overwhelmingly covering that up. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=0.0s)]
*  Joe Biden facilitated the first wave of genocide of carnage which largely wiped Gaza from the face of the earth. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=6.08s)]
*  Now under Donald Trump, Israel is liquidating the Gaza Ghetto. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=13.76s)]
*  This weekend, the IDF blew up the only cancer hospital in Gaza. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=18.16s)]
*  The claim of course is that the Turkish cancer hospital was a Hamas compound. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=23.2s)]
*  Now this really does take every accusation is a confession to its most deranged level. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=27.68s)]
*  You see, the IDF has been occupying this hospital and using it for military purposes for over a year. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=33.44s)]
*  The Palestinian journalist Eunice Harari has previously shared photos of Israeli soldiers [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=39.44s)]
*  not just gathered there but snipers stationed there. Now Israeli soldiers have also posted videos [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=44.64s)]
*  of themselves enjoying massage equipment meant for cancer patients. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=50.96s)]
*  They've also posted footage of them jubilantly destroying medical equipment. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=57.6s)]
*  Why did Israeli soldiers block this cancer hospital? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=87.6s)]
*  Not because it was a Hamas compound. They blew it up because they are committing genocide. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  They want Palestinians to die. In this case, they know they have imposed a death sentence on many cancer patients. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  They don't care how Palestinians die just as long as they die. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=108.24s)]
*  Now you would think our Western media outlets could state the facts about this particular hospital. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=112.96s)]
*  After all, the facts are incontestable that it was being used by the Israeli army, not by Hamas. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=117.6s)]
*  Those Israeli claims to the contrary can be dismissed without any further interrogation. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  But where is this? This crime in the Western media is barely mentioned in most Western media outlets at all. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  This wasn't the only hospital attacked this weekend. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=137.2s)]
*  The Israeli army attacks the emergency ward of Nasser hospital too, with no warning. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=140.08s)]
*  It happened when a journalist was being interviewed by BBC Arabic. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  This is the moment the hospital was hit whilst a journalist was giving an interview to BBC Arabic. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=147.84s)]
*  What was the justification for bombing this hospital whose victims include [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=160.16000000000003s)]
*  Palestinian medics and a 17-year-old boy who was due to be discharged today after being treated? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=163.68s)]
*  Having been already injured in another attack. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=170.16000000000003s)]
*  Now they say their target was a Hamas official named Ismail Barhoon who was killed in a strike. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  A few things here. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=179.44s)]
*  Under international law, attacking hospitals is strictly forbidden for reasons which hardly [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=181.44s)]
*  need explanation. The only exception is if the hospital has abdicated its civilian purposes by [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=186.08s)]
*  becoming used for military purposes, for example launching missiles. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=192.0s)]
*  Then any attack needs to be proportionate to any military advantage gained and advance warning [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=195.76s)]
*  needs to be given. In this case, this was a political official. He wasn't a Hamas military [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=200.88s)]
*  commander. And so he wasn't a military target. He wasn't used in a hospital for military means. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=206.4s)]
*  He was a patient. He'd been critically injured by a previous Israeli strike and he was there [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  being treated by doctors. I do not need to explain that he represented no military threat [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=218.56s)]
*  of any description. There was no legal justification, forget morality for a second, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=223.12s)]
*  no legal justification for attacking the hospital. Let's listen to what Feroz Sidra, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=228.56s)]
*  a US surgeon serving at Nasr Hospital, who survived the attack. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=234.0s)]
*  Indeed. Imagine a hospital was attacked. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=253.12s)]
*  Because a Likud member, not even Netanyahu, it's not the equivalent of Netanyahu. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  Imagine a Likud minister who had been already injured in a Hamas attack. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  You then had a Hamas missile target the part of the hospital he was in, killing several other [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=298.0s)]
*  people and also wrecking a significant part of the hospital so he can't treat patients anymore. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=304.72s)]
*  That would be seen as an unspeakable crime. It would be seen as a monstrous crime. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=309.76s)]
*  I mean, remember back in October 2023, when Al-Shifa Hospital, the main hospital, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=316.24s)]
*  or it was in Gaza, when it was hit by a missile, there was a massive controversy about who was [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=322.15999999999997s)]
*  responsible. The reason there was a massive controversy was because it was universally [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=325.92s)]
*  understood that attacking hospitals was a heinous crime. Indeed, Mark Regev at the beginning of the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=330.48s)]
*  genocide, the then senior advisor to Benjamin Netanyahu said the following. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=335.92s)]
*  Let me be clear, the IDF does not target hospitals. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=339.52000000000004s)]
*  Well, now Al-Shifa Hospital lies in ruins and every hospital and medical facility in Gaza [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=342.40000000000003s)]
*  has been attacked all repeatedly, with well over 1,000 Palestinian medics killed and most hospitals [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  and medical facilities rendered inoperable. As the United Nations inquiry found last October, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=353.52000000000004s)]
*  Israel has perpetrated a concerted policy to destroy Gaza's healthcare system as part of a [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=359.44s)]
*  broader assault on Gaza, committing war crimes and the crime against humanity of extermination, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=365.92s)]
*  with relentless and deliberate attacks on medical personnel and facilities. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=372.16s)]
*  No evidence, no actual evidence, has been presented to justify claims that these [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=376.72s)]
*  hospitals were military bases of any description. What we've seen here is yet one plank, just one [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=381.12s)]
*  plank, another plank of the genocide. Because if you destroy the healthcare system, then you impose [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=390.64s)]
*  a death sentence on so many people. I mentioned cancer patients, but I mean people with heart [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=396.40000000000003s)]
*  conditions, people with respiratory problems, people with a whole range of illnesses, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=402.8s)]
*  many pregnant women, newborn babies. You destroy your healthcare system, then that is a big step [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=410.72s)]
*  in the direction of a genocide. Of course it is. Let me say this bluntly and directly. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=420.48s)]
*  In full view of the world, the West has normalised destroying hospitals, slaughtering medical staff, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=430.48s)]
*  butchering children and babies by the thousand, deliberately starving an entire people, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=440.40000000000003s)]
*  torture, rape and endless other atrocities and examples of depravity. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=447.28000000000003s)]
*  For the West right now, this is the sowing. The coming harvest will be bitter. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=455.12s)]
*  Do you think we're going to get away with this? We're not going to get away with this. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=463.44s)]
*  For a start, once normalised, this depravity spreads like a disease. It has after all become [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=469.84000000000003s)]
*  acceptable, not even provoking a raised eyebrow from Western political and media elites. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=475.36s)]
*  And with the depravity of the West flaunted for the world to see, with so many on a daily basis, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=482.16s)]
*  in every continent on the earth witnessing the limitless barbarism being unleashed by the West, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=488.24s)]
*  it would be desperately naive to think we will not suffer a hideous reckoning. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=493.84000000000003s)]
*  It is necessary for me to keep referencing this quote by the way. I'll do it again. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=499.52000000000004s)]
*  If someone says it's raining and another person says it's dry, it's not your job to quote them [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=504.56s)]
*  both. Your job is to look out the fucking window and find out which is true. And this is a quote [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=510.64s)]
*  about journalism. Let's listen to BBC News with that in mind. The head of the hospital accused [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=515.36s)]
*  Israel of violating all international and humanitarian law. He's acknowledged that a [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=524.08s)]
*  number of his medical staff were injured in the strikes and we've seen those images of just a [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=529.28s)]
*  ward really blown out after the strike took place. Okay BBC, okay. The head of the hospital has [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=534.48s)]
*  accused Israel of violating international humanitarian law. Okay, you've made that clear. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=541.68s)]
*  Is it true or false? It is objectively true. An objective journalist is not betraying their [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=545.4399999999999s)]
*  objectivity by stating the facts. There was no argument found in an actual law which says [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=551.92s)]
*  otherwise. So why does the BBC present this fact as a contestable opinion which is open to debate? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=558.08s)]
*  Now Israel is unleashing its barbarism across Gaza. This morning Al Jazeera reports more than [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=564.72s)]
*  25 Israeli strikes in Khan Yunis in southern Gaza, killing at least 16 people. Meanwhile, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=569.2800000000001s)]
*  Morgan McEnoghle, an Irish vascular surgeon volunteering with medical aid for Palestine [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=574.08s)]
*  in Nassau Hospital, says the average age of children pronounced dead after this week's [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=578.96s)]
*  wave of attacks is between six and eight years old, over a third of casualties were under 14. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=583.92s)]
*  On Israeli television they continue to broadcast their incessant genocidal intent. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=590.4s)]
*  This is Colonel Gabi Sibony from the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=595.28s)]
*  Let's just repeat what he says there. Hamas is not the problem in Gaza. The population in Gaza is [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=613.92s)]
*  barbaric riff raff. The only solution is Trump's vision. Describing an entire [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=635.44s)]
*  people as barbaric riff raff is straightforward genocidal incitement. Describing anyone else as [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=642.08s)]
*  barbaric riff raff when you support a genocidal onslaught being committed by your own state, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=647.7600000000001s)]
*  which is blowing up hospitals, murdering medics, butchering countless thousands of children and [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=651.9200000000001s)]
*  babies, as well as so many other innocent civilians, deliberately starving an entire [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=657.36s)]
*  people, I could go on. As you advocate forcibly removing an entire people from their land. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=661.2s)]
*  You think you are in any position to describe anyone else as barbaric riff raff. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=668.88s)]
*  It's the inability to see themselves for who they are, those who support this genocide, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=674.88s)]
*  whether they're in Israel or Britain or the United States or elsewhere. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=680.6400000000001s)]
*  They are incapable of understanding who they are. I mean, you often, you know, you think this, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=684.96s)]
*  you look back at history at all this great evil, you go, do they not realize? Do they not realize [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=690.0s)]
*  how twisted and sick and depraved they are? How can they not understand? I mean, history makes [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=694.0s)]
*  it clear, but you think how can at the time they not look at themselves and go, oh my God, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=699.76s)]
*  what have I become? Last week, one Israeli cheerleader tweeted the following. There were [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=703.84s)]
*  no civilians in Gaza. Hamas has drafted everyone down to the newest babies into the war effort, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=710.16s)]
*  and they rejoice when the children they shove into the line of fire die because it's their [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=714.48s)]
*  most powerful weapon against those they hate more than life and blood. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=718.0s)]
*  As another Twitter user perceptively responded to this, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=721.76s)]
*  everyone who has ever committed abetted or supported genocide thinks they've stumbled upon [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=725.28s)]
*  the exception to humanity, that they alone have found the people who aren't people, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=729.28s)]
*  that those they kill are more dangerous than their killers. It is inherent to genocide to [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=732.96s)]
*  think like this. And that is exactly it. The genocidal mania possessing Israeli society is not, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=737.68s)]
*  alas, unique. Look at our history. All genocides are justified by a view that this particular [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=742.8s)]
*  people poses an existential threat, that this particular people have collective guilt, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=748.4799999999999s)]
*  that this particular people are the exception for which you must dull any remorse or empathy. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=752.8s)]
*  This has proven a hideous lesson for all of us about how the great evils we are familiar with [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=758.56s)]
*  in our past were made possible. And it must be restated. If we do not succeed in establishing [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbR3pGae2aA&t=763.3599999999999s)]
