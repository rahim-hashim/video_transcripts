# Israel Medic Massacre Lies FALL APART
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM)
*  Israel's massacre of 15 Palestinian Red Crescent paramedics and rescue workers [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=0.0s)]
*  follows a similar pattern. It goes like this. Israel commits a terrible war crime. The evidence [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=5.44s)]
*  for the crime is overwhelming. The Israeli state issues a pack of lies which the Western media [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=12.32s)]
*  eagerly laps up. In some cases, the lies are comprehensively debunked, but the rebuttal is [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=17.52s)]
*  either given coverage, which is inadequate and lacking in prominence, or simply ignored [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=23.92s)]
*  together by many Western media outlets. Rinse and repeat. Newly released and frankly [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=28.24s)]
*  nightmarish video footage has exposed Israeli claims for what they are, lies. This will not [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  stop the Western media from continuing to treat Israeli propaganda as credible. To recap, on the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=41.04s)]
*  23rd of March, Red Crescent medics, first responders and a UN staff member were dispatched in five [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=48.8s)]
*  ambulances, a fire truck and a UN vehicle to collect Palestinians injured by Israeli attacks [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=56.4s)]
*  near Rafah in the south of Gaza so that they could receive medical treatment. The UN reported that [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=62.72s)]
*  all of the vehicles were hit and that contact was lost. A sole survivor testified that Israel [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  had killed the crew in his ambulance. Access was only granted by the Israeli military five days [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=75.28s)]
*  later. En route, the UN team witnessed and videoed multiple atrocities as hundreds of [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=82.32s)]
*  civilians fled as the Israeli army shot at them, including a woman shot in the back of the head [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=87.52s)]
*  and a man shot as he tried to retrieve her. When the UN finally got there, they uncovered a mass [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=92.0s)]
*  grave reporting that the paramedics and other workers had been killed one by one after driving [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=97.11999999999999s)]
*  their clearly marked vehicles. A forensic doctor testified that many had been shot at close range. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=102.0s)]
*  One had his hands and feet tied. The UN also uncovered an attempt by the Israeli military [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=109.36s)]
*  to bury the ambulances and other vehicles. The evidence was overwhelming. But the IDF issued [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=115.36s)]
*  statements claiming their soldiers had opened fire towards Hamas vehicles and eliminated several [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=122.56s)]
*  Hamas terrorists. Israel's foreign minister, Gideon Sarr, said the following. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=128.56s)]
*  Well, the IDF did not randomly attack an ambulance. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=133.84s)]
*  On last Sunday, several uncoordinated vehicles were identified advancing suspiciously [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=141.28s)]
*  toward IDF troops without headlights [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=148.72s)]
*  or emergency signals. IDF troops then opened fire at the suspected [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=155.60000000000002s)]
*  vehicles. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=162.88s)]
*  The Western media was presented, on the one hand, with statements from the United Nations [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=166.8s)]
*  and the Red Crescent, evidence from a mass grave, evidence from a forensic doctor and the testimony [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=171.6s)]
*  of a survivor, and on the other hand, statements from a military which has committed every war [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=177.2s)]
*  crime under the sun which has a long and incontrovertible history of lies. What did [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=182.48s)]
*  the Western media do in those circumstances? They treated both as equally credible and [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=188.56s)]
*  plausible versions of events. One BBC journalist reported the following on the news channel. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  This is a classic modus operandi to turn war crimes into a game of he says she says where [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=219.28s)]
*  we are encouraged to simply conclude that we can never really tell where the truth lies in the fog [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=225.84s)]
*  of war when it comes to Israel and Palestine and nothing is ever allowed to definitively stick to [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=229.76s)]
*  Israel. Such is the sense of impunity that the Israeli military enjoys. They did not even see [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=235.6s)]
*  fit to make sure they destroyed all the possible evidence. Specifically, they failed to seize the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=242.8s)]
*  mobile phone of one of their victims. The footage of the last moments of these medics and first [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=246.88s)]
*  responders was uncovered and published in the New York Times. The video is deeply disturbing. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  However, I'll remember it for the rest of my life. The footage shows that in total contradiction [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=256.8s)]
*  of Israel's claims, the ambulance has had their lights on and were clearly marked and they were [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=260.8s)]
*  ambushed by the Israeli army. The terrified and obviously unarmed paramedics are then subjected [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=265.76s)]
*  to a barrage of bullets. You hear one paramedic reciting the shahada, the Muslim declaration of [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=271.76s)]
*  faith, because he knows he's going to die. His last words were, forgive me, mother, forgive me, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=280.0s)]
*  I chose this path to help people, forgive me, mother. He was begging for forgiveness from his [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=287.52s)]
*  mother because he had chosen to be a paramedic as if this is a career which should be treated as [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=294.24s)]
*  having a possible death sentence. His body was then found in the mass grave with a bullet to his [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=299.52s)]
*  head. There's more. Sky News has revealed that the 15 paramedics and first responders were in an [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=304.4s)]
*  area not covered by an evacuation order, discrediting yet another Israeli lie that this was the case and [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=310.08s)]
*  that coordination was therefore required. The Israeli military has also claimed that the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=315.84s)]
*  vehicles were traveling without coordination in a combat zone. But a Sky News investigation has [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=321.35999999999996s)]
*  revealed that an evacuation order was not issued by the IDF for that area until at least an hour [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=327.36s)]
*  after the incident. This Israeli military account is proven to be lies. As Trey Yinks, the chief [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=334.56s)]
*  foreign correspondent of Fox News says, I've spoken with the IDF multiple times about this day. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=341.92s)]
*  I was told several vehicles were identified advancing suspiciously towards IDF troops [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=348.08000000000004s)]
*  on emergency signals. That is clearly not true. So what we have here is an unbelievably grave [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=353.2s)]
*  war crime. The massacre of 15 red present medics and first responders which the Israeli military [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=358.72s)]
*  covered up and lied about. If this had been 15 Israeli medics and first responders, the Red Cross [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=363.28000000000003s)]
*  butchered by Hamas, the media coverage would be deafening. It would be front page news and lead [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=372.48s)]
*  every news bulletin. Every Western leader under the sun would issue damning statements [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=378.0s)]
*  offering this up as specific evidence about the utter evil and depravity of Hamas. But these [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=382.64s)]
*  victims were Palestinian and the perpetrators were the Israeli military. On the BBC News website, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=389.12s)]
*  it was four stories down yesterday but most damningly the headline was, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=394.64s)]
*  video footage appears to contradict Israeli account of Gaza medic killings. Appears to [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=398.96s)]
*  contradict. What does this even mean? The footage definitively proves the Israeli account is a [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=404.0s)]
*  litany of lies. What possible room for doubt exists here? What does appear mean in these [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=409.84s)]
*  circumstances? What could it possibly mean for it maybe not to be the case? What the footage is made [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=414.16s)]
*  up? It's CGI? What does the BBC really think here? Just imagine this footage had never been [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=420.16s)]
*  uncovered. Indeed, in the case of so many Israeli war crimes, there is no such footage and Israeli [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=426.96s)]
*  claims, however discredited they are by a whole range of evidence, are simply allowed to stand. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=430.96s)]
*  It gets worse. Today, the BBC published another article which was originally headlined, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=436.56s)]
*  Israel admits mistakes over medic killings in Gaza. Admit mistakes. To be clear, we are talking about [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=441.03999999999996s)]
*  the mass execution of Red Crescent medics and first responders whose bodies were dumped in a mass grave [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=446.4s)]
*  which the Israeli state systematically and deliberately lied about. If Russia had done this, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=450.96s)]
*  the Red Cross medics in Ukraine, would the BBC say that Russia had admitted mistakes? Mistakes [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=455.44s)]
*  when committing the gravest war crimes imaginable? And that becomes a whoopsie. This is disgusting. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=462.56s)]
*  The BBC is disgusting. It's a public broadcaster we have to pay for and they will face a reckoning [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=469.04s)]
*  for what they have done in this genocide. That BBC headline was then changed to Israel changes [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=472.96s)]
*  account of Gaza medic killings after video show deadly attack. They cannot even state an objective [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=477.76s)]
*  fact about Israel's deceit when it's been proven without any possible other explanation that they [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=485.2s)]
*  have lied through their teeth. And even after it's proven beyond any doubt the Israeli authorities [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=491.68s)]
*  are lying through their teeth about this crime, they still go on and print Israeli statements as [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=497.2s)]
*  though they are credible and we should take them seriously. They don't do that with Russia. I'll [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=501.12s)]
*  read. The BBC article says, an IDF official briefed journalists on Saturday evening saying the soldiers [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=506.96s)]
*  had earlier fired on a car containing three Hamas members. Even using the term briefed here confers [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=512.16s)]
*  a sense of legitimacy and accuracy on Israeli propaganda. A Russian official briefed journalist [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=517.68s)]
*  blah blah blah. Do you see that? It then says when the ambulances responded and approached the area, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=524.0799999999999s)]
*  aerial surveillance monitors informed the soldiers on the ground of the convoy advancing suspiciously. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=530.64s)]
*  This is simply printed as fact by the way. Yes, the article says there was no evidence any of the [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=535.52s)]
*  emergency team was armed. The bar was on the floor. We're supposed to be grateful for the BBC [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=540.96s)]
*  stating some facts here. But it also states when the ambulances stopped beside the Hamas car, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=545.12s)]
*  the soldiers assumed they were under threat and opened fire. Again, these claims uncritically [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=549.2s)]
*  regurgitated. They're not facts. That's presented as a fact. I don't believe that. I believe what [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=554.32s)]
*  I can see based on the evidence, which is the Israeli army deliberately massacred 15 [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=564.56s)]
*  medics and first responders after ambulances which were lit up and driving at a normal speed [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=571.68s)]
*  were ambushed by the Israeli military. They massacred them and threw them in a mass grave. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=580.2399999999999s)]
*  Honestly though, wait till you hear this bit. Wait till you hear this bit. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=586.0s)]
*  The soldiers buried the bodies of the 15 dead workers in sand to protect them from wild animals, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=588.9599999999999s)]
*  the official said, claiming the vehicles were moved and buried the following day to clear the road. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=596.3199999999999s)]
*  What do you even say? What do you even say at this point? The BBC has literally printed as a [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=601.28s)]
*  credible claim that the Israeli army buried 15 medics and first responders in a mass grave [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=606.64s)]
*  to protect them from fucking wild animals. Are you on crack? Are you people on crack? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=610.64s)]
*  What is going on in your head when you wrote that down? Do you think you're a serious journalist? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=617.9200000000001s)]
*  What is the editorial process here? You're literally writing about the mass execution [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=624.24s)]
*  of red Crescent medics and first responders have been dumped in a mass grave and you have uncritically [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=631.12s)]
*  printed the suggestion by the Israeli military who lied to you that they'd been put in a mass [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=636.8000000000001s)]
*  grave to protect them from wild animals. You cannot make this shit up. A straightforward [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=643.6s)]
*  question. Do you honestly believe that the Red Army ambushed the Red Cross, massacred them and [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=651.0400000000001s)]
*  threw their bodies into a mass grave and lied about it from start to finish? What? The BBC would [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=656.0s)]
*  subsequently print, oh well the Russian army claimed that they'd put the bodies in a mass grave, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=660.48s)]
*  not even a mass grave, that the Russian army wanted to protect the bodies from wild animals [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=664.88s)]
*  so they buried them all together. I'm sorry, I mean I shouldn't, I mean actually to be honest, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=670.0s)]
*  I think it's worth just losing our shit occasionally at the insanity that we are being [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=678.0s)]
*  presented with here. This is not normal. We can never normalise this stuff. This is so fucked up [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=685.52s)]
*  and one day it will be seen as such unless of course our species just goes down the fucking [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=693.52s)]
*  swanee which at this rate, the BBC goes on, the Israeli military official denied any of the medics [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=700.5600000000001s)]
*  were handcuffed before they died and said they were not executed at close range as some reports [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=705.44s)]
*  have suggested. Well I'm glad we've got the BBC to uncritically regurgitate Israeli claims after [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=708.8000000000001s)]
*  they commit yet another obscene war crime and then covered it up. Great journalism there as per well [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=713.44s)]
*  done. Where is your Pulitzer? Israel lies, kills, lies, kills, lies, kills. Back in 2022 they killed [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=717.12s)]

*  chief of hospital being the headquarters of Hamas, they lied about the killing of five-year-old [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=728.0s)]
*  Hinraj Ab and her family, they lied about the Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA being at Hamas [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=731.52s)]
*  front, they lied about the flower massacre when over 100 Palestinians were massacred while waiting [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=735.92s)]
*  for a flower. I really could just keep going on and on and on and on and on and on and on. As the [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=740.0s)]

*  by the IDF. But what's more disturbing is this won't change the Western media's modus operandi. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=750.08s)]
*  If you think it will, you're going to be very disappointed. The Israeli journalist Barak Ravid [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=754.72s)]
*  says, this incident is an extremely difficult further breaking point in relations between the [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=758.72s)]
*  IDF and the international media. The army and its spokesmen lied to all the media outlets in the [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=763.36s)]
*  world in their initial response. The damage caused to Israel by this lie alone even before the actual [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=768.5600000000001s)]

*  claims and presenting them as credible and legitimate. As I've noted, Western media outlets [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=782.24s)]
*  have done rebussels of Israeli claims before. CNN took apart Israeli claims about the so-called [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=787.2800000000001s)]
*  flower massacre. The Washington Post took apart Israel's claims about the November 2023 assault [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=792.4000000000001s)]
*  on El Chivar hospital. The New York Times examined how contrary to Israeli claims, £2,000 bombs were [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=796.4000000000001s)]

*  all of a sudden going, well, no, let's congratulate the Western media. They've done their job, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=805.76s)]
*  haven't they? I've just given you some examples, haven't I? No. You see, here's the thing. These [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=808.48s)]
*  are outlets which have systematically whitewashed this obscenity overall. Not to say there aren't [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=813.76s)]
*  exceptions. Overall, they have deferred to Israeli narratives, whitewashed crimes, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=821.12s)]
*  failed to spell out exactly what's happening. The point is, isn't just these rebussels aren't [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=827.84s)]
*  frequent enough or given proper prominence or treated with the requisite gravity, i.e. as [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=832.48s)]
*  evidence of extreme war crimes, it's that they are orphaned from the wider narrative. Western media [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=837.6800000000001s)]
*  outlets should make clear that Israel has a proven record of entirely false statements about such [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=844.08s)]
*  atrocities. But like a perverse groundhog day, they act instead as though these rebussels never [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=850.4s)]
*  happened. Note how they will say things like, Hamas run health ministry to undermine our faith [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=857.76s)]
*  in the official death statistics. That's why they do that. But even though we know Israel lies over [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=865.36s)]
*  and over again, you don't get, as you should have standard, previous Israeli claims have been proven [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=871.12s)]
*  to be false. The narrative around Israel remains made at titanium that Israel is engaged in a war [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=877.04s)]
*  self-defence and that there is a debate which can be had about whether that response is [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=884.24s)]
*  proportionate or not with legitimate arguments on both sides, rather than a genocidal onslaught in [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=887.6800000000001s)]
*  which every war crime under the sun has been committed, leading to arrests warrants issued [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=892.32s)]
*  by the International Criminal Court, a case of genocide at the International Court of Justice, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=896.8000000000001s)]
*  and a consensus among scholars of genocide that genocide is being committed. We can see how [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=900.56s)]
*  Western media outlets should behave by simply looking at how claims by Russian authorities [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=906.9599999999999s)]
*  are treated. Quite correctly, there is no deference there. This is emblematic of how the [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=910.64s)]
*  Western media has willingly allowed itself to become an integral part of Israel's propaganda machine. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=914.88s)]
*  This is the greatest scandal overall of Western journalism of our age and we must keep the receipts [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=920.4s)]
*  for the reckoning ahead. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fWi6Y6xEhM&t=926.96s)]
