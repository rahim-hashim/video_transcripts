Video Description: As Russia launches missiles at Ukraine and kills innocent civilians, Western governments are in uproar. Yet when Israel unleashes far worse war crimes, there's not only no condemnation - Western governments are arming and supporting Israel's onslaught.

The rest of the world isn't stupid - and this double standard will have devastating consequences for Western power for a very long time to come.

# Hypocrisy Over Gaza And Ukraine Is A Disgrace
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [December 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZATExzU-5ec)
*  Moral consistency. Without it you have no real claim to moral authority.
*  Moral consistency would mean that you condemn attacks on civilians no matter who does them.
*  You would condemn war crimes no matter who does them.
*  If say attacking tower blocks where civilians live or medical facilities is an outrage in one case,
*  which it is, it should be an equal outrage in another case.
*  And here is why Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine exposes the rampant,
*  unashamed and profoundly unsubtle hypocrisy of the West when you compare the response
*  with the horrors of Gaza. Now Russia has just launched a huge wave of missiles against Ukrainian
*  cities including the capital Kyiv. According to the Ukrainian president Zelensky 110 missiles
*  were fired in a few hours. Now bear in mind Russia fired 160 missiles in the first day of the
*  invasion so this is clearly a very substantial attack. It's reported at least 30 civilians were
*  killed, 132 injured with missile strikes on residential buildings in the capital Kyiv in
*  Lviv and in Kharkiv. It's also reported by Ukrainian authorities that targets here include a maternity
*  ward, educational facilities, a shopping centre, residential tower blocks and other private homes.
*  And amongst those killed are two kids and a pregnant woman in Odessa. Now I've been clear
*  from the very beginning that Russia has committed grave war crimes in Ukraine and here are yet more
*  examples. After this latest onslaught I had two thoughts. Firstly, obviously solidarity with the
*  Ukrainian people as they're subjected to yet more horror, they've suffered already so much.
*  Secondly, how on earth, how on earth can Western governments credibly condemn these atrocities? How
*  could anyone possibly take them seriously? It would sound I thought like a dark dark satire which
*  would receive for most of the world nothing but contempt and ridicule and quite rightly so. After
*  all the US has backed Israel as it has unleashed mass slaughter and destruction by which I mean
*  not just giving it political and diplomatic support and cover but arming it to the teeth,
*  providing it with weapons which have blown apart the bodies of thousands of innocent people including
*  thousands of kids, toddlers, babies, no condemnation just lots of weapons to kill innocent civilians. We
*  don't know by the way, we don't know how many Ukrainian civilians have been killed by Russia's
*  brutal invasion. It's a lot though. The UN's official death toll is 10 000. We don't know for
*  example how many civilians were killed in Putin's devastation of Maripol. We all remember those
*  devastating images but there's no doubt that as a proportion far far far more civilians have been
*  killed in Gaza than in Ukraine and in such a shorter period of time. Now Ukraine's pre-war
*  population was approaching 44 million, Gaza's pre-war population was around 2.2 million.
*  So Ukraine had a population to begin with 20 times bigger. According to the independent NGO,
*  Yoram-Med Human Rights Monitor, 27 and a half thousand civilians have been killed in Gaza
*  as of 30th of December, actually slightly more than that. Now for the equivalent number of
*  civilians to have been killed in Ukraine that would have meant well over half a million civilians
*  and no one is claiming anything like that figure and Ukraine's war has been going on for 674 days
*  compared to 84 days of horror in Gaza. None of this is to belittle Putin's horrors by the way.
*  On their own terms his crimes are bad enough and in a just world he would face a war crimes tribunal
*  for what he has done. It just underlines the absolute obscenity of what the Israeli state
*  has done and is doing to Gaza including a level of devastation incidentally according to experts
*  worse than that which for example Maripol was subjected to. Indeed take those reports of 30
*  Ukrainians being killed by Russian weapons terrible enough on their own terms they were enough to
*  lead international headlines but an average of 10 times that many Palestinians are being killed by
*  Israeli weapons in Gaza every single day every single day. Now I know statistics lack humanity
*  so let's all try to remember each is a human being who lived and loved who had hopes dreams
*  fears insecurities whose lives were violently snuffed out sometimes immediately
*  sometimes not sometimes in excruciating pain and sometimes with all-consuming unimaginable terror.
*  Now let's just read what Joe Biden had to say about that assault on Ukraine by Russia. He said
*  overnight Russia launched its largest aerial assault on Ukraine since this war began.
*  This massive bombardment used drones and missiles including missiles with hypersonic capability to
*  strike cities and civilian infrastructure all across Ukraine. Strikes reportedly hit a maternity
*  hospital a shopping mall and residential areas killing innocent people and injuring dozens more.
*  It is a stark reminder to the world that nearly after nearly two years of this devastating war
*  Putin's objective remains unchanged. He seeks to obliterate Ukraine and subjugate its people.
*  He must be stopped. Now firstly on its own terms fair enough he's right substantially that's
*  correct but it doesn't just apply to Gaza it applies far far far more literally to Gaza
*  proportionately far more killed far more destruction the conditions that sustain life
*  in an infinitely worse place but in the case of Gaza the US isn't condemning the attempt so
*  let's just use Biden's language obliterate Gaza which is far more accurate in this case it is
*  backing and arming this attempt to obliterate except we can strike out attempt which is what
*  he said about Ukraine in terms of what Russia is doing to it. Gaza is being obliterated satellite
*  data suggests that as many as 80 percent of buildings in northern Gaza have been damaged
*  or destroyed across Gaza itself an estimated 70 percent of buildings have been damaged or destroyed
*  that is obliteration you could argue that Gaza has been obliterated and there is more horror
*  to come now bear in mind the US has admitted that the US has committed war crimes in the most
*  meanly mouth way possible that's an important caveat because Joe Biden said off camera that
*  Israel's bombing was indiscriminate and then a White House spokesperson subsequently walked
*  those comments back so clearly this was a case of what we could describe as accidental honesty
*  but that qualifies as a confession not a condemnation given US complicity indiscriminate
*  bombing is a war crime it's prohibited by the Geneva Conventions which governs the norms and
*  laws of warfare so what then of the fact that as the Israeli military commits war crimes as
*  confessed by the US administration the same administration bypasses congress to send Israel
*  more weapons without democratic accountability and oversight and what are these weapons as the
*  US journalist Ryan Grim notes this is battlefield artillery because it's not expected to be precise
*  it has a huge blast radius and off a lands outside where it was aimed Israel has now packed two plus
*  million people into very tight quarters the mere act of shipping the more he adds of these right
*  now is a potential war crime just absorb that condemnations for Russia rightly for its war crimes
*  whilst Israel is armed to the teeth to commit its own now it's not just the US of course as the UK
*  mission official mission to the United Nations has tweeted Russia's wave of air attacks last night
*  were not aimed at the front lines but cities and civilians homes shopping centers and metros were
*  hit the death toll is still climbing Russia will not gain momentum nor succeed we will support Ukraine
*  for as long as it takes how do these jokers think the rest of the world sees this you think they're
*  stupid don't you I mean let's not just be unfair it's not as though that same UK mission hasn't
*  mentioned Gaza at all yesterday they treated the scale of suffering and displacement of innocent
*  Palestinian civilians and Gaza remain shocking it is reported that four in 10 of those killed in
*  Gaza so far have been children close to eight and a half thousand dead many more will die if we do
*  not act to stop this humanitarian catastrophe as it puts it humanitarian catastrophe to stop this
*  humanitarian catastrophe oh really how did that humanitarian catastrophe happen then was it an
*  earthquake a hurricane maybe it was a tsunami I don't know maybe King Kong made a bad tempered
*  arrival on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea this is simply reputational management from a
*  country which refused to vote for ceasefire and now parades its conscience on the global stage
*  by demanding we act to stop a humanitarian catastrophe that the British government has
*  helped facilitate from the very beginning now let's listen to your opinion specifically
*  says Joseph Borrell-Fontelles the EU's foreign affairs supremo who condemns yet another cowardly
*  and indiscriminate targeting of schools a metro station and a hospital adding their barbaric
*  attacks correct but where the EU statements condemning Israel's attacks is barbaric cowardly
*  or indiscriminate even as it destroys far more schools hospitals and homes what then of the
*  western media coverage consider this point from the US author and scholar Assel Rad what she'd done
*  is compare two New York Times stories one about Ukraine the other about Gaza the first is Russia
*  pounds Ukrainian cities in one of the largest air attacks of the war she notes in this headline that
*  the attacker is named Russia she emphasizes the word pounds is used that projects a sense of course
*  of brutality in the subheading it clearly states the attacks killed at least 30 people the other
*  headline reads explosion Gazans say with airstrike leaves many casualties in dense neighborhood this
*  headline projects uncertainty and even skepticism it doesn't state he was killed rather than killed
*  we simply have casualties while the subheading discusses the lifeless being prepared for burial
*  the lifeless is that what we call dead people now well clearly only if they are Palestinian now
*  meanwhile another New York Times headline is displaced Gazans in the south facing dangers
*  they had fought to escape what is meant here is that nowhere is safe in Gaza claims of a of safe
*  zones or lie wherever Palestinians flee they are bombed by the Israeli army and they are killed
*  and maimed Gaza faces the apocalypse an apocalypse which western politicians and media outlets
*  directly facilitated the crimes committed by the Israeli state are being loudly broadcast to the
*  world you could just pick them at random Thursday the UN aid chief notes an aid convoy was fired
*  upon while traveling from northern Gaza to Rafa a convoy that's clearly marked he notes and its
*  movements coordinated with the parties Gaza's population has been driven into an ever-shrinking
*  corner of Gaza and as must be noted and will be noted again and again and again and again
*  it won't be the violence which kills most Palestinians but the collapsed healthcare system
*  the therefore untreated injuries illnesses and conditions as well as hunger the lack of clean
*  water we could go on as the brilliant Debbie Sridhar professor and chair of global public health
*  rights a quarter of Gaza's population is on course to die from disease and illnesses it should be
*  noted with that context that South Africa of course itself a previous victim of apartheid has
*  failed a devastating case accusing Israel of genocide at the international court of justice
*  I'm going to do a separate video on that it is one of the most devastating documents I've ever
*  read in my entire life a very serious and detailed document what I will say is that the world has
*  watched this episode closely this gruesome vicious little episode which shows no signs of ending
*  they've looked at the grotesque double standards applied to Gaza in ukraine now for much of the
*  world the claims of the west the moral authority were always groundless western countries after all
*  colonized much of the world stole their resources enslaved their people stole their land committed
*  multiple genocides oversaw numerous avoidable mass famines many of these countries had to fight to
*  shake off that colonial domination at huge cost and sacrifice only to remain locked in a world
*  rigged in favor of those same nations which had made themselves rich at the expense of the rest
*  of the world and those same poorer countries are now condemned to suffer the worst consequences
*  as just one example of a climate emergency overwhelmingly caused by that rich global north
*  they've seen these western states back multiple dictatorships and indeed install multiple
*  dictatorships because they conveniently serve their strategic interests whilst simultaneously
*  crowing about human rights and democracy they've witnessed the more recent bloodbaths such as the
*  iraq war so that moral authority was let's be honest never really bought into by much of the world
*  for pretty obvious reasons but how can there be any claims by the west the moral authority now
*  how can anyone possibly take the moral pronouncements of the west seriously ever
*  again now this is not actually something to crow about if western domination was declining in
*  favor of something more benevolent that would be cause for celebration but it isn't instead global
*  anarchy beckons international law long something which powerful states and their allies pick and
*  choose from as it suits their interests is in a state of collapse and one of the consequences
*  of this massacre of gaza may well be more blood and chaos to come in so many parts of our already
*  beleaguered globe a bleak place to end but it is better to be honest than to give false hope please
