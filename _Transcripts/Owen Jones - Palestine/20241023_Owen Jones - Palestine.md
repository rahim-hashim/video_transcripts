# Israel We Will KILL Last Palestinian Journalists
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QR4_kehzPNk)
*  This is urgent. The Israeli state has put a target on the backs of the six remaining
*  Palestinian journalists in northern Gaza and six of the last surviving Palestinian journalists
*  remaining in Gaza full stop. They're all Al Jazeera journalists and they've played a pivotal role in
*  reporting on some of the worst crimes and atrocities committed in our age. And that is exactly why the
*  Israeli state wants them dead. The Israeli defense forces, so-called, have tweeted out that these
*  six journalists are terrorists. They claim to have documents saying that Hamas, Islamic Jihad,
*  claiming these documents serve as proof of the integration of Hamas terrorists within the Qatari
*  Al Jazeera media network. And no, Israel has been waging a ceaseless and remorseless war on Al
*  Jazeera, attempting to ban, of course, all of its reporting because Al Jazeera is one of the only
*  media networks which has actually shown the reality of Israel's genocide. They specifically
*  claim that Al Jazeera journalists here have spearheaded the propaganda for Hamas, especially
*  in northern Gaza. This is a key point actually, we'll come on to that. Now two of them are Anas
*  al-Sharif and Hossam Shabbat, whose content has been engaged with by many millions of people across
*  multiple media platforms all over the world. Now bear in mind that since 7th October 2023,
*  the Israeli state has perpetrated the biggest slaughter of journalists in recorded history.
*  Many of these journalists have been slaughtered in their beds, sometimes alongside most or
*  their entire families, including children, including their babies. At the same time,
*  the Israeli state has banned foreign journalists from entering Gaza. As Alex Crawford from Sky News
*  said last December, international journalists have been deliberately blocked from entering Gaza
*  by primarily Israel, who doesn't want them seeing the war crimes. On the smearing of these
*  journalists, here is some context. As the Committee to Protect Journalists says in a statement,
*  the Committee to Protect Journalists is aware of the accusations made by the Israel Defence Forces
*  against several journalists in Gaza accusing them of being members of militant groups.
*  Israel has repeatedly made similar unproven claims without producing credible evidence.
*  After killing Al Jazeera correspondent Ismail Al Ghul in July, the IDF previously produced a
*  similar document which contained contradictory information showing that Al Ghul, born in 1997,
*  received a Hamas military ranking in 2017 when he would have been 10 years old.
*  It is worth recalling that Israel's war against journalists long predates the current onslaught
*  against Gaza and indeed back in May 2022, the Israeli state shot and killed Shireen Abu Akhli,
*  a Palestinian-American journalist. They claimed initially it was Palestinian militants to blame.
*  Months later, when attention of course had moved elsewhere, they admitted they were responsible.
*  Now, as I say, Hossam Shabbat is one of the journalists targeted. He's done incredible
*  work exposing war crimes and atrocities, risking his life every single day. Many of his colleagues
*  and close friends have been butchered by the Israeli state and he's had to bury them.
*  He says in a statement, Israel's army has released fabricated dossiers framing us,
*  the last remaining journalists in North Gaza, reporting on Israel's extermination and ethnic
*  cleansing campaign as terrorists. This blatant and belligerent attempt to transform us,
*  the last witnesses in the North, into killable targets is an assassination attempt, an obvious
*  attempt to preemptively justify our murder. We would like to remind everyone that after murdering
*  our colleague Ismael Al Ghul, Israel released a document that claimed he supposedly received
*  a military ranking on July 1st 2007 when he would have been a 10 year old child. This public threat
*  was made without any evidence and is part of a systematic propaganda campaign to justify the
*  unjustifiable as Israel continues to target civilians in Gaza including doctors, aid workers,
*  children and us journalists. We call on our colleagues and media institutions around the
*  world to show their solidarity with us. Despite these dangerous and untrue threats made against
*  us, we remain committed to our profession and will continue to report the facts on the ground
*  as the genocide regretfully continues unabated. That's very clear what's going on here. Shabbat
*  says these are the last witnesses in the North and Israel has cut off communications in the North.
*  They impose a total siege on the North from the beginning of this month, preventing food, water,
*  medicine and all the essentials of life from getting in. They waste a ceaseless war against
*  hospitals whilst wiping civilian infrastructure off the face of the earth and driving the
*  desperately traumatised, hungry, maimed, injured survivors from northern Gaza whilst detaining
*  many to send them to camps where we know from overwhelming reports there is mass torture,
*  including several detainees who were tortured to death as well as rape and gang rape.
*  At the same time, the ruling Likud party in Israel has organised a big conference in support
*  of ethnically cleansing Gaza and colonising it with illegal settlements. That's what's happening
*  here. They are now trying to clear northern Gaza of all Palestinian life and Palestinian existence
*  to settle it for the state of Israel. That's why they need to silence anyone still there,
*  reporting on the atrocities being committed in this genocidal onslaught.
*  The Israeli state are helping to facilitate this crime. The Ediyoth Aronof newspaper headline is
*  IDF exposes six Al Jazeera journalists as Gaza terrorists, while Emanuel Fabian, the British
*  Israeli military correspondent of the Times of Israel, posts this IDF propaganda on his Twitter
*  feed. I would note that this journalist served in the IDF, so he's a former soldier in an army,
*  which is currently committing some of the worst war crimes of our time, whilst sharing
*  official Israeli propaganda which is smearing Palestinian journalists as combatants,
*  propaganda from Israel and attempt to have them killed. Well, journalists such as him need to be
*  held to account because he is clearly there helping to legitimise that propaganda and putting those
*  courageous Palestinian journalists in danger. I'd also note that several Israeli journalists are
*  currently serving soldiers. As an anti-Zionist Israeli account who I follow religiously puts it,
*  he's got the punchy Twitter handle at I really hate you, could not recommend following him more.
*  Says an Israeli journalist was wounded whilst taking part as an army reservist
*  in the invasion of a foreign country. Remember that the next time they try to bullshit you with
*  Palestinian journalists are Hamas, Israeli journalists being soldiers. He's referring here
*  to Haim Goldich, who is, and I'm not shitting you here, a correspondent for the Israeli Public
*  Broadcasting Corporation, or KAN, the Israeli equivalent of the BBC. In another example,
*  Avril Bloch has posted a video of an utterly destroyed village, completely apocalyptic footage,
*  showing the total ruin of clearly civilian infrastructure at the hands of the Israeli
*  military. He tweets alongside it, that's how my battalion left the village they fought in,
*  a regiment of real tigers, and then describes his battalion as honourable with the emojis of the
*  Israeli flag and a flexed bicep. We need to make sure we remember the names of all of these people,
*  these soldiers, so if they try to enter our countries, we can do everything we can to
*  prosecute them for war crimes. This individual clearly there confessing to war crimes.
*  I want to say one final thing here. The failure of the vast majority of Western journalists to
*  speak out about the biggest slaughter of journalists in history is disgusting. It makes me nauseous. I
*  have nothing but contempt for these people. My industry is a cesspit. Now you know perfectly
*  well, and you know what I'm talking about, many of these hacks think they're courageous. When they
*  turn out some bile about whichever voiceless vulnerable minority is flavour of the month to
*  get a kicking from mainstream media outlets, and then they get called out online and act as though
*  they're being persecuted and attacked. Well, listen, real courage has been shown by the
*  Palestinian journalists of Gaza, the lions of the world's press back, who have sought to show the
*  world the proof of some of the worst atrocities committed of our age, facilitated as they are by
*  our governments and who have been slaughtered, maimed, traumatised and as we see, relentlessly
*  menaced with death every waking second. Western media outlets have overwhelmingly shown
*  minimal solidarity. This is just one crime amongst so many. But let's be clear, there are some
*  journalists in the West and Israel who voluntarily made themselves complicit in a crime. There will
*  be a reckoning. Complicity in genocide and public incitement of genocide are crimes. They are
*  criminalised by the 1948 Genocide Convention, which nations like the US and Britain and Israel,
*  for that matter, have put on their statute books. And those specific journalists in Israel and
*  elsewhere should be pursued to the day they die by legal means to face legal accountability
*  for their role in the mass slaughter of the Palestinian people. The Palestinian journalists
*  of Gaza, meanwhile, must be protected, their courage rightly celebrated. We must do all we can
*  to demand our governments and our media outlets speak out and stop their Israeli ally from wiping
*  every last journalist out. Please like and subscribe, leave your thoughts and your comments.
