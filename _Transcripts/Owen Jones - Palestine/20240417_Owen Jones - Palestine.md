# New York Times EXPOSED Over Israel Bias After Memo Leak
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPbYtCepkEc)
*  Israel's genocidal war on Gaza has been facilitated every step of the way by the Western media,
*  with courageous exceptions.
*  Let's look at recent revelations about the New York Times, long treated as the preeminent
*  paper of record in the United States and accordingly is one of the most powerful media outlets
*  on the face of the earth.
*  Now these revelations appear in The Intercept, an absolutely crucial media organisation,
*  both during this catastrophe but also their incredible reporting on so many issues.
*  Now The Intercept reveals an internal memo which orders New York Times journalists covering
*  Israel's onslaught to restrict the use of the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing, to
*  avoid using the term the phrase occupied territory when describing Palestinian land.
*  The word Palestine is prohibited except in very rare cases, as is the use of the term
*  refugee camp to describe areas of Gaza historically settled by displaced Palestinians, as The
*  Intercept put it themselves, driven from other parts of Palestine in previous acts of ethnic
*  cleansing in 1967.
*  As The Intercept notes, these areas are recognised by the United Nations itself as refugee camps
*  and are home to hundreds of thousands of officially registered refugees.
*  The memo says words like slaughter, massacre and carnage often convey more emotion than
*  information.
*  It suggests that this applies to all sides, but that isn't so as The Intercept itself
*  says.
*  Despite the memo's framing as an effort to not employ incendiary language to describe
*  killing on all sides, as The Intercept puts it, in the Times reporting on the Gaza war
*  such language has been used repeatedly to describe attacks against Israelis by Palestinians
*  and almost never in the case of Israel's large scale killing of Palestinians.
*  Indeed, you have a situation don't you, where The New York Times reporting of 7th
*  October happened, the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel, in which such language was
*  allowed to be used, and was used when the victims were overwhelmingly Palestinians,
*  you then just changed the rules.
*  Now surely come on to studies of how the media has framed the onslaught against Gaza in ways
*  which benefit Israel, and are frankly just overtly racist, drawing partly on The Intercept's
*  own work.
*  In any case, the memo makes it clear that it is absolutely appropriate to use terrorism
*  and terrorists when describing 7th October because of the deliberate targeting of civilians
*  in killings and kidnapping, and that The New York Times shouldn't shy away from that
*  description of the events or attackers.
*  Fine but be consistent then, apply to Israel, apply to what Israel is doing.
*  Israel's leaders have repeatedly made it clear in their statements that they hold the
*  civilian population collectively guilty, and that they intend to make them pay as a people.
*  And then there's the so-called Daha doctrine used by the Israeli state, in which violence
*  is deliberately used against the civilian population in the belief it will make them
*  turn against Hamas or Hezbollah in southern Lebanon.
*  That is violence against civilians for a political end.
*  That's terrorism.
*  Then there's the deliberate and systematic targeting of civilian infrastructure, including
*  the near total destruction of Gaza's medical system.
*  As for hostages, well the Israeli state mass arresting and detaining Palestinians, often
*  without charge, including children, and save the children that have reported before 7th
*  October happening the physical and sexual abuse of kids, but as we know now, hideous
*  examples of mass torture, mistreatment of the most unspeakable kind being deployed against
*  these detainees, often their loved ones not told about their whereabouts.
*  Sounds a lot like hostages taking to me.
*  Now the word genocide is out, so is ethnic cleansing.
*  It being described as another historically charged term, which is unfortunate given 14
*  Israeli ministers earlier this year attended a conference dedicated to the removal of the
*  Palestinian population from Gaza, while a document leaked from the intelligence ministry back
*  in October in Israel offered up the removal of Gaza's population as the preferred option,
*  while Benjamin Netanyahu backed so-called voluntary migration back in December.
*  Yeah, voluntary migration.
*  So what you do there is you wipe out an entire territory, you subject it to starvation, and
*  you go, well, guess it's not somewhere that's livable anymore.
*  Do you want to leave?
*  Now as he just set notes, banning occupied territory or describing refugees as refugees
*  which is what they're doing, so you can't use occupied territory to describe occupied
*  Israel occupied territory or describe refugees as refugees.
*  That goes against what international law itself says.
*  Now according to Time staff as you spoke to The Intercept, while the memo is presented
*  as an outline for maintaining objective journalistic principles in reporting on Israel's onslaught,
*  some of its content show evidence of the New York Times' deference to Israeli narrative.
*  Now according to one newsroom source cited by The Intercept, anonymous for fear of reprisal,
*  I think it's the kind of thing that looks professional, logical if you have no knowledge
*  of the historical context of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, but if you do know, it will be clear
*  how apologetic it is to Israel.
*  I mean, this is so pernicious.
*  I mean, it tries to exploit people's naivety, doesn't it?
*  That's what they're saying.
*  Now Spokesperson for the New York Times claims this is about ensuring accuracy, consistency
*  and nuance, that language choices are sensitive, current and clear to audiences.
*  Well, we can call bull on that, can't we?
*  I mean, let's just talk about some more.
*  There's been an internal battle between journalists there, reported by The Intercept,
*  over coverage of Israel's onslaught.
*  That's erupted in Slack and WhatsApp and led to a clampdown by management.
*  Examples include Israel's attack on Al-Shifa hospital, which was Gaza's largest hospital
*  until Israel destroyed it, the Palestinian civilian death toll figures, allegations of
*  genocidal conduct by Israel and President Joe Biden repeatedly pushing unverified facts.
*  Sorry, they're not facts, that's the point.
*  Repeatedly pushing unverified claims from the Israeli government as facts,
*  which then turn out to be false.
*  Now let's just put this in the general context of what should be regarded as the greatest
*  media scandal of our time.
*  Let's just consider some of the ways that the Western media hasn't strewed its coverage
*  favors Israel as it wages this genocidal campaign against the Palestinian people.
*  Media coverage has overwhelmingly, with very few exceptions, failed to frame the coverage
*  of Israel's onslaught around the very public statements of intent by Israeli leaders and
*  officials who made their intentions clear over and over and over and over and over again
*  in the most clear, most vulgar ways imaginable.
*  Like the defence minister, Yoav Galan, declaring on two separate occasions from the start
*  that he'd released all restrictions and all the restraints on Israeli soldiers,
*  as well as ordering the total siege of all the essentials of life,
*  like food, medicine, you name it, on the grounds that Israel's fighting human animals.
*  There are countless statements by Israeli leaders and officials making it clear
*  they hold the entire civilian population collectively responsible.
*  President Isaac Herzog was another one, that they were going to starve them,
*  as well as block all the essentials of life, and that they were going to wipe Gaza off
*  the face of the earth.
*  They wanted to drive whoever survived out of Gaza.
*  There's several pages in South Africa's case against Israel, alleging genocide at
*  the International Court of Justice, of these, including these quotes, which I'm afraid
*  to say are out of date because many more need to be added since.
*  Those statements proved the most reliable and accurate guide for what Israel was going to do.
*  Which they did, to the letter.
*  And yet, even now, the Western media fails to frame its coverage accordingly.
*  That should have been the entire basis.
*  I mean, imagine a hostile state, its rulers, its officials and leaders, use the same rhetoric.
*  Do you think that would just be something which would occasionally appear maybe
*  somewhere down an opinion column as a throwaway?
*  Or do you think it would actually frame the entire understanding of how
*  what they then did was framed?
*  Let's be clear.
*  What this means is the Western media is lying through their teeth.
*  Lying by omission is still lying.
*  And lying by omission is not actually doing justice to what they've done.
*  They have systematically and willfully misinformed the public about Israel's onslaught
*  against Gaza by not making it clear this is what they said they wanted to do.
*  This was their intent, which they've now done.
*  But they've done it again.
*  Rather than suddenly go, oh, gone a bit far, haven't they?
*  What are they like?
*  Anyway, here's some more weapons.
*  Now, the Western media has repeatedly peddled false Israeli claims, including
*  of atrocities which did not happen on the 7th of October.
*  Which is not to say that there weren't terrible atrocities which were committed on the 7th of
*  October, which I've said over and over and over and over again despite, obviously,
*  the most deceitful critics on earth claiming otherwise.
*  But the point is, those atrocities that didn't happen were used to justify
*  terrible acts of barbarism against the people of Gaza.
*  Now, in terms of those atrocities committed on the 7th of October by Hamas and other armed groups,
*  bafflingly, in the Amstrad, the false claims, like bedding babies, for example,
*  got far more coverage.
*  Partly because the terrible atrocities that did happen, and no one should be in a doubt
*  they did happen, were more comparable to what the Israeli state did on a much
*  greater scale to the people of Gaza.
*  And therefore, they erode the moral superiority that Israel's authorities were attempting to claim.
*  The basis of what they were doing there is to go, yes, fine, we're going to kill a lot more people,
*  but the way they kill people is actually a lot worse than the way we kill people.
*  That was the entire basis for all of that, such as, for example, beheading multiple babies.
*  Because there's nothing more obscene you can probably think of than someone beheading a baby.
*  That's the point.
*  And then every time people started saying, well, look, this is terrible, what's happened to Gaza?
*  How could this happen?
*  They go, well, they beheaded babies.
*  That's what happened.
*  That was the basis for it.
*  Rather than actually one baby being killed on the 7th of October, one baby, too many, incidentally,
*  who was shot through a door of a safe room.
*  Many babies have been killed by indiscriminate bullet firing, let alone bombs being dropped in
*  their homes by the Israeli state.
*  14,000 plus kids have been killed, a large number of them babies.
*  But that was the whole point, wasn't it?
*  That was the whole point.
*  I know the New York Times had to backtrack about one particularly graphic example
*  in which they originally claimed two young women had been raped and murdered,
*  which it published.
*  It turned out to be entirely false.
*  And do you know what happened in that situation?
*  They published an article making it clear that actually wasn't true.
*  It was very, it was just provably false.
*  Because an anonymous military paramedic had given a very detailed story,
*  which was so graphic and detailed, there was no way on earth it could have been based on
*  some mistaken impression.
*  But do you know who offered up that military paramedic to multiple news organisations
*  to offer that story?
*  Former government spokesperson, Elon Levy.
*  Now, Western media outlets have ignored multiple examples of actual Israeli atrocities and
*  allowed the Israeli state to get away with them by repeatedly platforming the Israeli
*  state's dishonesty, deflection, muddying of the waters, propaganda in the most vulgar way possible.
*  As things stand, there's a horrendous failure to clearly establish that the Israeli state
*  is very obviously intentionally manufacturing famine in Gaza.
*  And in terms of their record and just lying through their teeth, there's so many obvious
*  examples of how they've lied and lied and lied and lied.
*  If you take famine and mention that Elon Levy there, he essentially lost his job because
*  David Cameron, the foreign secretary, conservative foreign secretary of the United Kingdom,
*  made it clear that Elon Levy's claims of aid getting into Gaza were false.
*  Just went through how Israel was blocking them from getting into Gaza.
*  But then there's multiple atrocities where Israel claims one thing and then later on,
*  should have been known at the time, but then it's very clear that Israel was responsible.
*  If Russia was doing that and Russia does lie, its leaders, that is then factored into the coverage,
*  isn't it? If a state lies so wantonly as the Israeli state does about the crimes it commits,
*  that should be embedded in your journalistic understanding of their actions.
*  But it isn't. And that is grotesque journalistic malpractice of a sort, which is about life and
*  death on a grand scale. Media coverage has dehumanized Palestinians, showing nothing
*  but contempt for the value of Palestinian life. Indeed, the Intercept's previous analysis of the
*  first few weeks of coverage by the US media outlets like the New York Times found that for
*  every two Palestinian deaths, Palestinians were mentioned once, while for every Israeli death,
*  Israelis were mentioned eight times, a rate 16 times more per death than Palestinians.
*  The analysis found highly emotive terms for killing civilians, like slaughter, massacre,
*  and horrific, were almost exclusively used for Israelis killed by Palestinians rather than the
*  other way round. Another crucial piece of research by The Column found it was even worse on US cable
*  news, looking again at the first period of the onslaught. The research found that an IDF
*  spokesperson, Peter Lerner, was interviewed 44 times on CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News in the course
*  of 30 days, and given free rein to mislead and distort with little to no pushback, that Israelis
*  were mentioned more than Palestinians every day on those channels, even when Palestinian deaths
*  began to far, far outpace Israeli deaths, that emotive language like massacre was similarly far,
*  far, far, far more likely to be used when Israeli victims were being discussed rather than Palestinian
*  victims, that Israeli hostages got far more coverage than many thousands of Palestinians actually
*  killed by the Israeli state. There isn't even the pretense here that Palestinian life has any kind of
*  worth. The research on the BBC's coverage also showed, again, far more coverage for Israelis killed
*  than Palestinians killed, as well as emotive language reserved for Israelis rather than
*  Palestinians. Now, what we're discussing here is racism. It's not subtle racism, by the way.
*  It's not the kind of way we're talking about racism where they push backing over. That's a
*  misapplication. You can't just throw racism around willy-nilly. You're diluting its meaning. That's
*  dangerous in itself. How could you have a more striking example of racism than this?
*  There's no subtlety here about the lives of some and their deaths being treated as having far less
*  significance than those of another group based on their ethnicity. That's just the most raging
*  form of racism imaginable, isn't it? You're literally saying, we care infinitely more about
*  the deaths and the lives of one group rather than another, which is just unapologetic,
*  shameless racism. People don't like being called racist, do they? Of course they don't. Well,
*  don't be a racist then. Don't have literally, rampantly unapologetic racist coverage about a
*  genocidal onslaught against a civilian population. How would these people be able to defend themselves?
*  If that went through court, for example, if they said, no, well, actually, how dare you? How dare you?
*  You go, what do you think an Israeli civilian life and a Palestinian civilian life, do you think
*  they have equal worth? How would they be able to justify that claim? If they said yes, they go,
*  yes, of course I do. How would they be able to justify it though? What evidence would they be
*  able to provide if you just go through their coverage based on the statistics? They wouldn't
*  be able to justify it. What would they be able to say in those circumstances? What would their
*  defense be? I can't come up with a defense for them. I like inventing defenses for people,
*  I oppose. I can't think of one. If you go through your own coverage in a media organization and you
*  find that there was far, far, far, far, far less interest and emphasis on the killing of one group
*  of people than another based on the ethnic group, then what? You don't have a leg to stand on.
*  This is racism. It's rampant racism in the service of a genocidal campaign. It doesn't get worse than
*  that guys. It doesn't get worse, does it? There's no pretence about impartiality. It's wanting
*  unapologetic bias, dripping with racism, which has helped blind people about Israel's actual
*  intentions with terrible murderous consequences because that means less pressure put on the
*  Western governments arming and supporting Israel to actually do something. This media coverage,
*  I'm going to say it's killed people. This coverage has helped kill a lot of people and it's going to
*  keep killing a lot of people too. If the Western media had done its actual job in terms of what
*  the media should do in these circumstances, this would all be over by now. They wouldn't have got
*  away with it. You just imagine, we know from previous examples of when Western governments
*  suddenly decide they want to go to war against someone, then the Western media just marches into
*  line and just goes, we have to act immediately. That's what they did in Iraq. An urgency,
*  emergency, emergency. All these crimes commit by Saddam Hussein. Anyone who opposes this action is
*  an absolute moral disgrace given the crimes he's committed, including for example, gassing the goods
*  in the 1980s when the West was actually backing him at the time. But that's what they do. They
*  whip up suddenly a sense of emergency and it's wall to wall coverage about the terrible atrocities
*  framed on the basis that this is a terrible grotesque crime that must be stopped immediately.
*  That's what they did over Kosovo. They did that in the late 90s in Kosovo.
*  Terrible crimes were committed in Kosovo, not even in the same league as what Israel's done to Gaza.
*  What the Western media has done is covered up the atrocities committed by Israel,
*  underplayed the sheer scale of horror we could go on. And when the true history of how Israel
*  was allowed to commit, one of the gravest crimes of our time is written, the role of the Western
*  media will be at its heart. You cannot understand the horror of the current crime without understanding
*  the role of the Western media. What the Intercept have done here as ever is brilliant work. It's
*  holding the media to account. They don't like that often, having worked in the media industry
*  for a very long time now. People in the media at the top think they can stand up to whoever they
*  want, even if it's migrants, refugees, Muslims, trans people, that kind of thing. But perish the
*  thought you stand up to the power of the media, even though they're one of the most influential
*  actors in any democracy, as much as we have democracy. It's a democracy with caveats, isn't it?
*  But we need to hold them to account because they facilitated this and they've warped
*  people's understanding of what's actually happening. So let's make sure we support the Intercept and their work
*  as best we can. But also let's keep telling the truth. Let's keep saying what Israel, the state's
*  actually doing. Let's make clear that we're holding everyone to account for their role in it, our
*  governments and our media. They can't get away with this. I don't just mean the Israeli state,
*  I mean everyone who facilitated them. We're not going to let them get away with this time.
