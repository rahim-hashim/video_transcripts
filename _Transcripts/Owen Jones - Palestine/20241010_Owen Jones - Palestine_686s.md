# Netanyahu Threatens Lebanon With Genocidal Mayhem
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C49EiMuhq04)
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of Israel and one of the most murderous war criminals
*  of our age, has threatened, bluntly speaking, to wipe Lebanon from the face of the earth
*  and face a genocidal war being prosecuted against it by the State of Israel. Let's
*  hear from an address made by Netanyahu purportedly to the people of Lebanon this week.
*  Israel has a right to defend itself. Israel also has a right to win. And Israel will win.
*  We have degraded Hezbollah's capabilities. We took out thousands of terrorists, including
*  Nasrallah himself, and Nasrallah's replacement, and the replacement of his replacement. Today,
*  Hezbollah is weaker than it has been for many, many years. Now you, the Lebanese people,
*  you stand at a significant crossroads. It is your choice. You can now take back your
*  country. You can return it to a path of peace and prosperity. If you don't, Hezbollah will
*  continue to try to fight Israel from densely populated areas at your expense. It doesn't
*  care if Lebanon is dragged into a wider war. Christian, Druze, Muslim, Sunni and Shiites,
*  all of you are suffering because of Hezbollah's futile war against Israel. Today I ask every
*  mother and every father in Lebanon a simple question. Is it worth it? Because it doesn't
*  have to be that way. I know you want a better future for your children. So I am speaking
*  to all of you today. There is a better way. A better way for your children, for your cities,
*  for your villages, for your country. You deserve to restore Lebanon to its days of tranquility.
*  You deserve a Lebanon that is different. One country, one flag, one people. Don't let
*  these terrorists destroy your future any more than they've already done. Stand up and take
*  your country back. You have an opportunity that hasn't existed in decades. An opportunity
*  to take care of the future of your children and grandchildren. You have an opportunity
*  to save Lebanon before it falls into the abyss of a long war that will lead to destruction
*  and suffering like we see in Gaza.
*  Okay, a few things. Netanyahu, of course, erases the decades of atrocities committed
*  by the Israeli state in Lebanon, like the 1982 invasion in which Israel committed so
*  many atrocities that the US right-wing Republican President Ronald Reagan rang the then Israeli
*  Prime Minister Menachem Begum to protest against what Reagan called a Holocaust. You
*  then had the massacre of Saba and Shatir in which up to three and a half thousand civilians,
*  largely Palestinian and Lebanese Shia, were massacred by Israel's allies, the Falangis,
*  which was coordinating with Israeli defence forces. The atrocities committed were beyond
*  hellish and the then defence minister of Israel, Ariel Sharon, was forced to resign in disgrace.
*  He was found responsible for that massacre by an Israeli commission, but later became
*  prime minister. Now, in the last year, who has been responsible for the vast majority
*  of cross-border attacks? Israel or Hezbollah? Well, let's just listen to the BBC in late
*  July.
*  There's been over 7,000 such attacks between October and early July. That's according
*  to data gathered by the conflict monitoring group, Eklid, and analysed by the BBC. The
*  vast majority of these cross-border attacks were carried out by the Israeli military with
*  a ratio of about five to one.
*  Even the BBC. But the key sentence in Netanyahu's address, which was specifically highlighted
*  by his official Twitter account, was as follows. You have an opportunity to save Lebanon before
*  it falls into the abyss of a long war that will lead to destruction and suffering like
*  we see in Gaza. That's a very clear and straightforward threat. What he's saying in this address
*  is we will destroy you unless you have a civil war. You either yourselves go to war with
*  93% of Lebanon's Shia population have a positive view of Hezbollah. That's not to express
*  any of my own sympathies of any sort for Hezbollah. It's to point out they have mass support
*  amongst the Shia population and indeed are part of the ruling coalition government in
*  Lebanon. So this would be not just a civil war, but a vicious sectarian civil war. He's
*  saying unless you do this, Israel will unleash the genocidal fury it has already unleashed
*  against Gaza, against Lebanon, with credible estimates, for example, put forward by public
*  health experts in the Lancet suggesting that one in every 13 Palestinians in Gaza could
*  already have been killed by Israel's year long genocidal onslaught. Most civilian infrastructure
*  has been destroyed or damaged. So Gaza is a different colour and texture when looked
*  at from space from the mass violent repeated displacements of almost the entire population
*  to a deliberate siege of the essentials of life, which has caused famine from mass brutal
*  incarceration to torture and rape from the injuring and maiming of 100,000 Palestinians,
*  the destruction of Gaza's healthcare system. We could go on one of the most abominable
*  crimes of our age. And that's what Israel explicitly says it wishes to replicate in
*  Lebanon. Now let's talk about what's already happened to Lebanon. But first I'm going
*  I'm afraid to Matthew Miller, the US State Department spokesperson.
*  So you said earlier that Israel has a right to attack Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation.
*  I wanted to ask if you had seen the Israeli prime minister's video that he put out in
*  English to the people of Lebanon last night. He had a couple of lines in there. He said,
*  you have an opportunity to save Lebanon before it falls into the abyss of a long war that
*  will lead to destruction and suffering like we see in Gaza. I say to you, the people of
*  Lebanon, free your country from Hezbollah so that this war can end. That seems like
*  a blanket threat against the civilian population. Is that terrorism?
*  So first of all, let me say we cannot and must not see the situation in Lebanon turn
*  into anything like the situation in Gaza. That would of course not be acceptable. And
*  ultimately, it is the, as I said in response to an earlier question, it is up to the Lebanese
*  people, not anybody else, to decide on who their government is. I said in response to
*  another question, no country in the region should dictate to the Lebanese people who
*  their leaders are. Not Israel, not the United States, not any of the other countries in
*  the region. And that should continue to.
*  But Israel is dictating that.
*  To be the case. No, they're conducting operations going after a terrorist organization. That's
*  a different thing than dictating what the civilian government should be. That's a question
*  for the Lebanese people to decide.
*  But if they decide against Israel's wishes, Israel is threatening Gaza-like annihilation
*  of the people of Lebanon.
*  And I'm making very clear that there should be no kind of military action in Lebanon that
*  looks anything like Gaza and leaves a result anything like Gaza.
*  OK, first thing here. He says we can't and mustn't see the situation in Lebanon turn
*  into anything like the situation in Gaza. That would of course not be acceptable. Excuse
*  me. What does he mean there? Why of course would it not be acceptable if Israel did that
*  in Lebanon, Matthew? Are you saying that because what Israel has done in Gaza, armed and facilitated
*  every step of the way by your administration, that that's been unacceptable? And if so,
*  in what way? Are you saying that it was acceptable to do that in Gaza, but not Lebanon? And why
*  are they different? Help me out here, Matthew, please. You're always so eloquent in your
*  answers.
*  Let's listen to Nadia Bilbasi charters, Washington bureau chief, Al-Arabiya, as the following
*  to the White House spokesperson, Karine Jean-Pierre.
*  One last question. In two weeks, there is already eight hospitals in Lebanon are out
*  of service. There is thousands of people being killed. There is one million forced to flee
*  their homes. And the Israelis has calling for more troops. So how can this not be a
*  scenario in Gaza that we have seen it unfolding? And second is, isn't that a mission creep?
*  How do you agree with the Israelis on the outcome of the war? If Netanyahu said we're
*  going to continue regardless of what the White House more or less is saying, as long as we
*  are not achieving our aims in Lebanon?
*  I'll say what I said moments ago. We do not want to see Gaza, what happened in Gaza happen
*  in Lebanon. That's what I said. And that is something that we do not want to see. And
*  as we've said, Israel does have the right to defend itself and to go after their security
*  threats that they see.
*  But one civilian casualty is too many. And we've been very clear about that. They must
*  take, Israel must take, every feasible precaution to prevent civilian harm.
*  Spot on question, diabolical answer. Thousands have indeed already been killed by the Israeli
*  state in Lebanon. In Lebanon, the Israeli state are bombing rescue workers. Listen to
*  Alex Crawford, Sky News, one of the best broadcast journalists incidentally on this, in Lebanon.
*  Emergency workers, civil defence workers, Red Cross workers, all telling us that they
*  feel they are now the targets of Israeli strikes. One of this emergency crew, civil defence
*  team said one team went to rescue some people who had been hurt in a bomb strike. They then
*  got hit. A second civil defence team went to help them. They got hit. The Red Cross
*  went to help that second team which got hit. And they also got hit. A lot of stories about
*  how the emergency workers themselves now feel under target.
*  Early this week, Lebanese authorities reported Israel had killed 50 health workers in three
*  days. The mass slaughter of medical staff should be seen as utterly shocking, indicative
*  of a truly monstrous attacker. But Israel normalised it in Gaza and now it has no cut
*  through at all. This is an example and I will keep returning to this theme, partly
*  because I'm writing a book on it, but I'm writing a book on it because it's what I
*  think, in the fall of the West. Just an example of moral collapse. The world can see all this.
*  It can see who's facilitating it. Israel is essentially a Western state. The consequences
*  will be felt for generations, I can assure you of that. Here's a village of Yeroon
*  in Lebanon comparing what it looks like now after the Israeli onslaught and what it looked
*  like before.
*  Well yeah, that does indeed look like Gaza now, doesn't it? The same genocidal destruction.
*  The US facilitated the genocide onslaught in Gaza with pathetic occasional hand-wringing
*  and now is set to do exactly the same in Lebanon. And it is up to us to make sure they don't
*  get away with that. Please like and subscribe, leave your thoughts or comments, help us take
