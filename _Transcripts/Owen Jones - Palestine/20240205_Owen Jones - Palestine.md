# CNN's Pro-Israel Bias Exposed In Devastating Report
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [February 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZorUSMn_9g)
*  Shocking, or it should be shocking, but maybe not surprising.
*  A new report in the Guardian US, written by, amongst other things,
*  the former Jerusalem correspondent, Chris McGreal,
*  has exposed how CNN spreads propaganda on behalf of the Israeli state.
*  That's my conclusion, having read this report in detail.
*  It's a damning report.
*  It shows, in my view, that CNN isn't offering journalism.
*  It's voluntarily offering its services to the Israeli state.
*  Now, this matters. It matters a lot.
*  It's about media outlets which claim to be a partial objective,
*  failing in the basic function of educating and informing citizens,
*  in this case, on a matter of life and death,
*  and instead how they act like politically driven machines,
*  with a track record of justifying foreign crimes,
*  and indeed how media outlets make themselves complicit in acts of mass murder,
*  as well as grievous attacks on the most fundamental human rights.
*  And it raises profound questions, I have to say,
*  about what we call Western democracy.
*  Now, this report is based on accounts from six staffers
*  across several newsrooms, as well as internal memos and emails.
*  So it talks to many of these staffers, one of them, for example,
*  is quoted as saying,
*  That's quite a damning thing, isn't it, to say about your own media organisation?
*  They explain why. They say,
*  Now, it's clear who is chiefly held responsible at the top for this raging bias.
*  It's the new editor-in-chief and CEO, Mark Thompson.
*  That matters, actually, because this guy used to be director-general of the BBC.
*  And he was, as the article actually notes,
*  accused repeatedly of bowing to Israeli government pressure
*  when he headed that corporation.
*  What are the consequences, then?
*  Let's just see what this report suggests.
*  As well as framing the coverage on Israel's own terms,
*  that is, portraying it as
*  Now, just in terms of how low our expectations are, or mine are, by the way,
*  you know, if we actually have news organisations like CNN
*  properly committed to rigorous journalism,
*  they would never dream of seeking to start the clock on 7 October.
*  They would obviously have to talk about the mass ethnic cleansing suffered
*  for generations by Palestinians.
*  Indeed, the vast majority of Gaza's own population
*  are the families of those driven from their homes back in 1948.
*  And subsequently, as well as the occupation, the siege,
*  what is defined by multiple human rights organisations,
*  including in Israel, as apartheid, illegal colonisation,
*  mass incarceration, mass human rights abuses,
*  mass killing of Palestinians before 7 October.
*  We could go on.
*  But, I mean, what I'm saying there is just like in another universe
*  from what CNN offers.
*  And unsurprisingly, this report quotes a staffer saying
*  there's a lot of internal strife and dissent, and some are looking to get out.
*  It's good to see the more principled journalists with integrity there.
*  Now, some journalists with experience in the region
*  avoid, apparently, assignments in Israel
*  because they don't believe they'll be free to tell the whole story
*  or they believe that editors are actually keeping them away.
*  Now, from the start, the CEO, Mark Thompson,
*  is described as setting expectations for coverage,
*  which included that while there would be coverage of human consequences
*  in historical context, saying,
*  we must continue always to remind our audiences
*  of the immediate cause of this current conflict, which they italicised,
*  namely the Hamas attack and mass murder and kidnap of civilians.
*  Now, according to staff members, that meant a framework
*  in which atrocities on the 7th of October
*  were used to implicitly justify Israeli actions.
*  And that, in practice, then other contexts, history was kept out.
*  So one staff member eloquently put it like this.
*  How else are editors going to read that other than as instruction,
*  that no matter what the Israelis do, Hamas is ultimately to blame?
*  Every action by Israel dropping massive bombs
*  that wipe out entire streets is obliteration of whole families.
*  The coverage ends up massaged to create a they had it coming narrative.
*  I think that's really crucial point because, you know,
*  what many media organisations have done is give Israel a blank check
*  to behave as it wishes, because they basically have a narrative of,
*  well, Hamas did this, they caused all this,
*  and therefore everything Israel does is on them.
*  So Israel can do anything it wants, it can commit any war crimes.
*  And then the narrative is, well, because I Hamas, isn't it?
*  It's not a defence, is it, in a trial?
*  You can't go, well, they made me do it.
*  That's not how the law works.
*  Not least governing warfare.
*  Now, the official death of death
*  was apparently invariably portrayed as unreliable by the network,
*  despite all the evidence to the contrary, precedent, aid organisations,
*  the US's own private estimates and Israel's own private estimates,
*  which they now believe as the Israeli magazine Plus 972 has discovered,
*  they are now using it privately, the official Gaza death toll as their own.
*  Hamas statements are banned from being reported on the grounds
*  they're inflammatory rhetoric and propaganda,
*  but inflammatory rhetoric and propaganda from Israeli officials
*  and their US cheerleaders is not.
*  And indeed, apparently, according to all this,
*  I don't watch CNN, generally speaking, I have to say,
*  but apparently not challenged at all.
*  Israeli official statements are often quickly cleared
*  on the basis they can be trusted at face value,
*  unlike statements from Palestinians, not just Hamas,
*  which apparently are delayed or never reported.
*  Edits of pieces of journalism are believed to be done
*  to ensure that there isn't criticism by pro-Israeli groups,
*  as if they'd ever live in fear of criticism from pro-Palestinian groups.
*  It gets worse.
*  One staffer's quoting is saying,
*  Some CNN staff fear that the result is a network
*  acting as a surrogate censor on behalf of the Israeli government.
*  The system results in chosen individuals
*  editing any and all reporting with an institutionalised pro-Israel bias,
*  often using passive language to absolve the Israel defence forces of responsibility
*  and playing down Palestinian deaths and Israeli attacks.
*  That's one of the network's own journalists saying that.
*  Now, they say actual hard hitting report on the ground
*  is much less visible in the US version of CNN.
*  You might get an international version, but not for US domestic audiences.
*  Often you have hours and hours of interviews with Israeli officials
*  and supporters of the war in Gaza, not being challenged
*  and sometimes just being backed up by presenters.
*  With Palestinian voices and views much less frequently heard,
*  but more aggressively put on the spot and challenged.
*  So one example given is of Rami Igram,
*  a former Israeli intelligence senior officer who appeared on Anderson Cooper's show
*  and claimed the entire Palestinian population of Gaza could be regarded as competent.
*  Just to be clear, we actually said the non-combatant population
*  of the Gaza Strip is really a non-existent term because all of the Gazans voted for the Hamas.
*  And as we've seen on the 7th of October, most of the population in the Gaza Strip are Hamas, he said.
*  Nonetheless, we are treating them as non-combatants.
*  We are treating them as regular civilians and they are spared from the fighting.
*  Well, just quickly, a few things.
*  I mean, it's not true.
*  Firstly, even when the elections happened, which was back in 2006,
*  it's not true that even Hamas won a majority.
*  They got the biggest share.
*  But also, most, nearly half of Gaza's population of children.
*  I mean, the vast majority of people weren't eligible to vote in that election.
*  I mean, it's just factually wrong.
*  And it wasn't challenged.
*  I mean, it's also, you can see what he's doing, slippery, isn't it?
*  Trying to plant into the audience's head that the people of Gaza suffer
*  from collective guilt and therefore suggesting that actually, rather than making you think,
*  well, actually, Israel, the Israeli army has gone too far.
*  The artists go, oh, they've been kind to them because even though actually,
*  are they really civilians, but they're not, they're being treated as civilians.
*  Despite all the mass death and devastation Israel's caused.
*  Now, as I say, not challenged by Anderson Cooper.
*  That is outrageous, by the way.
*  There's been critical and excitable promoting of Israeli claims,
*  which have turned out to be true, like that hideous story of Israeli babies being beheaded.
*  One baby was killed on 7th of October.
*  That's hideous enough, by the way.
*  I mean, any baby being killed is hideous.
*  That baby was shot dead through the door of a safe room.
*  The family was in the safe room and militants fired bullets through the door and killed the baby.
*  Hideous. You did not have the headings of babies on the 7th of October.
*  It never happened.
*  Now, the purpose of this claim was underlined by the presenter putting the claims
*  of the beheadings of babies to a reporter on the grounds that Israel would never be able to make peace
*  with Hamas because of the beheadings of babies, which, as I keep saying, didn't happen.
*  So you can see what the basis of that claim was.
*  People were a bit like, oh, why would you even need to question these things as if, like, you know,
*  if Israel was accused of atrocities in Gaza and then, you know, if they,
*  specific examples turn out not to be true, of course, cheerleaders of Israel would say so.
*  In this particular case, you can see what's happening.
*  It's being used to justify a military onslaught, which has, I would note, killed
*  over 13,000 children, many of them babies.
*  Now, they even, CNN apparently claimed to have a video of such atrocities.
*  They didn't have such a video because those atrocities didn't happen.
*  Other atrocities happened. I've seen them.
*  There were atrocities committed against Israeli civilians, which I saw.
*  Not these claims. Now, CNN have come back and said these claims in this article are untrue,
*  unfair. They're not biased.
*  Now, I think I'll probably let you all think through whether you believe them or not.
*  But there's an interesting point made in this piece in that a precedent was set by Russia's invasion
*  of Ukraine, where reporters and the channel were just clear about being open and supporting Ukraine.
*  It just seemed like, you know, in their heads, this is such a clear cut case.
*  So they ended up cheerleading.
*  Now, look, I oppose Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine.
*  I've made that clear over and over again.
*  But I'm an opinion writer.
*  I'm not actually there to report from the war itself.
*  And I would say there's a problem there because we've been deprived of an accurate understanding of
*  what's happening in that war as a consequence.
*  And I think it came as a surprise to many people in the West when they found out that it wasn't going
*  well for Ukraine. And that's because if you get cheerleading instead of reporting, people don't understand
*  what's actually happening.
*  The point here is it set a precedent and then journalists went on to apply the same partisan approach to Israel.
*  Now, there's also the point about CNN reports being embedded in the IDF, producing reports censored by the army.
*  That's not journalism.
*  And as for not interviewing Hamas, it's been pointed out that CNN has interviewed all sorts of unpleasant
*  people over the years, including Osama bin Laden.
*  So why not now?
*  It's just journalism.
*  You do have to speak to people who are unpleasant, including the Israeli state.
*  Now, there's a wider context here, isn't there?
*  And, you know, foreign reporters banned from Gaza unless they're embedded with the IDF, of course, and
*  producing censored material.
*  Palestinian journalists in Gaza have been butchered, the biggest mass killing of journalists in the
*  history of modern conflict.
*  Across the West, major media outlets have done various things, avert cheerleading for the Israeli massacre.
*  We're often at best framing this as a counter-terror operation by Israel, Israel defending itself with a
*  side debate about whether it's proportionate or not.
*  There's been a huge focus on the suffering of Israelis.
*  Of course, you have to talk about the suffering of Israelis, but much, much, much less proportionally given
*  to the suffering of Palestinians, even though far, far more Palestinians have been killed, maimed, driven
*  from their homes, their homes often destroyed and the population reduced to apocalyptic conditions.
*  Palestinian life has been treated as virtually worthless by multiple media outlets and journalists.
*  And even when confronted with what?
*  Well, over 13,000 Palestinian kids being violently killed.
*  So many babies and toddlers among them.
*  Well, the extremism of Hamas is often marked upon by these media outlets, but the multiple genocidal and
*  murderous statements made by Israeli government ministers, politicians, army figures, soldiers, media
*  outlets, journalists, some of those, of course, cited by South Africa, in its case, in the
*  International Court of Justice and indeed cited by the president of the court in the damning ruling.
*  Now, they've not only not framed the coverage, they've often just not been reported on at all.
*  As if we can't understand the intent of a military onslaught based on what those driving actually say,
*  as if that same standard would be applied to other states.
*  Now, Israeli spokespeople and pro-Israeli guests are often treated with deference, while Palestinian
*  voices and their allies are platformed much less and often interrogated as though they're criminals in the
*  dock, including Palestinians who've got nothing to do with Hamas and indeed including Palestinians who've had
*  loved ones killed by the Israeli state.
*  All of this protects Israel from scrutiny of the grave crimes it's committing, the direct support and
*  complicity, of course, of our governments.
*  That itself reduces public pressure on our governments to stop their own involvement in this great
*  crime. And without that involvement, it'd end.
*  The US, one phone call, gone, finished.
*  So what CNN is doing here is not properly informing citizens of what's been done in their name, which
*  should be a crucial role of the media in any healthy, functioning democracy.
*  It has helped to facilitate media coverage across the West and alleged genocide.
*  That's a moral disgrace and it underlines what we deserve so much better than the media ecosystem that
*  we are currently given.
