# 'We Won't Vote For Genocide' - Owen Jones in Dearborn, Michigan
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [November 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF0RXlHMrAk)
*  How are you feeling about the election? Are you fired up?
*  Uh, no, not honestly, no.
*  Because it's either going to be Trump or Kamala.
*  So for me, definitely Jill Stein.
*  Definitely not Harris.
*  I'm not going to vote for Trump.
*  But there's no way I'm going to vote for the Democrats after Palestine.
*  Yeah, I agree.
*  Probably going to vote for Harris.
*  What, I mean, a lot of people around here,
*  they're very angry about the role of the Democratic presidency in arming Israel.
*  Given what's happening, what would you say to that?
*  Um, no, it's definitely a valid concern.
*  And I think it's definitely, you know, the anger is definitely justified,
*  especially because, you know, we expect more out of the Democrats.
*  You know, they're supposed to have morality.
*  They're supposed to be against these kinds of pointless wars.
*  Hello from Michigan.
*  We are on the verge of the US presidential election
*  and this state will help determine who the hell wins.
*  Now, last time, Joe Biden only just scraped it.
*  About 150,000 votes.
*  Both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are throwing everything at Michigan,
*  given its 15 electoral college votes may prove pivotal.
*  But this is why this place is so interesting.
*  I'm in Dearborn.
*  Now, Dearborn, next to Detroit, has the highest concentration
*  of Muslim American voters in the United States.
*  And it's the first Arab majority city in the United States.
*  Now, of course, Israel's genocide in Palestine looms large
*  over this city in particular.
*  Now, obviously, lots of Americans are very angry about it,
*  but there's a particular resonance here.
*  How are they going to vote?
*  Given the democratic complicity facilitation of the genocide,
*  and on the other hand, they've got Donald Trump,
*  who is extreme on Israel and is the architect of the Muslim ban.
*  How are voters here falling?
*  What are they thinking?
*  What kind of agonizing are they going through?
*  What happens here may help determine the future of the United States
*  and how they end up voting.
*  So I'm going to go out.
*  We're going to talk to lots of very, very interesting people.
*  And we're going to find out what the hell's going on.
*  They are genocide defenders.
*  They are genocide defenders.
*  Democrats, don't you see?
*  You support a killing spree.
*  You support a killing spree.
*  You set Lebanon on fire.
*  You set Lebanon on fire.
*  So on the eve of the election, you're out protesting today,
*  and you've got a lot of skin in the game because you're Palestinian.
*  Absolutely.
*  Tell me a bit about it.
*  I was born in Bethlehem and came here when I was 25 years old.
*  So I was raised back home in Palestine,
*  and I've experienced the occupation firsthand, basically.
*  Our life there is definitely hard.
*  The other thing I just want to ask is,
*  do you think, looking now at the polling,
*  that do you get hope in terms of how this ends?
*  So I spoke to Gideon Levy, who's an Israeli journalist,
*  and he thinks that the way this ends
*  is public opinion shifts in the United States.
*  There's this assumption that you can work from within the system
*  to try to shift the votes and so forth.
*  And I contest that idea.
*  I say that the only way that you can actually impose difference
*  is working from the outside of the system.
*  And that's exactly why we are taking up the streets.
*  That's exactly why we continue to unrelentlessly speak
*  on behalf of the silenced Palestinian.
*  We reject this narrative of the lesser of two evils,
*  because as far as we're concerned, in this election,
*  both candidates are the epitome of evils.
*  It's very frustrating because it's my tax dollar
*  that's paying for those bombs that are dropping on kids
*  and babies and innocent people indiscriminately.
*  So it's very frustrating. I'm outraged.
*  Do you feel, I mean, in the US before the genocide began,
*  there were people, obviously Palestinian citizens
*  of the United States, but others who cared about the issue.
*  But do you think, you know,
*  it was a very small section of the population.
*  Yes.
*  How much has that changed?
*  How much do you think looking around people
*  who weren't necessarily that engaged with the occupation,
*  the part-time, how much do you think, you know,
*  I mean, this doesn't, it's well given what's actually happening,
*  but how much do you think that's changed?
*  It has changed dramatically because, you know,
*  luckily the young people are not counting on mainstream media
*  anymore to get their news source.
*  Now they're like going directly and getting the news from,
*  you know, journalists who are on the ground in Gaza.
*  So, like, the effect of CNN and Fox News
*  and all those local news is less now on people
*  because they can't control what they're going to see.
*  So now more people are knowing the truth
*  about what's going on in Palestine.
*  Once you know the truth, there's no going back.
*  This is it.
*  Whereabouts in Palestine did your family originally go?
*  My mother and father and of course their parents
*  are from the West Bank, they're from Ramallah.
*  They lived there most of their lives,
*  but my father came here in 1973
*  and my mother, she was born and raised in Canada,
*  but she bounced around between Miami, the West Bank,
*  and of course Canada,
*  but she's been here with my father since 1992.
*  They've been married for about 30-something years now.
*  Do you feel as a Palestinian American for a long time
*  you've felt maybe quite silenced
*  that being able to speak about your experience
*  as a Palestinian American is something
*  which is actually quite hard to do, don't you think?
*  Very much, you know, I think prior to October 7th
*  and even to a certain degree now,
*  there's this great amount of censorship,
*  dialogue as it pertains to Palestine.
*  For an example, when I was an undergraduate student,
*  anytime we discussed theories about international relations,
*  we discussed South African apartheid,
*  but once you drew that parallel
*  between Israel's machinations in the West Bank,
*  its occupation, its treatment of Palestine,
*  and how it's similar to South African apartheid,
*  all conversation would be shut down.
*  And I think you can see that
*  in the American political system now.
*  There is a general invisibility
*  towards Palestinian suffering and Palestinian life
*  and the struggle, even though it has widespread popularity
*  and support amongst ordinary Americans here,
*  amongst some folks on the progressive left,
*  and even in the general international community,
*  as it pertains to the halls of Congress,
*  the Palestinian cause just unfortunately
*  doesn't register with people.
*  And I think that's why you see this ability
*  to silence people, the censorship,
*  where speaking about Palestine
*  or speaking about Palestinians in human life
*  is like this nasty thing that cannot be discussed.
*  Is it almost, do you think, like, even just saying Palestinian
*  in the American context for a long time,
*  that registers as extremists outside the mainstream?
*  Very much so.
*  I think prior to October 7th,
*  a lot of people just viewed Palestine
*  as like a backdrop in the general Middle East.
*  Now, Palestine, the word Palestinian
*  is being used as a racial epitaph,
*  a kind of a way as a slur to describe people.
*  When people think of Palestine,
*  they unfortunately don't think of the suffering
*  the Palestinians have endured for over 75 years.
*  They don't think of the apartheid in the West Bank.
*  They don't think about the genocide in Gaza.
*  They simply see us all as combatants and as militants.
*  And I think that's very reflective, of course,
*  of how Israel's treating the Palestinians.
*  There is no innocence there.
*  Unfortunately, I think that's matriculated here in the US,
*  where you have a lot of mainstream politicians
*  that just simply don't see the humanity of Palestinians.
*  I'm interested because, you know,
*  the two parts of your identity, Palestinian and American,
*  and the US is, as always, for a fail in time,
*  certainly stood behind Israel,
*  armed Israel, and all the rest of it.
*  And in this genocide, he's arming Israel
*  as it slaughters the Palestinian people.
*  How do you feel, I mean, being a Palestinian American,
*  living in this, the global hegemon, I guess,
*  what's that like?
*  It's a very disgusting feeling,
*  disgusting in the sense that, you know,
*  I do live here in America.
*  I do have a good life.
*  And I am, to a great degree, thankful
*  for the life that America has given myself,
*  my brothers, my sisters, my mother, and my father.
*  But in that same respect, despite this,
*  America has done all it can to sidestep
*  and erase the Palestinian cause
*  and basically not treat us as people.
*  You feel a great degree of guilt knowing that you're here
*  and you're surviving and you're thriving.
*  Myself and other Arab Americans feel this way.
*  But yeah, as soon as we open up our phones
*  or we watch the news,
*  it's slaughtered Palestinian children, women, and men.
*  And you feel a great degree of shame.
*  And I think that it activates people to be more involved
*  and understand this dichotomy that the life we have here,
*  although great, at some point,
*  we have to stick up for ourselves and say something.
*  Because you can't be a democratic home, quote unquote,
*  but imperial abroad.
*  And unfortunately, the Palestinians have caught
*  the short end of the stick as it pertains to that dynamic.
*  Okay, it's the big election.
*  Yeah.
*  How are you feeling about it?
*  Are you gonna vote?
*  I'm not gonna vote, no.
*  I don't think anyone that's gonna be elected for president
*  is gonna support us in Palestine
*  and stop any of the genocide.
*  I think both parties are gonna financially support Israel
*  and the genocide, so I would not be voting this year.
*  And just finally on that,
*  do you think when the Democrats go,
*  well, look, it's very sad about all the killing.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, when you hear that, what do you think?
*  Of course, oh, when they say it?
*  Yeah.
*  I don't really believe them because, I mean,
*  words speak action.
*  You know, they've been handing money to them.
*  When Trump was in office, he wasn't helping us,
*  and neither Kamala, I doubt she's gonna help us at all either.
*  You were in, so you've been in Lebanon recently.
*  Yeah.
*  Tell me about it.
*  What were you doing in Lebanon?
*  Well, I came back a week ago because of the war
*  that's been going on between Israel and Lebanon.
*  And it was tough, you know, living it and being in it.
*  Where were you?
*  Were you in Beirut?
*  Well, at first I was in Beirut, then it got even worse,
*  so I had to go up to the mountains.
*  We're sitting there and we're stuck there,
*  but you still hear the bombs.
*  We were hearing bombs every day.
*  What did you feel when you heard that?
*  What were you thinking?
*  At first it was kind of scary,
*  but then after hearing it a lot, you kind of get used to it.
*  But the people that are in Beirut
*  and the cities that are being bombed,
*  we just hear it.
*  They've been impacted by it, like more than us.
*  Because you see a lot of kids being killed.
*  We see that a lot.
*  Some of my friends' houses have been bombed.
*  Wow.
*  When you heard that, when you heard about your friends' house,
*  what were you thinking?
*  I was like, I hope that...
*  I know nothing happened to them
*  because they weren't the ones that posted it,
*  but I was very concerned about them.
*  How did you feel as well?
*  You're an American citizen and you're in Lebanon,
*  and these are American bombs.
*  How did that feel?
*  All thinking about that.
*  I felt disappointed by the American government.
*  I felt...
*  There's a lot of feelings that go...
*  It's tough.
*  Yeah, it is tough, but you have to fight through it.
*  The Lebanese people are resilient people.
*  They're very strong.
*  Do you have any Lebanese heritage yourself?
*  Or was it just...
*  I'm Lebanese.
*  Yeah, Lebanese-American, yeah.
*  Yeah, so they are resilient.
*  They've been through a lot in their lives
*  since five years ago.
*  There's a lot of things that have been going on,
*  but this year has been the worst year for them
*  because of everything that's been going on.
*  You see kids are dying,
*  parents...
*  1.1 million people have been kicked out of their home,
*  are homeless on the streets.
*  We've seen it in Beirut when I walked through the streets.
*  So you see a lot of stuff that affects you mentally,
*  but we gotta stay strong.
*  We gotta fight.
*  The Lebanese people are resilient people.
*  They're strong.
*  We'll get through it,
*  and by God's will, we will come out victorious.
*  On the other side, or at least my viewpoint is,
*  they're the more likely to, I guess, move their opinion
*  with the Republicans, especially with Trump.
*  Once he's decided what he wants to do,
*  he's just gonna do that no matter what.
*  So I'm not happy to have to vote for Harris,
*  but I think she's the best chance for any sort of peace.
*  And just lastly, did you agonize?
*  Was it hard?
*  Is it emotionally quite difficult to come to that conclusion?
*  Harder than it's been in other elections?
*  Yeah, I mean, usually it's pretty easy
*  to vote for the Democrats.
*  I mean, it's not the easiest thing in the world,
*  but this time was a little bit harder,
*  but as much as it was a bit upsetting to see
*  that she didn't change her position,
*  I ended up coming to that conclusion.
*  Is that less or too equal, basically?
*  Yeah, basically.
*  So I'm gonna meet something of a political sensation,
*  Abdullah Hamoud, he's the mayor of Dearborn,
*  first Muslim mayor, first Arab-American mayor.
*  He's very significant right now.
*  A lot of people listen to him,
*  and I'm gonna talk to him about this community
*  and about what is a very historic election.
*  Dearborn, you're the mayor,
*  you're obviously very proud of this community.
*  Explain, describe it to someone
*  who doesn't know anything about you.
*  Greatest city in America, and I say this not as mayor,
*  but as somebody born and raised in this city.
*  This is a city where most migrant communities
*  first come get their start,
*  whether it was the Irish community, the Polish community,
*  Lebanese, Yemeni, you name it.
*  Most folks first come into the south end,
*  which is an entry portal for many immigrants,
*  and they find themselves really flourishing
*  in the city of Dearborn.
*  It's a place that's welcoming to all.
*  How many cities can you go to across America?
*  Which are home to the largest mosques in the country
*  on a historic road called Altar Road,
*  where you have a mosque neighboring three churches,
*  they share the same parking lot, they're the same sidewalks.
*  That's the city of Dearborn, that's what's so beautiful.
*  It's over a year now
*  that Israel's genocidal assault against Gaza,
*  and of course the expansion of murders,
*  like murders on the assault against Lebanon,
*  where your family came from.
*  What's been the impact in this community?
*  There's a blanket of grief
*  that's just covering this community.
*  We're at funerals and offering condolences
*  to families on a daily basis.
*  I attended a service, not for one or two,
*  but for 12 just a week ago,
*  where the mayor of a village in the south, Lebanon,
*  and his civilian employees who were setting up a bomb shelter
*  were actually decimated and targeted and assassinated.
*  And so we went to a service for 12.
*  The following day, that Sunday,
*  there was a service for over 20 innocent men, women,
*  and children who were slaughtered.
*  That is what's happening.
*  At this point, you can speak to anybody across the city,
*  and they know somebody who's been killed,
*  injured, or displaced by what's happening,
*  be it in Gaza, in Yemen, or in Lebanon.
*  And so, you know, the first Lebanese-American citizen
*  that was killed was a Dearborn resident.
*  And people feel dehumanized when the initial reaction
*  from the White House was to deny
*  that that person was a citizen.
*  And there's two things wrong with there.
*  One, no, it was in fact a citizen,
*  and they clarified via writing later.
*  But secondly, they wanted to create this hierarchy,
*  as if if you kill an innocent non-citizen,
*  it's somehow less important.
*  And that's what's also what's disturbing from that message.
*  But some would say, look,
*  you might not be happy with Kamala Harris and the Democrats,
*  but look at what's happening to Donald Trump,
*  Netanyahu clearly wants him to win.
*  The polling shows in Israel,
*  that's what most Israeli citizens want.
*  And, you know, he uses Palestinians as an insult.
*  She's the lesser evil, that's what people say.
*  Yeah, I think for 20 years, what this community has done
*  is set the issues of global and foreign policy as secondary.
*  Because I can't tell you that there's been a president
*  who's assumed the office who I've aligned with
*  on the issue of Gaza, Palestine, Iraq, you name it.
*  It wasn't Bush, it wasn't Obama, it wasn't Biden,
*  it wasn't Trump, and it won't be this next president.
*  But what you're hearing now from the residents is saying
*  is we can no longer make it secondary.
*  They all have to be, the values that we apply
*  have to be universally applied.
*  If we want to end mass shootings in America,
*  we also can't equip war criminals with 2,000 pound bombs
*  to decimate every university across Gaza.
*  If you want to expand access to university healthcare,
*  how do you then forgive a government
*  for decimating every medical facility
*  across Lebanon and Gaza using white phosphorus,
*  whatever it might be?
*  And so people are saying that that thought
*  that no longer applies to this current context.
*  Yes, I understand the threat that Trump is.
*  But I think the question you're asking
*  should be positioned back to Vice President Harris
*  or any candidate running for the White House.
*  Why is the alignment with Benjamin Netanyahu,
*  why is the alignment to this genocide far more important
*  than the potential unraveling of American democracy?
*  Now look, it is so important to emphasize,
*  it is far from just Muslim Americans and Arab Americans
*  who are angry, furious about the US role
*  in facilitating Israel's genocide from day one.
*  But of course, there's a particular emotion here
*  and a sense of, I think betrayal.
*  And that has come up a lot, I think.
*  That this is a party many of them have felt very loyal to
*  and they feel that they are being guilt-tricked
*  into voting for a party which is complicit in genocide.
*  And that is a hideous, hideous choice
*  forced upon this community.
*  Now, in terms of what happens in the presidential election,
*  we don't know, we don't know obviously
*  which way Michigan's gonna go,
*  but this anger and disillusionment
*  is not gonna dissipate.
*  And I think we've got to bear in mind
*  in the age in which we live,
*  the story is often of people who are disenfranchised
*  and not listened to,
*  and that has big dramatic political consequences,
*  which I think are gonna be felt for many, many years.
*  And the Democratic Party, I think,
*  are gonna end up ruining the day they decided to facilitate
*  what is one of the great crimes of their age,
*  because people here, as across the world,
*  are just not gonna forget what happened
*  regardless of who wins.
*  Now, we're on our way next to North Carolina
*  and then we're going to Pennsylvania
*  and we're gonna keep making these videos
*  both before the election and after the election.
