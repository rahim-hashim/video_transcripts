# Israel 'ALLYING' With ISIS To Starve Gaza - Shocking New Allegations In Israeli Media
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [November 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPahBbPUN1c)
*  This really is so dark, so twisted, and we must never of course become immune to the horrors being unleashed against the Palestinian people in Gaza by the Israeli state as part of its multi-pronged attempt to starve and decimate the population.
*  This includes, as we'll discuss, Israel reportedly allying with ISIS-linked armed gangs to starve the people of Gaza.
*  Now, it was why the context, the Israeli state has done everything it can to implement the promise made by Yoav Galant, the former defense minister, openly at the very start of the genocide last October to impose a total siege on a civilian population that he called human animals.
*  The different means that Israel has deployed to deliberately block aid from getting in has been documented with overwhelming evidence over and over again by the United Nations, aid organizations, human rights organizations, Palestinian journalists, and so on.
*  Indeed, notably, two US government agencies, the US Agency for International Development and the State Department's Refugee Agency, concluded that Israel was deliberately blocking aid from entering Gaza this April, which the US administration simply chose to ignore because it would legally, if accepted, impel the US to stop supplying Israel with weapons.
*  Now, that includes obstructing aid from getting in in the first place, intentional delays at crossing points, closing routes, arbitrarily banning things, we could go on.
*  And then there is the mass destruction of infrastructure within Gaza itself, which means preventing aid moving within Gaza, as well as, of course, checkpoints, as well as constant bombings, military onslaughts, shootings, attacks on aid convoys, the biggest slaughter of aid workers ever recorded in any conflict.
*  And indeed, that includes, of course, the killing of foreign aid workers, notably the World Central Kitchen attack, which led to international aid organizations suspending their work.
*  We really could go on.
*  Now, back in October, this October, the US administration sent Israel's administration regime a letter listing the various ways that Israel is clearly obstructing aid from getting into Gaza and around Gaza.
*  Now, this was all for show for the election.
*  And indeed, as soon as the election was over, they made clear they weren't going to take any action, despite aid agencies saying Israel's deliberate siege was worse than ever.
*  And aid reaching Palestinians by October fell to the lowest point since this genocide began.
*  Nonetheless, the letter was useful because it showed that the US is fully aware of Israel's deliberate starvation policy.
*  That is a siege deliberately imposed on the essentials of life.
*  But it is also the most basic responsibility and international law of an occupying power to maintain law and order and to ensure that aid, that the basics of life, get to the population who are under occupation.
*  In the case of allowing aid to reach a population in the midst of mass violence, all of this clearly is a mass of life and death on a mass scale.
*  Now, earlier this year, even the US administration reprimanded Israel for deliberately targeting police units within Gaza charged with escorting aid convoys.
*  Clearly, in the apocalyptic circumstances imposed on Gaza by Israel with a desperately hungry population and the collapse of civilization itself, without armed escorts, aid simply can't get around.
*  The systematic attack on the security forces in such desperate circumstances led to a collapse of law and order in Gaza months ago.
*  It gets so much worse.
*  The evidence is absolutely overwhelming for what the Israeli newspaper Haaretz succinctly describes in its headline as the Israeli army is allowing gangs in Gaza to loot aid trucks and extort protection fees from drivers.
*  Now, this is something else.
*  According to the newspaper article, this is the Israeli media, bear in mind, the IDF is allowing armed men to loot aid convoys as they enter Gaza and to extort protection money from them.
*  This is based on sources from international aid organisations.
*  Note, by the way, why these are anonymous sources, because aid organisations are desperate not to give Israel any excuse to block them from operating them at all, which hugely entails their freedom of speech.
*  Now, according to this Haaretz piece, the armed men are from two clans in Ra'atha and they are blocking large trunks of aid shipments from entering Gaza from the Kerem Shalom crossing.
*  The sources tell the newspaper the looting is systematic, yet the IDF has turned a blind eye.
*  Such armed attacks take place a few hundred metres away from Israeli soldiers and truck drivers, even seek help from the IDF, who then refuse to intervene and even block those drivers from taking safer alternative routes.
*  The Israeli army, trigger happy when it comes to butchering little children, won't fulfil its basic legal obligations as an occupying power to make sure aid gets to the population and law and order is protected in these circumstances.
*  It gets worse, it really does get worse, because some aid groups won't pay up the extortion money.
*  So where does the aid end up? It just ends up sitting or rather rotting in warehouses.
*  And guess who controls those warehouses? The Israeli army.
*  You see, the Israeli army shut down the main Ra'atha crossing with Egypt six months ago.
*  Most aid, therefore, has to enter Kerem Shalom.
*  And as Haaretz notes, armed gangs control the area on the Gaza side.
*  What we're talking about here is, of course, partly a plausible deniability, where you make things so complicated and confusing that it's difficult to show in very clear terms how you're starving people to death.
*  Now Israel says, look, we're allowing aid in, see, we've allowed, I don't know, X amount of aid in, despite the fact they're actually not allowing vast sums of aid in.
*  But they know that the aid they get in is then deliberately allowed to be stopped from getting to the civilians, because as Haaretz notes, the aid represents the vast majority of food and equipment Palestinians in Gaza depend on, because there are almost no commercial imports anymore.
*  Now the newspaper points out, as I alluded to earlier, that what remains of the local security forces try to take action against looters.
*  And what happens then? The Israeli army fire on them, attack them, kill them.
*  Because of course they label anything and everything as Hamas and legitimate targets. Wait till you hear this.
*  The Israeli state, as this Israeli newspaper point out, say they are considering making the clans from which these armed looters spring from in charge of actually distributing the aid to the surviving people of Gaza.
*  Wait till you hear this.
*  This is a quote, again.
*  Even though some of the clans members are involved in terrorism and some are even affiliated with extremist organizations like the Islamic State.
*  Here as this Israeli newspaper pointing out that Israel is seeking to give the armed extremists who are looting aid responsibility for distributing aid.
*  And that includes ISIS.
*  I mean, it's the sort of thing, it just sounds like a tinfoil hack conspiracy theory, doesn't it?
*  Israel de facto are allying with ISIS as part of a deliberate strategy of starving people to death in Gaza.
*  But that's what the evidence, as this Israeli newspaper points us to.
*  Now yesterday, this was corroborated by the Washington Post.
*  They cited a leaked internal United Nations memo which concludes that gangs may be benefiting from a passive, if not active, benevolence or protection from the IDF.
*  They cite a gang leader establishing a military-like compound in an area which is restricted, controlled and patrolled by the IDF.
*  And the UN has declared Gaza to be basically lawless.
*  I mean, when you think about that, they've wiped Gaza off the face of the earth.
*  I mean, trigger happy isn't even a nearly accurate way of describing the operational policy of the IDF.
*  Most of its infrastructure has been wiped out or severely damaged.
*  Gaza looks like a different colour and texture and looks out from space.
*  And they've wiped out so many innocent civilians.
*  Entire blocks of flats blown up with all their families in them.
*  And yet they're just what? Allowing some criminal gangs who've established military compounds in areas that they're entirely in charge of.
*  Again, the evidence speaks for itself.
*  Now, this piece finds that organised gangs are stealing what aid is allowed into Gaza by Israel.
*  And bear in mind just how much of it is blocked from entering, as I keep saying.
*  According to testimonies they cite, aid workers, humanitarian workers, transport companies and witnesses, these gangs are operating freely in areas controlled by the Israeli military.
*  Israeli authorities are denying most requests from aid organisations to introduce better measures to safeguard convoys.
*  As was also noted by Harret, the Israeli forces repeatedly fail within views of attacks to intervene as looting is underway.
*  Again, multiple corroborated testimonies from aid workers, UN officials, transport workers, truck drivers.
*  So this Saturday, 90% of trucks entering from carrying UN food aid from Karem Shalom were ransacked by these armed groups.
*  With the catastrophic consequences that entails for the people of Gaza.
*  Now, we know there's been a total siege imposed in northern Gaza since the beginning of October, with Israel openly declaring they're ethnically cleansing it with its population forbidden from returning.
*  But this article notes that officials say criminal looting has become the greatest impediment to distributing aid in the southern half of Gaza, home to the vast majority of displaced Palestinians.
*  Now, things were already unbelievably bleak in southern Gaza, but not as cataclysmic as northern Gaza.
*  Well, that, of course, we can see how that is due to change.
*  As noted here, aid truck drivers have been killed, beaten, kidnapped.
*  Clearly, this deters aid agencies and aid drivers from working in Gaza to distribute that aid.
*  Again, what's the consequence?
*  Gaza and people in Palestine in Gaza don't get food, don't get medicines, don't get the essentials that are needed to sustain life.
*  And here is a harbinger of Gaza's proposed future.
*  The gangs identified here are opponents of Hamas, indeed, who've been targeted by Hamas.
*  But these gangs, and we'll talk about this more in terms of the completely apocalyptic future of Gaza.
*  Well, we'll talk about it in depth because what's been proposed is basically to put the people who remain in Gaza, what's left of them, in de facto concentration camps.
*  And these gangs will rule the roost.
*  Now, there was another crucial article at the Always Excellent Dropsite News website, which discusses how surviving members of the Palestinian security forces killed at least 20 members of an organized gang alleged to be looting aid trucks and offers even more detail about this pillar of
*  Israel's genocidal onslaught.
*  The point being made here is this looting has been done by collaborators with the Israeli occupation, again pointing to what this is all heading towards.
*  Very clear what's happening here.
*  Israel has de facto allied with criminal collaborators, murderous collaborators, including ISIS, in Gaza as part of a systematic attempt to starve its population.
*  As was reported last December, Benjamin Netanyahu tasked his top advisor with plans to thin out the Palestinian population in Gaza to a minimum.
*  Not even subtle.
*  This is genocide.
*  Now, I just want to define your flag a few things.
*  I told supporters on Patreon already, but I set up a sub stack for a few reasons.
*  I want to do more original written work, obviously, including investigative work and reporting.
*  Separate from that, I'm finally about to publish a big piece of investigative work on the BBC and its reporting on Israel and Palestine.
*  That's taken months and a huge amount of time and resources, including a lot of legaling.
*  I also want to post written versions of the videos of them doing because one of the things I think you can see I've been trying to do on this channel is to document the genocide as best I can.
*  But that's much better done if it's written down, archived and searchable, if I'm honest.
*  But I also want to use sub stack to expand the professionals, what I do more broadly.
*  And one of the reasons I'm trying to move there is because Twitter is becoming a imploding far-right cesspit.
*  And I want to put more effort into investing, into countering the far-rights, unfortunately hugely effective use of the internet, which I'm afraid is a big problem.
*  My sub stack is so far empty, but that will immediately change. It's orenjonesjourno.substack.com.
*  I've also set up an account on Blue Sky. You can find me there simply at Owen Jones, all one word.
*  And finally, I'm working on a book called The Fall of the West, which has things which are obviously linked to a lot of what I talk about on this channel.
*  I'll let you know more about that as soon as I can.
*  As ever, please like, subscribe, leave your comments, your thoughts, help take on the genocide of media.
*  If you can, if you want to, Owen at patreon.com, for the last hour, Jones84.
*  Listen to this podcast, I'll speak to you soon.
