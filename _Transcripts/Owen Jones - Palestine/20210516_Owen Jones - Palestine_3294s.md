# Israel Wages War on Palestine
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 16, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ls7jyYNAFM)
*  Hello and welcome to the show. This is a very special edition that we're talking today,
*  of course, about the horrendous events currently taking place in Palestine as the Israeli onslaught
*  against the Palestinian people has only escalated. Now, I just want to do a quick, before we go in
*  and bring in a guest, because the last thing that we're going to do today is hear my voice.
*  I just want to make something very clear, because I think this has come up a lot before when I
*  announced the show, I announced what we're talking about, people said, oh well Owen,
*  what about all the perspectives? Why can't we hear the other side of the argument? And so on
*  and so forth. Now, let's just set some ground rules about this. We often hear about the conflict,
*  the conflict, the Middle East conflict. Conflicts presuppose two sides that are at least comparable.
*  This isn't a conflict. This is a question of an occupation between a state which is
*  illegally occupying and besieging Palestinian territories, denying the right of the Palestinian
*  people to the most, one of those elementary rights of all, the rights of national self-determination.
*  And the occupied. One is a military superpower which is armed to the teeth by Western powers
*  and therefore knows it can and will get away with anything with Joe Biden,
*  much like Donald Trump, continuity in US foreign policy is ever allowing and very publicly signaling
*  that Israel can get away with virtually anything up to and including, as we saw yesterday,
*  the destruction of a building, housing, international media organizations. We see
*  it with a death toll. It is every death is a tragedy, of course, including Israeli life.
*  What we do have to make very clear is that as ever, the number of Palestinian dead vastly
*  outnumbers those who've died who are Israeli. Again, for the very basic reason that this is
*  not a symmetrical conflict. It is a conflict between a military superpower, armed to the teeth
*  by Western powers and an occupied people who clearly are not. Now, that's the basic ground
*  rules we're beginning on. And the whole point of this channel from the beginning was to offer an
*  alternative to mainstream media outlets for where you will all hear constantly the other side,
*  if you like, which is the aggressor, the occupier, which is in violation of international law
*  and armed to the teeth by our own governments. If that sounds frustrated, tough, but we have to
*  just make that very clear. Now, just quick ground rules or housekeeping as ever. For those who are
*  watching live, please do click through to YouTube. It just really helps the channel. Click like,

*  forward slash Owen Jones 84, or you can support the channel using super chat. You can put questions
*  to our guests and I will read out the questions, but I will also at the end,
*  give a special thanks to everyone who has supported us as well. Now, what we're going to do is we're
*  going to start straight away, as I've said, because we don't. And again, this is the point I think that
*  needs to be heard, which is it's about which voices are heard. And we hear a lot of white
*  Westerners in this so-called discussion. The voices who are almost always erased from this
*  conversation are those of the Palestinian people themselves. This show is a limited attempt to
*  address that imbalance by handing the mic to Palestinian voices on the ground in occupied
*  Jerusalem and in Gaza. And those are the voices that we're going to hear from today. So to begin
*  with, I'm going to bring in our first absolutely brilliant guest who we're very lucky to have,
*  and that is Farooz Shaqawi. Please. Hello. Firstly, can I just check, have I pronounced your name
*  right? Do you tell me off the bat? It's great to see you. Now you're obviously based in occupied
*  Jerusalem. You're the director of Grassroots Al Quds. So just tell me firstly, tell us a little
*  bit about yourselves, just so the audience either watching live or listening later know who you are.
*  Yes, Grassroots Al Quds is a Palestinian organization based in Jerusalem. And we are a platform
*  for Palestinian community mobilization and networking in Jerusalem, because the way things
*  are going in Jerusalem, it seems like everyone has a say about the destiny and the future of the city,
*  except for the Palestinians living in it. So what we do is research Jerusalem, Jerusalem,
*  Palestinian community stories, current reality challenges faced under the occupation,
*  the Israeli occupation, displacement policies against Palestinians. We also support local
*  mobilization within our communities and build networks between the different fragmented
*  Palestinian communities in Jerusalem so that we can together envision the Jerusalem we want
*  and start building long-term strategies for Jerusalem and translating them into reality.
*  Our global mobilization focuses on giving the Palestinian perspective on Jerusalem,
*  the true story of Jerusalem. We offer political tours and analysis of the policies in Jerusalem.
*  So to begin with, and I think this is very important because the problem,
*  I'm sure you're well aware, the many limitations with the Western media and how it reports on
*  what's actually happening in Palestine, is it will suddenly erupt into the headlines
*  without the background or context, which is often stripped. So do you just want to explain
*  what was going on in occupied Jerusalem in the buildup before all of a sudden it suddenly appears
*  in Western media outlets portrayed as, again, a conflict at best, it's Israelis and Palestinians,
*  they're fighting again, again, often suggesting inequality of forces or even, to be honest,
*  suggesting this is an onslaught by terrorists. So just give that context, what was going on
*  in occupied Jerusalem? Yes, I think what we are witnessing these days is a Palestinian uprising
*  everywhere in the different occupied parts of Palestine and this started a bit around a month
*  ago in Jerusalem. I mean, this is all happening within a wider context and I think that it is
*  important to explain that the happenings of these days are not just incidents happening
*  without a context. We are speaking about a context of more than 73 years of settler colonialism in
*  Palestine. In Jerusalem itself, the Israeli occupation policies for Jerusalem are very clear.
*  They aim at annexing as much land as possible, robbing and stealing as much land as possible
*  with as little Palestinian presence on it as possible. So since 1967, when the eastern part
*  of Jerusalem was occupied along with the Palestinian population living in it, the Israeli
*  occupation authorities started designing and implementing policies of displacement against
*  Palestinians from Jerusalem. Ethnically cleansing Jerusalem from its Palestinians is the Israeli
*  official goal, Israeli official plans for Jerusalem state that they wish to maintain, achieve and
*  maintain a so-called demographic balance between Jews and non-Jews, their terminology, and this
*  imbalance, if I may correct the term, stands at 70% Jewish, 30% non-Jewish. In other words, 70% Israeli,
*  30% Palestinian, and in order to achieve this goal, Israeli occupation authorities have been
*  dispossessing Palestinians, robbing our lands, confiscating our lands, demolishing our homes,
*  suffocating our communities, not allowing our communities to naturally grow, suffocating our
*  economy, dictating the curricula that our kids learn at schools, all of this in order to achieve
*  that goal of displacing as many Palestinians as possible. Now part of this story of displacement
*  is the specific story of Sheikh Jarrah, this one neighborhood strategically located just outside
*  the old city that has been facing the threat of colonization since 1967. Actually it has been
*  colonized slowly, gradually, taken over by settlers since 1967, and the case, the specific case of six
*  families from Sheikh Jarrah who are about to be expelled from their homes is what sparked protest
*  in Jerusalem last month, and many Palestinians not only from Jerusalem, also from other parts of
*  Palestine, those who can access Jerusalem, started showing up and being present to give solidarity
*  and back up to the Palestinian families in Sheikh Jarrah. Certainly this protest and this presence
*  is considered a threat by the colonizer, and so people visiting the families have been attacked
*  by the Israeli army and police, occupation police throughout the last month. This all was happening
*  during the month of Ramadan, the holy month of fasting for the Muslims, accompanied with stories
*  and reports and scenes. We have seen how the Israeli occupation forces have been attacking
*  worshippers inside the Al Aqsa mosque, basically going into the Al Aqsa mosque with tear gas
*  and sound bombs and very excessive use of power and violence and aggression, terrorizing worshippers
*  inside the Al Aqsa. These conditions together have led to the spark of the protests in the streets
*  of Jerusalem, especially around Damascus Gate, which is the main entrance to the old city. It is
*  our city center. The Damascus Gate area is where we practice our belonging and ownership
*  over Jerusalem, and that is why even sipping tea at the stairs in front of Damascus Gate was considered
*  a threat by the colonizer again. So the army was there beating up Palestinians, again using tear gas
*  and sound bombs and whatnot in order to show eventually who the boss is, who controls Jerusalem.
*  So I think it is important to understand the wider context. This has led to the revolution,
*  if I would be very optimistic these days and say that the revolution has spread, and now there is
*  confrontation with the occupier by Palestinians in the different parts of occupied Palestine.
*  Gaza, the West Bank, the eastern part of Jerusalem as part of the West Bank, as well as 48 occupied
*  lands. Now I just want to ask you something about the US response, because everyone was very
*  relieved when of course Donald Trump was defeated, but one of the many problems with US foreign
*  policies, when a Republican is in the White House, not least one who is easily seen as this pantomime
*  villain like Donald Trump, there is more unity around the nefarious nature of that president's
*  foreign policy and then people breathe a huge sigh of relief of Democrats in the White House,
*  hurrah hurrah hurrah. Now Joe Biden yesterday just issued an eminence's tweet, today the president
*  spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu affirmed his strong support for Israel's right to
*  defend itself against rocket attacks from Hamas and other terrorist groups in Gaza and condemn
*  these indiscriminate attacks against Israel. Donald Trump could have issued the exact same thing,
*  but interestingly there is actually pressure within the United States which is greater than
*  it was before from the left, so more than 140 progressive groups released a statement calling
*  on the Biden administration to denounce efforts to evict Palestinian families in Jerusalem
*  and exert the utmost diplomatic pressure to prevent these potential war crimes from taking place.
*  What's your view on, in terms of the US response, because obviously there is a backlash there,
*  specifically to what's going on in Jerusalem and how that enables the Israeli state to get away
*  with their actions in Jerusalem? Well two things to say here, first of all I don't think that there
*  is a difference between Biden and Trump really, I think it's just like when asked about Israeli
*  politics whether Netanyahu is better or someone else from the Israeli politics is better than
*  Netanyahu, eventually what decides is the system, is the regime and both in this case both countries
*  are settler colonialist projects who by default are going to have the same politics on certain
*  issues, but at the same time I mean to say something about the US, Trump has been like
*  the lowering of a bar so low that people would celebrate anything else, but eventually Palestinians
*  did expect that this is what's going to happen, Biden's statements are not surprising to the
*  Palestinians and we do not expect the US administration to magically suddenly change
*  its position, its decades long position on Palestine. In addition I think that it is very
*  convenient for the rest of the world to simply say the US is the villain here, the US is the bad guy,
*  the US sends 3.8 billion dollars every year in unconditional support and aid to Israel and that
*  is why indeed the US is the number one enabler of the Israeli settler colonialist project in
*  Palestine. Nonetheless I think that we need to realize that different governments are showing
*  this backup and support to Israel, to name just a few examples the Austrian Parliament raising the
*  Israeli flag, two days ago the German as well as the French police cracking down heavily on protests
*  supporting Palestinians in the streets of Berlin and Paris yesterday and the day before. I think
*  that again it is not surprising, governments are going to support each other, regimes support each
*  other and I think that we Palestinians should move our attention and our mobilization from the
*  decision maker level in other countries and focus on our allies in the streets. I think that
*  connecting struggles and connecting the grassroots of Palestine to the grassroots of other countries
*  is our way to achieve real change. I think that statements by officials again also the very
*  provocative statement by the European Union and other governments they are not surprising,
*  they have always failed the Palestinian people, our hope is in our brothers and sisters in the
*  streets around the world that are raising a louder voice. These are the same people who are so thirsty
*  looking for reports on Palestine on social media as you said before because the mainstream media is
*  simply chewing again over and over again the same old statements about what's happening in Palestine,
*  supporting and promoting misinformation about what's happening on the ground. So I would say
*  it's not surprising that governments are backing up the Israeli occupation government and what
*  needs to be done is for you, their voters, go out to the streets and say no, hell no, you will not
*  support Israel in our name. Could you tell us what's happening on the ground in occupied
*  Jerusalem today? I mean there's been reports of huge numbers of arrests this morning there and
*  also I mean that point you made about a generalised uprising because what's I suppose new about or
*  relatively new about what's happening at the moment is what's happened within Israeli Arab communities
*  where we've seen protests again often attacked by the Israeli state. I mean that's what a new
*  phenomenon isn't it? So I'm interested to know what's happening on the ground in Jerusalem with
*  this crackdown and what your thoughts about what's happening with those protests as well?
*  Yes well first of all we need to clarify that the confrontations with the Israeli occupation forces
*  have not stopped in Jerusalem. Many Jerusalem Palestinian communities yesterday witnessed
*  such confrontations with the occupation forces and that's exactly that comes within the context
*  of the Israeli heavy crackdown again on protesters and yes hundreds of Palestinians were arrested
*  in Jerusalem in the past two weeks. In Palestine in total there have been 1,500 people arrested
*  in the last couple of days since the confrontation started and spread all over Palestine. A huge
*  number was in Jerusalem I think around 800 of those 1,500 were in Jerusalem around 400 in the
*  West Bank and another maybe four or five or six hundred in 48 occupied lands. I think that this
*  and let's not forget the number of martyrs yeah almost 200 Palestinians were killed by the Israeli
*  occupation forces all over Palestine in the last few days the highest number of course coming from
*  Gaza I think it's around 181 today around 11 or even a bit more martyrs fell in in the West Bank
*  especially on Friday and one Palestinian was murdered by a settler in the city of Lid inside
*  48 occupied lands. So certainly the terrorizing of Palestinians includes also mass incarceration
*  arrests that aim at terrorizing people and making people think twice before going out and protesting
*  in the streets. Let's not forget that protesters face real threats to their safety and to their
*  lives being in the street as well because before the arrest comes the rubber-coated bullets come
*  and other arms and weapons that the Israeli army uses against protesters in Palestine.
*  So I think it is important for people following the news from outside of Palestine to understand
*  that this is not just another so-called war between Hamas and Israel. I mean I think people
*  need to understand that Hamas is part of the Palestinian people and what's happening today
*  is not just the retaliation between Hamas and the occupation state of Israel what's happening today
*  are also protests in cities like Haifa, Lid, Akka, Kufr Kanna, Im el Fahm all of these are 48 occupied
*  cities also all over the West Bank there are Palestinian protests and demonstrations and
*  confrontations with the occupation army and of course the eastern part of Jerusalem as well
*  as I was saying confrontations continued also yesterday last night and also Gaza is resisting.
*  So I think it's important that people understand that this is not just a so-called conflict between
*  Hamas and Israel what is happening right now is a Palestinian uprising against 70 plus years of
*  colonization of dispossession of oppression of humiliation and Palestinians have had enough.
*  I think that it is great to see that the Israeli plans the Israeli budgets for creating false
*  consciousness in Palestinian minds creating different political realities is part of the
*  divide and conquer against Palestinians so creating different political realities making
*  different Palestinians believe or feel that they are living different struggles. I think what we
*  are witnessing in the last few days is all of Palestine saying after tens of years and tens of
*  billions of shekels or dollars or pounds or whatever currency we can use I think that it
*  is a proof that all of this has been failing the Israeli policies have been failing and the
*  Palestinian people against all odds continue to not only feel but also act as one colonized
*  people under one colonization and occupation with one struggle for freedom and self-determination.
*  One of the questions just just finally I mean just twofold someone asks Raja and thanks for
*  the support everyone do you think a change in Israeli leadership would make a difference to
*  Palestinians if it was the right kind of leadership I know you've partly partly answered that but just
*  in terms of what your thoughts are in terms of you know maybe solidarity that you've had from
*  within Israel and the importance that all the significance of that and finally where
*  where next what are your hopes because many people watching this will see will have you know
*  resistance from in terms of these in Jerusalem we've seen these huge protests organized protests
*  the Israeli government will clamp down they will have the support of western governments
*  and the occupation will continue the evictions the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from occupied
*  Jerusalem will continue those protests that I've said will be will be further clamped down mass
*  arrests and and and that will be the end game so what what do you have any hopes that that outcome
*  could be different this time well regarding the change in Israeli politics again as I said before
*  I don't think there is a difference because we are talking about a Zionist project in Palestine
*  and there are no voices that are anti-zionist within the Israeli politics and so I don't think
*  there is a difference between Netanyahu or anyone else go back to history and look up what Paris the
*  Nobel Prize winner did in south Lebanon in Ghana and he was supposed to be left he was supposed
*  to be left wing so no I that's exactly my point by default Israeli politics and the Israeli system
*  is Zionist and that is that that means racist and oppressive to the Palestinian people so there is
*  no hope coming from changing faces or voices in Israeli politics now regarding what's next I think
*  that it's very important and clear these days that on our side as Palestinians we need to invest in
*  community organizing again our own political leadership is certainly not
*  working in our favor it's not really representing the Palestinian people it is the first obstacle
*  on our way to to liberation but I do we do believe in grassroots organizing and we believe in
*  community organizing and that's exactly what has been working in the streets in the last few days
*  we have seen many proofs to that so I think that we need to organize our communities we need to
*  build the infrastructure the popular grassroots infrastructure that will hold and sustain a
*  revolution and we have already witnessed how there are committees being created in the different
*  Palestinian cities committees that aim at defending people when settlers and police attack them
*  committees that include lawyers to look after RSTs or medics and the doctors and nurses to be
*  there when they are needed when ambulances are blocked by the Israeli occupation army and many
*  other types of committees it reminds me of the spirit of the first intifada which was a beautiful
*  example of proper community organizing I think that we today understand or are reminded more than
*  ever that there is a need to build this infrastructure and to do that type of organizing on our side
*  when it comes to what can be done from outside of Palestine to support Palestinians and you know
*  I think that there are two main things that people can do first of all make some noise as I said
*  before go out to the streets and tell your decision makers that they cannot support the atrocities and
*  the crimes and the colonization of Palestine in your name unless you accept it and agree to it
*  secondly and and again this support by governments can be both diplomatic and also material and
*  economic by dealing and having business with the occupation state of Israel secondly I think that
*  what also enables and and supports the Israeli colonial project in Palestine are all of those
*  international corporations that are invested in the settler colonialist project that are benefiting
*  from the Israeli occupation of Palestine and I think that they need to be held accountable as
*  well you know I've been living in Jerusalem for 20 years now and oftentimes I see those tear gas
*  canisters used by the Israeli army and occupation police here in Jerusalem tear gas canisters
*  manufactured by an American company based in Pennsylvania in the United States two days ago
*  we found where one of these canisters was found in the city of Imel Fahim inside 48 occupied lands
*  so I think that this is just one example of one corporation that is benefiting from the Israeli
*  oppression of Palestinian people I think these corporations are also the responsibility of the
*  people in those countries where these corporations are coming from I think that more than anything
*  that economic boycott the cultural boycott the cultural academic economic boycott of Israel are
*  tools that people must use outside of Palestine I think that people need to be brave and to counter
*  the anti-bds legislations and crack down by their own governments on their own freedom of expression
*  and people should be able to raise a loud voice and say not with my taxpayer money and not with
*  my consumer money you will not support what is happening in Palestine.
*  Thomas we really appreciate you joining I know you're incredibly busy and you know as I've said
*  it's so important that we have your voice given at the moment the discussion here in many western
*  states is very much erasing your voices such as your own please stay safe out there and
*  huge solidarity and take care and it's a huge honour to have you thank you so much thanks Owen
*  bye bye take care. We're now going to be joined by another voice and again as I've said these are
*  voices people need to hear because when people talk about balance what do we mean by balance?
*  What kind of balance is it when the voices of those in Gaza particularly are completely
*  airbrushed from this conversation? Gaza is spoken about often but very rarely by people who actually
*  live in Gaza and we're going to challenge that and we're really really honoured to have Afaf
*  with us here hello Afaf can I are you there yes we've got you hello Afaf hello hi hey can I just
*  check how to say your last name firstly because I was going to say it and then I was going to get
*  it wrong again please oh so sorry I was going to say how just to make sure I pronounce your
*  your surname correctly yeah my name is Afaf and Najjar great to see you thanks so so much for
*  joining us Afaf just quickly could you just explain to people watching or listening just
*  tell us a little bit about yourself and where you're speaking from at the moment just just
*  describe a little bit about yourself all right um my name is Afaf and I'm an 18 years old student
*  I study English in Al Aqsa University here in the Gaza Strip um I live in Khan Yunis which is the
*  to the south of the Gaza Strip um I'm working as a writer with We Are Not Numbers um where we write
*  the stories behind the numbers in the news where we tell the stories behind the numbers of those
*  people who get murdered by the Israeli occupation and um just the rest of the world that these are
*  not just numbers these these are not uh just statistics that you see in the news but people
*  with dreams with hopes with ambitions that were destroyed because of everything that's going on
*  here um so yeah um I mean again I should say it's such an honour to have you in to have you here
*  and particularly when at the moment you're under uh armed attack from the Israeli state so it's a
*  huge hugely appreciated by not just myself but everyone watching and listening Afaf can you just
*  tell us a little bit before we talk about what's currently going on you're 18 years old and all
*  you've known all your life is either well both siege and occupation so do you just want to describe
*  the kind of experiences that people who are 18 years old in in Britain have never had to endure
*  never had to go through just tell us a little bit about those experiences
*  All right um the first war I've ever witnessed uh as a child was in 2008 as as you know um there have
*  been words wars in 2008 2012 and 2014 and now 2021 uh the first one I witnessed was um in 2008
*  I was seven years old and since that day like since that age and even earlier I had to um make
*  sure to know what to do at the time of the bombing because um you know it's continuous
*  bombing for a couple of days when it's war and um what we had to do was to stay in one room together
*  like the whole family would get packed in one room together so that if we die or if we get killed at
*  least we die together um what is happening currently in the Gaza Strip is continuous bombing to different
*  places um actually all over the Gaza Strip all over the uh the different cities of the Gaza Strip
*  it started on Monday and it still continues uh until now just uh like minutes ago when Fayruz
*  was talking there was a lot of bombing like in my area around my house and uh this morning actually
*  I was I was um woken up to the sound of bombing I had just slept I had just finally had some
*  uh time to sleep because I'm constantly um you know posting on social media and busy with uh
*  the media and stuff so I don't get time to sleep so when I finally decided to sleep and I put my
*  phone down and I put my head on the pillow the bombing started so I had to wake up and run
*  downstairs to sit with my family um I live with my grandparents and my mom and two brothers and
*  to be honest at such a time I'm unable to you know attend to every one of them because um
*  I'm the the oldest um among my amongst my family like I'm the the oldest child let's say or the
*  oldest grand uh daughter in the house so I have to take care of both my grandparents my brothers
*  my mom and even my cousins who live with us as well and sometimes our neighbors have to come from
*  their house to stay at our place because it's apparently safer so as I said before we get
*  packed in one room all of us um you know my grandma and our neighbors start praying uh they
*  start asking God to keep us safe and stuff and usually I go on live videos to just you know
*  record everything and post it so that uh our voices and our message could be delivered to
*  the whole world um so yeah this is what's going on in the Gaza Strip they are bombing residential
*  towers they are attacking um you know citizens who are completely innocent um a lot of people
*  have died a lot of places have been bombed they're literally bombing anything that gives life
*  to the Gaza Strip they're bombing streets um the street that my university is in was bombed my
*  university was bombed as well uh so yeah this is how it is in the Gaza Strip right now.
*  When Israel the Israeli state argues that the targets it's attacking are military targets
*  they're Hamas legitimate targets what would you say based on your own experiences of what's
*  actually happening on the ground in Gaza and just tell us a little bit about I mean how much
*  it's a glib question but you know the everyday fear what that's like over the last few days
*  as you said you try to go asleep you hear the bombing begin how much fear there is just in
*  the communities of the Gaza Strip at the moment? um now regarding the first part of your question
*  about how they're only bombing uh military uh places that's completely false that's definitely
*  a lie um the the most or the three most famous uh residential towers that were attacked were
*  Al-Hanadi Al-Jawara and Al-Jalah if I remember correctly these are residential towers with people
*  with citizens living in them um and they all are homeless now because of what happened this is the
*  first thing residential towers they are bombing uh citizens and their houses on top of their heads
*  they are bombing banks I don't think that banks have anything to do with um any political aspect
*  of uh the Palestinian struggle they are bombing mosques they are bombing streets they are bombing
*  schools and universities so I'm not sure like if the world sees this as um a military place or a
*  military um you know I'm not sure I just I think that this is the truth despite what they're trying
*  to uh convince people of in the media um now about about how scared the situation is here as I said
*  we've already witnessed four wars and a lot of other assaults and raids on the Gaza Strip
*  other than the wars the wars themselves and even though we have witnessed them for so many times
*  we never and I mean never get used to it you can never get used to the sound of the bombing you
*  can never get used to seeing people um die you can never be used to seeing the blood and the limbs
*  all over the place you can never be used to seeing destruction and your and seeing your you know most
*  favorite places uh in your country destroyed so it's very scary and it continues to get scary and
*  to be honest the one thing I'm scared of the most is losing one of my family members more than losing
*  my own life I'm scared to one day wake up and have to live without one of my family or one of my
*  friends um this is one thing the second thing I'm scared of is uh to have to live for example without
*  an arm or without a leg or without eyes because this is happening to Palestinians this is happening
*  happening to children right right now in the Gaza Strip um so I mean I've have we know that at least
*  74 children have died in the Gaza Strip over over the last few over the last few days um I mean
*  I mean I'm curious your response to you know yesterday Israel as you say they bombed one
*  of the towers they bombed housed international media organizations they gave one hour's notice
*  included Associated Press I understand actually I think the BBC and Al Jazeera who then broadcast
*  live the bombing the destruction of their own of their own offices I mean what's your thoughts
*  given given the way the western media is often reporting on what's happening within uh the
*  palace the occupied occupied Palestine within what's happening in Gaza what what's your take on
*  on Israel feeling so emboldened that they think they or they know not they think they know they
*  can get away with bombing not just killing civilians who've been thoroughly dehumanized by
*  much of the western media but they can get away with bombing media organizations
*  okay uh so I'm just going to mention this because um it made me so extremely scared yesterday
*  my friends a lot of my friends live near to that building um Angela building and um I've seen how
*  they were tweeting and telling like their friends that hey we left our homes because of uh you know
*  uh the the bombing that's going to happen so what Israel does or the Israeli occupation does is that
*  they call the owner of the building they tell him we're going to bomb your building so you better
*  leave um and from what I've heard that the owner of the building actually asked them for more time
*  because you know the building is full of equipment and full of things that they need for uh their
*  work and he asked them to give them some more time to give the Palestinians some more time to like
*  take things out of the building and um make people leave and they said no uh and in my opinion these
*  calls are not actually made to help to for example make the Palestinians safe they're actually made
*  to make them get scared to make them terrified so it's it's basically an until war um for the
*  Palestinians now regarding what's happening in the media I'm sure that most of you have heard
*  about the censorship that most of the uh social media platforms are practicing on anyone who's
*  posting about Palestine the reach of stories and the views of stories are becoming way less than
*  they were before anything that has the word Palestine or the hashtags uh in it is uh not
*  reaching as many people as the like other posts are um many of us are not allowed to go on live
*  videos many of us are getting their accounts deactivated and blocked um and unfortunately
*  as you said just now yes Israel knows that they can get away with such things because
*  the media especially in the western um world is helping them the media is supporting Israel and
*  not supporting Palestine and this is why it's very important for people um who live abroad and even
*  for people who live in Gaza Strip to try and you know post about what's going on to try and go on
*  live videos to try and um you know go on interviews and podcasts like these uh to make sure that the
*  momentum doesn't die uh so in my opinion it's it's really all on us now it's it's on us as citizens
*  and us as people who are pro-Palestinian uh pro-Palestine sorry um because we are not getting as
*  much recognition as the Israeli people are getting we are not getting as much support from you know
*  the big uh let's say tv channels and so on as they are so yeah it's it's totally our responsibility
*  now and it's my responsibility as an 18 year old year old it's it's my brother's responsibility as
*  a 16 year old even my little brother who's nine is making videos and trying to post um like on
*  his accounts to tell the rest of the world what's happening and I think kids like us because I still
*  consider myself a kid uh despite everything that I have to go through kids like us shouldn't be
*  obligated to begin with to do such things we should be living in peace we should be living
*  in our hometown peacefully and and with no you know with no fear so yeah that that's that's
*  basically what I think about this absolutely um another question I wanted to put to you was
*  when you hear in media reports this description of a conflict okay it's what I said earlier it's
*  this idea of two sides both locked in a battle with each other one side is uh you know Israel
*  is bombing but also Hamas is sending missiles and this is an equal conflict between two belligerents
*  what do you what's your from your own lived experience what's your what's your react what
*  would you say to someone who portrays this is essentially a conflict between two two forces
*  who are comparable to each other okay um so I don't like to talk about Hamas and I don't like
*  to talk about anything related to politics but to be honest it's time for us to speak up Hamas is
*  part of the Palestine is is a big part of the Palestinian people's lives and um it was legally
*  elected to uh you know um be in the government uh now regarding how they're talking about war
*  and they're talking about conflict it's not a conflict it's a Palestinian struggle it's not a
*  war it's an aggression because when you're talking about a conflict or talking about war
*  you're talking about two sides that are completely equal and Palestinians and the Israeli occupation
*  are not at all in any way uh equal in this uh aggression that is going on because you know
*  like only the the rockets that are launched from the Iron Dom in Israel they cost about um I think
*  from 35 to 50 000 and the rockets that are made in the Gaza Strip are actually handmade they're made
*  here in the Gaza Strip with no help of anyone so it's not the same they have places to run to
*  like basements and stuff to run to when shelters when uh there is bombing um they have the Iron
*  Dom to block any rockets that are um you know launched from the Gaza Strip to Israel so it's
*  it's not the same and it's not equal and it's they have way more power especially like military
*  power uh than we do in the Gaza Strip that they talk about how you know Hamas is killing people
*  in uh Israel the amount of people killed just in these few days by the Israeli occupation is way
*  more and I mean way more than the amount of people who died um in Israel in the past 10 years so
*  please start using the right terminology when you're talking about the Palestinian struggle
*  because um this is the only way we can hold the Israeli occupation accountable to what they're
*  doing to the Palestinian people. Finally Faf because I know I mean we're very honoured and
*  privileged that you've had time to speak to us and I know other people are going to be talking to you
*  shortly what in practice we we have mass demonstrations this weekend both in Britain
*  where over 150 000 people marched uh but also other countries in France even though they they
*  faced a violent crackdown by the French police but there've been protests or towns and cities all
*  over the world yesterday huge numbers of people came out despite the pandemic and the restrictions
*  that imposes um but what would you like to say to people who don't know what to do at the moment
*  they feel a bit lost they see these terrible images on tv on social media they hear voices like your
*  own what would you like people to do? Okay so um I've been trying to tell my friends uh
*  how they can help and what they can do and it's really easy you guys it's it's really easy to do
*  it it doesn't even take that much of that much time um basically and and the the easiest thing
*  you can do to help is to post on social media to tell the rest of the world what's going on to keep
*  reposting what we as Palestinians post to try and you know um raise our voices and deliver the
*  message to a wider audience uh this is the first thing so post on social media on instagram on
*  twitter on facebook wherever you can this is the first thing um and please when posting again make
*  sure you use the right terminology it's not it's not war it's an aggression it's not conflict it's
*  a struggle it's not uh evictions it's forced expulsions and um ethnic cleansing of the
*  Palestinian people um and again the only way we can hold them accountable for what they're doing
*  is by using the right terminology when talking um another thing is people who can talk multiple
*  languages or a couple of languages like I I'm able to speak Arabic and English and I'm translating
*  from Arabic to English so if you talk more than one language please try to translate um like the
*  news and what's going on to the languages you speak in order for us again to reach to a wider
*  audience and to more people um you can post about Palestine and you can support Palestine in your
*  own way let's say if you're an artist uh you make paintings you draw do that draw about Palestine
*  paint about Palestine if you're a singer sing about Palestine and post these singing's you're
*  doing if you're able to speak nicely and fluently and in a in a convincing way try to go on live
*  videos try to uh you know join podcasts like these and if you have big platforms um on social
*  media try to give the Palestinian people a chance to go on live videos with you to explain to the
*  rest of the people about what's going on in the Gaza Strip um people who can go on protests I've
*  seen a lot of protests um that are amazing in the UK in the USA in France in Germany and in Turkey
*  and they're amazing please send me videos if you could of these things because I post them
*  on my social media and they really really help us to you know keep our steadfastness and to
*  feel supported and to feel like our voices are actually reaching to people um people who can
*  donate uh please do that as well but make sure that your donations are going to the right places
*  make sure that your donations are actually arriving to the Gaza Strip and to Palestine
*  and please don't stop posting about Jerusalem the Israeli occupations the Israeli occupation is
*  actually using what's happening in the Gaza Strip to distract people from what's happening in
*  Jerusalem and the Sheikh Jarrah so please don't stop posting about Jerusalem as well try to post
*  about both both places about Palestine um as a whole the occupied Palestine the occupied
*  territories and Jerusalem and the West Bank and about Gaza as well and people who can boycott
*  please boycott boycotting is very important and it puts a lot of pressure on the Israeli occupation
*  um the last thing that I'm going to talk about and it's very important as well if you could go on
*  Google Play and uh App Store uh like Apple Store on your phones and rate these platforms one star
*  and write something about Palestine that would help a lot I'm not sure if you've seen it or not but um
*  at the beginning of everything that was happening uh Instagram was actually not allowing some
*  hashtags to be used like al-Aqsa hashtag but because of what we were doing and because uh we
*  kept like um rating it with one star they actually uh started letting us use the hashtag again and they
*  started to um they actually posted uh to clarify why they're actually not allowing these
*  specific hashtags to be posted and they talked about Sheikh Jarrah so if you could do that as
*  well that would be highly appreciated um thank you so much uh for you know hosting me and thank you
*  so much for giving me the chance to talk and to tell you about what's going on we really appreciate
*  every little thing that you guys are doing and we see it and we are so thankful that you guys are
*  showing your support and solidarity to the Palestinian people.
*  We really really appreciate it and I know having read the comments uh how overwhelmed people are by
*  by what you said it's made a very big impact and I really do hope people will will act on what you
*  so eloquent eloquently described a lot of people are asking in terms of social media how to follow
*  the work of we are not numbers which of course you're part of and it's very straightforward it
*  is we are not numbers if people go to at we are numbers on on Twitter they'll be able to follow
*  that and and support we are not numbers there and also elevate the voices that you've you've
*  described if I stay safe and huge huge solidarity um I can't even begin to imagine what you've had
*  to endure what what you're enduring right now but you have the love and support of countless people
*  all over the world and I hope at a time like this that that means something but all my solidarity
*  and I really appreciate it. Thank you very much thank you. Take care now take care.
*  I mean as she says no 18 year old should be having to endure or describe these things uh
*  18 year old should be living normal lives spending time with their friends studying having fun
*  and that's not the experience of people like Afaf and the dehumanization of the Palestinian
*  people and all of this is something that has to be called out because at times like this people
*  do show themselves and reveal themselves and if that so many or so much commentary
*  is based on essentially the fact that Palestinian lives are not of equal worth
*  to the lives of westerners for example or even close is racism and it should be called
*  called out as such and that I'm afraid is being used to justify a decades long illegal occupation
*  of Palestinian lands the deprivation of the Palestinian rights and national self-determination
*  and the siege of Gaza which again is infringing on the rights of the people of the Gaza Strip to live
*  lives approximating something which could be regarded as normality and security
*  and these things have to be called out look Meds on some frontier the fantastic NGO just
*  reported that their medical facility has been bombed overnight those sorts of actions are
*  war crimes and they should be called out as such and of course what we all need to be fighting for
*  is a secure and just and lasting peace giving peace and security to Jews and Palestinians
*  alike in the Middle East and we're not having that conversation because as things stand
*  the Israeli state knows it can get away with almost anything and it is getting away with
*  almost anything because western governments most notably the United States have given them a
*  blank check to do exactly that and that's why it's so important we have these voices
*  on the ground in occupied Jerusalem and in Gaza to provide the balance if you like which is sorely
*  missing when what we are talking about is an occupied people who are under attack by a military
*  superpower denying their right to exist as an independent nation and we're going to leave it
*  there just to wrap up though we've got lots of interviews and videos coming up this week we'll
*  have lots more coverage of what's going on I'm sure in Palestine do act on what Afaf has said
*  in terms of what people can do and use your voices as best as you can just before I sign off
