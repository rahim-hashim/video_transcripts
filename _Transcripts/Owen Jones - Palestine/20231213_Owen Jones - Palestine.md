# Yanis Varoufakis Tells Me Gaza Is A Genocide In Plain Sight
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [December 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0on31lBXTY)
*  Hello, hello, hello. I am delighted as ever to have the brilliant Yanis Vyafakos,
*  who has so many hats he wears that I suppose his head is just full of hats.
*  He's a former Greek finance minister, he's a very esteemed economist, writer, political leader.
*  I could go on, Yanis. You've got a lot of hats, as I've said, balancing on your head.
*  Well, I'm glad to be considered your friend and your comrade and your mate.
*  That's more than sufficient.
*  That's the ultimate bauble on the Christmas feast. I will take that, that'll be my epitaph.
*  So Yanis, let's talk about Gaza. Now, I think just in terms of a historical context and lens,
*  and not just in terms of the specific dynamics of Palestine occupation,
*  but I spoke to Raz Segal, who's an Israeli American professor of Holocaust and Genocide Studies,
*  for those who aren't aware. And what just struck me was the argument he made was that intent is
*  very rarely so overtly spoken in these situations. When you get Benjamin Netanyahu quoting Amalek from
*  the Bible in which the Amalek nation attacked the Israelites and their God orders them to kill all
*  men, women, children and livestock, that were fighting human animals, that Gaza was reduced
*  to a city of tents, there were no innocents in Gaza, the West Bank is full of Nazis,
*  two million Nazis. It is rare, is it not, for a crime and atrocity to be spoken out with such
*  a lack of subtlety by those perpetrating it. And yet this is something which the West, Western
*  leaders, governments are openly facilitating. I'm just wondering just in your thoughts on that
*  kind of just what makes it so striking in that sense. Well, since the Second World War, it is
*  unique. There've been genocides, there've been awful atrocities perpetrated in French Algeria,
*  or Algeria by the French, in Vietnam, in Cambodia, in Iraq, or you name it. There was ethnic cleansing
*  recently in Nagorno-Karabakh, but at least the perpetrators have been trying to hide it,
*  trying to cover it up in a veneer of some humanist endeavor. But here you had the deputy
*  mayor of Jerusalem only the other day in the context of those men that were stripped down to
*  their underpants and treated like cattle. When this gentleman came out and said that
*  if it were up to him, he would have ordered a huge bulldozer to bury them alive.
*  I have never heard a political class while perpetrating genocide being so
*  aptly about exactly what they were doing. And so, I mean, it makes our job of trying to argue that
*  there is a genocide going on simultaneously extremely easy and futile. Because if, as you said,
*  on the world, our world, not the world, but the governments, our governments, our ruling classes
*  are prepared to grant the Israeli government and institutions the right to commit any war crime
*  in the pretext of self-defense, then what is there to say except that, you know, to invoke
*  the Geneva Convention, which is, of course, utterly irrelevant, the moment you have this
*  willingness, especially, I'm really obsessed with the German government, the German political class,
*  including the party of the left, which is refusing to answer a really very simple question
*  that I put to my German comments.
*  We do have a collective guilt over the Holocaust, but how much Palestinian blood is necessary
*  in order to help us wash that guilt off ourselves? The answer is impossible, because
*  by adding crime upon crime, you don't cleanse your conscience, you make it worse.
*  In terms of what it says about the, whatever we call it, the world order governed by Western states,
*  Peter Boehner, who is the editor-in-chief of the larger Jewish Courants, and he responded to
*  this horrendous statistic, nine in ten people in northern Gaza are no longer eating every day,
*  according to the United Nations. And he quoted with, if a US adversary were doing what Israel
*  is doing now in Gaza, liberal hawks in Washington would be calling it a war.
*  If you think back to Kosovo, and the NATO's bombing campaign, then the Soviet Montenegro,
*  it wasn't even a fraction of the crimes. It is striking, isn't it, what this says about
*  the pretenses of the so-called humanitarian hawks, the liberal hawks, which dominated from
*  particularly the 90s onwards. But a lot of the world already thought that was deeply
*  hypocritical and nonsensical, but this is in such striking technicalities.
*  But even back then, Owen, remember they were fashionable and unfashionable victims. So were
*  they victims of ethnic cleansing in Krayna, the region of Croatia where the Serbs lived,
*  and the West simply turned a blind eye to them. And then when there was genuine ethnic cleansing
*  by Milosevic in Kosovo, suddenly all hell broke loose and German warplanes were bombarding
*  a European capital for the first time after the Second World War. I think that in retrospect,
*  and especially in light of this slaughter of Palestinians, which is unprecedented in scale
*  as we speak, we have to come clean. Human rights is a sham. It's an invention by the West.
*  The West, our ruling class, never intend to grant human rights to people who actually need them.
*  They only use them as a cover, a cover-up for their brutal, cynical application of what they
*  consider to be their self-interest in international affairs, in unleashing violence
*  without any impunity or without any restraint, and then using the language of human rights
*  selectively, separating victims between fashionable and unfashionable ones, worthy and unworthy,
*  in a manner which is utterly determined by the interests of our oligarchies.
*  And they would do the same, of course, and they have shown their capacity to do this,
*  not only against brown people, but against our own people. When I remember, very recently I watched
*  Ken Loach's fantastic movie, The Old Oak, and I was reminded of the experience of the
*  minor strike. You were too young to be part of it. I was. I spent eight months going up and down the
*  country. Owen, look, the brutality that we see in faraway places by the West, by the West that
*  supposedly is moved and mobilized by human rights and the concept of human rights, well, that
*  brutality was shown around England, Wales, and Scotland. In 1984, we must not forget that.
*  The United States government will nuke their own people if that's what it takes in order to maintain
*  the rights of the very, very few to rule over the many.
*  I should say with the minor strike, I was actually born in the midst of it in Sheffield.
*  So I was sort of part of the minor strike because I was taken to rallies, Arthur Scargill's rallies,
*  which I think I found quite alarming at the age of three months.
*  Yeah, Awen Madhawi, who's a Palestinian American writer, she writes for the Guardian US, but she
*  said, you know, I do not want to hear Western democracies lecture the rest of the world of
*  human rights ever again. That's how she began her article. I mean, just before I talk about
*  the dynamics, this is quite a basic point. I still think it's worth just stating, which is I've worked
*  in the media now as an interloper on the left for 11 years, 11 years. And I'm not surprised,
*  but I am still shocked about the level of gratuitous dehumanization of Palestinians,
*  that there isn't even a pretense that Palestinian human life has any worth at all. Because
*  what is rightly regarded as an intolerable attack on, I don't know, an Israeli civilian,
*  Israeli child, that there's a limitless amount of death that can be tolerated
*  around 10,000 Palestinian children now, according to pretty credible estimates.
*  I mean, it's rare that it's shown in such technical again, because, you know, in previous
*  invasion of Iraq, you had this humanitarian gloss for what was still a catastrophe. But it's that
*  level of dehumanization that people who regard themselves as moderate and centrist and liberal,
*  and who often grandstand on foreign policy issues, condemn the outrages of the left,
*  supposedly, and yet there isn't even that pretense of Palestinian humanity.
*  Indeed, a couple of points here. Firstly, of course, it is the language. Israeli children,
*  Israeli civilians are slaughtered, Palestinians die. In Israel, you have brutal terrorist attacks.
*  In Gaza, you have explosions. We know all about the language of manipulation, propaganda.
*  But Owen, look, because the details of what's happening in Gaza are so nasty to look at,
*  and so obvious. I mean, there's nothing much I can say. I mean, everybody can...
*  We share the same information, and yet there are people who don't care.
*  And so the big question is, how can their hearts not be broken? How can they continue to legitimize
*  a self-defense, what is clearly mass slaughter? And the answer to that must go back to the concept
*  of terra nullius. You know, when the Brits disembarked in Botany Bay in Australia,
*  they declared the land to be a terra nullius, a land without people. Now, is that not exactly the
*  same dictum as the one on which Zionism is based? A land without the people for a people without
*  the land. The moment you say you're a Zionist, and therefore you support the notion that Palestine
*  was free of people in the same way that the British Empire declared that Australia was free
*  of people. Well, the process of dehumanizing the people who actually live there, because it's not
*  a land free of people, has already been completed. The massacre of five million Aborigines
*  was not a massacre simply because they weren't there. It was terra nullius.
*  And what people are there can very easily, whatever they do, whether they smile, sing,
*  or resist, they can very easily be declared to be human animals. Sometimes subhuman animals,
*  as a deputy mayor of Jerusalem called them very recently.
*  I just, there's lots of people reading this, a wealth and copy of the 100 years war on Palestine
*  by Rashid Kledi, which I think really puts into context the context which is airbrushed out of the
*  Western narrative about Palestine. Just in terms of, I'll throw out, I suppose, just narratives
*  which have dominated the coverage, which is on the 7th of October, there was a
*  horrendous attack by Hamas, which killed huge numbers of innocent civilians that has traumatized
*  Israeli society and therefore there has to be this removal of a murderous terrorist organization.
*  This is obviously a narrative which, it's been talked to death by those who oppose
*  what's happening. But I just want, in terms of now, we're over two months on, how much do you think
*  the attempt to make this the clock began on the 7th of October, how much do you think now that
*  has actually been challenged and we can actually talk about the context which has been erased
*  deliberately? Substantially, in the first couple of weeks after the 7th of October,
*  you just couldn't get heard. I remember Guterres, the secretary general of the United Nations, dared
*  say that after having condemned the atrocities by Hamas against civilians, he added that it didn't
*  happen in a vacuum and the Israeli government condemned him as a criminal, asked for his removal.
*  I noticed that for the first 48 hours, the establishment press in Britain, in continental
*  Europe, in the United States were taking an approach which was quite inimical, quite
*  confrontational towards the secretary general of the United Nations. But
*  5,000, 6,000 dead people later, that has changed, the tide has shifted. You could see that in the
*  United Nations General Assembly yesterday, countries that had supported Israel either by voting
*  against the ceasefire, the call for a ceasefire, or by abstaining, now turned and supported it.
*  So, I hate to say that, but it took a river of blood, of Palestinian blood, to change that tide.
*  Regarding the 7th of October attack, I have personally been vilified because I refused
*  to condemn the attack against the wall and the attempt to demolish it and to drive a wedge through
*  it. In my view, every Palestinian not only has a right, whether they're Hamas or not, it doesn't
*  matter, they have a duty to escape from that prison camp. So, the trick for humanists, for those who
*  despise antisemitism, who are very, very worried that this whole
*  slaughter, massacre, disaster, catastrophe, is going to fuel the fires of antisemitism.
*  The trick, as far as I'm concerned, is on the one hand to defend the right of Palestinians
*  to perform a prison break, while at the same time condemning atrocities against civilians performed
*  by Hamas fighters. I shall never condemn the attempt to bring down that wall. We should all
*  be there bringing it down, making sure that the people of Gaza are released from that wall,
*  and the same thing applies to Sharon's wall or separation wall in the West Bank.
*  There's nothing uglier than that wall, save perhaps for the peace walls in Belfast and other such
*  walls between the United States and Mexico. But on this occasion, I think it's essential to
*  distinguish between the duty of Palestinians to bring that wall down and atrocities against civilians,
*  Israeli or not. But do you think the legacy might be, look, either that wall becomes even more
*  entrenched, but or it is removed, and the only reason it's removed is that Gaza's Palestinian
*  population is removed, that life is made inhospitable. And if you look at the walls
*  in the devastation in northern Gaza, it's not inhabitable anymore. Much of it now, the deliberate
*  flooding that's going on, as well as the total destruction of civilian infrastructure, including
*  the destruction, for example, I mean, you know, the justice building, which contains public records,
*  civil societies being erased by the Israeli war machine. Isn't the danger the legacy will just be
*  either they are more caged than ever in even more catastrophic conditions, or they are ethnically
*  cleansed and driven into the Sinai desert? Honestly, I have no idea. Nobody knows. Anybody
*  who claims to know is either lying or is deluded. But I have to tell you this, that if I were
*  speaking for myself, right, I have no right to generalize from that, but speaking for myself,
*  if I were a Gazan, if I lived in Gaza before the 7th of October, watching the United Arab Emirates,
*  Saudi Arabia, Morocco, other Arab countries, normalizing their relationship with Israel,
*  essentially declaring that the Palestinians in Gaza, but also in the West Bank, were none of their
*  business. Let them quietly die out. Let them quietly be ethnically cleansed. Remember, before
*  the 7th of October, 60% of children in Gaza were malnourished. So there was an engineered
*  humanitarian crisis, which was kept at the level, which would not be on the radar of the
*  Western media, but it would essentially drive the Gazan Palestinians into an early grave.
*  If I were a Gazan, I would want to break out and to hell with it. If it meant my death, if it meant
*  that we would all be exiled as a result, for Gazans, and I've spoken to quite a few of them,
*  the worst fate was what was happening before the 7th of October, which was a slow march to oblivion
*  without the cameras of the world, without you and me discussing this on your show, without the,
*  you know, the Financial Times even leading with stories from Gaza.
*  We need to understand that a people that have been condemned to a slow burning death
*  have a duty to rebel and to hell with it. And I think that's what happened. This is why
*  the vast majority of Gazans, even though their lives have been completely destroyed now,
*  even though they are facing exile in the Sinai, in the middle of the desert,
*  death through disease, through thirst, through hunger, I have little doubt that the vast majority
*  of them do not sit around what fire they've managed to light up or, you know, sitting on
*  bricks in a demolished house saying, oh, what a disaster it was that there was an attempt at
*  a prison break on the 7th of October. In terms of Joe Biden, just hand-wringing, I would describe
*  hand-wringing is a good term to use in the context of what he said this week, which is all of a
*  sudden saying, well, Israel, calm down a bit. You know, almost trying to suggest that perhaps
*  they're going a bit too far. What do you think in terms of, I suppose, not just the context of
*  military aid and the role that plays, but the diplomatic and political cover provided by
*  successive US administrations and by, of course, specifically President Joe Biden over the last
*  few weeks, but obviously throughout his whole career, to be honest?
*  Well, the kindest thing you can say about Joe Biden is that he's pathetic.
*  Because I'm saying the kindest because it's probably untrue.
*  He himself only yesterday declared himself to be a Zionist. To declare yourself to be a Zionist in
*  the middle of this genocide, essentially to invoke what I said before, the dictum, a land
*  without a people, for a people without a land, is essentially to support the genocide, to come out
*  and say, yeah, let the genocide continue, but do it a bit more subtly, please. Do not put me in a
*  difficult position vis-a-vis my own public opinion. That is, I think I'm being very kind calling him
*  pathetic because, actually, this is criminal and he knows exactly what he's doing. So, you know,
*  the only thing I can do in the context of giving him the benefit of the doubt is to say that he's
*  sin-island pathetic, but I don't believe that things are so good for him.
*  No, and actually it's quite striking, isn't it, that the consequences of this, because
*  if you look, obviously, Muslim Americans, Arab Americans, but it's much broader than that.
*  Younger Americans are the first pro-Palestinian generation in history since the foundation of
*  Israel, according to the polling, and a lot of those voters are not going to come out and vote
*  for Joe Biden. And I know what the response of that wing of the Democratic Party will be. It will be,
*  rather, they have two options. They could go, we need to listen to what you're saying here, we need
*  to learn, please tell us your grievances, or we will scream at you for being a moral disgrace.
*  How dare you, you have a duty to come and vote for Biden, and it's your fault if Trump wins,
*  and also we hate you. I mean, that's generally the kind of approach of that way. So, just
*  interesting. I mean, what do you think is going to, I mean, what are the political consequences
*  could well be that Donald Trump wins because of Joe Biden's strategy, if you call it that?
*  You know, Joe Biden and his team, not so much him, but his team, the moment the events of the 7th of
*  October unfolded, they panicked. They panicked because Donald Trump, let us not forget, is
*  Benjamin Netanyahu's bosom mate. So, the number one priority for the Democratic Party apparatchiks
*  was how not to allow Donald Trump to become the great supporter of Netanyahu and the Israeli
*  establishment. So, they became more royalist than the king, more Trumpist than Trump, in
*  advocating for the right of Israel to commit any war crime it pleases in the context of
*  supposedly self-defense. It was that sin. And for them, losing the support of young, more progressive,
*  lefty, socialistic, liberal, whatever you may call them, voters was a necessary evil
*  in their own electoral calculus. Now, as the rivers of blood flow, it is clear that they are
*  now worried that maybe this collateral damage in the progressive vote, of the progressive vote,
*  is becoming too large for them to tolerate. But you know what? To hell with them. I'm really not
*  interested. There is a genocide happening. It's going to stigmatize the whole generation. It's
*  going to stigmatize us, our children. It's something that will be discussed 100 years from now.
*  And Joe Biden's electoral calculus is none of our business, should be none of our business. We
*  shouldn't really care about it. We should treat him with the contempt that he deserves for having,
*  even yesterday in the United Nations General Assembly, vetoed or voted against the very basic
*  idea that when you've got a population with nowhere to go, they've already been displaced
*  10 times, within and without Gaza. You're shooting at them like they're fish in a barrel.
*  Nothing short of a ceasefire at that moment is consistent with the right to call yourself human.
*  I mean, do you think, as you say, so many genocide scholars have come out and said this is
*  genocide. I think the very least people can do is listen to specialists. It's quite interesting.
*  Yesterday, Danny Cohen, who is the former controller of the BBC, wrote an article damning Gary Lineker,
*  who's the most famous sports personality probably in the country, for sharing a video,
*  the video I did with Red Sea Gal, saying it was offensive and factually wrong. And I just thought,
*  who's better positioned to know about genocide? An Israeli American professor of Holocaust and
*  genocide studies or the guy who commissioned Strictly Come Dancing and Poldark? But I mean,
*  do you think that, in terms of, you know, what people are seeing, I have noticed that it is
*  having, just from the correspondence I get, it is politicising a lot of people. Maybe a lot of
*  people before who didn't really know much about Palestine, hadn't particularly engaged in Palestine,
*  or might have had some sympathy but weren't particularly interested. It is having an impact.
*  I'm just interested in your thoughts on that. We've lived through years of tumult and, you know,
*  struggles, defeats, but it is having a big impact, do you not think, amongst particularly a younger
*  generation politicising them? I just wondered, do you think, despite the horrors we're seeing,
*  that we are going to see a much stronger global Palestinian movement than we had before?
*  Maybe, but it's not enough. It's not enough because the speed at which the genocide is proceeding
*  on the ground, in the West Bank, in Jenin, in East Jerusalem, not just in Gaza, is so
*  large, so huge, that whatever the equivalent speed of the build-up of the pro-Palestinian
*  movement amongst the young internationally is simply no match to the events, to the
*  swiftness of malignant processes unfolding on the ground in Palestine.
*  You know, you mentioned, Koan, there are so many fantastic Israelis and Jews from the diaspora
*  who are doing an enormous amount of work in order to make it absolutely clear that nothing of what
*  the Israeli defence force or defence forces are doing in Gaza at the moment can be justified on
*  the basis of ensuring that Jews will never have to face another Holocaust, another pogrom, another
*  anti-Semitic purge. Iris Heffetz, a colleague and friend and comrade of ours of the M25 movement
*  a couple of weeks ago in Berlin, she's an Israeli Jew, she's a psychoanalyst who lives in Berlin,
*  she walked onto a square, a city square in Berlin, close to her home with a placard,
*  which actually said a banner, which she had written herself, on her own, without anybody next to her,
*  a single woman in her 50s walking on the street with a banner which read, as an Israeli and as a
*  Jew, stop the slaughter in Gaza. She was arrested by a white German policeman for anti-Semitism
*  and the rest of the people around did nothing to protect her, did nothing to impede that white
*  German policeman from arresting this Jewish woman for saying the obvious on behalf of Jews.
*  Now maybe that act by Iris, you know, converted 10, 20 people who saw that
*  episode unfold from the sidelines, but oh and it's not enough, it's not enough, let's not try to
*  find solace in the small mercies of a few conversions here and there.
*  Well, Bleeck, just a few other things because I know how busy you are. So, just some questions
*  because I posted on Patreon that I was interviewing you and some people are interested in international
*  institutions I suppose, like Anoop Kairat, how do you get the European Union to change tack and face
*  the reality of genocide in Gaza, a force of breakup and foreign policy positions because of the
*  members, between the members to demolish any EU support narrative. I think it's notable that the EU's
*  constituent governments have shifted quite dramatically to the right over the last few
*  years in particular, but also David 74, the UN, he says it's been shown to be an effectual,
*  is there any reform because it was the UN everybody capable of affecting change, it's just people
*  just interested in these international institutions, I just wondered what you think and obviously on the
*  EU that's something you have particular interest in. Well the only way of getting other governments
*  in Europe is by threatening their power. So there's a European Parliament election happening in June,
*  we are going to be running, the Democracy in Europe movement we are going to run with a campaign of
*  peacemaking in Ukraine, in Gaza, in Yemen, in Kashmir, with a campaign for a basic income
*  because let us not forget that there is also a war against the weak Europeans across Europe,
*  inequality has reached a level which is bordering on the misanthropic.
*  We need to counter the ultra-right and the authoritarian establishment which is also
*  Zionist at the same time as being anti-welcome class within the European Union, it's a total order,
*  but there's no alternative to that. As for the United Nations, you know people dismiss the United
*  Nations as a talking shop, well it's important to have a talking shop because what happened in the
*  General Assembly yesterday, there was a vote and the vast majority of countries around the world
*  voted for a ceasefire and created the circumstances to expose the duplicity and complicity of the
*  United States that voted against and of course of the United Kingdom that abstained dishonorably
*  and in a cowardly fashion, that's the role of the United Nations, you know more than a hundred people
*  working for the United Nations have been killed in Gaza, their death means something, their death
*  is going to signal to the rest of the world that humanity is being tested in Gaza, that is a
*  sufficient contribution by the United Nations, the rest is up to us, we need to organize in our
*  countries and run campaigns and running elections and contest elections in order to scare the living
*  daylights out of our governments that if they could not change tack on this and the genocide
*  which is being perpetrated as we speak, we will overthrow them through the ballot box.
*  I mean just finally, I mean this I suppose maybe the answer to this is just things are bleak and
*  that's how things are, but you know the conclusion one could just draw is the Palestinians are
*  going to suffer a gruesome fate which will in practice mean the permanent ending of any attempt
*  of nationhood in a particularly murderous fashion which will destroy their society, I mean this is
*  why people talk obviously about genocide, that the very notion of being a Palestinian
*  will be murderously ended as an identity in the future, I mean what is there any hope, I mean can
*  you see any prospects not least because the problem in Israel is you've had such a dramatic
*  shift there to the right, the peace movement there is on its knees, it's becoming an increasingly
*  overtly authoritarian even on its own terms within Israeli society let alone you know its occupation,
*  an authoritarian undemocratic system, what is there any hope of any description, what do you think the
*  long-term implications will be because a lot of the world has just looked at this horror and
*  atrocity and I think they're drawing some pretty grim conclusions about the nature of the world in
*  which they live. There is hope, hope never dies as long as we are alive, as long as one single person
*  is alive, as long as one pretty Palestinian is alive. Look you know where I'm getting hope from?
*  From within Israel because yes the peace movement has died, the liberal party has become putrid
*  and irrelevant but when you have somebody like Tamir Pardo who was handpicked by Benjamin Netanyahu
*  in 2011 to lead Mossad, Mossad, don't need to add anything, Mossad and he comes out in support of
*  Palestinian rights to condemn that Israel for imposing a state of apartheid,
*  all those young men and some women in the Israeli army now who are who have blood on their heads in
*  Gaza, I refuse to believe that they are happy with what they are doing. I think the next peace movement
*  will come out of them who will come back and at some point will tell their own people that you know
*  what you did in Gaza was a crime against humanity that would feel very ashamed of
*  and also you know the Palestinians, I will say something that may sound callous but I'm saying
*  it in the nicest possible way, they're very hard to kill, they have a remarkable staying power,
*  they are killing a lot of them but with every one child that they kill they create 10 militants and
*  I hope that those militants will be humanists, that they will not become what the West calls
*  terrorists. So between the young soldiers, Israeli soldiers who will go back and reflect on what they
*  have been doing in Gaza and the new militants that are springing up everywhere in the West Bank,
*  in East Jerusalem, in Gaza, I want to hang on for dear life to this hope that they will be from the
*  river to the sea and I made this point provocatively from the river to the bloody sea, there will be
*  a movement for granting equal human rights to every single person between the river and the sea
*  independently of what language they speak, what God they worship, I personally hope they all become
*  atheists because I'm one and then we can decide about borders, we can decide about
*  municipalities, about states and all that but we need to maintain the hope that in the end
*  freedom and human rights, the very human rights that the West is invoking in order to cancel,
*  nevertheless they have an intrinsic value that is consistent with what is innate in human nature
*  and we will manage to overcome. Good, a hopeful place to end, I was concerned we might never
*  reach it but as I do, I always feel more hopeful when I speak to you guys so it's good to have a
*  therapy session as well as an interview but it's good to be able to put this in the horror which
*  we're seeing every day in its broader context and to talk about possible hope for the future.
*  For those watching or listening please like and subscribe but a huge thank you very much
*  to the brilliant Yanis as ever for sharing his wisdom and his thoughts, thank you Yanis.
*  Thank you.
