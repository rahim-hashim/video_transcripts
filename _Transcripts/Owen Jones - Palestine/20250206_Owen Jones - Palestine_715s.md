# Joe Biden Fans' VILE Crowing Over Trump's Gaza Ethnic Cleansing Demand
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM)
*  One of the most grotesque spectacles of the past few days hasn't come from Trump supporters, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=0.0s)]
*  from the loud and proud, MAGA cat-wearing proto-fascists, but rather from the Democrats, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  specifically cheerleaders of Joe Biden and his defeated Vice President Kamala Harris. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=11.76s)]
*  In response to Donald Trump's proposal to murderously expel the surviving Palestinian [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=17.92s)]
*  population of Gaza, many of these so-called centrists have decided not to focus on horror, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=23.44s)]
*  and outrage at an inherently genocidal proposition, they've taken a rather different tack, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=30.0s)]
*  by instead crowing. They see this as a moment to score settle, to use this as an opportunity [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=36.88s)]
*  to face down those who objected to Joe Biden's administration arming and facilitating Israel's [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  genocidal rampage. Now their mantra goes a bit like this, you turned on Biden and Harris, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=51.04s)]
*  now look what you've got. How's it worked out for your precious Palestinian people [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=57.12s)]
*  now the Democrats have been turfed out of office? Now just to be clear, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=61.76s)]
*  both Trump and Biden are war criminals who deserve to go to jail. As a very citizen, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=65.36s)]
*  I'm relieved not to have been placed in the impossible situation of so many US voters, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=70.64s)]
*  with both presidential candidates committing to facilitating Israel's genocidal rampage. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=75.36s)]
*  I don't believe for one moment that the crowing champions of the Democratic Party establishment [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=82.4s)]
*  have any meaningful care for the future of the Palestinian people, look what their leaders did [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=87.76s)]
*  to the Palestinian people. Let's just start shall we with Julia Ioff, the founding partner [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  and Washington correspondent of PUC News. Now she screenshotted a New York Times news alert [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=99.12s)]
*  about Trump's ethnic cleansing threat, whatever you want to call it, and she wrote the following, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=104.72s)]
*  hope everyone is happy now they got Genocide Joe out of office. Now you could just imagine the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=109.6s)]
*  thrill she got when she typed that, more disturbingly I'd ask, did she actually get a thrill from [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=115.19999999999999s)]
*  hearing about Trump's plan? Is she feeling the emotion of delight? Because she feels the more [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=120.24s)]
*  the Palestinian people now suffer, the more she can dunk on those hated critics of the Democratic [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=125.28s)]
*  Party establishment. Now firstly, Julia, Genocide Joe was called Genocide Joe, which you're clearly [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=131.6s)]
*  mocking because he provided vast sums of arms to Israel, in fact nearly $23 billion worth in the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=136.72s)]
*  first year. Indeed that comes on top by the way of all the vast sums of US applied weapons [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=143.92s)]
*  that Israel already had, and he did that in order to help Israel wipe Gaza from the face of the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=149.2s)]
*  earth, exterminate its people and in some commit genocide. Genocide Joe, the clue truly is in the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=154.56s)]
*  name. Now when two of his government agencies told him last April that Israel was deliberately [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=161.04s)]
*  preventing aid from getting to the desperate people of Gaza, his administration was legally [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=165.6s)]
*  obliged under US law to immediately stop providing weapons to Israel. Guess what Biden did? You guessed [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=170.32s)]
*  it Julia, he kept those weapons flowing. Now aside from the fact that it was the Democratic [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=178.0s)]
*  Party establishment which got Genocide Joe out of office, largely because they thought he wasn't [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  really with us anymore if you get what I'm saying, what he does seem to be conceding, and we'll come [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=188.88s)]
*  on to this is that Gaza actually did play a role in Harris's defeat, which sounds like an argument [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=193.36s)]
*  for her listening to those who said that maybe Harris should have broken from Biden's administration [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=198.08s)]
*  on the issue. Maybe they were right. Usually in a democracy when a politician loses, they are [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=206.0s)]
*  supposed to be held themselves accountable for their failure rather than blaming the voters, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=211.12s)]
*  which is of course what you are seeking to do. Then there's Darnan Milbank in the Washington [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  Post, he is the classic Washington insider. Now I struggled to find this man's previous concern [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=220.88s)]
*  for the Palestinian people, there is something of a theme here. The only column before this [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=225.44s)]
*  week I could find on the issue was from last May, headlined, To the Gaza protesters helping [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=229.12s)]
*  to elect Trump, give it a rest. Ah yes, that definitely sounds like a column written in good [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=234.4s)]
*  faith, in just the style you would adopt if you were sincerely intending to win people over. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=239.04s)]
*  I had to scan through several paragraphs until he actually said something about Palestine, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=244.64s)]
*  he said, their frustration, the protesters, with the President's support for Israel is understandable, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  but they were simply helping to elect Trump. You see for him, the hideous suffering of the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=253.36s)]
*  Palestinian people, like everything else, was relegated to the electoral arithmetic of the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=256.88s)]
*  United States. Now his column yesterday was headlined, From the River to the Sea, Palestine [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=262.64s)]
*  will be … abolished. How droll, how amusing, reducing the genocide of a people to a sarcastic [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=268.32s)]
*  headline. It does underline, does it not, the total dehumanisation of the Palestinian people, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=275.04s)]
*  would other victims of mass slaughter be talked about in this whimsical way? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  His column opens like this, Genocide Joe, in quotes, never looked so good. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=284.32s)]
*  Gaza peace protesters rallied Americans by the hundreds of thousands to oppose President Joe [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=289.92s)]
*  Biden and vote uncommitted in democratic primaries. They heckled Vice President Kamala [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=294.24s)]
*  Harrison, disrupting her events. On election day, Donald Trump prevailed in the majority Arab town [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=299.04s)]
*  of Dearborn, Michigan, and across the country many young voters stayed home or even voted for Trump, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=303.68s)]
*  likely because, in part, they were disenchanted that the Biden administration [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=308.88s)]
*  had been insufficiently tough on Israel. How's that working out now? He says. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=313.2s)]
*  Let's just address this, shall we? Even if you don't accept genocide is taking place, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=319.84000000000003s)]
*  well you're wrong, but if you don't, you must accept it's a legitimate position. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=325.12s)]
*  Given there is a consensus on the issue ranging from preeminent scholars such as Omar Batov, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=329.52s)]
*  the Israeli American Professor of Genocide and Holocaust Studies to human rights organisations [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=334.8s)]
*  like Human Rights, sorry, like Amnesty International. Now you must accept that these people know what [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=339.6s)]
*  they're talking about, that loads of preeminent genocide scholars think genocide is happening. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=345.44s)]
*  You don't think they're cranks, I would imagine. You don't think Omar Batov's a crank. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=348.8s)]
*  He's literally one of the most esteemed genocide scholars on earth. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=352.08s)]
*  Polling shows that most democratic voters believed Israel is indeed committing genocide. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=358.56s)]
*  So my question to you Diana is, and those like you, do you accept, at the very least, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=365.76s)]
*  that voting for a candidate you believe is facilitating genocide presents a moral dilemma? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=370.96s)]
*  If I asked you in the abstract, would you ever vote for a presidential candidate you knew was [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=376.48s)]
*  facilitating genocide? What would you say? Would you answer that without blinking? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=380.64s)]
*  Depends on the circumstances? Before all of this? Before Israel's genocide? Would you have said [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=384.24s)]
*  that? Or would you have said absolutely not? Would you? Be honest. What if what had happened [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=389.2s)]
*  to Gaza had happened to Israel? What if Israel had been reduced to an apocalyptic wasteland, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=394.48s)]
*  its hospitals deliberately destroyed, its people deliberately starved, and countless tens or indeed [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=399.28000000000003s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of Jewish Israelis, mostly women and children, had been slaughtered? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=404.24s)]
*  And what if this had all been armed and facilitated by the President of the United States? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=409.04s)]
*  If many Jewish American voters find it rather difficult to vote for a candidate in such [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=413.04s)]
*  circumstances, would you blame them? Would you mock them? As you do here, be honest, if not with me, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=417.36s)]
*  than with yourself. What's so obscene is you must know that the annihilation of Gaza happened under [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=424.0s)]
*  and indeed was facilitated by Biden. When Trump refers to the horrors of Gaza today, which he [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=429.6s)]
*  uses as a justification for his ethnic cleansing, on the point about the horrors, is he not objectively [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=434.96000000000004s)]
*  correct? How did they happen? Under who? How are they allowed? As My Rev Zonshine, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=440.4s)]
*  an Israeli analyst I highly rate puts it, it's amazing how Trump's statement is at once the most [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=446.56s)]
*  dehumanizing and destabilizing statement you can make about Palestinians and at the same time holds [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=451.2s)]
*  more humanity than Biden ever had. And this is why this is so perverse. There is more recognition [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=456.96s)]
*  from Donald Trump of the utter depravity that has been unleashed by Israel upon the people of Gaza [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=462.47999999999996s)]
*  than there is from these democratic vultures. Let's carry on, shall we? Simone D. Sanders Townsend, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=467.76s)]
*  who co-hosts a show on MSBC, no doubt intended a strong side-eye when she tweeted, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=473.76s)]
*  I think now it's very appropriate to reiterate that elections have consequences. As one progressive [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=479.84s)]
*  activist responded, so true. We voted for Biden and Harrison in 2020 and they committed genocide. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=486.08s)]
*  Seriously, there is endless amounts of this. Accounts supporting the democratic establishment [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=491.28s)]
*  get vast numbers of retweets and likes by being terribly sassy. One tweets alongside a picture of [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=495.52s)]
*  a smiling Kamala Harris. How's that uncommitted vote going for you? Another quote tweets Donald [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=501.84s)]
*  Trump's ethnic cleansing announcement with a picture of a smiling Kamala Harris with a hands [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=506.96s)]
*  out stretch and adds no less than 9 laughing emojis. I'm going to say it, these people are, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=511.12s)]
*  morally speaking, no better than MAGA supporters, in some cases even worse. Indeed, many democratic [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=516.72s)]
*  vultures believe that Trump supporters need to be held to account themselves. Trump voters need [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=522.4s)]
*  to be held to account, that's their view. Pointing out that at the very least, they must have chosen [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=527.84s)]
*  to vote for him, knowing his history of gratuitous racism, bile, his sexual misconduct, his threats [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=531.4399999999999s)]
*  to democracy. What about voting for a candidate despite them facilitating genocide and knowing [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=537.76s)]
*  they're facilitating genocide? Is there any question of accountability there? Now, a poll [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=542.48s)]
*  released in January conducted by YouGov for the IMEU policy project concluded, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=547.52s)]
*  Vice President Harris lost votes because of the Biden administration's support for Israel's [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=552.72s)]
*  genocide of Palestinians in Gaza. It found that of those who voted for Biden in 2020 and cast a [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=558.0799999999999s)]
*  ballot for someone else, 29% did so because of ending Israel's violence in Gaza. That was the [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=564.3199999999999s)]
*  top reason. The economy came in at 24%, Medicare and Social Security at 12%, but in many key [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=569.52s)]
*  battleground states like Arizona, Michigan and Wisconsin, the figure on the question of Gaza was [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=575.2s)]
*  even higher. By a 3-1 margin, 2020, Biden voters who did not vote for Harris this time said they [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=581.44s)]
*  would have been more likely to do so if she had pledged to break from President Biden's policy [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=588.5600000000001s)]
*  towards Gaza by promising to withhold additional weapons to Israel, rather than less likely. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=594.32s)]
*  Actions. Consequences. Now sure, you can choose to blame the voters, or you could, maybe, choose [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=601.6s)]
*  to hold the Democratic party establishment to account for arming and facilitating one of the [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=609.1999999999999s)]
*  most depraved crimes of our age. Maybe, just maybe, here's the conclusion. Maybe voters should be put [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=614.08s)]
*  in this situation. Maybe it's a damning indictment of American democracy. Maybe voters shouldn't have [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=619.92s)]
*  to suffer the eternal moral stain of having voted for a candidate they believe is literally [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=624.8s)]
*  complicit in genocide because it's the lesser evil. What are we even doing here? We're talking [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=629.6s)]
*  about facilitating genocide. Even discussing the concept of a lesser evil in this context is what? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=635.28s)]
*  That Trump is a racist demagogue, a menace to an already profoundly compromised US democracy, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=642.64s)]
*  and an accomplice to Israel's genocide. All of that is without question. But we live in an age [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNPymD8wlM&t=649.44s)]
