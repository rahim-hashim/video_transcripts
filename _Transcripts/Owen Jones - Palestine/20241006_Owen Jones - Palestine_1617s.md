# Israel's Lebanon MASSACRE Could Be STOPPED By US In Moments - w. Beirut Professor Karim Makdisi
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ6tDHnkGXA)
*  Now, we've had a year of Israel's genocidal onslaught against Gaza. Now, there has been
*  over the course of that year, Lebanon has been very much involved. We've seen up to
*  this escalation, bombings, military onslaughts against Lebanon, significant numbers of Lebanese
*  people have already been killed over the last year. But clearly, we've had a catastrophic
*  escalation in terms of an invasion in Lebanon, which many media outlets refuse to call it,
*  as well as an attack on Beirut. Now, I'm really delighted to be joined by Karim Makhtisi,
*  who is the Associate Professor of International Politics at the American University of Beirut.
*  And he's the co-host of, I have to say, a podcast many people talk about. It's become
*  a must-listen to so many people. Makhtisi Streets, which he is the co-host of. Karim,
*  firstly, thanks so much for joining us. It's such a difficult time. Also, you put with our
*  technical difficulties. But we finally see you, which is great. But you're in Paris at the moment,
*  just to clarify. I just want to just ask you firstly, I mean, this is incredibly difficult.
*  There's a huge amount of emotional labor here involved, doesn't there? I'm asking you to talk
*  about something, world events, horrors, but this is your city. This is your country. Can you just
*  tell us in a moment what's it like having to talk, just what's going through you and kind of how
*  that reflects what's happening through the minds of so many Lebanese people right now?
*  Yeah, I think, thank you for having me. I think it's an extraordinarily difficult moment. The
*  humanitarian situation, just to start with the humanitarian situation, as you know, there's over
*  a million people that have been displaced. A lot of them are in Beirut. A large chunk of them, of
*  these displaced are in Beirut and in the neighborhood where, you know, personally, you know,
*  where I live, and where my family lives, you know, where the university is, there's a lot of people
*  there. The government, as you know, probably since 2019 collapsed, the state basically collapsed at
*  the time. It's in a bankrupt, there's really nothing going on. So most of the time, it's personal,
*  you know, community initiatives of people trying to deal with some of the displaced, trying to host
*  them, trying to put them in flats, trying to feed them, you know, blankets, all this kind of thing.
*  And it's an extremely, extremely difficult moment, dispiriting moment, particularly since, as we see
*  every day and especially every night, these massive attacks that are increasing, in fact,
*  in Beirut and, you know, increasingly into not just what's called the Dahei, the suburbs of Beirut,
*  but also now increasingly into more central Beirut. And we see more and more civilian
*  destruction, more and more civilian targets being deliberately hit. And it doesn't really
*  matter what the mainstream media is saying, they're very much deliberately being hit.
*  It's an incredible form of terrorism at every level. And it has been that for a long time. In
*  fact, it's been like that my entire life. I mean, I grew up in the civil war in Lebanon, but also,
*  you know, went through the Israeli invasions, you know, especially in 1982, and then the massive
*  invasion in 2006. So in this sense, you know, many of us have been through these kinds of
*  invasions before, but this is by all means the biggest, the worst, and the most, just the most,
*  the cruelest in some ways. 2006 was very, very bad, but this is even crueler. And it doesn't look
*  like this any way that it's going to stop anytime soon. So people are very dispirited. There's,
*  on the other hand, you know, if one wants to find positive things, there's a lot of solidarity,
*  unlike what the Israelis like, unlike what the Israelis want, rather than mass kind of
*  sectarian and kind of, you know, communal and social fighting, there's actually a lot more
*  solidarity in all the areas and a lot more, as I said, kind of community support. There's a lot
*  of understanding. And I would even say that even those that are under a considerable number of kind
*  of political, let's say opponents, or those that don't like Hezbollah as a political party, or what
*  it did in Syria, or what is what's done in Lebanon, even those people in general at the humanitarian
*  level, at the human level, have been very sympathetic and have been doing what they can,
*  you know, what each person trying to do, what they can do to support these people. So having said that,
*  that's a, that's, it's an incredibly difficult moment. And the kinds of attacks that are happening
*  in Beirut, but not just Beirut, Beirut is in the news, of course, but you have Saidan, you have
*  Sur, Tyre, you have Baalbek, you have, you know, all the villages and towns across the south.
*  And if you see, if you see a map, it just of the, there's a lot of people doing these nice graphics,
*  if you see these maps of evacuation orders. So now what the Israelis are doing, like they did in Gaza,
*  is they, they send every single day, they send these little maps that say, okay, in neighborhood
*  123, this is true of Beirut, but it's also true in the south, neighborhoods 1234, you know,
*  evacuate now. And then sometimes they'll hit very, you know, within half an hour or something. And
*  we're talking about things they release on Twitter and social media in English, you know, so, and then
*  of course they hit. So they're clearing out vast chunks of the south, large chunks now increasingly
*  on Beirut itself. And as I said, you know, there's a lot of uncertainty and it's not clear where,
*  where we're going in this. I mean, you mentioned this, an area of Beirut called Dahi,
*  and I, and you've talked about the 2006 invasion. The reason I bring that up is some may have heard
*  of Dahi doctrine developed in the 2006 war, Israeli war in Lebanon, which involves attacking
*  civilian infrastructure in order to try and build, to get them to turn against Hezbollah,
*  and using violence for political ends against civilians, terrorism, which is what other people
*  describe it. I mean, do you think that Dahi doctrine is in place? Is that what we're
*  seeing here, witnessing? Yes. You know, yes, the Dahi doctrine is something that kind of comes in
*  a lot. And as you said, basically it gives the Israelis some itself there, you know, this is
*  their doctrine. So they get to basically hit any civilian area or target where they will claim
*  there's some kind of military target. So they can destroy, in this case, as happened in 2006,
*  they destroyed the entirety of the Dahi, these suburbs where, just remind viewers and listeners
*  that Dahi is not some, you know, place, some kind of industrial area where the nobody lives. It's
*  one of the most densely populated civilian areas. So while there are Hezbollah offices and there are
*  the media and there's, you know, various things, it's an extremely densely populated area with
*  hundreds of thousands of people live. From lower class to middle class, and it's not a, you know,
*  it's quite a diverse place as well. So that's important to kind of note that. But the point of
*  this is that, yes, they give themselves this idea of the Dahi doctrine, they get to destroy. So when
*  they say, well, we're killing this commander, or we're killing this person, that person, this
*  security person, the other person, they're taking down buildings. They're taking down not just one
*  building, but several buildings at a time. When they assassinated the Hezbollah secretary general,
*  Sayyid Nasrallah, they hit over 80 tons of bunker busting missiles to, they took out an entire
*  neighborhood and killed quite an incinerated a lot of people along the way. So this is the kind of
*  thing that they're doing. But I would just point out one other thing. So my critique in the sense
*  of all those who talk about the Dahi doctrine, it's somehow as though this is not Israeli policy
*  since 1948. It's always been like that. I mean, Israel was created at a genocide, the Nakba in 1948,
*  47, 48. And that continues all the way till now to the Gaza genocide, to the 2006 war in the Dahi,
*  to end the South Lebanon, to this war where they're hitting not just the Dahi, not just the South,
*  but as I said, in the Bekaa, in the Baalbek, in the North, just about all parts of Lebanon.
*  So they give themselves the right to attack civilians and civilian infrastructure,
*  and then come up with flimsy excuses about who's there and what kind of military structure is there.
*  I'll give you one example, if you want, which is just last night, there was an absolute
*  massive bombardment in which several buildings in central Beirut were hit. And then immediately
*  the Israelis, as they do, claimed that there was a major Hezbollah figure, Hisham Safiuddin,
*  whose some would say might be taking over from Sayyid Nasrallah, although they haven't declared
*  anybody yet, but that's what Israelis say. And then when it was clear that he wasn't there,
*  they immediately, oh, no, no, this was a security, there was a security meeting. And so therefore,
*  it's okay, that's all right, we get to kill all these people anyway, because we just decided that
*  there's a big security meeting. So that's okay. So we get to hit civilians. But as I said, my own
*  personal entire life, the Israelis have been hitting civilian targets. They did so in the
*  Israeli invasion in 1982, the siege of Beirut. They've done so in all the wars and all their
*  incursions and all their attacks, to say nothing of Palestine, to say nothing of the West Bank and
*  Gaza and other areas. I mean, you mentioned there the question of, I guess, sectarianism,
*  and that's how it's kind of, you know, and we've seen a lot of that in the coverage. And obviously,
*  the Israeli state itself, its official mantra is, I was not with Lebanon, it's specifically with
*  Hezbollah. And those are two separate questions. But I mean, what's your thought just in terms of
*  how things are being portrayed? It's about firstly, the sectarian divisions. So, you know, much of
*  Lebanon is, you know, the idea is they would be sympathetic. And but also that the Israeli
*  mantra that we're focused here on, our quarrel is with Hezbollah, not with the Lebanese people.
*  Right. Yeah, I mean, that's a good question. That really is, you know, it's actually very,
*  very complex. But, you know, if I could say a couple of things, it would be in its own kind
*  of logic, you know, Israel is a apartheid state, it's a textbook apartheid state. So even in their
*  attacking, even in their military logic, they use apartheid. They're attacking what they claim
*  is Hezbollah, but actually we're talking about the entire Shia areas. So in south Lebanon,
*  in the Bekaa, Baalbek, and in the so-called, you know, Dahi, where they keep saying it's a
*  Hezbollah stronghold. But as I said, it's a dense civilian population. So their idea is very clear,
*  which is to destroy as much as possible of the entire, you know, Shia community,
*  civilian infrastructure, create what is now a million displaced, mostly Shia, from south
*  Lebanon, from the Bekaa, from other areas, from the Dahi, into different parts of Beirut, and create
*  sort of some kind of sectarian troubles as all these people kind of go into other areas,
*  you know, destitute, no money, had to leave their houses very, very quickly. As I said, in some cases,
*  in a matter of minutes, they just had to pick up and rush out before their buildings get taken down
*  or they get, you know, destroyed. So their idea is, but they've been doing this, again, ever since
*  I can remember. They did this, this was explicit in, for example, in the early 90s, in 1993, in 1996,
*  when the resistance was operating in south Lebanon and quite effectively against Israeli occupation.
*  Remember, Israel was occupying Lebanon from 1982 until the year 2000. So Hezbollah and other
*  resistance groups were fighting them on inoccupied Lebanese territory. And as they were gaining
*  and becoming more effective in the 1990s, Hezbollah, the Israelis would kind of increase
*  their attacks. And there were two major incursions in the early 90s, 93 and then 1996, and very
*  destructive. Of course, they killed, they wounded, etc. And they hit infrastructure. But one of the
*  things they kept saying was, we want to kind of create this displacement and then create
*  sectarian tensions, which in turn will put huge pressure on Hezbollah, which in turn will kind of,
*  you know, just make them much less effective and force them to kind of stand down. So they're doing
*  this now, but on steroids. They're doing this now on steroids. And the idea is they can claim,
*  well, we're just hitting Hezbollah, but that effectively means we're killing every single
*  Shia and anybody that is living in Shia, supposedly Shia majority kind of areas. But even that is
*  going to keep on increasing beyond that. So that's clear. We know the pattern from Gaza. We know the
*  pattern from other Lebanese wars. They will go after every civilian. They'll go after, they'll
*  terrorize every single neighborhood, and they'll keep on expanding. I mean, we know, I mean, the
*  last, the Israeli invasion of Russia from 1982 onwards, those are the conditions which Hezbollah
*  emerged. What do you think the Israeli strategy is this time? I mean, you've had Israeli politicians
*  openly discuss a de facto, well, they talk about a border zone. What they mean there is the
*  ethnic cleansing, the violent removal of the people living there. I mean, do you think, I mean,
*  it seems almost unlikely that they would want to repeat what happened last time, which suggests
*  something far more, well, sinister is the wrong word. I mean, what do you think they're planning
*  based on their behavior as of yet? Yeah, no, it's a great question. And I think there's a couple of
*  things. First, I think a context, the Israelis for over 100 years, before there was an Israeli state,
*  the Zionist delegation in after World War I came and tried to get the British to push the French
*  so that the border between Palestine at the time and Lebanon would be at the Litani River.
*  So they knew they wanted the economic and the water resources that are quite plentiful in
*  South Lebanon. And so since then, they've been trying to either annex, occupy, more recently,
*  demilitarize. And so there's a long, long history of this. So there's that. The other part is to try
*  to create a control over South Lebanon in a way that they tried in 1982, for example,
*  and they failed in 2006. So in 1982, what they were able to impose was a president. They forced
*  a presidential election that happened at the time with Bashar al-Jumein, where they forced the
*  parliament to meet under occupation to elect the president who was, before he even became, while
*  he was still president elect, was then assassinated. And then there was a treaty that was signed
*  by the then-next president in 1983, which is a kind of infamous treaty. That was basically a
*  treaty of surrender, which basically would give the Israelis what they wanted in South Lebanon
*  and install, let's say, if you want to be generous, a friendly government in Lebanon.
*  And you can think about the model of the Palestinian Authority. So the idea now,
*  in 2006, they wanted to do the same thing, but it failed because Hezbollah was quite effective
*  in their fighting, much more so than the Israelis and the Americans who were pushing the Israelis.
*  At the time with George W. Bush, and they wanted to kind of pacify Lebanon, pacify Hezbollah,
*  just after the Iraq war, on their way to Syria and then ultimately to Iran. And by the way,
*  this is continuing now. So Hezbollah defeated them in South Lebanon. So that whole plan
*  to go from Iraq all the way to Iran via Lebanon and Syria failed in South Lebanon,
*  and because of Hezbollah, in 2006. So now this plan has kind of been revived.
*  What I see is that Netanyahu and the Israelis have become now kind of, let's say, drunk on their own
*  power and their own kind of tactical successes from these pager, what they love to describe as
*  kind of James Bondian kind of things, but really macabre, kind of evil, maiming tactics and trying
*  to basically pure terrorism and hitting and the assassinations, this kind of thing, a lot of
*  tactical successes, especially the assassinations that even Hezbollah kind of concedes are tactical
*  successes. But the idea that Netanyahu I think now has is to not only try to demilitarize South
*  Lebanon, that's been their long goal, and that's embodied, what they say is embodied in the UN
*  Security Council Resolution 1701 that was convened after the 2006 war, but to try to do this by force.
*  So to disarm Hezbollah, to defeat it, because you can't disarm them without totally defeating them.
*  So to disarm and create a demilitarized zone, what I think that won't even be enough at this
*  point, I think if Hezbollah is defeated, they'll not only disarm anybody that's in that area, they
*  will I think occupy at least five, 10 kilometers into South Lebanon. You hear all these crazy
*  settlers that are now trying to kind of talk about resettling, or as they say, resettling
*  South Lebanon, it's promised to them as part of greater Israel. And while these are fringe
*  people and really cuckoo people, the way the Israeli state works, you need to take them seriously
*  at this point, you know. So I think they've always had their eye on South Lebanon. I think anybody
*  that knows the way the Israelis work will understand that they do not understand treaties or just
*  stopping. They keep on going, they keep going, and they keep going. So if Hezbollah loses,
*  then South Lebanon is lost. And I think that's the idea, one way or the other, whether it's occupation
*  or demilitarization. And the idea that the Americans have had since 2006, and the Brits, by the way,
*  the UK is very much part of this, is to kind of turn the Lebanese army into sort of like the
*  Palestinian Authority, you know, turn the Lebanese army into a local kind of anti-terrorist unit that
*  would be opposed to Hezbollah or any other kind of forces that might go against the kind of British,
*  American, Israeli plan. They've not been able to do this. The Lebanese army remains where it is and
*  remains quite ineffective, symbolically important, but ineffective militarily.
*  Just one final question. I mean, you've talked about the triumphalism of the Israeli state after,
*  you know, the pager terrorist attacks, and I'm actually using the language there of the former
*  head of the CIA, but also, you know, the assassination, well, I say the assassination
*  of the Secretary General Hezbollah, but we also mean the mass slaughter of countless Lebanese
*  civilians, which accompanied it, of course. But the role of the United States is crucial for the
*  underpinning of Israeli triumphalism. I just want your thoughts on that in terms of, you know,
*  we've had occasionally, you get hand rigging from the US, and this isn't to let them off the hook,
*  by the way, if anything makes it worse. It's not actually in their interest for this escalation at
*  the time, but they carry on providing the arms, the weapons, the aid that Israel needs to continue.
*  So I just want your final thoughts, really, on the role of the US government and administration
*  as it hand rings and continues to arm Israel in its onslaughts.
*  Yeah, full partnership. Full partnership. So I think for the first several months when
*  the Israelis with American support were pulverizing Gaza, committing genocide in Gaza,
*  with total full American support and weapons, without which, and it's so important to keep
*  reminding ourselves, without these American weapons and Germans at the beginning, the Israelis
*  would not be able to do anything. So this is not this Israeli bravado. This is all American weapons,
*  all American support. If America today stops, Israelis will have to stop almost instantaneously,
*  because they simply won't have the weapons or the ammunition to kind of continue, let alone the
*  diplomatic support. So they're in full support. What happened, I think, you know, for the first
*  several months while the Gaza genocide was taking place, I do think that the Americans were putting
*  a certain kinds of restraint on Netanyahu, telling him, go ahead, kill as many people,
*  Palestinians as you want in Gaza, especially, but you cannot expand beyond a certain amount in
*  South Lebanon, and you certainly can't extend regionally to Iran. That's, you know, we don't
*  want that. When Netanyahu went, I think in July, to the United States, and this kind of, you know,
*  remember the obscene standing ovation at Congress, he came back, as soon as he came back from that
*  trip, and by the way, it wasn't just the politicians in the Congress, etc., it was also
*  all the big social media people, the corporate media, all the, so it wasn't just politicians.
*  That's very important, since you work in the media, you know, much better than me, but there was
*  very clear meetings that took place in order, at the time, up until that July moment, that's when
*  Israel was being portrayed, was very clear that their image on social media, etc., across the
*  world, the global public opinion, the protests on US and UK and other kind of campuses, the South
*  African case at the ICJ, the International Criminal Court, all of that stuff was putting
*  huge pressure on the Israelis. Suddenly, when they, when he came back, the pager stuff begins,
*  the assassinations begin, the massive kind of switch in media portrayal really also starts to
*  kind of be pushed, you know, what Elon Musk on Twitter, all these kinds of things. The Americans
*  then see, okay, what they wanted to do before that was to come up with a deal, so before July,
*  the American plan was to come to a deal with Lebanon that would de-link Lebanon from Gaza.
*  Remember that Hezbollah and Nasrallah's one and only objective from October 8th, when they started,
*  until now has been, we will have an immediate ceasefire as soon as there's a Gaza ceasefire,
*  but we need to link these two things together. The American plan through Amos Hoxdeen, Biden's
*  mediator, who by the way is an Israeli who served in IDF, or IOF as we like to say,
*  so their plan was to de-link. That didn't happen because Nasrallah and Hezbollah refused to de-link
*  from Gaza and the Gaza genocide. Once the tactical successes of the Israelis and Netanyahu kind of
*  proceeded, the Americans changed their tune, Biden changed his tune, they withdrew this kind of
*  diplomatic deals, and they are in full support, no matter what they're leaking in the media,
*  no matter what they're saying. It's very clear, and today I think there was a report that came
*  out and kind of basically confirmed this, that the Americans from the highest up, from Biden onwards,
*  are saying we are in support of an Israeli invasion to try to end Hezbollah, at least to end it as a
*  fighting force that's a serious fighting force that can threaten anybody, and that way it also weakens
*  Iran, of course. The big target is Iran as far as Israelis are concerned, as far as the Americans
*  are concerned. Lebanon, Hezbollah is just one big Iranian proxy, so if Arabs die, if Lebanese die,
*  Palestinians die, it doesn't matter, they're not really humans. They're all basically Iranian
*  proxies, and all of this is okay because Iran has just put everybody there, and it's okay to kill
*  everybody. This is of course incredibly wrong and incredibly difficult to accept, and I don't think
*  it will work. I think if you see what's going on on the ground, as soon as the Israelis started
*  their invasion, it's not an incursion, it's an invasion, as soon as they started their invasion,
*  two, three days ago, they've been handed several defeats by Hezbollah fighters. More than a dozen
*  soldiers were killed at least in one fight, a series of tanks, Maccabean tanks, were destroyed,
*  and the Israelis have had to withdraw each time with their tails between their legs.
*  In return, so they've been unable to do anything so far anyway on the ground, and so in return what
*  they've been doing is increasing their attacks on, as we started this in Beirut and other, in
*  Tyre and Baalbek and other areas, to kill and destroy as much of the civilian infrastructure
*  and civilians as possible, to create as much terror among the Lebanese population, to create as much,
*  to kind of push the displaced into smaller and smaller areas like they're doing in Gaza,
*  so that they can sort of hit them. They're literally putting zones, and they're pushing
*  people from one zone to the other zone to another zone, then another zone, and each day these zones
*  are going to increase. The Hezbollah fighters on the ground in south Lebanon are incredibly,
*  incredibly well prepared. No matter what happens to their leadership, no matter how many are
*  assassinated, these guys have their, have their plans, they have their, they've got their strategy,
*  they've got their tactics, and they will not give up. That is 100% for sure. So they're either all
*  going to be killed, or, and this is what I think part of the Israeli strategy is going to be,
*  which is just try to come in from kind of towards Syria, surround south Lebanon, turn it into a kind
*  of a war zone, just absolutely destroy south Lebanon, while the kind of Beirut and other areas are
*  isolated in a different kind of battle. I think that's probably what they're trying to do.
*  I just think that they don't have the, you know, you see that in Gaza, after one year, they're still
*  unable to kill Senua, they're still unable to achieve any of their military objectives.
*  They're still fighting Hamas in Gaza. And so why people would expect them to destroy Hezbollah
*  in a matter of a few days or a couple of weeks, it's beyond me. So this is a very long battle.
*  We're still in the first few days of it, the first week of it, and I think it's going to be
*  very bloody, very dangerous, and it doesn't look like the United States is going to stop them.
*  And I don't know what's going on with the Europeans. They seem to have totally disappeared,
*  even at the humanitarian front. I might add, Owen, one thing, the NGOs have disappeared.
*  I don't see many, the international NGOs that you remember in 2020, in August 2020,
*  when there was a massive explosion in the Beirut port, and it was very traumatic. It was an
*  unbelievable explosion. A couple of hundred people killed, many wounded, the whole neighborhood was
*  destroyed. The amount of money that came in from the west, from Europe, from France, from all these
*  countries was unbelievable. The reconstruction that happened was unbelievable and welcome. Of
*  course, it was fantastic. Now when you see these displaced, a million people displaced, because of
*  who they are and because of where they're coming from, suddenly we see that all these international
*  NGOs, I mean, of course, there's always good people working, but sort of the heavy presence,
*  the big money, we don't see them very much. So we're back to neighborhoods, communities,
*  individuals, people organizing themselves, people trying to do as much as possible
*  to alleviate the suffering, because they know this is a long, there's a long, long, long,
*  you know, October, November, at least ahead of us, and people are scared.
*  Very sobering, shocking stuff, infuriating stuff, but so much insight. All of this, I know,
*  in terms of the audience, we're always so lucky to have incredible guests, but I know there's a
*  huge amount, as I said, at the beginning of emotional labor, it's not easy to talk about
*  horrors and atrocities being committed against your own country as we speak on such a scale.
*  So I do really, really appreciate it. And I know everyone watching and listening
*  will really, really appreciate it. We need your voices more than ever, the voice of people like
*  yourself, people who actually have lived experience and can speak in a way much of the
*  Western media has decided to erase the voices that we need to be hearing from at the moment.
*  For those watching, please share this video, make sure Karen's voice is heard loud and clear,
*  leave your thoughts, your comments, that helps the algorithm so more people will watch and engage.
*  Subscribe, but Karen, honestly, it's such an honor. Thank you so much for being with us.
*  Thank you. Thanks very much, Owen.
