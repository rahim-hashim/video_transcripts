# Israel's Alliance With Europe's Far Right Exposed w/. Rachel Shabi
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [June 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8)
*  Now in the European elections, the far right, I'm afraid to say, did very, very well indeed. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=0.0s)]
*  And if we look, for example, at France, where Macron, the president, the technically, well, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=6.0s)]
*  kind of right-centrist president, has called for national elections, the French far right [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=11.52s)]
*  are in pole position. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=16.92s)]
*  Doesn't look great. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=18.48s)]
*  Now putting this in the context of talking about Israel might seem a bit odd, but it [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=20.68s)]
*  isn't because Israel has, because we need to talk about the dynamics within Europe vis-Ã -vis [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=26.12s)]
*  what's going on in Gaza and Israel. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=32.2s)]
*  That matters a lot. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=34.64s)]
*  And the Israeli state has made it clear that it sees the European far right as its allies. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=35.64s)]
*  You can see the same in terms of the American far right, Donald Trump et al. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  I think this is a really fascinating topic and there's no better person to speak to [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=45.08s)]
*  about this than Rachel Chabit, who is the, well, a brilliant journalist and writer, but [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  I am unbelievably excited about her upcoming book, Off White, The Truth About Anti-Semitism, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=52.92s)]
*  which everybody must pre-order immediately. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=57.52s)]
*  I personally can't wait. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=60.52s)]
*  Rachel's always full of moral clarity, humanity, as well as obviously huge amounts of wisdom [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=63.160000000000004s)]
*  and knowledge. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=66.72s)]
*  What a combination. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=67.72s)]
*  And I saw Rachel tweeting about this topic and then I was like, we need to talk about [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=69.72s)]
*  it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=72.88s)]
*  And what Rachel tweeted was, Israeli government ties, the European far right is win-win. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=73.88s)]
*  Israel gets allies willing to deflect criticism, it's treatment of Palestinians. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=77.44s)]
*  The far right gets a fig leaf, it's still raging anti-Semitism. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=80.64s)]
*  Hello, how are you? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=83.4s)]
*  Hi, thanks so much for having me on and for such a generous welcome. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=85.2s)]
*  It was, if anything, understated. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=89.84s)]
*  Now, yeah, just in terms of just taking a step back, I mean, the far right took over [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  Europe in quite notoriously, I would say in the 1930s and 40s, and committed the Holocaust, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=100.44s)]
*  the extermination of six million Jews, two thirds of European Jews. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=109.08s)]
*  That's what happened the last time the far right were in charge. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=113.0s)]
*  The state of Israel publicly positions itself as the, not just a homeland for Jews, but [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=116.03999999999999s)]
*  the global protector of the Jewish people. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=121.72s)]
*  I think just making that alliance with the far right, and also the early Israeli state [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=125.4s)]
*  would never have positioned itself, whatever people think about that, but it didn't publicly [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=131.32s)]
*  position itself in those terms. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=135.56s)]
*  Can you just tell us what the hell, just in terms of taking a step back, it looks kind [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=136.72s)]
*  of crazy if you just strip any kind of knowledge and the dynamics were always in this direction. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=140.96s)]
*  What do you have to say about that? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=147.36s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=149.2s)]
*  It does look crazy. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=150.08s)]
*  It does look horrifying. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=150.96s)]
*  And I think one of the things when I was researching this book about how anti-Semitism [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=153.36s)]
*  has become such a battleground, one of the things that makes it so confusing is this [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=158.8s)]
*  twist that's happened over the last few decades, which is essentially pro-Israel anti-Semitism, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=163.04000000000002s)]
*  meaning you can be as anti-Semitic as you like as long as you're full-throated supporter [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=170.0s)]
*  of Israel. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=175.36s)]
*  And so we can see that when it comes to things like Christian Zionism, which is deeply disturbing [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=176.16s)]
*  in its view of Jewish people. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=183.12s)]
*  We'll park that for now. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=184.16s)]
*  But the other aspect of it is what you're talking about, which is the alliances that [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  Israel's been making over the last few decades with the far right, with their track record [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=190.32s)]
*  and still very much live anti-Semitism, as well as, of course, rampant Islamophobia, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=195.92s)]
*  hostility to immigration and very illiberal policies across the board. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=202.32s)]
*  So I think we can start this story in 2004 when 10 new countries joined the European Union. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=206.48s)]
*  And in this context, the ones to keep an eye on are Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=217.04s)]
*  but also Estonia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=223.44s)]
*  That happens in 2004. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=229.44s)]
*  By then, Israel is getting a lot of criticism at the EU level, a lot of condemnation. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=230.95999999999998s)]
*  By then, we've got just rampant settlement expansion that happened during the 1990s, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=237.92s)]
*  during the Oslo peace process years, to such an extent that Oslo came to be seen as a kind of [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=244.24s)]
*  cover or an opportunity for more settlement expansion. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=251.60000000000002s)]
*  And then we've got the second in Tivata, which broke out in 2001. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  And then the Palestinian suicide bombs, which were horrible and deadly in Israel, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=261.2s)]
*  school buses, cafes, clubs. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  And the Israeli response was ferocious and disproportionate. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=271.52000000000004s)]
*  And we saw military sieges of Palestinian towns in the occupied West Bank, Ramallah, Bethlehem. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=277.76000000000005s)]
*  And then, of course, the separation barrier starts to go up in 2002, which is another land grab [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=287.20000000000005s)]
*  because it leaves, swathes the Palestinian land on the Israeli side of the barrier. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=292.64000000000004s)]
*  It also cuts Palestinians in the occupied West Bank off from their lands, neighborhoods, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=297.6s)]
*  relatives, jobs, and of course, from Jerusalem, which is the cultural and spiritual heart. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=306.08s)]
*  Because of all these reasons, Israel is really getting it at the EU. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=313.92s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, who really is the architect of this slide into these alliances with the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=319.68s)]
*  right wing across Europe, he looks at these new countries that have just joined the EU. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=325.44s)]
*  He is then foreign minister and thinks, well, maybe they could be useful allies in blocking [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=331.52s)]
*  all this criticism that we're getting. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=339.44s)]
*  And in fact, that's exactly what came to pass. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=342.32s)]
*  So if we fast forward to the next year, 2005, Viktor Orban, the now Hungarian far-right leader, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=344.72s)]
*  of Hungary, he meets Benjamin Netanyahu in 2005. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=356.08s)]
*  He's just had a bruising defeat in the 2002 election, which he loses partly because of the [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=362.56s)]
*  stink of antisemitism. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=367.76s)]
*  He uses tactical antisemitism, as he calls it politely, in that election because he wants [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=368.96s)]
*  to win sections of the far right. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=375.04s)]
*  And he- [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=376.72s)]
*  He's kind of George Soros, the Jewish puppet master for the opposition. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=378.24s)]
*  That comes later. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=383.2s)]
*  That comes in 20- later on in 2017. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=384.0s)]
*  In those early days, the 2002 election that he lost was because of that stink of tactical [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=387.2s)]
*  antisemitism that was surrounding him. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=393.2s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=394.56s)]
*  He lost in that election. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=395.12s)]
*  And he knows he has to sanitise his party and get rid of that smell. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=396.4s)]
*  And so he goes and meets Netanyahu in Israel. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=402.24s)]
*  They get on great. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=406.8s)]
*  Of course they do. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=407.92s)]
*  I mean, authoritarian ethno-nationalists meet authoritarian ethno-nationalists. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=409.12s)]
*  So that's the start of this friendship, this alliance. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=414.8s)]
*  You fast forward to when they're both in power. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=419.12s)]
*  So, you know, 2009, Netanyahu comes back as Israeli Prime Minister. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=422.16s)]
*  2010, Viktor Orban wins again as Hungarian leader. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=427.28000000000003s)]
*  And they can activate this alliance. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=432.08s)]
*  And so that's when you start to see the EU. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=435.36s)]
*  Because it's, you know, you can block it with one veto vote. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=438.71999999999997s)]
*  You can see constantly Hungary, but also the Czech Republic, and to some extent Slovenia, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=444.0s)]
*  constantly stymie everything the EU tries to do that's remotely critical of Israel, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=451.2s)]
*  that's remotely pro-Palestinian, anything that's critical of settlements expansion, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=457.52s)]
*  or trying to label goods that come out of settlements in the occupied West Bank, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=461.67999999999995s)]
*  or trying to condemn the US embassy relocation to Jerusalem in 2017, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=467.76s)]
*  right up to now, where the EU is unable to make any sort of meaningful statements about the horrors [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=474.8s)]
*  that are going on in Gaza with this genocidal war that Israel is waging. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=483.6s)]
*  It's unable even to issue a statement against Israel, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=488.32s)]
*  an Israeli bombardment or offensive in Rafah, because Hungary keeps blocking it. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=495.92s)]
*  So you can see how effective that strategy is at an EU level. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=500.8s)]
*  With what I'm just interested in terms of the European far right, because obviously traditionally [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=507.12s)]
*  the European far right's anti-Semitism was Jewish people are not Europeans, they're outsiders, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=511.2s)]
*  they're the other. They're the disloyal other, the dangerous subversive other. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=516.96s)]
*  Then they reconfigure Israel as us. There is an outpost basically of [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=522.72s)]
*  Western civilization threatened by a sea of Muslim barbarism. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=528.72s)]
*  It's just interesting how they've reconfigured that, that evolution, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=537.6s)]
*  but at the same time there's still massive anti-Semitism which keeps the old anti-Semitism [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=540.72s)]
*  within. Cognitive dissonance is often a very important part of politics, isn't it? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=545.04s)]
*  How people, political movements can have completely, and the far right has always [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=549.76s)]
*  been completely contradictory by its definition. So I'm just wondering what your thoughts are. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=554.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, that cognitive dissonance is very much a feature of the far right and it makes it really [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=558.48s)]
*  hard to keep track of and understand what's going on. But absolutely. So they realized that [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=563.4399999999999s)]
*  anti-Semitism is an awful thing in polite company in the way that unfortunately in our societies [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=570.8s)]
*  across Europe, you cannot say that's the case with Islamophobia, which is much more, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=580.32s)]
*  I don't know how to put it, socially acceptable. Sounds like a horrible thing to say. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=586.72s)]
*  It's true. It's true. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=590.8s)]
*  It's the nature of these racisms and how they play out in terms of media and political perception [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=592.24s)]
*  of acceptability. And so they realized that they could rehabilitate themselves by being [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=598.72s)]
*  very performatively pro-Israel, which would sanitize them and would create the impression [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=604.72s)]
*  that they're no longer anti-Semitic. Now that's clearly not the case. So these parties with these [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=613.2s)]
*  history of anti-Semitism being formed by ex-Nazi officers and ex-SS officers like [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=620.8000000000001s)]
*  the National Assembly now in France or the Freedom Party in Austria or Fidesz in Hungary, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=626.9599999999999s)]
*  they're still very deeply rooted in anti-Semitism. However, they are using their performative, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=637.28s)]
*  we love Israel, we care a lot about Israel, and we care a lot about anti-Semitism, which we are [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=646.0799999999999s)]
*  going to recast as criticism of Israel. They're using that as a way to sanitize themselves. And [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=652.64s)]
*  that's what facilitates, that's what enables the relationship with Israel. And so when we look at [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=659.52s)]
*  the fact that anyone who is pro-Palestine or actually in any way left-wing now, anti-racist, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=666.88s)]
*  Black Lives Matter, critical race theory, all of those things being cast as anti-Semitic, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=676.96s)]
*  part of the function of that is not just to put the spotlight on the left, is that it takes the [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=681.76s)]
*  spotlight away from the far right, and it facilitates these kind of strategic alliances that we see now [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=686.8s)]
*  with Israel. And you're right that there's this symbiosis, and it really accelerated in the early [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=693.04s)]
*  2000s, post-911, where Israel, which has always portrayed itself as this sort of European rampart [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=698.9599999999999s)]
*  against the sort of barbarian, uncivilized Middle East, was really able to ramp that up and say, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=707.2s)]
*  well, we're all in the same fight. We Israelis are not fighting Palestinian resistance movement, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=714.1600000000001s)]
*  it's not resistance to occupation, it's just a local franchise of the war on terror. And that [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=721.84s)]
*  framing really mobilized the far right, which in any case are Islamophobic, and it all got [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=727.9200000000001s)]
*  turbo boosted with what was portrayed as a European migration crisis, but which was obviously a crisis [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=734.8s)]
*  for refugees who were fleeing war and persecution. It all accelerated and all got bundled together, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=741.76s)]
*  so that it became this really big identifier for elements of the far right to see themselves [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=748.56s)]
*  as pro-Israel as a way of being rampantly Islamophobic. And so then you see people like [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=755.3599999999999s)]
*  Hilt Wilders of the Dutch Far Right Party, or again Marine Le Pen, come out and say things like, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=765.04s)]
*  well, we're going to protect Jews against the real antisemitism, which is coming from Islamists, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=771.12s)]
*  or Muslims. So they're managing to both deflect their own antisemitism, and then project it onto [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=777.3599999999999s)]
*  Muslims, and then claim that they're protecting Jewish people from the actual antisemitism. So [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=788.0s)]
*  it's a real twist, a sort of nearest distortion that's going on. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=794.88s)]
*  Jason Vale It reminds me of, I mean take Germany, I know [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=800.24s)]
*  Germany is quite a specific example. So for example, a German Iranian man, he's gay, he fled, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=803.4399999999999s)]
*  he ran as a refugee, he came to Germany, and I think he posted somewhere, Twitter, Facebook, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=810.0799999999999s)]
*  in support of a ceasefire in Gaza, and then non-Jewish Germans targeted him, calling him, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=815.52s)]
*  go back to your shithole country, you dirty Islamist, overtly Islamophobic racist stuff, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=822.56s)]
*  and tried to put an Israeli flag on the shop door where he worked. And it reminded me, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=827.68s)]
*  I spoke to a Jewish German journalist whose contract wasn't renewed after he's put through [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=834.3199999999999s)]
*  an antisemitism course by non-Jewish colleagues, protested about the framing, and then have his [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=840.0s)]
*  contract renewed. Astonishing Kafka-esque stuff here. Which is, he said basically because German [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=845.28s)]
*  nationalism was stigmatized for fairly obvious reasons, Israel basically gave a kind of [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=852.24s)]
*  permission slip to German, the far right and German nationalism generally, to say you can be racist, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=859.12s)]
*  and we're giving you credentials to protect yourself from accusations of replicating your [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=866.24s)]
*  past. I don't know what you think about that. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=872.48s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think that's exactly what's going on, and it is extraordinary when you think about [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=874.64s)]
*  it. You've got German officials saying things like, oh well, the reason we have an antisemitism [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=878.56s)]
*  problem is because we've got so many migrants from Muslim countries, which is an extraordinary [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=884.9599999999999s)]
*  claim when you think about it, for Germany to make. And so this ability, this transparency, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=891.6s)]
*  this [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=898.56s)]
*  transparency of the [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=900.56s)]
*  problems and the availability of a redemption narrative for these countries that have a history [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=902.56s)]
*  of antisemitism, and for these far right parties with a history of antisemitism. And the trouble [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=910.56s)]
*  is that if we look at what some of those parties are actually doing is actual revisionism. So the [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=917.28s)]
*  moment, or in Poland, which in 2018 passed a law making anyone claiming that Poland had anything [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=924.16s)]
*  to do with the Holocaust illegal, which is extraordinary, the country where most Polish [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=931.12s)]
*  Jews were killed and where actually most of the extermination of Jewish people happened. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=937.4399999999999s)]
*  And that has consequences. That has consequences for the revisionism itself that's going on around [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=944.9599999999999s)]
*  Holocaust denialism. So some Israeli scholars of Holocaust revisionism and denialism have been [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=952.8s)]
*  really critical of the Israeli government and said, you've basically given a gift to Holocaust [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=963.76s)]
*  deniers the world over in facilitating these relationships with Poland and Hungary. But it [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=970.48s)]
*  also endangers those Jewish communities in those countries. And that's the problem with this. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=977.44s)]
*  So for instance, Hungary, which has to deal with what you were talking about earlier, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=986.0s)]
*  Viktor OrbÃ¡n's nakedly antisemitic campaign against Soros. Or Poland, where when they passed [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=990.08s)]
*  that law in 2018, it caused a wave of antisemitic attacks, including phone calls and yelling at [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1000.8s)]
*  people in streets because they're now seen as the enemy within. And the reality is that these far [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1006.8s)]
*  right alliances that Israel is making is to the detriment of those diasporic Jewish communities. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1013.28s)]
*  Just finally, this is a depressing question to pen and paper. We are in the timeline we're in, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1024.0s)]
*  Rachel. So it is what it is. I mean, it's sort of kind of suggested that what we're looking at, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1028.72s)]
*  the whole of Gaza could foreshadow a future which embraces all of us. The far right is on the rise [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1035.92s)]
*  in Europe and in the United States. I mean, even talking about the prospectus of war in the United [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1046.56s)]
*  States, it's not far-fetched. And, you know, we can see, for example, the looming climate emergency [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1051.2s)]
*  and, sorry, there's a climate emergency now, but the looming really catastrophic consequences [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1058.48s)]
*  could be so destabilizing. And the way the global north might respond, particularly with an ascendant [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1065.3600000000001s)]
*  far right with the othered peoples of the crisis-afflicted global south. I don't know, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1071.1200000000001s)]
*  in my darkest moments, I kind of look at this and think, is Israel the blueprint in terms of [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1080.48s)]
*  what's happened to Palestinian people in Gaza and beyond? What do you think? Is that just being [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1084.56s)]
*  too alarmist? Do you see what I'm getting at? I do. I mean, it's really hard to have any faith [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1090.48s)]
*  in humanity at the moment, isn't it? Looking at, you know, the apocalyptic images coming out of Gaza. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1098.72s)]
*  And at the same time, we have to have faith in humanity. But I do think that [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1108.8s)]
*  we underestimate to our peril and, you know, the sort of centrist parties underestimate [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1115.2s)]
*  to the peril of all of us just how rapid the growth of this sort of far right, zero-sum, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1122.32s)]
*  Islamophobic mentality has become. And you can see, you know, it's not just online anymore, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1132.32s)]
*  it's bursting out into the open and it has real life consequences. And this sort of affiliation, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1139.84s)]
*  what's important to remember with this affiliation with, you know, the far right who are pro-Israel [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1147.12s)]
*  and anti-Semitic and performatively care a lot about anti-Semitism is that actually they don't [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1153.6799999999998s)]
*  care at all about anti-Semitism and they certainly don't care about Jewish people. So it's not serving [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1159.36s)]
*  anybody, it's not serving any minority to have this dynamic going on. And I guess the only hope [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1164.0s)]
*  we can have is the realisation that these currents, even though they're playing out [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1171.68s)]
*  and they manifest at the moment in this genocidal war on Gaza, these currents are actually endangering [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1179.52s)]
*  all minorities globally. And it's only if we find a way of unifying that struggle against the far [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1189.12s)]
*  right that it's targeting all of us in different ways that we ever stand a chance of opposing and [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1196.56s)]
*  defeating it. More clarity, a huge amount of knowledge, wisdom, see, everyone who's not [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1202.8799999999999s)]
*  listening to Rachel Chabbie, you can see why so many of us admire and look up to her always in these [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1209.6s)]
*  hideous moments. Do make sure you get a pre-order copy of Off White, the truth about anti-Semitism. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1215.76s)]
*  As you can tell, it's going to be a truly seminal piece of work and I'm very, very excited about it. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1223.76s)]
*  Thanks so much for having me on and thanks also for all the work that you've been doing and all [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1230.16s)]
*  the people that you've been interviewing, Israelis, Palestinians. It's been really [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1233.92s)]
*  reassuring and heartening and important to see. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1239.92s)]
*  Well, as I keep saying, what's the point of me having a platform if I don't use it at a time [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1242.16s)]
*  like this? But for those listening, watching, press like, subscribe, leave your comments, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1247.04s)]
*  love to hear your thoughts, share the video so everyone hears Rachel's wisdom. But Rachel, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1252.4s)]
*  honestly, always a superstar. Thank you. Thanks so much. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XZsUGMNGW8&t=1256.08s)]
