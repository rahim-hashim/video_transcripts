Video Description: An interview with a Hamas official promising to repeat the 7th October atrocities has gone viral amongst opponents of a ceasefire. It shows, they say, that Israel's onslaught must continue, with an endless death toll. Here's why this argument is bankrupt on moral and practical grounds - and will unleash an even greater catastrophe.

# The Argument Against A Ceasefire TORN APART
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [November 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIdd0F5YIjo)
*  Those politicians and commentators in countries such as my own who oppose a ceasefire who therefore support Israel's onslaught against Gaza
*  Which they must know will end in the deaths of tens of thousands of innocent people. They are suddenly in a grimly triumphant mood
*  They are many of them deep down aware of the moral obscenity that they are cheering on
*  They are aware of the approaching 10 000 Palestinians who've been killed in less than a month including
*  3760 children more than the total annual number of children
*  Killed in all conflicts in the last five years in the space of a month a death toll that will stand around quarter
*  Of the total civilian death toll in the bosnian war the 1990s which took place over three years and bear in mind
*  Bosnia had twice the pre-war population of Gaza. They know that the claims
*  Israel is circulating that they are avoiding targeting civilians are an absurd and frankly disgusting
*  Nonsense belied by what Israel's leaders themselves are saying in public which i'll come on to but suffice it to say they can hardly be
*  Less subtle unless Benjamin Netanyahu himself appeared on international television with a neon sign attached to his head
*  Inscribed with we are committing war crimes against innocent people
*  They are aware of the schools the the hospitals the refugee camps being bombed the countless aid workers human officials and journalists
*  Who've been killed the entire generations of families wiped from the face of the earth the collapse of the health care system
*  The lack of clean water and food the fact that gaza is in short being turned into a killing field a mass grave
*  And we are only in the first few weeks of what could be many many months to come
*  The eventual death toll from both direct violence and the collapse of the health care system lack of essentials the spread of illness
*  I don't even want to think about it frankly. It is too terrifying to even contemplate but mark my words
*  We it will be pinned on those who cheered this atrocity on now deep down
*  They are aware as I say of the obscenity that they are cheering on
*  So they spend time some of them scouring through social media to try and find this or that
*  Extremists attaching themselves to the Palestinian cause so they can tell the whole movement and claim that the real morally bankrupt
*  Extremists are those who oppose the mass slaughter of children rather than those who support what is in practice the mass slaughter of innocent people
*  including so many kids or
*  In the latest case the lifeline they think has been presented to them is a television interview involving a hamas official
*  Now a decade ago gazi hamad was hamas's deputy foreign minister and he remains on its political bureau
*  And in this interview, he says israel is a country that has no place on our land
*  We must remove that country calls it a terminal threat to the our nation says israel must be taught a lesson
*  That the atrocities hamas committed on the 7th of october will be repeated a second a third and fourth time
*  Blood curdling stuff bearing in mind that on the 7th of october hamas committed terrible crimes against humanity. No question about that whatsoever
*  Which is what the murder of innocent civilians and the kidnap of innocent civilians constitutes for which there is absolutely no defense
*  Of any description so the video that has been shared of this interview all over social media by supporters of this massive atrocity taking place
*  Is used to explain why they have no choice but to back a military onslaught causing
*  I repeat death on a mass scale every single day
*  Now firstly those taking this position are clearly and unambiguously saying that palestinian life either matters very little
*  Or not meaningfully at all. Let me explain on the 7th of october
*  1,200 israelis were killed at least a thousand of them civilians that is very correctly understood
*  As an intolerable death toll the idea that another
*  Thousand israeli civilians could be murdered is rightly considered
*  Absolutely and completely unacceptable and intolerable. This does not apply
*  To palestinian life self-evidently doesn't apply to palestinian life around 10 times
*  as many palestinians have now been killed as
*  Those israelis who were so brutally killed on the 7th of october 10 times the death toll
*  Which was quite correctly seen as intolerably
*  High with no limit to that death toll
*  In sight now so so we are rightly being asked to give value to israeli
*  Civilian life as we should that even one more israeli civilian death would be a moral outrage
*  But we can keep endlessly piling up the bodies of palestinians
*  including children
*  toddlers
*  Newborn babies who are being handed their death certificates before their birth certificates with defenders of this atrocity
*  Refusing to say just how many palestinian lives they're willing to sacrifice 10 000 is more than fine. Apparently, what is it?
*  20 000 50 000 100 000
*  Now nobody thinks and we should just be clear that he sees fan now
*  Would trigger hamas suddenly marching back over the border to repeat the atrocities they committed that is clearly impossible
*  But the idea therefore being presented is that they would use
*  The ceasefire to prepare themselves to do it all over again
*  Now we must emphasize and it cannot be forgotten that 7th of october was in large part a story of israeli security failure
*  Which quite understandably has caused massive uproar in israeli society
*  We really expected to believe that the israeli state is going to leave its southern communities undefended against a repeat attempt hamas
*  By was by all accounts completely taken by surprise
*  Because they didn't expect to get anywhere near as far as they did because of the weak israeli defenses on offer
*  Whatever happens. I think we know and can take for granted. There's going to be a massive
*  Permanent israeli armed presence in the south with an endless amount of other security measures
*  So we are being asked and would you just be honest about it? This is the truth
*  We're being asked to endlessly sacrifice palestinian lives for the repeat of an eventuality which frankly is going to be rendered completely
*  impractical indeed
*  This is the other point an absolute key point
*  The diabolical rhetoric of this hamas official is being used as evidence quite rightly of mass murderous intent
*  And it is being used to say to underlie that hamas intends or seeks to destroy israel
*  Let's be blunt here hamas has absolutely no chance whatsoever. No capacity to destroy israel whatsoever
*  Absolutely zero israel on the other hand does have the capacity to destroy gaza
*  We know it has the capacity because it's currently destroying gaza in order to prevent a hypothetical impossibility
*  Of israel being destroyed by hamas. We are being asked to support an actual reality of gaza being destroyed
*  By israel bearing in mind palestine as a nation isn't even allowed to exist because of generations of refusal
*  By israel to allow the national self-determination of the palestinian people and indeed israeli leaders
*  Themselves are using murderous language which has been condemned for having genocidal
*  intent and indeed condemned by un officials and genocide experts for
*  Being in practice a genocide you may agree or disagree
*  but many experts
*  Including those who have worked in actual genocides and spent their lives studying genocides. That's the conclusion they've come to
*  Netanyahu for example citing amalek in the bible to justify the war on gaza
*  Which calls for the mass execution of men women children and livestock for that passage. Imagine a muslim leader
*  in a war
*  Used a quranic verse to justify that war involving the mass slaughter of men women children and livestock
*  Can you imagine the response to that?
*  Now we know israeli officials are saying in public that their aim is damage
*  Not accuracy. We know israeli officials have called for gaza to be reduced to a city of tents
*  That is all buildings destroyed. We know the defense minister has said gaza won't return to what it was before
*  We will eliminate everything and when he was justifying a total siege including cutting off all water food electricity medicines the work
*  He said that israel was fighting human animals. We know that one israeli minister amekai
*  Elayahu yesterday called for the complete destruction of gaza
*  Calling for it to be replaced with beach condos
*  We know another lequeued politician who was until recently a minister said
*  Erase all of gaza from the face of the earth that the gaza
*  Monsters will fly to the southern fence and try to enter egyptian territory or they will die and their death will be evil
*  Gaza should be erased
*  We know one of their top military lawyers said if you want to destroy hamas then you have to destroy gaza
*  Because everything in gaza almost every building there is a stronghold of hamas
*  We know that israeli president isaac herzog said it's an entire nation out there that's responsible the reticraft civilians
*  Not being aware not evolved is absolutely not true. They could have risen up
*  They could have fought against that evil regime the language of collective guilt, which is always the prerequisite for mass slaughter
*  Nisem vataru another politician a member of the ruling akut party who talked of erasing the gaza strip from the face of the earth
*  There's a leaked plan for one government ministry to permanently remove all of gaza's population something various
*  Israeli politicians have long spoke about and egypt keeps
*  Publicly warning israel intends to do the point i'm making is the murderous destruction of gaza is not just a hypothetical backed up
*  By genocidal language, which I think we can safely describe much of that language. It's a reality hamas and israel may threaten both
*  Terrible mass murder, but one only one
*  Has the actual capacity to follow through on their threats and it is doing it it is
*  Wiping out gaza and it is actively armed and backed by our governments in the process, which hamas clearly is not
*  Now there's another point that israel is doubling down on a strategy
*  Which is taken to the nth degree which has only succeeded ever in bolstering extremism not just in gaza, but elsewhere as well now
*  Mohammed shahada
*  Has spoken publicly he's a very interesting person who should be followed on social media
*  And he said that he once debated hamad this hamas official and hamad said the two-state solution had become impossible israel would never agree to it
*  And shahada said that when he challenged hamad about hamas not renouncing violence negotiating peace the response was the plo
*  And the palestinian liberation organization and mamoud abbas who is the president who runs the west bank
*  Did all this and more but got nothing and are being humiliated and demonized it goes on to say i retorted to hamad
*  That they should agree to pa elections to let
*  Palestinians choose their leaders and his reply was elections for what the weakened empty husk of the palestinian authority
*  And he went on about how israel gives the pa no real control and withholds its revenue
*  Now over a decade ago this hamas official everyone is circulating publicly backed a two-state solution
*  Now we know the plo abandoned the armed struggle in the early 90s and embraced peace and they got nothing to show for it
*  Just more occupation in terms of the west bank continuing the humiliation that involved the theft of their land
*  The things like mass incarceration
*  torture
*  People being arrested and detained without charge the colonization the the the settlements which are illegal international law
*  Drastically expanded year after year and that's why so many palestinians ended up driven to the arms of hamas
*  and in the first place
*  A non-violent strategy when it was embraced such as the great march of return
*  Was fired on by israelis soldiers with mass deaths as a consequence
*  And we know israel strengthened hamas to weaken the palestinian national movement as bedouin netanyahu was quoted by
*  haretz the
*  leading respected
*  Israeli newspaper anyone who wants to foil the establishment of a palestinian state needs to support the strengthening of hamas and the transfer funds
*  To hamas now we know that hamas has been repeatedly strengthened by israeli crackdowns before
*  This horror show before the 7th of october. It wasn't popular
*  and polling showed that 44 percent of those in gaza had no trust at all in hamas
*  Followed by not a lot of trust at 23 percent only 29 expressed either a great deal or quite a lot of trust
*  for example, and another showed that
*  half of garzons
*  expressed support for democracy
*  and and equally that
*  54 favored a two-state
*  solution
*  That's 73 percent of garzons favored a peaceful settlement
*  and so there was
*  this potential
*  Huge goodwill amongst the population of gaza
*  But polling showed that past israeli crackdowns in gaza only increased support for hamas and none of them have gone anywhere near as far
*  As what's been unleashed against gaza now counterinsurgencies like this
*  Do not work
*  What was the point?
*  Of so many dying in afghanistan so many civilians
*  And also it should be noted us and uk troops without learning that lesson two decades of counterinsurgency
*  How did it end with all the horror involved it ended with a taliban?
*  stronger than ever before
*  What about iraq?
*  When we were told that we had to go in partly because supposedly al qaeda when kahootz was saying a nonsense
*  Go in drive people into the arms of al qaeda
*  In terms of much the sunny population have a massive al qaeda
*  Insurgency in the 2000s in the noughties and then a massive counterinsurgency
*  Program and how what ended then isis emerged which was even more extreme and sees large chunks
*  large swathes of iraq and syria for that matter as well after 9 11
*  We were told we have to do something we have to do something and those of us who opposed it were seen as
*  As morally obscene and we keep hearing these comparisons. This is israel's 9 11
*  Do you think they can't respond to 9 11 like we did as though?
*  We have somehow forgotten
*  The calamity of the response to 9 11 who looks back at the response to 9 11 and thinks that was a good idea
*  Afghanistan iraq anyone what we do all that all over again
*  Now the impeding as as foreign affairs this
*  article
*  and foreign affairs very prestigious journal entitled that the the invasion of gaza will be disaster for israel
*  noting that the impending invasion of gaza will be humanitarian moral and strategic catastrophe will only badly harm israel's long-term strategy and inflict
*  unfathomable human costs on palestinians, but also threaten core u.s
*  Interests now the idea that you go in and just take out the leadership of hamas and that will vanish is is lunacy
*  Because obviously there is a base for hamas which will only expand
*  Now either hamas or something more extreme has happened in iraq
*  You think all those people on a daily basis who are now watching their loved ones being murdered being slaughtered by bombs
*  Picking up the charred limbs of their children are going to go. Oh, okay. I accept israel now
*  scores and scores and scores of recruits
*  Forever greater extremism are being created every single day now as a as a former u.s
*  general
*  David petraeus says a military ground offensive by the idf would last years involve horrific fighting
*  He said it's hard for me to imagine more difficult setting than this particular one
*  You don't win counterinsurgency in a year or two
*  They typically take a decade or more as we saw in iraq as we saw in afghanistan
*  Not quite sure why the example of afghanistan is being used there now. The fact is actually hamas is divided
*  There's a clear divide in hamas. So for example
*  in their
*  political wing ismael hannayyat from doha says we want to open a political track towards a palestinian state which
*  is called jesus and is a capital
*  Whilst we hear from hamad we will fight till we annihilate
*  Israel surely it's the the wing which continues to argue for a two-state solution which needs to be bolstered but
*  Who on earth thinks they're going to be bolstered?
*  With what's now being afflicted against gaza, you know who argued for the bolstering of that wing incidentally of all people
*  Tony blair in 2017 he spoke of his regret for the boycott imposed on hamas after they won the palestinian elections
*  He said in retrospect, I think we should have right at the very beginning tried to pull hamas and dialogue and shifted their positions
*  I think that's why I would be in retrospect very sensible
*  He actually invited the then leader of hamas to try and broker an end to the siege of gaza
*  Not often that I commend Tony blair particularly on issues of the middle east, but he was true. He was absolutely right now a catastrophe
*  Awaitance not just in gaza because when hamas did what they did they knew what israel was going to do
*  Israel are now doing what hamas intended they're following the script
*  You may go well, that's foolhardy than it may backfire spectacularly, but clearly that's not the calculation hamas made
*  Israel is likely to be dragged into a catastrophic urban war
*  Its its army are clearly not prepared for the threat is this then spreads to the west bank where president abbas is monumentally unpopular
*  What about hesbola in lebanon? There's very limited support in lebanon now for involvement in this war
*  but what when israel is
*  Its army is is is trapped in a disastrous urban warfare and atrocities are mounting and our republic anger grows
*  And hesbola could then try and posture as though it's preventing a genocide. They have a huge army and then it could spread even further
*  Now this is a catastrophe
*  This is a a catastrophe and it's very obvious. It's a catastrophe with no obvious end game. No strategy. It's just
*  If you back it, you should be clear. This is vengeance driving it
*  It's blind vengeance
*  with catastrophic
*  Human consequences don't think you're backing this because you think it's going to end in peace and security for israel and hamas vanishing
*  That's not going to happen
*  It's obvious like iraq. This will be a catastrophe and people like me were horribly vindicated in the worst possible way
*  What do we have to show for it blood blood and more blood the cheerleaders?
*  Of what is now happening are the same people who cheered on afghanistan many of them
*  Afghanistan a catastrophe iraq a catastrophe libya a catastrophe none of these wars have been anything other than a catastrophe
*  Here they are drenched from top to bottom in blood demanding yet more blood acting like they're the learned wise sage ones
*  And we're the extremist divorced from reality when they keep delivering the same catastrophes over and over and over again
*  The same catastrophic results are never learning
*  Well, we have to go through this absurd period of being treated as extremists
*  Who don't have answers as they casually doused petrol all over the fire manically screaming. Well, we have to do something
*  We are going to be right again in the worst possible way. It will be miserable and a catastrophe beckons
*  But there is not the precedent
*  for the success
*  When you have a state which is clearly monumentally hostile to a population. It's inflicting terrible horizon
*  Who on earth thinks they're going to be subjugated?
*  The only way
*  They could succeed in that way is to drive the entire population out of gaza, which some are contemplating
*  Is that what the so-called moderate liberals are now?
*  prepared to countenance
*  So yeah
*  There is no good argument against a ceasefire because the atrocities being committed the grave atrocities
*  Are those being committed by a military superpower which has the capacity to wipe out vast numbers of civilians who've been completely dehumanized?
*  So we don't even think about the worth of their lives who are destroying gaza and who are going to breed even more
*  extremism and spread a conflict even more which will result in the potential deaths of so many people those
*  who support
*  This who oppose a ceasefire are complicit in one of the great crimes of our time and mark my words
*  We're going to hold you to account because it is inevitable how this ends and it is catastrophe
