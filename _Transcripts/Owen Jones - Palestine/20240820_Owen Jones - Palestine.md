# Joe Biden's SHAMELESS Gaza Lies Don't Let Him Get Away With It
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [August 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNzzPbhWxzk)
*  Now some might go, why even talk about Joe Biden? The guy is on his way out, let's face it,
*  probably in every sense. Move on, let it be. Now the simple answer to that is no.
*  You don't let enablers of genocide just walk away with their bloodied hands and pretend it
*  never happened. You hold them to account, and you do that when they're alive, and you do that even
*  when they're long dead. Even if they never face justice, what they did must be understood.
*  We've seen how much of liberal America rehabilitated George W Bush, going gooey-eyed
*  as he once handed candy to Michelle Obama, acting as though he was morally superior to Donald Trump
*  because he doesn't send mean tweets, wiping away the mass slaughters of Iraq amongst all the other
*  crimes. Well this matters in the present, because Biden will still be President of the United States
*  until the 20th of January 2025, which is nearly 22 weeks away. 22 weeks in which Israel can
*  continue to commit one of the worst crimes of our age, and because of the likely continuity
*  represented by Kamala Harris as Vice President until proven otherwise.
*  Now let's listen to Joe Biden, the Democratic National Convention, clearly prepped to try
*  and defuse the fury amongst so many natural Democratic voters, whipped up because he has
*  armed and actively backed, in every sense, one of the worst atrocities of our age.
*  A few days ago I put forward a proposal that brought us closer to doing
*  that than we've done since October 7th. We're working around the clock, my Secretary of State,
*  to prevent a wider war and reunite hostages and families, and surge humanitarian health and food
*  assistance into Gaza now. To end the civilian suffering of the Palestinian people,
*  and finally, finally, finally deliver a ceasefire and end this war.
*  So
*  those press, those protesters out in the street, they have a point.
*  A lot of innocent people are being killed on both sides.
*  Firstly, just a fact check there, as he tries to say that those protesters on the streets may have
*  a point about butchery, butchery that his bloodied fingerprints are all over. He says a lot of innocent
*  people are being killed on both sides. He knows full well that almost all Israeli civilians killed
*  by Hamas or other Palestinian militants were killed on 7th October, in war crimes to be clear,
*  and he also knows that even if you go by the official death toll, well over 28 times as many
*  Palestinians have been killed, not even taking into account the disparity in population size,
*  and therefore the proportions in question, and that official death toll is likely a drastic
*  underestimate. Indeed, one estimate by academic health specialists would mean that around 133
*  times as many Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli state. Even here he's being deceptive,
*  because the way this is presented gives the impression that there is an ongoing slaughter
*  on both sides taking place. That is absolutely and completely untrue, and it also erases the
*  fact that this entirely one sided slaughter, which has taken place every single day from the
*  8th October last year, is being armed by his administration. The US administration,
*  Joe Biden's administration, just approved a $20 billion weapons package to Israel a few days ago,
*  weapons which will be used to kill many more thousands of Palestinians than have already
*  been killed in the first place. But the real lie is this working around the clock to get a
*  ceasefire claim. Now sometimes you just need a bit of plain speaking, so here goes. That is
*  bullshit. For a start, Joe Biden could end this whole horror show like that, clicking his fingers,
*  or rather specifically with a phone call. If US aid stops, Israel's genocide stops,
*  sometimes things really are that simple. Now let's hear, shall we, from US Secretary of State
*  Anthony Blinken, and this is following his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
*  Firstly, funny isn't it that you don't hear Netanyahu saying any of this, why isn't it coming
*  from his lips, is Blinken now his spokesperson? But then you read what news outlet Axios says,
*  which is, that statement baffled some Israeli officials who told Axios that Netanyahu's hard
*  lines are actually making a deal much harder to reach. Axios also reported Netanyahu endorsed the
*  US proposal which incorporated several of his updated demands, knowing Hamas would reject it,
*  senior Israeli officials tell Axios. Now wait till you hear what this deal actually is.
*  It really is quite something. More specifically, Hamas objects to the fact that the proposal
*  doesn't include a permanent ceasefire or comprehensive Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.
*  Yeah, okay, let's just be clear, this isn't a ceasefire. This would mean pausing the slaughter
*  for a few weeks, exchanging some hostages and then continuing the mass slaughter until the end point
*  defined by Hamas as until Hamas is entirely defeated, which is completely impossible for
*  many reasons, one of them being a state engaged in a genocidal onslaught would mean enraged and
*  traumatised survivors will keep taking up arms, however many existing militants you kill, and
*  another being that Israel defines Hamas in a completely all-encompassing way which allows for,
*  well, genocide. Now, it goes on, this deal. It would also not allow the free movement of civilians
*  from southern Gaza to the north because it endorses Netanyahu's demand for control of the
*  Netarim corridor. So permanently dividing what is already a tiny strip of land the size of East
*  London with a pre-war population of 2.2-2.3 million into a northern and a southern zone with much of
*  the north depopulated and the population desperate, homeless, concentrated in a devastated southern
*  zone. Weird how they're not agreeing to that one, isn't it? And then it goes on, the proposal would
*  also give Israel control of the Ra'afa crossing and the Philadelphia corridor along the Egypt-Gaza
*  border as Netanyahu has demanded. Now, Hamas said Netanyahu also reversed previous concessions and
*  set new conditions in the prisoner exchange process. So permanent total control of a divided Gaza
*  by Israel as it fights a forever war. I cannot believe Hamas is not agreeing to this deal.
*  I would also note the Israeli state is not getting its hostages back alive like this,
*  and we should always be clear that taking your civilians as hostages, whoever does it, is a grave
*  war crime. Six Israeli hostages who should never have been taken, well their bodies have been
*  retrieved by the IDF, all of them killed. And as per Israeli news sources, the initial assessment
*  is they suffocated in tunnels because of gas from an Israeli army attack. Hidious and again underlines
*  that the mass slaughter of Gaza includes the mass slaughter of Israeli hostages
*  by Israeli armed forces. Those remaining hostages will only be returned alive with an actual
*  permanent ceasefire deal, but that is too late, much too late for so many of those hostages.
*  Now let's finally listen to a former negotiator for Israel, Daniel Levy, who is a brilliant
*  analyst who I've interviewed on this channel. Wishful thinking is not a policy, spin is not
*  a policy, but it can get you through new cycles. So the BBC and much of the American and other
*  Western media are reporting in optimistic ways that maybe there's a deal being done because that's
*  what US officialdom is telling them. But I can tell you that in the region no one is buying it,
*  your own correspondent of course, and the way you've said it is to put skepticism on this,
*  but if they can just get through, muddle through Chicago, hopefully muddle through an election
*  season as they see it, and this isn't just about words, but what they're doing is they're saying
*  to the Iranian axis, you are going to undermine this and using that time in order to place
*  further military assets in the region. So what you have is a US that is trying to make sure
*  that its ally Israel continues to have freedom of operation. Interestingly, the Israeli security
*  establishment is background briefing that Netanyahu is still not giving the kind of mandate
*  to negotiators that could bring a deal. The hostage families in Israel are out briefing,
*  they don't trust the Prime Minister. One of the people found recovered bodies today,
*  one understands could have been part of an earlier deal had Netanyahu agreed to it. This is
*  unfortunately the result of the Israeli system being treated with an impunity, not being held
*  accountable to what it's doing, because of course Hamas should not be holding these Israeli
*  civilians, that's a crime. Israel should not be conducting the actions which have led to
*  arrest warrant requested in international criminal court, have led to urgent measures being
*  called for by the international court of justice because of plausible genocide.
*  None of these things should be happening. But Netanyahu is able to carry on because the US runs
*  cover and indeed the US is about to, it seems, place the blame again at Hamas' door when that
*  does not accord with the facts. So this is all a sham, a sham to help the Democratic Party get
*  through the elections and shore up Israel's regional role. As he says, the Israeli system
*  enjoys impunity and this is all being set up so Hamas is presented as being to blame when as he
*  says that does not accord with the facts. Look, I get it, I get it guys, I get the desperation to
*  stop Donald Trump, I get the specific threat he poses to an already heavily caveated US democracy,
*  I get the plausible threat of civil war in the United States, I get what a menace Trump also
*  represents to the Palestinian people, but some leverage has to be brought to bear here because
*  what actual tangible evidence is there that Kamala Harris is going to stop Israel's genocide,
*  let alone Joe Biden given he has months still in office in which as things stand,
*  tens of thousands of more people are set to be killed. In any case, Biden is lying. Don't believe
*  him. Don't let him get away with it. Please like and subscribe, leave your thoughts and your
