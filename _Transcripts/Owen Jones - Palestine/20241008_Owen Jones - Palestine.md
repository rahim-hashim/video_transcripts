# ONE THOUSAND Israeli Soldiers Face War Crimes Complaint - w. Dyab Abou Jahjah
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrPwjsK5GoQ)
*  It's now been just over a year of Israel's genocidal onslaught against Gaza. And of course,
*  what we've seen is impunity, the sense of the Israeli state, quite rationally, they're in now
*  that they are above the law, that they can get away with anything. And they have committed war
*  crimes and crimes against humanity, some of the most depraved atrocities of our age in full display
*  of the world every single day. Now, of course, a lot of focus has been on those at the top,
*  the leaders. And we, of course, at the moment have the ongoing, for example, International Criminal
*  Court Chief Prosecutors' Request for Arrest War, it's against specifically Israeli Prime Minister
*  Benjamin Netanyahu and his defence minister, Galeh. But it's not just the leaders and those at the top
*  of the army that matter, it's the soldiers, the Israeli soldiers, who every single day, including
*  as you're listening to this, are committing war crimes and crimes against humanity. They think
*  they have impunity again, in the here and now they do, but will they have impunity forever?
*  Now, this is a crucial, crucial discussion. The Hin Rajab Foundation has just released,
*  and that opened up their case, which we'll talk about against a thousand Israeli soldiers,
*  and with evidence, huge amounts of evidence amassed against them. And just so we know,
*  just in case people aren't familiar, Hin Rajab, of course, was that little girl, little six-year-old
*  Palestinian girl, who was butchered by the Israeli state, desperately terrified in her car, butchered
*  along with four of her cousins and her aunt, uncle, and we heard her last phone call to the
*  Palestine Red Crescent, the paramedics were sent to save her, they were butchered as well, and the
*  investigation into it. If you read forensic architecture, nobody can any doubt the soldiers
*  knew who in the car when they killed all of them. Now, I'm really delighted to be joined by Jab Abu
*  Zaharja, who is political activist and spokesperson for the Hin Rajab Foundation. Firstly,
*  it's great to see you. Thank you for being here to talk to us about this.
*  Thank you.
*  Crucial.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  Let's just start, shall we, with what's just been released, basically. So you filed this complaint
*  against a thousand Israeli soldiers. Can you just tell me who's been involved in this,
*  and over what time period, and how this all came about?
*  Yes, it all basically started, first of all, thank you for having me, Owen.
*  It all started in November last year, one month into the genocide in Gaza, when a group of
*  activists, including myself, came together and said, we have to do something. We have to do
*  something about it. We've seen a lot of things happening. A lot of people have been organizing,
*  a lot of people, media figures like yourself have been communicating, and everything,
*  you know, every bit helps. We wanted to contribute, and we thought, okay, let's
*  organize ourselves. We founded something called the March 30 Movement, in reference to land date,
*  basically, the Palestinian land date. The March 30 Movement started filing complaints.
*  It came about because we noticed that we have a lot of lawyers among us, and we thought, okay,
*  there's a lot of lawyers, so let's take the legal avenue. There are people organizing demonstrations,
*  that is great, that has to happen. Other people are communicating in the media, and okay, let's
*  do something about litigation, and basically offensive litigation. So we started with a
*  strategy initially, out of the March 30 Movement, to target the Israeli soldiers who are by the
*  nationals, who are dual nationals, who have nationalities of European countries. The logic
*  behind that is that these people, as you said in your introduction, we cannot just keep things
*  symbolic, even though symbols are very important, but symbolic about trying to reach the top,
*  Netanyahu, Galant, which is great. We have to reach them, and we totally support the approach
*  of the ICC trying to get there, or the condemnation of the state of Israel itself
*  that's being done, or that South Africa is trying in the ICC. So these are great initiatives,
*  but we felt that we need to go after the soldiers themselves, because there are many layers to that,
*  and one of them is, on the practical level, that these soldiers, unlike the heads of states,
*  do not have an argument as to enjoying, I would say, that immunity, legal immunity, while a head
*  of state, there's a whole debate about that. Secondly, there's no debate of jurisdiction,
*  when it comes to nationals of, let's say, Belgium, my country, where I live, or the Netherlands. If
*  you are a citizen of the Netherlands or Belgium, and you are committing war crimes abroad, which
*  is the case of these soldiers in Gaza, then you are accountable to your country, to your home
*  country. So there's no debate on jurisdiction, which is the case when you're talking international
*  law. So these are the advantages of the national law approach, right? So we started filing these
*  cases as March 30 movement against the binational, and we're still working on them. So this is an
*  avenue that we will never leave. Now, as we've been researching to look for these binationals,
*  we've been coming in our research, we've been finding a lot of soldiers who are Israeli
*  themselves. They don't have other nationalities, or we cannot prove these other nationalities,
*  but they were committing terrible things. So we're amassing this data, of course,
*  and keeping it, thinking that, well, this might come handy, and after the genocide, hopefully,
*  there will be some kind of legal attribution, legal accountability. So we were documenting
*  this since November last year. At a certain moment, I think a few months ago, we realized
*  that we have a huge amount of data on these soldiers, not just on the binationals, which we
*  are pursuing already actively in the Netherlands and France and Belgium, even in other countries
*  as well, that we will declare soon. We realized we maybe can do something with that. At the same
*  moment, you had the talk about Karim Khan wanting to issue an arrest warrant on Netanyahu and Gala.
*  To be clear, that's the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court.
*  Yes. And then as you know, probably the audience as well, there have been a lot of pressure on the
*  ICC in terms of trying to block them from issuing this. Countries were intervening, Germany, UK,
*  at a certain moment. There have been even threats from politicians, congressmen in the United States.
*  So we thought, OK, it's all focused about Netanyahu and Gala, and the Israelis claim, OK,
*  you do not have jurisdiction on us. They're claiming, of course, immunity. So we thought, OK,
*  we should strengthen the position of Karim Khan. How about introducing a case to the ICC this time
*  and not to local courts against Israeli soldiers? So at that same moment, we have decided also to
*  start the Hind Rajab Foundation, which is now the umbrella under which we will be doing all
*  our litigation, including the binational. So everything, the March 30 movement will no more
*  do litigation under that name. The March 30 movement will focus on narrative and on media
*  communication and so on. And the Hind Rajab Foundation was founded to continue the way of
*  litigation. And this is how this data that we have been gathering became a project of a complaint.
*  Of course, we had still to process, to create criteria, to check the evidence, to see if it's
*  acceptable in a court of law, to, you know, to clean it up, basically, in order to and also to
*  develop the argument, the argumentation, to have a very solid case. And that all became,
*  you know, ready, let's say, a few weeks ago, we just made the last touches and we have a very
*  solid case against 1000 Israeli soldiers. We on purpose, we did not include a lot of binational.
*  We included some binational symbolically, for example, you know, 12 people from France, even
*  though we have more than 50 profiles in France. But, you know, but everybody that is included in
*  this complaint, every one of the 1000 soldier is identified by name, has a whole file that is,
*  that has been individually worked by our lawyers. So it's not that kind of complaint that is, you
*  know, attacking a batch, let's say, of potential culprits, you know, it's, it is, it's 1000
*  individually worked files. So it's a huge issue. Yeah, it's not overall complicity, you're actually
*  going for specific crimes committed by individuals. So they're individuals who committed specific
*  crimes attached to them. Just to be clear on this, you have over 8000 pieces of verifiable evidence.
*  So the point is, you're trying to get, well, the point is to have to a legal standard. So it's,
*  you know, there are lots of bits of evidence, which we will find hideously distasteful and horrible,
*  but that doesn't make them a crime. So you're applying a standard which is this is criminal,
*  which includes videos, audio recordings, forensic reports and social media documentation.
*  I suppose what I put you with, you know, is often we described this genocide as the most documented
*  genocide in human history. That is partly due to technological improvement that is partly down to
*  the courage of Palestinian journalists who've been slaughtered and slaughtered in unprecedented
*  numbers. But it's also due to the fact that Israeli soldiers just keep posting their war crimes online.
*  I'll just say just in a documentary about this, because they think they're above the law. They
*  think they have impunity and they also are overwhelmed by this combination of genocide,
*  of mania and racism, which go together clearly. But I mean, they just think, you know, they're
*  posting it because they get social cache out of it. They're getting pats on the back. They're
*  getting likes and retweets and people giving them emojis on their various social media platforms.
*  Just describe that because you are basically being helped by the evidence provided by Israeli
*  soldiers. That's what you're doing. I think mainly the evidence is provided by Israeli soldiers,
*  except when it comes to forensic evidence when we have to, for example, pinpoint a certain brigade
*  at a certain time near a crime scene. And we can link, for example, a soldier that is,
*  you know, you need, when you take the picture of a soldier standing on the rubble of a house,
*  for example, and posting genocidal statements such as, we will wipe out Amalek from under the skies.
*  But this is what you see on social media. But in order to make it a piece of evidence to present
*  in a court of law in a serious manner, you have to take this, you have to extract the metadata,
*  if you can, of that. You have to be able of locating to have forensic analysis to
*  geolocate the house and try to see when was the picture taken and try to see what happened around
*  that day there and what brigade was there and what brigade is that soldier. So there's a lot of work
*  that you have to build around a file in order to transform that social media post of an Israeli
*  soldier into evidence that you can present in a court. So this was mainly the work that we had
*  to do because, as you said, the Israeli soldiers have been themselves posting these things. So,
*  and, you know, it's very interesting to try to analyze that, you know, I think
*  books will be written on that, psychological books will be written on that, and trying to understand
*  the level of, you know, moral decadence that this reflects and how that also reflects on
*  the general ideology that is driving this genocide because this is also, you know,
*  it's not just a matter of individual choice, there's something collective behind that,
*  there's some kind of, you know, collective psychosis that is genocidal and this is very scary,
*  obviously. And, you know, I've just seen images from South Lebanon today and you see the same
*  playbook being repeated there, you know, taking pictures, filming themselves in people's houses,
*  playing with people's belongings, blowing up the houses in some kind of, you know, like a scene as
*  if it is a movie scene. So there's something, there's a pattern here and obviously, you know,
*  I don't want to do this, this work has to be done obviously, but I wonder in how far is it also a
*  part of the Israeli strategy in this genocide, how far is this part of the, you know, psychological
*  warfare that's being waged? So it is indeed helpful on the one side that they are doing this,
*  but it makes me think the fact that they keep doing this, there's like, there's arrogance in this,
*  a feeling of impunity in this that, you know, nobody can touch us even though, look, we're
*  letting you see what we're doing, but this is not only coming from the soldiers themselves,
*  this is coming also from their leadership, from the chain of command that is not intervening in
*  terms of pay attention. So one nuance in this whole thing Owen is the binationalists, you know,
*  and this is another also importance for the binational, you know, complaints that we're still
*  pursuing. We noticed that binationalists when targeted by complaints, they immediately start
*  deleting their profiles or putting them on private and hiding because they, why? Because they think
*  they will come back to Europe, so they feel that they are within the reach of national law at least,
*  even if they do not take international law seriously, they feel we might be held responsible
*  in Belgium or in the Netherlands. So that's the only nuance into this sentiment of impunity that
*  is clearly present among them. Just so we're clear about the sorts of crimes that you're examining,
*  so they're divided up into, I can see, five categories. So one is destruction of civilian
*  infrastructure, targeted attacks on homes, hospitals, schools, markets, mosques,
*  or civilian infrastructure. And we should note Gaza now looks like a different color and texture
*  from space, given most civilian infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed altogether.
*  Illegal occupation and looting, so going through civilian homes, looting their belongings,
*  exploiting occupied properties, participation in the Gaza blockade. And we should note the moment
*  the International Criminal Court's case so far focuses on that. So that's the active role in
*  enforcing a blockade, depriving civilians of the essentials of life, targeting civilians, audio and
*  video evidence showing soldiers deliberately attacking noncombatant individuals, including
*  medical personnel, journalists, use of inhumane warfare tactics, indiscriminate bombing campaigns,
*  starvation, and the systematic destruction of civilian infrastructure. I mean, it's part of
*  this as well to show, I mean, Nuremberg, the classic line was, you can't get away with saying
*  you were following orders. If you commit a crime, it doesn't matter if you've been told to commit
*  a crime, you are committing these crimes. So it's the point of the complicity, always remember the
*  complicity of course, the leadership, but it's the fact you're showing that these all are all
*  specific crimes and these people might be drunk on hubris now, might be drunk on racism and
*  genocidal mania, but they're still committing grievous crimes. And this is, you know, holding
*  them to account. Absolutely. And they are individually responsible for this before
*  talking about their state being responsible. I think this is a dimension that we should stress
*  because, and I agree, we need to talk about the genocide as is, and we need to talk about crimes
*  against humanity. But one of the main features of a genocide is that it's collective, right?
*  Genocide is collective. It is also a genocide in any other crime against humanity is called
*  that because it is the emanation of a policy by certain leadership that has the intention to
*  destroy in part or in total a group or a population. So the nature of genocide is collective and is
*  related to policy. If there's no policy, you cannot talk of genocide. You cannot prove intent by the
*  leadership. You cannot talk of genocide. Okay. However, you know, if you look at all these
*  soldiers, right? And what they're committing, this is they are committing clearly war crimes,
*  right? You cannot say that each one of them is committing a genocide, but the aggregation of
*  their crimes form genocide when it's connected to the communication of Netanyahu and the other
*  leadership who are clearly showing intent of destroying the population of Gaza in whole or
*  in part, which is clearly, and it can be proven and court of law beyond any possible doubt. So
*  there is clearly a genocide going on. But if we dismantle this genocide into small war crimes
*  committed by these soldiers, it might sound less bad or let's say, you know, let's say less extreme
*  because war crimes. Yeah. And every, every war you have war crimes. Cause this is when, when a
*  soldier is burning a house or a shooting civilian is committing a war crime. If you can prove that
*  this is a policy that has been systematically being applied, then is that, then it's genocide,
*  right? So, but it's important to hold them responsible for their war crime. So that indeed,
*  as you said in your question, in your introduction, indeed that they cannot hide behind the argument
*  of them being just following order. They are next to the genocidal endeavor that is clearly present
*  and directed by the Israeli leadership. There is that dimension of sadistic war crimes that are
*  being committed by these soldiers that makes them individually accountable. Even, even if for some
*  absurd reason, Israel is not considered to have committed genocide. Imagine that this things go
*  bad on that level, which I don't expect at all to go, but let's for the sake of argument, even then
*  these individuals are clearly clearly committing war crimes and they are war criminals. So this is
*  the, I think this is an important dimension. And I think this is why, you know, this is very concrete.
*  It's, it's very, it's not an abstract notion. This is a very concrete thing.
*  And I should know, you know, Galan, the defense minister, just to show the dire catastrophic
*  nature of Western journalism, because you think, you know, if we had a functioning media coverage
*  would have been framed around this, but it's striking that he said on the 9th of October,
*  he told troops on the Gaza border who he addressed, he said that he had released all the restraints,
*  i.e. on them. And he said to them that Gaza won't return to what it was before. We will
*  eliminate everything. If it doesn't take one day, it will take a week. It will take weeks, even months.
*  We will reach all places. And then the next day, he said Israel was moving to a full scale response
*  and he had removed every restriction on Israeli forces. So the point is, again, they're committing
*  individual crimes and they have been clearly, I mean, the Israeli state just said fill your
*  boots. You can do what you want. There's no doubt about that. There's no doubt about that.
*  And this is, of course, you know, on the level of magnitude, this is much, you know, much more
*  important to come to that condemnation of the genocide. I mean, the first, the most important
*  goal of the March 30 movement to speak about that is to recognize the Gaza genocide, because it's
*  important to acknowledge that genocide as such. But I think within the arsenal, the legal arsenal
*  that we have, we have to also establish accountability on the individual level.
*  And also, you know, we need to create a sense of accountability, even if we start with the
*  weakest links. And these weakest links are these soldiers. And because we know, we know
*  that international law and we support it, you know, fullheartedly. And we, everything we're
*  doing is because we still did not lose hope that international law can be upheld, because
*  imagine we lose this hope and we fall into cynicism. I think we're heading towards a world
*  where nobody of us would like to, you know, live in because, you know, you're totally in a
*  jungle. And, but, so we're keeping the hope despite all the indication of hypocrisy and
*  double standards and the fact that the United States is weighing hard into shielding and not
*  just the United States, but also Germany or the UK, more or less less now, but still, you know,
*  quite dubious and many other European countries are also part of this creating this immunity,
*  this umbrella, you know, this is not just an act of nature. This is an act of policy, you know,
*  of Western governments. So despite all this, we believe that the crimes that committed by Israel,
*  starting by genocide and going down into simple war crimes, simple, I mean, you know, what's in
*  the world? I mean, it's a terrible thing, a war crime, but you know, when genocide is being unfolded,
*  you know, then you tend to see that less. So all these, this whole, this whole spectrum of crimes
*  should be addressed. And I believe that, okay, we, we need to work on all levels. We need to
*  support South Africa and what they're doing on the ICJ. This is great initiative and it's very
*  hopeful. The ICJ is very hopeful. The ICC, we need to give it drive, you know, Karim Khan took long.
*  He was slow. I don't think he was very enthusiastic into doing something, but eventually he moved. So
*  we need to give him fuel, fuel his, give him arguments, give him, and that's why we, we wanted
*  also to present all these information because he can say, look, guys, it's not just about, it's not
*  a political thing because when you attack, I mean, when he wants to issue a warrant against
*  Netanyahu, the argument, if you read what the congressmen have written, he's immediately being
*  accused of being biased against Israel and political. But when you present all, all this data of
*  crimes, individual crimes, I mean, how can you then call somebody shooting a civilian? What is that?
*  You know, somebody who was shooting an unarmed civilian in conflict, a sniper who is, you know,
*  blocking entry to somebody who's laying on the ground and dying and you have medics trying to
*  reach that person, the sniper trying to shoot the medics, you know, and playing that game,
*  leaving that person alive. So how can you call that? There's no debate on politics there. These
*  are clear, these are clear-cut crimes, you know. So this helps, I think, the effort into eventually
*  in the aggregation, you know, proving the genocide beyond reasonable doubt to anybody.
*  Just a couple of final things. The foundation's name after Hinn Rajab, who, as I've noted,
*  is this six-year-old girl who was violently killed by the Israeli state alongside her family, her
*  15-year-old cousin, Rang, the person I read to present you here, being killed on that phone call.
*  You hear her desperately scared, scared of the dark, terrified, the paramedics then killed on
*  the way when those coordinates were shared with Israeli military. And the investigation shows by
*  forensic architecture that given how close the tanks were and all the rest of it, there's no way
*  they couldn't see who was in the car. That's just one example. Why is it so important for the
*  victims, this? Because we're talking here, of course, about perpetrators, but you've named the
*  foundation clearly after one of the most famous victims, and I'm afraid one of a countless number.
*  We have no idea how many children have been killed, but it is many, many, many, many thousands.
*  So what does this mean for, where do the victims feature in all this in terms of why this is
*  important? Yeah, but to start with, the story of Hind Rajab is heartbreaking. I mean, it breaks my
*  heart every day. But despite the emotionality of that story, I think the importance of it is that
*  it symbolizes the victims of the Gaza genocide, and it symbolizes especially the fact that this
*  genocide has been targeting and inflicting incredible toll of death, death toll on children.
*  This is one of the unique features of the genocide and unique in a macabre way. So Hind Rajab
*  symbolizes all this, all the victims, of course, also men and women, but also children. And also
*  the way Hind was murdered is an example of that sadistic approach. Hind was calling for help,
*  the Israelis bombed the ambulance going there, they did not let help arrive, eventually she was
*  killed in the car. So it's an extreme act, and it has that same arrogance that they are also manifesting
*  in these different occasions, but in the most extreme way. So this is why we went with the name
*  Hind Rajab, because it symbolizes everything. And I don't like comparisons, and every historical
*  comparison is wrong somewhere, but Hind Rajab is like the Anne Frank of this genocide.
*  It is something that's going to come to symbolize this, and we want it also to haunt the perpetrators,
*  to inspire the people who go for this just cause and try to uphold justice and accountability.
*  But on the other hand, we don't want the story of Hind's story to end there, to end just by
*  the agony and the drama and the pain. We want it to become a story of vindication, of justice.
*  So this is a bit symbolic behind it. And the victim story, part of our mission in the Hind
*  Rajab Foundation, next to the pursuing justice through litigation against the perpetrators
*  and people who are accomplices, also we want to preserve the memory of the victims.
*  There is a work on memory that has to be done. These people are not numbers, these are human
*  beings with dreams, with feelings, with stories, and this has to be put forward. So we have a lot
*  of projects in that regard as well. Of course, now we're prioritizing litigation, but preserving
*  the memory of the victims is something very important for us. So this is a bit the logic
*  behind this choice. And just finally, a lot of people go, look, they'll be defeatist. They'll
*  there will never be justice here. These Israeli soldiers are right on one level.
*  They aren't going to get away with anything they want. This impunity is, they've got the world's
*  only hegemon behind them. So at the end of the day, they'll just keep committing these atrocities
*  because they know they can get away with them. What do you say to that? What do you say to people
*  who go, this is fine in terms of for memory, but for actual dragging these murdering war criminals
*  through courts for what they've done? That's never going to happen. What do you say to that?
*  First thing I say is I hear you. I hear you and I feel this and every day I'm struggling with this
*  as well. Every day I get up and I have a feeling because we look at reality. We can also see the
*  geopolitical reality and what you described in terms of hegemony and how things are in this world.
*  But what keeps us going and what keeps me, I can speak personally in this, is that the fact that
*  I believe that nothing, no reality or no situation will last forever. And that's one part of our work.
*  Of course, we have first to try. I don't think even if our chances are slim compared when you
*  take the balance of power into account, and I mean internationally, but I will give you some
*  points of hope and light. One element is, before talking about the element of time, which is
*  important, which is the most hopeful thing, but let's start with what we can do today and the
*  the places where this impunity of Israel is not completely up or cannot be completely upheld.
*  And this is again national law, national courts. If international law is completely or for a big
*  part being, let's say, blocked by the United States of America at this stage, or influenced by it or
*  intimidated by it, which is the case definitely in the ICC, and hopefully they can withstand that
*  pressure, and also for partly in the ICJ even. So national law is not always like that. I'll give
*  you an example of Belgium, my country. So here in Belgium, we have a, if you file a complaint as a
*  victim, a direct victim of a crime, and the perpetrator of that crime, and you are Belgian
*  citizen or resident of Belgium, and the perpetrator of that crime also is a Belgian citizen or a
*  resident of Belgium, then Belgium has absolute jurisdiction over that crime. And we have a
*  system in Belgium called the Constitution of Civil Parties. So when victims file a complaint,
*  nobody will take a decision whether they will pursue investigation, yes or no. It's automatic.
*  This is not the case in the Netherlands, for example. This is not completely the case in France.
*  France is a hybrid situation between the two legal systems, but in Belgium, this is the case.
*  So now we are working on cases against 13 Belgian nationals who are committing war crimes in Gaza,
*  and the people who will file the complaints are not foundations like ourselves or organizations,
*  but individuals. We are, of course, trying to help this whole process and try to support it,
*  but the people who are filing the complaint will be direct victims of them who are also Belgian
*  citizens or relatives of victims who are also Belgian. So this means that we will have our
*  Dane Court in Belgium. I know that for a fact that Dane in court in Belgium will come. So,
*  and I believe that, okay, you can say, you know, justice is also biased and, and yes, we can be
*  critical, but I believe it's not always the case. There's always ways, you know, they have been
*  all through history and other issues, whether it's war crimes and genocide, or even struggles of,
*  you know, popular classes and countries or whatever, they have always been victories in the
*  court. You know, I'm not saying this is the only way. That's why I said we just do our bits in one
*  corner of the struggle and people should be doing all the demonstrations are crucial. The media work
*  is crucial. You know, the resistance on the ground is crucial. Everything is crucial. So
*  we have to do our bits and I believe we can have some justice in court and that if you can condemn
*  one Israeli soldier in Belgium for war crimes and crimes against humanity, by definition, you
*  condemned the whole Israeli military endeavor and political leadership of committing this genocide.
*  If only one soldier can be condemned, you put that on the record. So in that sense, I keep that hope
*  and I believe that we can, I hope also, for example, Karim Khan will issue, you know,
*  these mandates, these warrants. I hope he will do that because if he does that, this is not
*  no little games. This is not something small. Yeah, well, he's issued the request. It's the
*  pre-trial judges, of course, you have to prove them. Yeah, but imagine to go there. Imagine it
*  happens and I'm not sure it will, but imagine this is huge. This means if Netanyahu wants to
*  visit Europe, you know, one of two possibilities, either he cannot or Europe has to say, look, we
*  don't care about international law. You know, America said already, we don't care about
*  international law. America has even a law called the Hague Invasion Act. But Europe tries to sell
*  you a narrative of respecting international rights and we know we can all nuance that.
*  But eventually, you know, when there is a clear, you know, mandate to arrest somebody like Netanyahu,
*  then there's no way to nuance it anymore. Whether you reject the ICC completely and which will be a
*  revolution in the wrong way and the wrong direction, or you have to uphold it. And then
*  that's as such is an important victory if somebody like Netanyahu does no more dare to visit Europe,
*  for example. You know, so I know this is not enough when you look at the injustice. This is
*  not enough when you look at this genocide. But, you know, we should never give up. And the last
*  thing that I want to say is that element of time, which is the biggest, I think, you know, the act
*  of hope or let's say the faith in justice is for me related also to the fact that time is changing.
*  And I believe that this movement and this awareness that is being, you know, building up now
*  worldwide, people who are for the first time understanding the Palestinian question as it is,
*  and understanding the nature of Zionism as such, I believe this will eventually, you know, change
*  the realities, political realities, and even in the United States. I'm hopeful in that. And I know
*  it looks very far now with, if you look at the current elections, you know, campaign in the
*  United States, doesn't look very hopeful on both ends. But I think this is a matter of time. I
*  believe that within, you know, maybe a generation and you will say, are you working for a generation?
*  Yeah, of course, we have to work long term. You know, so yeah, I'm working for, I'm trying to do
*  my little bit, you know, with my colleagues into building, maybe contributing a little bit to what
*  might become effective within a generation. You know, the other option is to give up and we're
*  not going to give up. Impossible. No, that's definitely the good place to start. Never,
*  ever give up. And there is always hope. And we can see that in terms of how public opinion has
*  shifted in Western states, which Israel depends on, including, I know, in the United States of
*  America, where most Democrats, Democratic voters think Israel is committing genocide. But also,
*  if you look in Britain, where 70% think Israel is committing war crimes, 55% of Britain's support
*  Benjamin Netanyahu's arrest for war crimes and crimes against humanity. I could go on.
*  And we owe it to the victims and we owe it to hint that symbolizes them. We owe it to them.
*  Yeah. Amen. Well, this is crucial work. And do check out the Hinrajab Foundation website,
*  hinrajabfoundation.org. You can donate to support their work. So they continue
*  going through hideous material. There's a lot of emotional labor involved going through depravity.
*  But it's really crucial work. So please, for everyone who's watched, listened, please share
*  this video, press like, subscribe, leave your comments and thoughts. Good for the algorithm.
*  More people watch, more people engage. That's the whole point. But yeah, honestly, thank you
*  so much and well done for your work. Thank you. Thank you very much.
