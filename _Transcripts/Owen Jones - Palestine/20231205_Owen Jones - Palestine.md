# The VILEST Lie About Gaza Yet
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [December 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqz9YBiKpms)
*  This is just so grotesque, so sickening, so stomach-churning that it's hard to know where to even begin.
*  The horror of everything that's been happening over the last two months has been so intense
*  that it may seem that nothing will shock anymore.
*  It's important we guard against that.
*  We don't normalise what should be regarded as a crime of historic proportions.
*  Now, reliable estimates suggest that around 20,000 civilians have been killed by Israel's onslaught against Gaza,
*  of which over 8,300 are children.
*  I'll come on to why those statistics are reliable shortly,
*  because in this video we're discussing atrocity denial.
*  There's a particularly shocking example of atrocity denial, which is currently going viral at the moment.
*  You're going to find it hard to believe if you haven't come across it already.
*  Now, let's just listen to Fleur Hassan Nahou.
*  She's deputy mayor of Jerusalem.
*  I've never interacted with her before, but I discovered she has blocked me on Twitter.
*  Anyway, she was interviewed on Sky News.
*  What do you think the death toll is?
*  I have no idea.
*  I'm sure it's thousands, but we believe that most of them are combatants,
*  because we've been doing as much as we can to make it into a tweezer operation.
*  Why does it tell me that yesterday, day before on social media,
*  there's a woman with essentially, or pretending it's a dead baby,
*  and when you look a little bit closer, it's a doll.
*  If there are so many dead babies, why are they using a doll?
*  So you think the death toll is significantly lower than 15,000, and most of them are combatants?
*  Yes, I do.
*  Let's just repeat what she said here.
*  A woman essentially pretending it's a dead baby,
*  and then you look a little bit closer and it's a doll.
*  If there are so many dead babies, why are they using a doll?
*  She was not corrected by Sky News, as you probably noted, when she said this.
*  Now, claims Palestinians are faking the deaths of their own babies
*  have been systematically spread by the Israeli state and its cheerleaders.
*  Back in October, the official Israeli account tweeted,
*  Hamas accidentally posted a video of a doll, yes, a doll,
*  suggesting that it was part of casualties caused by an IDF attack.
*  Now, this was false, and they quietly deleted it.
*  The Jerusalem Post, on the 1st of December, posted an article
*  headlined,
*  Al Jazeera Post Blurred Doll Claims It to be a Dead Palestinian Baby.
*  Now, again, false.
*  There was an uproar.
*  They took the article down and issued a mealy-mouthed statement
*  about how this grotesque false claim did not meet our editorial standards
*  and was thus removed, and that they regret this incident.
*  Sorry truly seems to be the hardest word,
*  especially when you're spreading fake claims
*  that grieving parents are faking the deaths of their own children,
*  their own babies, by using dolls.
*  The claim has also been spread by Israeli diplomats.
*  Davi Antebi, deputy head of the Israeli mission to Denmark,
*  he posted video clips of grieving Palestinian parents holding their dead babies,
*  writing,
*  What do you even say?
*  Absolutely vile stuff.
*  Yosef Haddad, a contributor at Israeli TV news channel,
*  I24 News, tweets,
*  In other words, their false propaganda is just embarrassing.
*  Note the ridicule, the derision,
*  as they talk about what are actually dead babies.
*  It's also been spread, this false claim by Vizagrad24,
*  a viral account which pushes far-right propaganda,
*  allegedly has received funding from Poland's far-right government,
*  incidentally, an allegation which certainly needs further investigation.
*  They tweeted,
*  They then quietly delete it.
*  Again, no apology.
*  To be clear, this is a lie.
*  It's been debunked by journalists at BBC Verify,
*  as one of them tweets,
*  False claims that the body of Mohammed Hani Al Zahar,
*  a five-month-old Palestinian baby, is a doll, are going viral.
*  Multiple images of Mohammed have already been published by professional journalists,
*  clarifying he's a real dead baby.
*  His body is going through rigor mortis.
*  What do you say, honestly?
*  He goes on to tweet,
*  This is the second time, he says,
*  totally false claims that a dead Palestinian child is a doll, are going viral online.
*  Now, if you want to know how messed up this is,
*  though I think surely it speaks for itself,
*  how disturbed this is getting,
*  one pro-Israeli influencer had a viral tweet with 1.2 million views in which he wrote,
*  He goes on to say that their price is $60 in China
*  and that Hamas has imported hundreds of them.
*  Here is a recent case study in atrocity denial,
*  a deliberate and systematic attempt to sow doubt in the public's mind
*  about the murderous consequences of Israel's onslaught.
*  They know public opinion in the West is turning against this Israeli onslaught
*  as people see so many innocent people, including little kids,
*  including babies being violently killed.
*  And so they want to make public opinion think this isn't real.
*  They're not really dying.
*  It's one big hoax that ordinary Palestinians are so depraved and morally twisted
*  that they would lie about their own little ones dying by parading dolls in front of cameras.
*  Hideous.
*  Doesn't even begin to cover it.
*  Well, there are no shortage of dead children,
*  of dead babies in the killing fields of Gaza.
*  We began this video with the uncorrected claim on Sky News
*  by Fleur Hassan Nahoum, the deputy mayor of Jerusalem,
*  that Palestinians were pretending to grieve over dolls
*  instead of their actual dead babies.
*  And she used this as an example to make a broader point
*  that you should not trust the figures being presented as Gaza's actual death toll.
*  The basis for this is those figures come from Gaza's administration,
*  which is run by Hamas.
*  Superficially, not a bad objection.
*  Park the nature of Hamas for a minute.
*  You should never defer to the claims of any party in a war
*  because all parties in warfare, whoever they are, engage in propaganda.
*  They have done as long as war has existed.
*  Instead, you have to look critically at the evidence base.
*  And that's this.
*  Firstly, that the death toll presented by the Gaza administration
*  in previous conflicts with Israel has always at the end of warfare
*  been validated by both the Israeli authorities and the United Nations.
*  Secondly, that when Joe Biden publicly doubted the figures at the end of October,
*  atrocity denial, the administration released the names,
*  ages and crucially, Israel assigned IDs of all deaths.
*  That's because Israel still controls the Palestinian Population Registry,
*  a computerized database of names and ID numbers
*  that proved that the death tally at the time was entirely correct.
*  Thirdly, Haaretz, the Haaretz, sorry, the Israeli respectable newspaper,
*  very respectable, has reported that the figures provided by the Gaza Health
*  Ministry and Government Media Office do not deviate significantly
*  from Israel's own private estimates.
*  Fourthly, last month, Barbara Leaf, Assistant Secretary of State
*  for Near Eastern Affairs, told a House panel, House, that is,
*  Congress, that the number of those killed at that point was likely higher
*  than was being cited.
*  What does she mean by that?
*  She means the figures officially presented by Gaza's administration.
*  This is a critical point.
*  The death toll officially excludes those missing,
*  that is, those buried beneath the rubble.
*  The brutal truth is that society in Gaza has collapsed to the degree
*  that thousands of bodies are under rubble or simply abandoned.
*  It's not possible to retrieve them or their details
*  or to include them, therefore, in any official death toll.
*  Fifthly, it should be said the UN and independent agencies say
*  the official death toll is credible and have also pointed to the bodies
*  under the rubble.
*  That's why I've been using the figures from Euromed Human Rights Monitor.
*  That's a Geneva-based independent organisation.
*  They're chaired by Richard Falk.
*  He's the former UN Special Rapporteur on human rights
*  in the Occupied Territory, as well as being Professor Emeritus
*  of International Law at Princeton University.
*  These figures do include those buried under the rubble as dead,
*  which is clearly, I'm afraid to say, what they are.
*  And that brings the total death toll as of the 1st of December.
*  Bear in mind that's still four days out of date from before the ceasefire
*  ended and many more have been killed since, but that was over 21,000 dead
*  with an estimate of 19,660 civilians and 8,312 kids and 4,270 women.
*  That means around 60% of those who've suffered violent deaths
*  are women and children.
*  Now, the point publicly being made by the Israeli state and its champions
*  is that how do we know the death toll isn't actually largely Hamas combatants?
*  Well, when the list of names and IDs was released at the end of October,
*  it established that around 39.5% of the dead at that point were children.
*  Women and children together represented the large majority of the dead.
*  Now, many have objected to this approach as though we simply disregard
*  the deaths of men or impugn their innocence.
*  And obviously so many male civilians have been killed too.
*  It's just women and children can credibly be automatically excluded
*  from the category of combatants.
*  An analysis by the brilliant Iraq body count, I'll come on to that,
*  and their work found that few of the victims can have been combatants
*  because, as they say, of the modest excess of adult males
*  can be explained by greater exposure to risk.
*  For example, they say, in rescue efforts.
*  Furthermore, the Israeli army themselves estimate they've killed
*  between 1,000 and 3,000 armed Palestinian militants.
*  The evidence is clear.
*  The horrendous death toll is accurate.
*  And it is overwhelming civilians being killed.
*  And that includes, credibly, over 8,000 children.
*  This atrocity denial is a cynical and morally repulsive attempt
*  to cover those numbers up and the human impact.
*  Now, I don't want to harp on about this because my detractors are
*  intentionally trying to make this all about me.
*  But you may know that I've come under attack because of my response
*  to an IDF screening of atrocities committed by Hamas on the 7th of October.
*  Again, to repeat, in that video, I made it clear that Hamas
*  had committed serious, grave war crimes, including the killing
*  of hundreds of innocent civilians, the killing of unarmed soldiers,
*  which I specifically noted was a separate war crime in its own right,
*  and the taking of hostages and made clear no cause on Earth
*  justifies such war crimes, as it does not.
*  I also emphasised how harrowing the footage was.
*  I remain, frankly, still shocked and horrified about what I saw
*  and how it would stay with me for the rest of my life.
*  I said there wasn't video footage to substantiate some claims made,
*  but made it clear that just because certain atrocities
*  weren't reflected in this footage, it did not mean that they did not happen.
*  I also specifically confronted false claims, which shifted blame away
*  from Hamas for the deaths of Israeli civilians
*  and provided the evidence to back that up.
*  I called to all the video and audio footage in the possession
*  of Israel's authorities to be handed over to independent journalists
*  which I stand by, which shouldn't be controversial,
*  but made it clear this shouldn't detract from the basic point
*  that Hamas killed hundreds of innocent civilians.
*  Alas, several of my critics have lied and willfully distorted
*  what I said, of which more were none.
*  But those are my views, which I have consistently clearly stated,
*  including from the very beginning.
*  I've never questioned the official death toll given by Israel.
*  So you can't accuse me of doing what those apologists for Israel's offence
*  for doing in Gaza.
*  It was originally around 1,400.
*  That was reduced by around 200 officially because some of those killed
*  were found to be Hamas.
*  And according to Haaretz, the newspaper, it's a newspaper,
*  that now means 1,136 Israelis and foreign workers were killed
*  on October the 7th, with 1,262 in total killed since the 7th of October.
*  Of those, 810 are classified as civilian deaths.
*  It's still being updated.
*  But Haaretz's information is 100% credible as far as I'm concerned.
*  I'm not the one disputing death tolls here.
*  This is an atrocious death toll, which is quite understandably
*  traumatised and horrified Israeli society.
*  Hamas should be condemned without reservation for the crimes
*  and atrocities they committed.
*  Now, it has transpired that some of the claims made about 7th of October
*  have been shown to be false.
*  Now, this is an atrocity denial.
*  So discuss this, questioning these claims, as long as it's in the framework
*  of accepting that overall an atrocity has been committed and not disputing
*  the credible official death toll that is not atrocity denial.
*  Some of these inflammatory claims did circulate in order to build consent
*  for committing other atrocities against Palestinians.
*  And this was the entirely justified concern that many had.
*  Now, according to the Israeli newspaper, Haaretz, these false claims,
*  including decapitated babies, I'm sorry to have to go through these again.
*  It's not even very disturbing to even talk about this.
*  Incinerated babies and dead babies hanging on a laundry line.
*  Now, in one case, an Israeli journalist posted a video of himself
*  interviewing a soldier who said babies and children were hung on a clothesline
*  in a row that got hundreds of thousands of views on Twitter.
*  Other journalists challenged this on the basis of publicly available data.
*  And it was then, it should be said, removed, deleted that particular claim.
*  As an example, there is no evidence for it.
*  For a start, the data shows one Israeli baby in total was killed alongside her
*  parents on 7th of October, as well as an unborn child on the way to hospital.
*  Horrendous enough on its own terms.
*  The life of that Israeli baby and the unborn child is worth no less than that
*  of a Palestinian baby.
*  There were other claims too of children bound together and set a lie
*  of pregnant women carved open of a baby in an oven, which Harret has also debunked.
*  Now, the progressive Israeli journalist, Demi Reeder, makes an important point
*  we should engage with.
*  Adufthil, emotional empathy, is very important in these particular horrors
*  that many of these stories may well have originated in good faith and or shock.
*  The first responders on the scene are not forensic investigators,
*  but they stumbled an utter horror which has traumatized so many of them,
*  understandably. It's taboo, I know, to question the testimonies of first responders,
*  but this is an empathetic explanation of why such claims can not always be accepted uncritically.
*  Again, none of this detracts from the fact Harris did commit terrible crimes on 7th of October,
*  which I've seen with my own eyes.
*  Now, Harret has a database of Israeli victims.
*  I've been talking to the brilliant Iraq Body Count, the internationally respected project,
*  which records violent civilian deaths resulting from the Iraq war using public records.
*  They've been doing crucial work on the horror that's been unleashed since 7th of October.
*  They've gone through this database and found that 34 of those Israelis killed on 7th of October were children.
*  That's those under the age of 18.
*  Includes, as I said, one baby and an unborn child killed when their mother was shot in the abdomen on the way to hospital.
*  Now, to be clear, that was an appalling death toll.
*  Appalling death toll. The worth of each of their lives is no different from those of a Palestinian child.
*  You should mourn every loss the same.
*  Innocent, defenseless children, their whole lives ahead of them,
*  ended by the most appalling violence.
*  To be clear, this database isn't complete.
*  We don't have the ages for around a quarter of those killed.
*  There are overseas workers, soldiers and police officers listed where we don't have their ages.
*  But of course, we know they are adults.
*  But I'm not going to include those in the total.
*  That means of the three quarters of those killed on the 7th of October, for whom we do have ages,
*  3.5% were children, Israeli kids.
*  Now, again, every single one of those child deaths, every single one is a tragedy, you know,
*  which would cause this horror, grief.
*  Now, what does this does underline?
*  And it does no way deflect from that horror, is the absolute horror now before in Gaza.
*  If we go by the data with names, ages and IDs released at the end of October for that Gazan death toll,
*  39.5% of those killed by Israeli strikes were children.
*  If we go by the latest estimates of those provided by your American Human Rights Monitor,
*  this proportion has actually stayed eerily static at around 39.5%.
*  In both cases, I'm using overall death tolls.
*  That is, I'm not distinguishing between civilians and combatants to avoid going into the controversy
*  of what proportion of those killed in Gaza are combatants when we know the official total of those killed in Israel.
*  That means the proportion of children killed by Israel's onslaught against Gaza is now over 11 times higher
*  than the proportion of children killed by Hamas on 7th of October in an attack which was rightly condemned
*  as a despicable and sickening atrocity committed against so many innocent people.
*  Now, to be clear, I'm talking about proportions here.
*  Of course, I'm not talking about absolute numbers.
*  Obviously, far, far more times children have now been killed in Gaza.
*  These are all horrible statistics.
*  Every single one of them is a human life.
*  We have to remember that.
*  A human life which was snuffed off, snuffed out violently.
*  Now, given that the Israeli state is claiming that there was a unique horror about Hamas's atrocity on 7th of October in a historical sense,
*  where does that leave the Israeli state given it is killing as a total proportion of the overall dead
*  over 11 times more children as a proportion in Gaza than Hamas did of their hideous death toll in Israel?
*  That isn't in any way, again, and we'll keep saying this because of my bad faith critics,
*  and because it comes from the heart, it is in no way an attempt to minimise the horror committed by Hamas,
*  which nobody should do, is to underline the sheer scale of horror being unleashed by the Israeli state.
*  When I spoke to the brilliant experts of the Iraq body count, they explained that for a start,
*  the smaller size of children, that is the smaller size of their bodies,
*  meant they are more likely to be killed than to survive bomb blasts and other war injuries,
*  whereas Hamas were using mainly handheld weapons,
*  and those southern Israeli communities, of course, are obviously far less densely populated than in Gaza.
*  Now, recent revelations by the Israeli-Palestinian publication Plus 972 exposed, based on interviews with figures in Israeli military intelligence,
*  that the acceptable ratio of civilian casualties per single military target has gone from dozens per military target to hundreds per military target.
*  Combine that with bombing the homes of those alleged to be Hamas militants, even those who are small fry,
*  that means killing them along with often their entire families, including their children and of course, including their babies,
*  as well as tower blocks, which are deemed acceptable targets if half a floor can be said to be used by Hamas,
*  as well as so-called power targets, which include high rises and residential towers in the heart of cities,
*  are the grounds this will create a shock in civil society to get Palestinian civil society to put pressure on Hamas,
*  all the rich indicative, by the way, of grave war crimes and what I would deem clearly to be terrorism.
*  So yes, there is atrocity denial happening amongst all this horror,
*  but the atrocity deniers are those who've refused to take a stand against Israel's onslaught,
*  who refuse to accept the death toll, who refuse to accept the number of children killed,
*  none of which applies in any sense to people like myself, despite their claims.
*  This is all projection on their part.
*  Don't let them get away with this atrocity denial, which is an attempt to deflect from the horror happening right now
*  because of Israel's Western backed onslaught against Gaza and the horrific human cost that entails.
