# Gaza Protest Shutdown Exposed By Jewish Politician - w/. Green Party's Zack Polanski
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg)
*  Now, the protests against Israel's genocide continued this Saturday. There is, of course, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=0.0s)]
*  the respite of the ceasefire, but the killings were and are going on. And clearly, those who [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  believe Netanyahu and Trump and those around them are going to allow the Palestinian people to live [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=10.96s)]
*  in peace and justice, I'm afraid, are going to arrive and collide with a brutal reality. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=16.56s)]
*  Nonetheless, there was an attempt by the police to shut down the protests outside the BBC that [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=21.84s)]
*  attempt was successful. And that protest, which I was attending, as is my brilliant guest here, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=29.2s)]
*  was about the BBC's coverage of the genocide. I wrote a very long investigative piece [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=36.0s)]
*  for Dropsite News. And the point I would make is the claims about the BBC's coverage are made, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  not least by the BBC's own journalists. So in a democratic country, people want to protest, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=48.56s)]
*  what is the public broadcaster which we fund with our licence fees. The police stopped that for [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=54.56s)]
*  reasons we will discuss. And then I'd say some pretty shocking developments took place, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=59.36s)]
*  which were consistent with the Metropolitan Police's tradition of, I think, dishonesty is [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=64.56s)]
*  being kind. I'm really glad to be joined by Zach Polanski, who's the deputy leader of the Green [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=71.28s)]
*  Party of England and Wales, but also is represented on the Greater London Assembly. So Zach, how are [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=76.72s)]
*  you doing? Great to see you. Thanks for having me as always, Owen. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=82.56s)]
*  So we were both at this protest. Can we just firstly start with, I guess, the premise, which [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=86.64s)]
*  was why the police intervened to stop the protest happening and then had a broader crack clown, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  which is that this is essentially, they say, disruption to the Jewish community. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=99.04s)]
*  Which is, I guess, translated as somehow menacing towards the Jewish community. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=106.16s)]
*  There were no synagogues on the route. There was a synagogue near the BBC. Do you want to just tell [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=110.88s)]
*  me about this and what you think as someone who is obviously a elected politician and a proud [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=117.2s)]
*  British Jew, I suppose? I think it's as simple as this is the establishment protecting itself. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  We have a government who has been complicit in arming a genocide. We have major opposition [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=128.48s)]
*  parties that have also fuelled that genocide. And so when it comes to a group of people who are [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=132.8s)]
*  representative of lots of people in this country who don't want to see the mass murder of innocent [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=138.72s)]
*  civilians, who don't want to see Netanyahu supported by our government, want to assemble, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=143.28s)]
*  that is a real threat to the establishment because that's essentially the facade of democracy that [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=148.4s)]
*  we have in this country crumbling because this is demonstrating that where the government are at [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=153.44s)]
*  and even where the major opposition party are at is in a completely different place [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=157.68s)]
*  to where the British public are at. And so I think that is the first thing that the Prime Minister, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=161.52s)]
*  the Home Secretary, the police more widely, the whole blob of institutions go this protest, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=165.44s)]
*  these people need to be stopped. Now within that, of course, Jewish voices like myself, but [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=171.04s)]
*  many Jews who are speaking out against this are a particular threat because what they have chosen [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=175.92s)]
*  to do is try and weaponize people's identity, people's Judaism and claim that this is some sort [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=180.48s)]
*  of threat to Jewish people. Now we've got to be careful here. There is a distinction to be made. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=186.24s)]
*  There are some Jewish people, and I know Jewish people, who are intimidated by these protests. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=191.12s)]
*  That doesn't mean they should be intimidated by these protests. That doesn't mean the protest [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=195.6s)]
*  should stop because they're intimidated. But I think it is also true that the police and the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=199.04s)]
*  government have chosen to inflate those fears, to stir those fears and to center those fears [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=203.28s)]
*  because it all again serves the purpose of making this threat to the establishment even more of a [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  threat that then is combined with anti-Semitism. Now we know anti-Semitism exists as anti-Muslim [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=215.44s)]
*  Islamophobia hate exists, and it's really important that we tackle that and we stand [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=221.76s)]
*  together with those communities. You do not tackle anti-Semitism by supporting a murderous [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=225.76s)]
*  Israeli government. You do not tackle anti-Semitism by turning on British Jews and claiming that we [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=231.44s)]
*  are in some way not Jewish because we hold a different position on the Israeli state, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=236.32s)]
*  and you don't tackle anti-Semitism by stoking further division. So I think all of these [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=240.4s)]
*  issues have been put into one complete mess by the police and the Home Secretary, but ultimately [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=245.44s)]
*  we need to be really clear what was going on here. This was about a group of citizens, yes, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=252.0s)]
*  elected politicians like myself, Jeremy Corbyn, John McDonnell, journalists like yourself Owen, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=256.08s)]
*  cultural icons like Juliet Stevenson, lots of civil group leaders, community leaders, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=261.36s)]
*  all peaceful coming together with thousands of members of the public, much more representative [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=268.08s)]
*  and much broader base and saying we will gather together peacefully to stand for peace and have [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=272.8s)]
*  been met by police resistance that has been, we've got some questions about it, but presumably [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=278.96s)]
*  been given instructions from higher up and I think that's deeply serious for our democracy. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=285.44s)]
*  I mean just on that in terms of the broader point about the protests, the arrest rate is lower than [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=290.32s)]
*  it classed to be music festival for example, and it's striking that actually, I mean I'm [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=295.6s)]
*  interested in your thoughts on this, there's actually quite a racist narrative which sprung [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=301.92s)]
*  out of that because there was an attempt then to square the claims of Suleyman and the likes of [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=306.64000000000004s)]
*  these hate marches with a lack of arrests. So Suleyman came up with the formulation, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=311.36s)]
*  which he wrote in the Telegraph saying Islamists are in charge of Britain and the police are under [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=316.72s)]
*  the thumb of Islamists. Is this what the kind of shape, because zone in on are these protests have [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=321.36s)]
*  angry Muslims quote unquote who are kind of extreme and all the rest of it. I mean that's [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=327.52000000000004s)]
*  what this became didn't it and that's how it kind of that is an important part of this narrative. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=331.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah I was going to say there's always been a racist undertone to criticism of Palestinian [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=336.40000000000003s)]
*  solidarity but it's not even an undertone anymore. I do think it is blatant racism at this point, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=339.92s)]
*  they're not even trying to hide the facade of this being respectable and I think this comes to a wider [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=344.64s)]
*  point as well which is around the dangers of centrism or the dangers of Stama's government [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=350.24s)]
*  that paints itself as centrist but I would argue is certainly to the right of centre if not quite [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=355.04s)]
*  far away from the right of centre certainly further arguably than even David Cameron's government. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=360.48s)]
*  And I think what this all does and I'm aware even in this interview and every time I talk about this [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=365.52s)]
*  it's creating a huge open space for Nigel Farage because we know trust of the police is already [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=369.76s)]
*  really low, we know trust of government and our elected institutions is also really low. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=374.64s)]
*  And so when speaking in the tone that I am I'm further eroding the trust because trust needs to [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=379.36s)]
*  be eroded, we cannot trust these institutions at the moment with the people who run them but if we [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=383.76s)]
*  don't create a credible alternative that gives people hope and that has a tangible difference [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=388.64s)]
*  to that alternative what Keir Stama is doing is rolling out the red carpet to the fascists and [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=392.8s)]
*  we've seen that play out straight away in America with Biden and Kamala Harris and Donald Trump and [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=398.0s)]
*  I would even say you know someone like AOC, someone who I've respected for a long time, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=403.12s)]
*  she did not need to get up on stage at a democratic conference and say Joe Biden is [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=406.96s)]
*  working tirelessly every day for a ceasefire. That is something that is demonstrably not true [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=410.79999999999995s)]
*  and we're seeing the same thing under Keir Stama. We're seeing him go out of his way to protect [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=415.52s)]
*  this Israeli government no matter what they do. We had you know we had him say that Israel had [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=420.15999999999997s)]
*  the right to turn off water and electricity. He said that's not what he meant but just a few [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=424.47999999999996s)]
*  hours Emily Thornberry went out on TV and radio to double down on what he said and was rewarded by [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=429.91999999999996s)]
*  being kicked out of the cabinet. All of that aside, all of that is a sideshow essentially to [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=435.12s)]
*  the fact that people are dying, innocent people are dying and Nigel Farage is rubbing his hands [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=441.36s)]
*  with glee because all of this is playing into this general sense that we cannot trust in [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=445.76s)]
*  democratic institutions anymore and so he is there and ready to pick up that mantle and I think it's [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=451.04s)]
*  so important that anyone who considers themselves on the left and that is a broad spectrum comes [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=455.92s)]
*  together and says this cannot happen but actually ultimately the number one thing we need to do [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=460.96s)]
*  at the moment is hold this Labour government to account. They cannot continue to pretend that they [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=465.04s)]
*  are standing up for respectability and decency at the same time that they are defending a police [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=469.20000000000005s)]
*  force that frankly have been caught lying and I don't think we should further anything other than that. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=474.8s)]
*  I was going to comment on that. I mean just the border point, again no synagogues on the [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=480.56s)]
*  route itself, the proposed route which obviously didn't happen, the synagogue nearby its services [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=485.52000000000004s)]
*  ended at 1pm and the protest outside the BBC was due to arrive at 3pm two hours later [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=492.08s)]
*  just as border context and also just that point about the Metropolitan Police, I mean they were [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=498.64s)]
*  found, you know they're supposed to be upholding community cohesion here, that's their claim, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=503.76s)]
*  they were found by a government report to be institutionally racist, sexist, homophobic [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=507.92s)]
*  and corrupt. I mean with that in mind what we were told then, because what was then proposed, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=513.84s)]
*  because I turned up, when I turned up to this protest it was ridiculous, it was absolutely [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=520.08s)]
*  ridiculous, I was walking through wire hole, aggressive police lines everywhere preventing [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=524.8000000000001s)]
*  people from moving anywhere, it was made a static protest, people couldn't get towards the stage [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=529.2800000000001s)]
*  where the speeches were, I only got let free because I was a member of the press and then [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=533.9200000000001s)]
*  what was proposed by Benjamin, who's directed the Palestine Solidarity Campaign who I've interviewed [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=541.76s)]
*  prior to this, who's now been charged I should say, we'll come on to that, is that instead of [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=548.4s)]
*  this protest which is now being banned they would walk with flowers to remember the dead [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=553.1999999999999s)]
*  Palestinian killed, slaughtered Palestinian children and they would walk through but if [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=559.28s)]
*  the police stopped them then they would simply lay the flowers on the floor. What happened? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=564.56s)]
*  Zach, just what happened? Yes, so first of all the exact same experience of arriving at the protest [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=568.72s)]
*  and feeling the aggression that was coming from the police, I'd only been there about 30 seconds [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=575.2s)]
*  when I actually had a conversation with a police officer because a woman, I don't know how old she [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=579.6800000000001s)]
*  was but I would guess late 60s, early 70s, was trying to get out of the protest to go to the toilet. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=583.6800000000001s)]
*  The police officer was saying that she was now in the protest and she couldn't get out, she was [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=589.12s)]
*  going to have to walk a very long way around. To be fair to a police officer I said what do you [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=593.2800000000001s)]
*  think she's going to do and looked at her and they then actually did let her out but it shouldn't [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=597.6800000000001s)]
*  have required someone to be there to talk about common sense and it just you know reflecting on [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=601.84s)]
*  it if the police are there to protect Londoners and protect the public how are you protecting the [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=607.44s)]
*  public if someone who is older who wants to get out of that protest who is clearly not any threat [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=612.24s)]
*  and saying that they need to use the toilet is then not able to use the toilet that is clearly [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=617.52s)]
*  the police not doing their job. More widely though at the end of the protest Ben Jamal came on stage [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=621.2s)]
*  and talked about the aggressive and authoritarian attitude that the police had had towards this [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=626.64s)]
*  protest and I think it's important first of all to mark that point. I spoke to people at the [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=632.08s)]
*  protest, one of my good friends in fact whose parents are often at those protests, I said to [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=636.3199999999999s)]
*  him are your parents around and he said no they saw all the stuff online and just didn't fancy [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=640.64s)]
*  being kettled by police for a couple of hours and I think that's an important point to note that [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=644.72s)]
*  that is already a suppression tactic just all the conversation that was in the media and the kind of [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=649.04s)]
*  social media is more widely designed to send the message to the wider public to say you can't come [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=654.88s)]
*  to these protests because if you do it is dangerous so you may be arrested and you do not have your [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=660.0s)]
*  democratic right to arrive so you're already creating a higher bar for people to be able to [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=664.0s)]
*  exercise their democratic and free right than they should be able to so that was already problematic. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=668.9599999999999s)]
*  Second thing Ben Jamal comes on stage and gives a very excellent and calm speech and just says we [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=674.3199999999999s)]
*  have been banned from marching we're not going to march what we are going to do in this small [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=679.1999999999999s)]
*  delegation is to walk forward with flowers up until the point that the police stop us [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=682.96s)]
*  when we will stop and lay the flowers for the debt. It was a very moving moment one of the most [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=688.8000000000001s)]
*  moving moments I've had at protest recently where we're on the stage and you turn to the sizable [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=693.0400000000001s)]
*  crowd and said could you part ways for the delegation to step forward because it's a [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=697.6800000000001s)]
*  peaceful protest and people were very attentive there was this amazing passing of the ways as [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=703.36s)]
*  then people were allowed to walk through very slowly with the flowers in silence. This was not [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=709.2s)]
*  a threatening moment this was not an aggressive moment this could not have been more peaceful [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=715.44s)]
*  and more somber with the kind of nature that you would expect which is ultimately to mourn the [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=719.76s)]
*  destruction and devastation of people's lives. Walked forward with the flowers now admittedly [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=725.6s)]
*  at this moment I was at the front and I very consciously I could feel that that people were [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=731.9200000000001s)]
*  coming forward many of whom I presume were Muslim or were wearing headscarves and I felt it was [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=736.8s)]
*  important that they were able to come forward for the media to be able to to be at the front and [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=741.04s)]
*  represent the people that they were representing so I was still very near the front but I wasn't [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=745.3599999999999s)]
*  exactly at the front. We then reached the point of the police line where I presume we were going to [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=749.28s)]
*  stop and the flowers were laid down we stopped there for about two minutes still in silence and [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=753.8399999999999s)]
*  then the police started to let us through and in fact were saying and there is video evidence of [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=759.52s)]
*  this come through come through so by that point we're being allowed into Trafalgar Square now [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=763.6s)]
*  admittedly I found this odd I thought I thought the whole point was that we were walking up until [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=769.28s)]
*  the police stop us laying the flowers but they did not stop us they did not ask us to lay the flowers [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=773.2s)]
*  they continued to let us come into Trafalgar Square. Now I then hours later see on the [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=777.84s)]
*  Metropolitan Police's Twitter feed that they're saying the marchers in some way force their way [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=783.2s)]
*  through that is categorically not true and in fact I tweeted that before I knew that there was [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=788.0s)]
*  evidence that it wasn't true because I believed it was important enough to be able to use our voice [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=793.44s)]
*  yes as elected representatives but also just frankly as people who were there to say what [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=798.6400000000001s)]
*  the Metropolitan Police are saying is not true and it then turned out there was video evidence [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=802.8000000000001s)]
*  that backed everything that I was saying and indeed Jeremy and John and everyone who was there was [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=807.44s)]
*  saying and today I've just written to the Home Secretary in my capacity as a London Assembly [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=810.8800000000001s)]
*  Member asking her to review the body worn cameras of the police to retract the statements that she [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=815.44s)]
*  has made and the police has made and indeed to apologise. I think all of those things are necessary [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=821.6s)]
*  in order to move forward on this to yes trust is low on the police but I don't think it helps us [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=827.28s)]
*  to erode it even further or to dismiss the need for trust with the police there is a long way to [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=833.84s)]
*  go to build that trust with the police particularly it should be said for minority communities [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=839.12s)]
*  and I think a step forward in doing that amongst the much bigger body of work which is a much [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=843.2s)]
*  bigger conversation is to tell the truth that has to be the most basic capacity and that there is [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=848.08s)]
*  very clear evidence it's important yes the Home Secretary has egg on her face on this but the best [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=853.5200000000001s)]
*  thing she could do at this point is clarify admit she got it wrong and she spoke too soon [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=858.32s)]
*  and talk about where we go in the future to make sure that people can assemble freely and by the [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=862.96s)]
*  way this is not just about Palestine we've seen this with climate protests we will see this more [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=867.2s)]
*  and more with trade union movements with civil rights movements and it is vital that everyone [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=871.9200000000001s)]
*  no matter where they stand on the Palestinian issue no matter where they stand on any issue [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=876.72s)]
*  understand how important and dangerous this moment is for our democracy for our future [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=880.8000000000001s)]
*  and frankly the entire country should be getting round to say no matter what you believe on any [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=886.08s)]
*  subject if we want to maintain the democracy that we proudly had in this country and yes caveat [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=890.96s)]
*  although we say there's been democracy there have always been problems with police always been [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=897.0400000000001s)]
*  problem particularly for minority communities but let's at least hold on to what we have and [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=900.5600000000001s)]
*  improve it rather than allowing it to be completely shattered amen i mean just lastly well i should [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=904.48s)]
*  say the the the metropolis have a record of when i say dishonesty in about frankly much graver [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=910.5600000000001s)]
*  issues for example the death of ian tommlinson the newspaper vendor who who collapsed and died [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=916.88s)]
*  um after being struck by a police officer in the 2009 d20 summit a pack of lies were fed by the [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=922.32s)]
*  police force to the evening standard which has regurgitated it 2005 of course the killing of [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=927.36s)]
*  john charles de menenez a series of police lies about the circumstances which led to his killing [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=931.92s)]
*  i mean just finally look the general yeah you just kind of talked a lot of that but the general [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=936.64s)]
*  authoritarian turn that is taking place across the western world and in america the united states [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=941.36s)]
*  we saw pro-palestine demos demonized not just by people on the right but people again who call [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=948.4799999999999s)]
*  themselves centrist and moderates and now trump's you know he's got a proposed package of laws to [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=953.5999999999999s)]
*  suppress pro-palestine demos and anyone who thinks it will stop there i think again they're [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=958.8s)]
*  going to collide with brutal reality and that's the danger isn't it that you get attacks on civil [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=962.8s)]
*  liberties and demonization of protesters by those who call themselves centrist and moderates and [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=968.0s)]
*  then that's used to help destroy democracy by the extremists who are currently let's just be [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=973.28s)]
*  absolutely blunt about it on the rise here and everywhere i mean you've just articulated it [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=978.24s)]
*  really well so there's not a huge amount to add to that but i suppose let's look at who's prime [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=983.68s)]
*  minister at this time too it is someone who is very comfortable i think with some of those [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=988.16s)]
*  authoritarian tactics or at least the idea of gaining more power we only need to look at [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=993.28s)]
*  kir starmer's attitude towards jeremy corbin his supposed friend who he then could not dismiss [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=997.8399999999999s)]
*  quickly enough and and the way that he has managed the party now i'm not comparing for a second the [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1004.0799999999999s)]
*  way you manage your own internal party factions with the need to manage a country in terms of [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1009.6s)]
*  democracy but you you see the patterns exactly of how how he operates and how he behaves so we are [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1016.96s)]
*  in this incredibly dangerous moment and again to repeat the point it's a moment that can't come [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1022.8000000000001s)]
*  quick enough for nigel farage and all plays into exactly the the things that he wants and it also [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1026.64s)]
*  plays into the fact we have seen racist riots on our streets just last year it feels like i'm not [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1031.76s)]
*  including you in this owen but more legacy media it just feels like the idea that we had racist [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1036.4s)]
*  riots on the streets just isn't talked about it was like some sort of this odd blip that happened [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1041.2s)]
*  last year and then admittedly i was really pleased to see the people who turned out in walthamstow in [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1044.96s)]
*  liverpool in manchester there's huge numbers on our streets but the fact that there was solidarity [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1049.68s)]
*  does not mean that the riots did not happen in the first place it does not mean that they were [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1054.16s)]
*  fueled by years of anti-migrant and anti-refugee rhetoric and the same sort of rhetoric again that [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1057.8400000000001s)]
*  the labor party are engaging in do i believe the labor party are engaging in full-blown racist [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1062.32s)]
*  rhetoric no they're not do i believe they're engaging in rhetoric about things like you've [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1066.4s)]
*  lost control of the borders tories did not cut emigration fast enough those kind of lines [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1070.72s)]
*  yes i do believe in that is that one small step away from full-blown racist rhetoric yes it is [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1074.96s)]
*  in fact it's a huge dog whistle and i think all of these things are going on and they're all playing [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1079.68s)]
*  into labor playing short-term politics they are playing with fire they are playing with dangerous [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1084.0800000000002s)]
*  rhetoric that entirely fuels the far right and that's exactly the place our country is going into [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1089.2s)]
*  at the moment so i don't end on a particularly grim and depressing note that's hard increasingly [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1093.6000000000001s)]
*  hard not to end on these days i do think the alternative is screaming out for change i think [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1098.72s)]
*  the majority in this country reject that kind of politics they reject that kind of toxicity [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1104.0s)]
*  and we see in polling at the moment under the first password system how fractured all of this [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1109.04s)]
*  is and it cannot continue so the only thing we know will not remain is the status quo [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1113.6000000000001s)]
*  so at this choice where we either fall and descend and we give into despair and we move [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1118.48s)]
*  into this increasingly far right authoritarian politics or this is a moment for the left to say [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1123.28s)]
*  we have the answers here this is a moment where we can rebuild our country where we can tackle the [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1128.32s)]
*  climate crisis tackle racism tackle inequality in our society let's talk about multimillionaires [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1132.6399999999999s)]
*  and billionaires who are profiting from what is going on in palestine from the war machine who [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1137.76s)]
*  are profiting from the climate crisis who are profiting from even the fires in la which are [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1142.0s)]
*  great for growth and gdp if you are the people who are profiting from certain things in there [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1146.72s)]
*  so i think it's important all of those conversations happen and i feel we've hit the point where we are [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1150.48s)]
*  near rock bottom and those conversations are happening but of course we've got to defend the [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1154.4s)]
*  most vulnerable in those conversations amen thank goodness we've got zack palanski and other [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1158.16s)]
*  colleagues of his in the green party and unlike i'm afraid a labor leadership which is paving the [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1162.64s)]
*  way ever more for terrible authoritarianism as well as not fixing the problems in the country [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1168.48s)]
*  which lead people into or drive people into the arms of faradjism and it's an important moment [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1173.68s)]
*  to say oh and well done more than well done a huge congratulations on your contribution here if it [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1179.6000000000001s)]
*  was not for your investigation to the bbc then a lot of these conversations would not happen but [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1183.76s)]
*  that was slam dunk evidence of what lots of people believed but didn't necessarily have the [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1187.76s)]
*  information in the investigation so that incredible work that you're doing is all feeding into this [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1192.48s)]
*  and i think history will judge you very kindly indeed bless you well on that note we praise each [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1196.8799999999999s)]
*  other and but of course just all i'd say is you know in my own view is the bar is on the floor [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1201.6s)]
*  with journalists in this country in that there are so many it's not the people who just support [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1208.08s)]
*  what israel's doing the people are still silent the people refuse to speak out when they know [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1211.2s)]
*  what's happening is a horrible evil and you know those of us have those of us who have a platform [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NkivioTuIg&t=1216.4s)]
