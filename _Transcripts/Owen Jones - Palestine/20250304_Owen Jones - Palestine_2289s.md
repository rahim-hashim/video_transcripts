# Gaza Exposes How The World Order Is COLLAPSING - w/. Prof. Paul Rogers
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM)
*  Now, one of the most important voices we have on conflicts in a conflict ridden world is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=0.0s)]
*  Professor Paul Rogers. He's had a big influence on myself, including when I was young. I studied [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=7.28s)]
*  his work as a teenager, in fact. And he's someone I've looked to, whether it be Gaza, whether it be [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Ukraine, in terms of understanding the tumultuous period we've lived in. He's also, for example, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=20.16s)]
*  Iraq, a very preeminent voice who huge numbers of people have looked to because of his wealth [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=27.36s)]
*  of experience and knowledge. So, Paul, it's great to see you again. How are you doing? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=35.6s)]
*  Very nice to be here. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=39.68s)]
*  Now, you've got a new book out as well, I should say, which is called The Insecurity Trap, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=41.04s)]
*  which I think in lots of ways looks at the broken economic and social order and how that underpins [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  many of the conflicts. I mean, a world with, you know, we see the rise of the far right, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=55.12s)]
*  climate breakdown, the explosion of inequality, and so on. I'm just interested, what do you think [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=59.919999999999995s)]
*  about Donald Trump in the context of the book you've written, The Insecurity Trap, A Short Guide to [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=65.12s)]
*  Transformation? Just talk about the phenomenon of Donald Trump. And as you see it, why do you think [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=69.44s)]
*  Trumpism has emerged in the way it has, which I think 15, 20 years ago, a lot of people would [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=74.4s)]
*  have found quite difficult for imagine happening in the United States? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=81.36s)]
*  I think we're trying to still work that out. I think myself that if you look at the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=85.44s)]
*  development of Trump, both in his first term and even more so in his second term, when he's so much [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=90.08s)]
*  better prepared, and look at some of the other developments in Italy, Hungary and elsewhere, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=95.76s)]
*  and the rise of more populist movements, I think it goes back a long way. You can trace it back, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=100.56s)]
*  I think, to the neoliberal changes back in the 1980s. And it has flowed from that. We have a [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=106.4s)]
*  more set of divided societies. We have an environment in which more and more people feel [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  excluded or out of it. And in different ways, they can look for solutions, usually in readily [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=119.36000000000001s)]
*  available and essentially ways that seem to make sense to them. And I think Trump is able to use [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=127.04s)]
*  that. But it's not just Trump. I mean, obviously, Nigel Farage is a past master of this. And the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=133.52s)]
*  whole reform group is also an indication of this when you get into so many countries. I think it's [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=138.88000000000002s)]
*  part of a wider phenomenon. I think there are two extra things as far as Trump is concerned. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=145.04000000000002s)]
*  One, he is really very much an expression of the way in which relatively small, extremely wealthy [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=151.28s)]
*  elites are able to essentially buy elections on a large scale, to put it very crudely. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=157.44s)]
*  And if you look at Trump alongside the four or five multi-billionaires who are in there as well, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  I think that gives a huge amount of political power. You get the same sort of thing in Britain, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=170.88s)]
*  obviously. I mean, reform is now trying to work with some very rich people. Labour is, incidentally, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=175.92s)]
*  which it wasn't doing under the Corbyn era, but of course the Tories do as well. But the thing is, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=180.8s)]
*  with this sort of concentration of wealth, super wealth, in relatively few hands, then I think that [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=185.68s)]
*  gives much more power to this kind of movement. And Trump himself is of that ilk. Trump, people [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=191.6s)]
*  talk about him as being an egotist or a narcissist. I don't know. I think in some ways he goes a bit [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=198.24s)]
*  beyond that. Narcissists, for example, an egotist, want people to like them. I think Trump is somebody [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=204.56s)]
*  who doesn't really care whether he's liked or not, as long as he's noticed and very much using [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=210.88s)]
*  his power. So I think it's a very difficult case and it's a coming together of a whole range of [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=215.92s)]
*  issues. But beyond that, of course, we're into an era where there are completely new challenges, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=222.0s)]
*  which certainly Trump means nothing for. If anything, he'll make it worse. That, I think, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=227.68s)]
*  is where, in a way, the book comes in. I wrote it, obviously, before Trump got in for his new term, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=232.56s)]
*  but with a mind to what was happening overall. And I think this is where we are now, a very [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=239.04s)]
*  difficult period in which we've got these three major challenges to the world, which all interrelate. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=244.23999999999998s)]
*  I mean, you write about Gaza in the book and the horror that's been unleashed against Gaza. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  And I think, I mean, your perspective actually is, if anything, we don't fully understand [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=256.8s)]
*  the full level of destruction that has been inflicted on Gaza. Obviously, we know Donald [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=261.76s)]
*  Trump at the moment. I would say it's quite striking. A lot of people would suggest he's [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=265.76s)]
*  actually admitted to genocide in that he said a whole civilization has been wiped out in Gaza. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=270.24s)]
*  He said it's a demolition site. It's uninhabitable. He's using that to justify [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=275.44s)]
*  violently displacing the entire population, but it's still inadvertently a confession. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=280.48s)]
*  I mean, just want to talk about the level of destruction. As someone, you're an expert in [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=285.28s)]
*  conflicts. You know, that's your thing. You've studied them in great detail. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=288.96s)]
*  How does this compare? I mean, just how unique, how extreme is the level of destruction which has [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=295.84s)]
*  been expected, which has been unleashed against Gaza? I think it's unparalleled in the post-Second [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=303.68s)]
*  World War world. You look at Grozny, you look at Mariupol and all the carnage in Ukraine, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=310.56s)]
*  and Russia in the Caucasus as well. And that's pretty extreme. But in fact, the scientists of [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=319.28s)]
*  global responsibility has just done a very good report on this. Phil Webb has written it. It is [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=324.4s)]
*  updating what is known about the level of destruction purely in terms of the weapons used. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=329.28s)]
*  Now, I did a lot of my work over the last 30, 40 years on nuclear issues. And one of the things [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=334.4s)]
*  you can say is that if you look at the total tonnage dropped of weapons, mainly bombs, but [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=340.47999999999996s)]
*  missiles, thousands, tens of thousands of artillery shells, you get a total of something like [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=345.52s)]
*  70,000 tons of explosives have been used. Now, back in the Cold War days, and of course still [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=351.68s)]
*  to some extent, we always used to use the term a kiloton, which is equivalent to a thousand tons [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=357.52000000000004s)]
*  of TNT. We're now using explosives which are much more powerful than TNT. But if you go by that [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=362.72s)]
*  figure, let's say, for example, that something like 70 kilotons of weapons have been dropped [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=368.64000000000004s)]
*  right across Gaza. Hiroshima was about 12 kilotons. So we're talking about six [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=374.4s)]
*  Hiroshima's equivalent stretched over the whole of Gaza. But of course, because these bombs drop [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=381.76s)]
*  individually, they're spread much more. So you get an extraordinary level of devastation. It's [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=387.03999999999996s)]
*  certainly more than Dresden, almost certainly more than most of the other 2000 bomber raids in the [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=393.76s)]
*  Second World War. And it probably matches the massive firestorm roads on Tokyo right towards [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=400.64s)]
*  the end of the war. In other words, to use that sort of language, this really is about as bad as [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=406.15999999999997s)]
*  it has got for many years outside of the Second World War. And it's it really is quite extraordinary. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=412.0s)]
*  I think very few people realize just how intense this has been and how continual. But that is where [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=418.4s)]
*  we are. And it's an illustration of modern war. We've not seen very much of it on the television [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=423.68s)]
*  here. Nothing like as much to say you see in Al Jazeera or indeed any of the Middle East channels, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=429.44s)]
*  which means that right across the Arab world, the degree of anger, and I would have to say hatred [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=436.08s)]
*  of what is happening is palpable. It's one of the things that is worrying Arab leaders right across [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=441.76s)]
*  the world, which is why they are so horrified at what Trump is now saying about clearing out [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=447.28s)]
*  Gaza sort of mass ethnic cleansing. So it's a very difficult period. And I just hope that sort of some [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=452.8s)]
*  degree of sense comes through. And we've got this very tricky ceasefire at the moment. Maybe that [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=459.28s)]
*  will maybe that will lead on. But I wouldn't sort of bank on it, not with Netanyahu, not with the [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=464.88s)]
*  people behind him as well, the people who have helped helping his coalition. One other thing to [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=471.03999999999996s)]
*  add here, though, is that although Trump has this long term history of being very favorable to Israel, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=476.23999999999995s)]
*  in this particular circumstances as an added factor, people tend to forget that the Jewish [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=482.23999999999995s)]
*  lobby in the United States, that's not a good term to use. Most American Jews are relatively [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=487.76s)]
*  on the liberal side of politics, quite progressive. You should use the term Israel lobby, because [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=492.71999999999997s)]
*  probably as important, if not more important than the Jewish supporters are the Christian Zionists. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=498.08s)]
*  We always tend to forget this. We're dealing with several tens of millions of evangelical Christians [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=503.52s)]
*  who believe that Israeli control of the holy places of the Holy Land is part of God's plan for [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=510.0s)]
*  the end days. And so this is one of the things which I think gives power to Trump and the like, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=516.8s)]
*  and added strength. And it makes it more difficult, of course, just to see a settlement through, I'm afraid. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=522.0799999999999s)]
*  It's interesting to say that because a poll indeed last July found that 30% of Jewish Americans think [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=527.3599999999999s)]
*  Israel is committing genocide, and that rises to 40% amongst those Jewish Americans under the age [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=532.9599999999999s)]
*  of 45, which is not true with evangelical Christians. They're far more pro-Israel. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=538.3199999999999s)]
*  So it's a really important point. When you talk about the direction, the way war is going, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=544.56s)]
*  I mean, there was this, it was a discredited view of history, the Whiggish view of history, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=548.8s)]
*  which is basically, you know, history is a story of bending towards progress and enlightenment. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=553.2s)]
*  And obviously that was, if it wasn't buried in the Somme, it was buried in Auschwitz-Birkenau. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=558.8s)]
*  But it still kind of persists, I think, in some ways of people's heads. You know, the idea that, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=564.64s)]
*  you know, okay, there were ups and downs, but the general trajectory is towards things becoming [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=570.32s)]
*  more civilized, if you like. But you just talked about this. I mean, you know, when Gernicke was [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=575.36s)]
*  bombed by the Italian fascists and the Nazis in aid of the national uprising in the Spanish Civil [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=579.2s)]
*  War in 1937, that was a shocking thing to happen to people. People were utterly shocked by the idea [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=585.84s)]
*  you could bomb a civilian area. But, I mean, you're talking about this, you know, this is supposed [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=591.0400000000001s)]
*  to be, you know, it presents itself as a sophisticated military and all the rest of it. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=595.92s)]
*  But why ping out a strip of land no bigger than East London, and with weapons provided by a [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=599.28s)]
*  superpower, with that level of destruction? I mean, you said kind of this is the direction [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=606.4s)]
*  things are heading towards. I mean, what does that tell us about where we're heading? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=611.8399999999999s)]
*  Well, I think that is part of the risk. But what I would say is we've got three parallel things [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=617.04s)]
*  happening at present, which we've got to get to grips with, and they interrelate. One, obviously, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=622.4s)]
*  is the nature of warfare. And I take your point very much in what we're seeing. It's extraordinary, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=627.52s)]
*  isn't it, when you think about it, that the recent wars that Britain and the Western saints have [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=632.4s)]
*  fought over the past 25 years have been abject failures. I mean, look at Afghanistan, 20 years [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=638.16s)]
*  of war. I mean, you and I have talked about Iraq. That was sort of eight years or so initially, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=643.68s)]
*  but Iraq is still in a very, very difficult state. And then you have Libya as well. But there's [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=649.12s)]
*  an any recognition of this, I think, when military don't see it that way. Because I think we're [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=654.08s)]
*  dealing with military industrial complexes of any countries, not just Britain, you could say the [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=659.2s)]
*  same for China, India, Russia, the United States, France, Germany, and the rest. These military [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=663.76s)]
*  complexes are almost a kind of law into themselves, very strongly interconnected, the militaries, the [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=669.2s)]
*  civil servants, the arms companies, the think tanks, some university departments, and to some [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=674.96s)]
*  extent, the trade unions. And essentially, it's very lucrative. It's really something which people [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=680.32s)]
*  can say we're helping to defend the country, in the case of Britain defending the realm. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=686.24s)]
*  And if you don't agree with the way it's happening, then essentially, you know, you're [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=691.2800000000001s)]
*  viewed with suspicion. You're an appeaser, if you like. And that, I think, makes it very difficult, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=696.8000000000001s)]
*  because it's a situation also in the military side, where you have a lot of secrecy, it's very [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=702.4s)]
*  difficult to find out what's going on. So you've got this problem that we tend to see major [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=707.6s)]
*  challenges as things which are best met by military force, which is why I've called the book [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=714.0s)]
*  Insecurity Trap. You've got that, you then got, as we talked about the start, we've got this [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=719.4399999999999s)]
*  extraordinary level of wealth, poverty, the division, which is quite phenomenal. You know, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=725.12s)]
*  the majority of all the people in the world are relatively marginalised. The third are doing [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=730.24s)]
*  pretty well, and a small proportion doing absolutely marvellously. But essentially, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=735.44s)]
*  we're getting that. It does come in part, not entirely, but in part through the neoliberal [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=740.24s)]
*  transition. You know, we saw it very much in Britain, and we're seeing it again in Britain [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=745.52s)]
*  in many ways. Labour, sadly, is not really recognising that. We're stuck with it. But what [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=749.44s)]
*  you have, therefore, is a world which is very much divided. If I may, I'll just remind people [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=754.96s)]
*  of a quote. It was done by Edwin Brooks 50 years ago, and he was an economic geography lecturer [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=761.52s)]
*  at Liverpool University. He'd been, I think, president of the Conservation Society and was [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=767.84s)]
*  an MP for four years, a Labour MP. And he basically wrote about the kind of world we must avoid. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=772.48s)]
*  He said, I quote directly, he was to avoid a crowded, glowering planet of massive inequalities [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=778.24s)]
*  of wealth, butchered by stark force, yet endlessly threatened by desperate men in the global ghettos. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=783.6s)]
*  Now, obviously, that is a very extreme dystopia, but we're a lot nearer there than we were 50 years [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=790.4s)]
*  ago. And I think the thing to add to this, to what Brooks is saying, is the killer in all of this, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=796.4s)]
*  of course, is climate breakdown. And that changes everything. I think we have to realise this. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=801.6800000000001s)]
*  I was a biologist originally. I then taught environmental science for a number of years [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=807.84s)]
*  and then moved into resource conflict and peace studies. But, you know, going back 50 years, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=811.84s)]
*  I look at my notes, they're already doing work with students on the risk of climate change as [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=816.72s)]
*  a result of carbon dioxide increasing in the atmosphere. We know it. We know it's happening. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=822.64s)]
*  It is accelerating. And it's going to get worse and worse unless we make some very big changes. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=827.6800000000001s)]
*  You put all those together because they all interrelate. You have major climate disasters [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=832.96s)]
*  have a huge economic effect. Wars do the same. Then we've really got to look at a very different [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=837.52s)]
*  kind of security. And this really is far bigger than the problems we're facing in Ukraine or even [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=844.16s)]
*  Gaza, or indeed Trump and the rest. This is something where we really have to change very [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=849.28s)]
*  quickly and make much more progress in the next five, absolutely 10 years than we ever thought [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=853.92s)]
*  of having to do. So sorry to give you a sudden sort of soapbox answer, but when you put all this [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=860.0s)]
*  together, we have to face up to a very different kind of world. It doesn't mean it can't change. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=865.84s)]
*  There's some very good news in all of that. I mean, the speed of technical development on the [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=872.1600000000001s)]
*  climate side is astonishing. You know, the cheapness of using solar and wind power [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=876.88s)]
*  for generation. The oil companies don't like it a bit. They campaign very strongly against it in [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=884.24s)]
*  different ways. But that is there. We can do it. But it's a pretty short period of time. We got [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=889.2s)]
*  to work on this. Sorry to give you a long answer, but that's how it looks to me. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=894.56s)]
*  S1 00 No, I mean, fascinating stuff. I mean, I'm interested just combining, because we should talk [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=898.56s)]
*  about in the book, the military industrial complex, I guess, and climate breakdown. This is where [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=903.04s)]
*  I often feel myself getting a bit dystopian. I mean, look at the development of new technologies [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=908.56s)]
*  and forms of warfare, like drones, armed drones, the use of artificial intelligence and targeting, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=913.92s)]
*  plus 972 magazine and Israeli Palestinian magazine has done these big exposés about the use of [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=919.28s)]
*  artificial intelligence in Gaza, for example, as well as far more extensive and intensive forms of [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=924.64s)]
*  surveillance. I just worry what I get dystopian about is, I mean, the use of surveillance, for [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=929.36s)]
*  example, it was a tweet which Mary should have, which is how dissent could be made impossible [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=934.24s)]
*  with these forms of technology. And you end up with a world that you discuss, which is you get [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=941.36s)]
*  climate breakdown, and the people, the politics, the sorts of politicians who refuse to take on [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=946.48s)]
*  the climate emergency, in a perverse way could end up benefiting from it, because there'll be [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=953.36s)]
*  a massive surge in global insecurity, people leaving their homes. And it's that dystopia, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=958.24s)]
*  talk about the use of these new forms of technology, and what you know, to just violently [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=962.96s)]
*  suppress the resulting insecurity and poverty that that climate breakdown will create. I'm just [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=968.64s)]
*  interested in your thoughts, because I feel often quite dystopian about this. Yes, I mean, again, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=975.36s)]
*  that quote, you know, the crowded, glowering planet, you know, that phrase actually says it all. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=980.08s)]
*  I agree with you in many ways. I mean, as you know, I've worked in this field for nearly 50 years, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=984.72s)]
*  I've worked on terrorism, nuclear issues, and the rest. And I sometimes say jokingly, anybody who [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=989.6s)]
*  does that sort of thing, you've only got three frames of mind. You're either alcoholic, suicidal, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=994.32s)]
*  or optimistic. And there are times when this optimism takes a fair bit of stretching. I mean, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=999.04s)]
*  I am optimistic and aware, I mean, obviously, we've got grandchildren, and you look to the [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1004.4s)]
*  future for them. But essentially, it's a difficult time. But we've been here before. I mean, I have [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1007.92s)]
*  to admit, I'm old enough to remember 1962, and the Cuban Missile Crisis. I was a student in London [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1013.76s)]
*  at the time. And essentially, it really did look like we were right on the edge. And we now know, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1021.1999999999999s)]
*  with all the benefits of the historians of the Cold War, we were very lucky in Cuba, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1027.44s)]
*  and very lucky on other occasions. We got out of the worst part of the nuclear armistice by luck, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1031.92s)]
*  not by judgment, and thank heavens for that. But what it also means is that there could have been [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1038.4s)]
*  an utter catastrophe, and all the people who were really concerned in the early 80s were right to [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1043.8400000000001s)]
*  be concerned. And we came through it. This is a different one, because we're not dealing with [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1049.2s)]
*  sudden global catastrophe. We're dealing, as you say, with a complex of factors, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1055.28s)]
*  including some very dangerous new technologies. And the problem is the way our system works. I [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1060.48s)]
*  mean, we've had all this talk at present from Trump and what he's doing, and from people like [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1065.6s)]
*  Stalmer about cutting the red tape. Well, red tape saves lives. And that's what people don't really [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1070.24s)]
*  like to face up to. Because there are some areas where if you go almost entirely on the profit [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1075.6s)]
*  motive, if you like, and make the money as quickly as you can, then essentially you will cut corners. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1082.48s)]
*  And I think this is what makes it even more difficult than where we face. But again, this is [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1088.0s)]
*  where I think if people know more about what can be done, then I think that's for the good. If I may [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1092.72s)]
*  just give a quick plug. What we're trying to do in the book, and in fact I wrote it in conjunction [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1099.12s)]
*  with one or two other people, in particular Judith Large, who is a peace researcher and mediator, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1103.76s)]
*  and she added a chapter looking at what ordinary people can do when they get depressed, what the [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1110.16s)]
*  things are away, because there are all sorts of things that people can do. But I agree with you [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1115.12s)]
*  in a way that this is a pretty tricky time. I mean, over 50 years working in the security field, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1119.52s)]
*  this is about as bad as it gets. But at the same time, we have to see through it. And we do have [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1126.3999999999999s)]
*  a capacity to change and change rapidly when the full import of the risk is shown. And this is where [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1131.28s)]
*  coming back to the climate thing, the climate emergencies which we're getting now, these were [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1138.1599999999999s)]
*  forecasts. Ten years ago, the climate scientists say you're going to get more extreme events and [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1143.36s)]
*  they're going to be more frequent. And we're getting that now. I have to say that I think we're more [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1147.84s)]
*  likely to see a major change if we get the kind of catastrophes that have been occurring in the [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1153.1999999999998s)]
*  global south, if they start hitting the global north. I mean, if you remember what was at Dera, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1158.8s)]
*  that Durner, the port city in Libya, which got hit by an extraordinary flash flood because of climate [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1164.8799999999999s)]
*  change very largely, and they reckon somewhere between 5,000 and 8,000 people died, the flood [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1172.24s)]
*  went straight through the village, through the town. It was quite a large city. And essentially, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1177.68s)]
*  frankly, if that was to happen, if there was a sudden massive heat dome, rather than just [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1182.56s)]
*  forest fires over a major northern city, that may change things. It might finally galvanize people [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1188.0s)]
*  to realize there's no other way but to handle this head on. And if that means very big changes, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1194.08s)]
*  then they're going to have to come. So in some ways, I suppose what you could say, Owen, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1198.72s)]
*  is that we're in a stage where you use a definition of prophecy, saying prophecy is suggesting the [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1204.72s)]
*  possible. And what I mean by that is that this is a time when we have to be constantly saying, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1213.68s)]
*  this is what can happen optimistically. We could do this, we could do that. And the more that people [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1218.32s)]
*  prepare to recognize that, then the more we may make the changes quick enough. Now, I grant you [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1223.6799999999998s)]
*  that essentially, if you've got somebody like Trump coming in, he may well try and close down [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1229.6799999999998s)]
*  as much climate research as he can. We already know that many of the references to climate change [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1233.76s)]
*  on the different official federal websites have been removed. They've just sort of trying to close [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1239.6s)]
*  down on it. This surely is exactly the period where a government, say in Germany or France or Britain, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1244.7199999999998s)]
*  all of which have very strong climate science communities, actually make sure that that work [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1252.0s)]
*  continues. We're not talking about billions of expenditure, quite small, but it basically [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1257.44s)]
*  will help fill the gap. I would love to see a system where if Trump does this, there are a [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1261.84s)]
*  number of fellowships offered in countries like, who are strong on the research already, to get [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1266.08s)]
*  Americans who are doing the work over here while Trump is in power. That's the kind of small thing, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1270.72s)]
*  sort of, I don't know, wide lateral thinking, which I think is going to be important. But always, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1275.68s)]
*  you've got to look for the ways forward, promote them. And we do seem to have the period where [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1280.56s)]
*  climate change won't be sudden global catastrophe, just gets worse and worse individually. And so, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1285.6799999999998s)]
*  you have time to make the changes. But it's going to be tough, I would have to admit. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1291.76s)]
*  You mentioned there before Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and in the book itself, you look at the [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1297.76s)]
*  cost of war program at Brown University, they looked at the cost of all of that, which they [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1303.68s)]
*  thought directly killed over 940,000 people, but indirectly, and indirectly is the vast majority [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1310.4s)]
*  in generally wars. That's how people are killed, isn't it? It's the collapse of the healthcare [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1318.0s)]
*  system and the means of subsistence, an estimated 3.6 to 3.8 million people, 38 million people [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1322.16s)]
*  displaced, the total cost of wars around $8 trillion. The reason I'm interested is, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1329.6s)]
*  I write a book at the moment about the crisis of Western power. And it strikes me that [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1333.76s)]
*  at the end of the Cold War, you had this period of military triumphalism, economic, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1339.4399999999998s)]
*  neoliberal triumphalism as well at the same time. As well as this kind of, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1344.3999999999999s)]
*  not actually, the formerly colonized world and much of the world would always look at this in [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1351.6s)]
*  contempt, that there's the kind of moral claims of freedom and democracy and all of that was used [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1356.48s)]
*  to kind of buttress Western power. And all of that in the 21st century has just collapsed, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1361.92s)]
*  quite dramatically, I would say. What do you think about that? I'm just interested in your [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1366.24s)]
*  thoughts on that. I think you really got to look at it in that sort of way. We are in different [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1368.96s)]
*  times. And essentially, what I think we have to do is to work out how we can start curbing the trends [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1378.16s)]
*  and put them in another direction. Now, obviously, people say, well, what the heck can I do? I'm just [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1385.84s)]
*  one person. Well, one person may be, but add to that a few thousand or a few tens of thousands, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1390.72s)]
*  more people think that way, then that can be the start of a change. But yes, these are very unusual [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1396.6399999999999s)]
*  and strange times. I think they are. People who think they're not are missing a trick. But at the [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1403.6s)]
*  same time, this is the kind of circumstance in which human ingenuity, if it is on the positive [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1408.9599999999998s)]
*  side, can have a very big effect very quickly. I mean, we turn it the other way around. I mean, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1415.44s)]
*  I certainly remember in great detail the start of the Falklands-Malvinas war and the speed with which [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1421.28s)]
*  Britain actually got a task force together. Suddenly, everything was done because it was a, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1427.44s)]
*  and this was a sort of a distant country, sort of, what, 8,000 miles away with 2,000 people. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1432.96s)]
*  Essentially, you can get a very strong reaction when people see there's no alternative. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1439.52s)]
*  And this is where you've got to always say, this is what can be done. I mean, for any individual [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1445.44s)]
*  person, I would say, you know, we all have our own specialities. I'm one of these people who tries to [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1450.96s)]
*  look more generally, but you can't expect everybody to do that. And people will be working, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1456.4s)]
*  they'll be working in some other area, and they'll be doing it in their own time, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1462.8s)]
*  and they'll be activists and maybe campaigners and the rest in one particular area. But they're [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1466.96s)]
*  part of a much wider community, and this is why people must really be aware of this. They are not [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1472.72s)]
*  alone. Nobody's alone on this, which is why I think the kinds of things that you do are important, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1478.16s)]
*  because it spreads the world more, spreads the word more. And if we're looking at it that way, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1482.72s)]
*  then I think we can see causes for optimism, and we have to. I mean, there isn't any other way to [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1488.56s)]
*  this. And so, however difficult it gets, you keep going, because in many other ways, there's a lot [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1494.56s)]
*  of interest. Sorry, that's a little bit sort of a ham-fisted way of saying it, but you have to look, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1500.72s)]
*  you have to remain optimistic. There have been very, very difficult times in the past. By and large, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1506.72s)]
*  one always has to remember that even now, the great majority of the world's population are living in [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1511.68s)]
*  conditions of tolerable peace. Very careful use of the words tolerable peace. It isn't warfare [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1517.44s)]
*  everywhere. It isn't disaster everywhere, and it doesn't have to be. And we are going down some [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1523.3600000000001s)]
*  areas which are really dangerous, and those are the ones we have to concentrate on. And basically, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1529.04s)]
*  facing down people like Trump and the rest is part of the name of the game at present. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1533.76s)]
*  I mean, speaking of Trump, what are your thoughts? We've spoken to you many times about Ukraine, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1538.8s)]
*  Russia. What are your general thoughts about his announcement last week of negotiations [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1542.96s)]
*  with Russia, which involve Ukraine basically surrendering a lot of the territory that is [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1550.8799999999999s)]
*  lost to Russia? I think it's very tricky, but the point is I wouldn't go for somebody like Trump to [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1555.12s)]
*  do it, but there has to be some sort of compromise here. I mean, the reality is within three months [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1563.04s)]
*  of the start of the modern phase of the Ukraine war three years ago, it was clear that there was [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1569.52s)]
*  a violent stalemate, which is fairly rare, but not that rare in warfare. What it meant was that [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1575.9199999999998s)]
*  neither side could win, but neither side could win. And essentially, if for example, Russia found [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1582.8s)]
*  itself right on the back foot, then it could start escalating and threaten use of chemical [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1590.24s)]
*  or even tactical nuclear weapons. If on the other hand, NATO is really on the back foot, then NATO, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1594.96s)]
*  sorry, Ukraine was really on the back foot, then it could always hope to fall back on Ukraine, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1601.68s)]
*  on NATO. Let me start again. If Ukraine was on the back foot, then it could always [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1606.96s)]
*  feel it had NATO backing it up. NATO is still backing it up a little bit, but the point is [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1612.56s)]
*  if you don't get some sort of negotiated settlement, this war goes on forever, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1617.44s)]
*  and I think we have to face that. Now, is it fair? Of course, it's not necessarily fair, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1622.56s)]
*  but there are many aspects of this which don't directly relate to Ukraine. You know, at the end [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1627.12s)]
*  of the Cold War, 1989, 1990, 1991, Russia basically came a part, or the Soviet Union did actually come [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1632.08s)]
*  a part of the scenes, and Russia lost what amounted to an empire in a matter of just [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1640.8s)]
*  weeks, certainly not even years, it was weeks. And essentially, there was a huge sort of [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1646.56s)]
*  espousal of turbo economics, turbo growth in the sense that essentially everything was pitched [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1652.6399999999999s)]
*  into the more pre-market capitalist model, and it was a disaster within Russia. But more than that, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1661.9199999999998s)]
*  Russia was treated with contempt by Western countries as a failed state at the end of 40 [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1668.0s)]
*  years of dangerous confrontation. And essentially, that really allowed Putin, eight or ten years later, [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1674.16s)]
*  to really work on that very strongly and convince the Russian people that they were being treated [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1680.4s)]
*  very badly, particularly by NATO. And it's absolutely fair to say that NATO did expand hugely [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1686.32s)]
*  at that time in a way which basically the Russians, particularly older Russians, saw themselves almost [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1692.08s)]
*  being surrounded. That is no excuse for what has happened more recently. There are other issues [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1697.76s)]
*  concerning claims of Western interference in Ukraine at different points. The way I would put [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1704.16s)]
*  it this way is that Russia did the invasion of Ukraine in February, what, three years ago, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1709.92s)]
*  and initially they were hoping to actually take over and install a satellite government, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1716.0s)]
*  a client government. They failed and failed dismally and were pushed back a lot, but then [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1721.92s)]
*  they turned around and began to recover. Now, if you go back to April of three years ago, there was [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1727.12s)]
*  a sense in which if you'd negotiated then, an early end to the conflict could have been found. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1734.1599999999999s)]
*  But looking at what the Hawks were saying in Washington and to some extent in Britain, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1740.4799999999998s)]
*  now is the opportunity to really see Russia crippled. And that would be very good for the [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1745.76s)]
*  long term because Russia was seen as the enemy. There's that phrase used at the time, you know, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1750.4799999999998s)]
*  we will fight Russia to the last Ukrainian. In other words, we're not doing the fighting. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1755.68s)]
*  That, I think, was another very dangerous thing. We're now in a situation where if anything, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1760.88s)]
*  barely, not that strongly, but barely, Putin does have the upper hand. And that means that we're [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1766.48s)]
*  going to see a settlement which won't be anything like as good as Ukraine would want. But this is [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1771.68s)]
*  what we are. Never forget what Putin is doing. It's extremely dangerous and in many ways [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1777.52s)]
*  have got no time for him at all. But at the same time, where we are now is partly due to the [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1784.64s)]
*  basically the Western work, the kind of attitudes we had at key times. Remember, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1791.6000000000001s)]
*  people do claim with a lot of justification that the Second World War stems directly out of the [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1798.16s)]
*  settlement of the First World War. And one of the issues here is Ukraine to some extent, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1804.0800000000002s)]
*  and what has happened there, extends in part out of the end of the Cold War. And that, I think, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1809.0400000000002s)]
*  we shouldn't forget. As I say, this does not in any way excuse Putin, but it gives you some degree [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1814.0s)]
*  of, I suppose, light, if you like, of transparency on what has been going on and why. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1821.04s)]
*  Do you think part of it, I mean, Western hubism I'm very interested in, partly because of the [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1829.92s)]
*  aftermath of the Cold War and, you know, as I said, the military and economic triumphalism you had. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1834.64s)]
*  I mean, that relates to what you said in terms of what happened in Russia, because [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1840.72s)]
*  there was the idea of, you know, we brought to heel the Russian bear and we're going to promote [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1845.44s)]
*  the economic neoliberal model, which was very much dominant at the West at the time. And that was [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1851.0400000000002s)]
*  seen as, you know, the absolute historical victory of the West and now Russia, with the willing [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1856.72s)]
*  compliance of the elites of Russia who benefited from those policies at the expense of the Russian [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1862.64s)]
*  people, I should say. But I mean, you know, this was an example of hubris, wasn't it? Because they [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1867.6s)]
*  promoted these neoliberal policies, which was again part of the kind of triumphalism of the period [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1872.3999999999999s)]
*  that produced an absolute catastrophe, a human catastrophe in Russia. And Putinism fed off that [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1879.28s)]
*  sense of insecurity, of societal collapse in lots of ways, and humiliation. And that's how Putinism [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1885.6799999999998s)]
*  kind of consolidates itself. So it's a kind of another example of Western hubris boomeranging [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1892.96s)]
*  in the face of Western elites. Yeah, yes. I mean, if you look at it in a sense, Russia lost its [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1898.32s)]
*  empire, if I can use that term very loosely, in the space of a few weeks. Britain lost its empire [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1905.8400000000001s)]
*  over 40 years, from the 1940s through to the 1980s. We've been another 40 years since then, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1912.08s)]
*  it still hasn't got over it. You know, we still have these delusions of post-imperial grandeur. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1918.16s)]
*  We have nuclear weapons, primarily because of that. I mean, nuclear weapons are absolutely [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1923.44s)]
*  pointless. The first thing to go, in my view, would be the nuclear forces, because essentially, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1927.92s)]
*  they just add to the dangers rather than decrease them. But in general terms, I think we're in a [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1933.44s)]
*  position where, I don't know how to put it, I suppose in a way, we're in very different times [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1938.96s)]
*  there's an awful lot of hubris, a lot of arrogance. We saw it, I mean, you know, [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1948.16s)]
*  9-11 hit the United States terribly. We must remember that. It shook them rigid. And essentially, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1953.52s)]
*  they had, they were working at the time, if you remember, on the project for the New American [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1961.2s)]
*  Century in the 1990s. Very similar to Trumpism in many ways. But essentially, then came 9-11, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1965.28s)]
*  and they went full tilt for it. You had to go to war. And you know, in open democracy, we were [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1971.2s)]
*  writing analyses which said, don't go to war. This is what al-Haidah wants. But of course, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1977.6s)]
*  they did. And the same happened with Iraq. And in each case, both in Afghanistan first, in the first [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1983.12s)]
*  10 to 12 weeks, it went very well. In the case of Iraq, in the first three weeks, it went very well. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1988.8799999999999s)]
*  Both came apart at the seams. And this is where the immediate response so often doesn't work. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1994.1599999999999s)]
*  And hubris comes in repeatedly. And I suspect you may even be seeing a little bit of hubris [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=1999.84s)]
*  on the part of Putin at the present time. There are indications that, in fact, although there's [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2005.36s)]
*  progress made on the battlefield, the cost to Russia itself is much heavier than we think. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2010.1599999999999s)]
*  But one other point in response to what you were saying, this whole neoliberal thing, [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2015.4399999999998s)]
*  I think people saw that the hawks, if you like, three years ago, were seeing the potential for [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2019.6799999999998s)]
*  Russia to be really pushed back very strongly. It wasn't so much Russia, they feared. It was [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2025.84s)]
*  the development of Russian-Chinese axis. Then they thought, really, weaken one part of that, [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2031.68s)]
*  and you'd be onto something of a winner. Extremely dangerous to do. And I think we're seeing the cost [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2039.28s)]
*  of that now. Just finally, you speak, I mean, in the book, you speak about the military-industrial [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2044.4s)]
*  complex, which is what Eisenhower famously warned about, the Republican President Eisenhower, [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2050.64s)]
*  who was president in the 1950s, in his departing speech. What's your thoughts about the power of [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2057.2s)]
*  the military-industrial complex and how much it actually drives policy, how much it actually drives [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2066.3999999999996s)]
*  conflicts and war rather than, I don't know, being a kind of passive beneficiary of it? [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2071.2799999999997s)]
*  I've been very lucky in my career. I've been able to lecture at Britain's main defence colleges [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2078.24s)]
*  year on year for the best part of 40 years, Royal College of Defence Studies, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2083.2s)]
*  Joint Service College. So I've met lots of military people. The first thing to say is some of them [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2086.48s)]
*  really do think things through. And in fact, the main military think tank, the Development Concepts [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2092.64s)]
*  and Doctrine Centre down at Shrivenham, has done a lot of work on climate breakdown and the problems [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2097.2s)]
*  that we face. And in that sort of basis, they will think ahead, but their job is to defend the realm. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2102.48s)]
*  I had an experience about six or seven years ago when I was invited to go down to an Oxford College [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2109.04s)]
*  to just do an overview of global security for a conference for government employees, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2113.68s)]
*  which was looking at the risk to Britain in its security terms of weak and failing states. It was [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2120.0s)]
*  a great thing to go to, but essentially what I could do was actually listen to some really top [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2126.16s)]
*  experts having done a bit of an overview at the start. It turned out though when I got there [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2130.56s)]
*  the audience was the Commandant and all the senior officers of the SAS plus Special Boat Squadron and [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2135.4399999999996s)]
*  MI6 people. In other words, looking ahead by the Special Forces, what problems will they face in [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2142.16s)]
*  the future? And one of the things about the military mindset in Britain in particular is that [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2147.2s)]
*  people always see their job as to defend the realm. Fair enough, and you know, I admire many of them [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2154.08s)]
*  in terms of what they do, but essentially it's a very limited way because what they should be [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2160.48s)]
*  doing in my view, any person on the military side, one of the major concerns should be with [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2165.68s)]
*  conflict prevention. But that is not in the thing and that is partly I think because it is a very, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2170.32s)]
*  very profitable business and I think one has to remember this. When it comes to arms sales, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2175.84s)]
*  I mean Jeremy Corbyn's outfit, the Peace and Justice Project, has just put out this extraordinary [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2180.8s)]
*  book which is called, what's it, The Monstrous Anger of the Guns. I helped some editing with it [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2185.44s)]
*  and Andrew Feinstein and Rona Michie did a fantastic job. And it basically gives a real [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2190.4s)]
*  indication of how the world arms trade works. So we're not just dealing with any one country, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2195.36s)]
*  Britain or others, it's a worldwide system and the problem is because war is so good for business [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2200.7200000000003s)]
*  in that narrow sense, it's very easy to say we must have more armaments and arms are the way to [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2206.8s)]
*  solve a problem. This is why we call the book The Insecurity Trap because it is a trap and if [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2212.32s)]
*  anything it generally will make things worse, not better. Amen to that. Well do check it out everyone, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2218.6400000000003s)]
*  The Insecurity Trap, The Short Guide to Transformation. It's always a pleasure to [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2224.32s)]
*  speak to you Paul about the rather bleak situation that our species has currently found itself in. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2227.76s)]
*  But there is hope and you obviously talk about that. There's always hope otherwise why are we [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2233.92s)]
*  even here? Why are we even talking? What's the point? And we've seen throughout history [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2238.0s)]
*  how moments of terrible political bleakness can be turned around. So there is always hope. Things in [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2244.4s)]
*  the 1930s looked pretty bleak but then we had a post-war settlement here and elsewhere which [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2253.04s)]
*  turned things in a different direction. So there is always that hope, hopefully without another [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2258.48s)]
*  global conflict for that to happen because unfortunately there are lots of nuclear weapons [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2263.12s)]
*  this time. But do for everyone watching and listening press like, subscribe, leave your [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2267.28s)]
*  comments. It's good for the algorithm, more people listen to Paul. Paul as ever it's an honour, thank [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2271.44s)]
*  you so much. Thanks very much, Homi, and good luck with your work. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yem4rkqT-wM&t=2275.84s)]
