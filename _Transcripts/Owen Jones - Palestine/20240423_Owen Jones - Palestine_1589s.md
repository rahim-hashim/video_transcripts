Video Description: It's the confrontation which has become international news, and become the latest incident seized upon by politicians and media outlets to demonise protesters against Israel's murderous onslaught.

Gideon Falter - who heads a group called 'Campaign Against Antisemitism' - released a clip about his confrontation with a police officer. But far more information has since come to light - so what is the full truth? We examine here in detail.

# Cops vs. 'Antisemitism Activist': What Really Happened?
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk)
*  We are currently seeing a renewed attempt by politicians, by media outlets, to demonise [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=0.0s)]
*  protests against Israel's genocidal onslaught against Gaza on both sides of the Atlantic. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Now, I'm going to look at a latest claim, drama, saga, centring on an incident here in Britain. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=11.84s)]
*  It involves a chap called Gideon Falter. He's chief executive of an organisation called Campaign [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=18.64s)]
*  Against Anti-Semitism, of which more shortly, and a board member of Jewish National Fund UK, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=23.52s)]
*  whose motto is supporting Israel for life. He's actually vice chairman there. Its honorary patrons [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=29.36s)]
*  include the prime minister and president of Israel. The context, huge mass protests against [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  Israel's genocidal onslaught against Gaza continuing on both sides of the Atlantic. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=42.64s)]
*  Here are some facts about those protests before we talk about the incident in question. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=48.0s)]
*  Firstly, they have been overwhelmingly peaceful, with a lower arrest rate than say, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=52.8s)]
*  a glassamy music festival or indeed a large football match. That isn't to say there haven't [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=57.6s)]
*  been people who've attended these protests, who haven't expressed hateful ideas. There has been, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=62.24s)]
*  and they belong nowhere near these protests. But it would be absolutely extraordinary if protests [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=68.0s)]
*  that big didn't have those individuals. If you just see any huge crowd anywhere, in any context, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=74.16s)]
*  the odds are there are going to be people there with hateful ideas. And obviously, they don't [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=81.44s)]
*  belong at those protests, which are overwhelmingly driven by a sense of anger and grief at the mass [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=86.72s)]
*  slaughter of innocent people. But media outlets and commentators and politicians have sought out, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=96.0s)]
*  literally sought to find these examples, to extrapolate them, to tar everybody at those [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=102.56s)]
*  protests. This is a well-worn technique. Not a technique. Those same people have applied to the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=108.24s)]
*  numerous genocidal statements made by Israeli politicians, I would know. So we have this focus [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=114.08s)]
*  on placards or things that are said by individuals at protests where these people have no power. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=120.16s)]
*  But when it comes to the Israeli government and politician after politician after politician [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=125.92s)]
*  saying blood curdling things as their military pummels Gaza, we don't get the same scrutiny, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=129.92s)]
*  do we? Now, these protests reflect where most of the public are at. And indeed, with every passing [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=135.04s)]
*  day, that is more and more true. More and more people move towards the positions reflected by [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=141.28s)]
*  these protests. Indeed, the polling here in Britain showed that even by 19th of October, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=145.52s)]
*  not long after this horror began, a large majority of Britain supported an immediate ceasefire. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=150.0s)]
*  And if we look at more recent polling, that includes huge numbers who believe Israel [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=155.36s)]
*  is committing war crimes and a huge majority who think we should end arms sales [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=162.72s)]
*  to Israel. Polling also suggests people, for example, think far more likely, by big margin, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=170.96s)]
*  to think Israel's entire campaign against Gaza is not justified. And indeed, a huge majority support [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=177.44s)]
*  peace negotiations between Israel and Hamas, a position I have to say you can't really get away [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=185.44s)]
*  with saying in the mainstream media. So that just shows where public opinions are. And that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  is what the protests reflect. And here's another point about these protests and a very salient [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  point here is that they have consistently featured, included large numbers of Jewish [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=200.88s)]
*  protesters. Those Jewish protesters have been a very, very important part of these protesters. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=207.28s)]
*  Jewish protesters who assemble in a specific Jewish block of the protest, but also those who [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=212.32s)]
*  marched throughout the protest. Jewish protesters who were there, loudly and proudly expressing [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=216.8s)]
*  their Jewish identities, for example, displaying signs, affirming their Jewish identities, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=221.2s)]
*  for example, Jews against genocide, that kind of thing, as well as wearing their kippah, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=226.23999999999998s)]
*  that is a Jewish school cap. Now, Gideon Folter has been involved in a high profile incident [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=231.04s)]
*  involving the Metropolitan Police in London at one of these protests, which he and his supporters [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=238.88s)]
*  have used to claim that these protests are not safe spaces for Jews, that they turn London, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=244.32s)]
*  essentially, into a no-go zone for Jews when they take place, a claim which has been [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=250.56s)]
*  repeatedly made in order to justify banning these protests, including, as we'll see by Gideon Folter [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=255.68s)]
*  himself. Now, the campaign against anti-Semitism, Gideon Folter demanded in the wake of this that [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=260.8s)]
*  the Metropolitan Police Commissioner either resign or quit. Now, who are the campaign against [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=265.44s)]
*  anti-Semitism? According to their website, they are a volunteer led charity dedicated to exposing [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=270.16s)]
*  and countering anti-Semitism through education and zero tolerance enforcement of the law. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=276.8s)]
*  Well, critiques of this organisation, it must be said, do not just come from the left. Margaret [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=282.72s)]
*  Hodge, a Labour MP on the right of the party who aggressively opposed Jamie Corbyn's leadership, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=288.24s)]
*  who earlier this year, in a so-called solidarity mission to Israel, posed in a picture with [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  Israeli President Isaac Herzog, whose comments in support of collective punishment against [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=297.12s)]
*  Gaza at the very start of all of this were cited in South Africa's case and the International Court [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=301.6s)]
*  of Justice alleging Israel is guilty of genocide. Margaret Hodge is herself a former patron of the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=306.72s)]
*  campaign against anti-Semitism and in July 2022, after the organisation attacked Keir Starmer, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=312.56s)]
*  she tweeted, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=317.92s)]
*  So she, in this case, was accusing them of being a right-wing organisation [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=332.24s)]
*  who weaponised claims of anti-Semitism for political ends. Now, I know that if someone [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=336.8s)]
*  on the left made that kind of argument, they'd be pretty swiftly given the boot from the Labour [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=341.76000000000005s)]
*  Party. Now, let's listen to another former Labour MP who became as well one of the most ardent [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=344.96000000000004s)]
*  opponents of Jamie Corbyn. Indeed, he was made a live peer in the House of Lords by conservative [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=350.56s)]
*  Prime Minister Theresa May and was then made the British government's so-called independent advisor [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=355.92s)]
*  on anti-Semitism. Mr Falter, would perhaps disagree with you suggesting that he was there [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=360.64s)]
*  purely to protest? He would argue that he was simply walking in London and he was stopped [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=365.84s)]
*  to doing, stopped from doing so because he was openly Jewish? No, no, let's be quite clear. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=372.47999999999996s)]
*  That is not true. He wasn't just walking in London. I mean, it's Shabbat at the time, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=378.88s)]
*  so the Jewish religious time, and he's been there before at the protests. He's been quite explicit. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=385.76s)]
*  Before he went on this protest, he'd already called publicly for Sir Mark Rowley to be sacked. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=395.28s)]
*  There's no ambiguity in what he's doing. Let me show you how he operates. Let me show you this. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=402.56s)]
*  This organization has for the last six months blocked me from seeing their social media. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=406.32s)]
*  I'm the independent advisor to government on anti-Semitism. They have other objectives in this. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=417.36s)]
*  If you're going to block people like myself from seeing your social media, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=424.24s)]
*  you're not playing it right. But Mr. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=428.96s)]
*  Incredible stuff there. When people on the left made such arguments, they were torn to pieces, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=431.2s)]
*  I have to say. But John Mann is claiming that the campaign against anti-Semitism has what he [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=434.8s)]
*  describes as other objectives and are playing it straight. It would have been interesting if he'd [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=441.04s)]
*  been press on exactly what he'd meant by that. Now, the campaign against anti-Semitism earlier [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=444.32s)]
*  this year put out a video which was widely condemned as Islamophobic with the text, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=449.44s)]
*  thinking of visiting Sadiq Khan's London. This is what you can expect to see beginning with an [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=454.96000000000004s)]
*  opening shot featuring an Islamist flag. Sadiq Khan routinely attacked because of his Muslim [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=459.68s)]
*  faith and links then made between him and Islamist extremism, even though, for example, he's [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=467.92s)]
*  consistently supported LGBTQ rights. You can hardly suggest he's a fundamentalist or linked [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=474.96000000000004s)]
*  to that form of extremism. Those claims have been repeatedly thrown at him over the years [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=484.0s)]
*  and is one of the main reasons he's got 24-hour police protection. Now, the campaign against [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=492.0s)]
*  anti-Semitism put out a video about the incident in question at the protests against Israel's [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=496.48s)]
*  on-site Gaza, which begins with this clip of the confrontation. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=502.72s)]
*  Now, I have to say, when I saw that clip, I was appalled actually, to be honest. The language [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=514.88s)]
*  used by that police officer, that was my instinctive reaction. I'm the last person on earth, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=518.24s)]
*  to be honest, to defend the Metropolitan Police, who I've got contempt for. They're institutionally [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=522.08s)]
*  racist, for a start. I don't trust them on the question of any form of racism, including [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=526.72s)]
*  anti-Semitism. I mean, I just instinctively just recoiled at that. That's how I felt about it at [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=531.28s)]
*  the time. Now, Gideon Falter used this clip as evidence to dispel the claim that Jewish people [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=537.52s)]
*  were safe when what he describes as anti-Israel protests coursed through London. He claimed that [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=542.24s)]
*  on the day of this protest, on a Saturday, he did what he normally did, went to a synagogue and [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=548.56s)]
*  met up with some people to just go and walk about around London. I think some people need some [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=552.72s)]
*  packing. He says that his group weren't wearing anything like stickers or badges. They didn't [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=558.08s)]
*  have placards or signs. They weren't chanting slogans or engaging with protesters, that they [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=562.48s)]
*  weren't involved with any protest or counter protest, that they were just walking wherever they [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=567.2s)]
*  wanted to as Jews, as free Londoners. So, he's clearly trying to make the argument that it wasn't [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=571.6s)]
*  because of the positions he was advancing at a protest against the onslaught against Gaza, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=577.9200000000001s)]
*  that it was clearly linked to the fact he was Jewish. That's the argument he's making. So, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=584.4s)]
*  he said the experience was frightening and that he was made to feel like he was being treated like a [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=588.4s)]
*  criminal for being Jewish, that the Metropolitan Commissioner had been curtailing the rights of [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=592.48s)]
*  law abiding Londoners, including the Jewish community, to appease lawless mobs. Now, this [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=597.28s)]
*  has caused a huge foray in the British media, but it's also made the international news in a big [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=601.68s)]
*  way as well. It's said to UK Prime Minister Rishi Sinhax, who was appalled by the way the police [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=605.76s)]
*  treated Gideon Falter and that the Metropolitan Police actually have themselves apologized twice [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=610.96s)]
*  for the language and written to Falter to offer a private meeting. Now, I watched a 14 minute video [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=615.6s)]
*  posted by Sky News, which shows a fuller version of the confrontation between Gideon Falter and the [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=622.5600000000001s)]
*  police, and it paints a very different picture from the narrative offered otherwise. In that [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=627.12s)]
*  video, the police officer accuses Gideon Falter of having repeatedly tried to barge through the [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=633.9200000000001s)]
*  police cordon around the march and in their words, to walk against this march. So to quote [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=638.32s)]
*  unquote, walk into the march, walk against the flow of the march, rebutting his claim that he was [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=643.6800000000001s)]
*  merely trying to cross the road, claiming that he was being disingenuous, not least when Gideon [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=648.48s)]
*  Falter claimed that the police were treating him like this because he was Jewish. So they didn't [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=654.72s)]
*  accept his motives or reasons. That's the point that the police were putting forward. That was [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=660.24s)]
*  their argument. Falter was further told that he deliberately tried to walk through the group of [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=665.92s)]
*  police officers and into the protests to walk through them and against the way they were [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=671.52s)]
*  moving towards, as in, so, you know, you've been at protests, you're walking in one direction. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=677.12s)]
*  And obviously the claim was he was walking in the direction of against the flow of people. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=681.92s)]
*  And indeed he said, my view is you are looking to try and antagonize things. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=688.64s)]
*  Falter objects are not, I'm trying to walk along the pavement. Indeed, he says, I can already see [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=691.84s)]
*  what your mindset is. So the police officer there is implying he believes Gideon Falter had ulterior [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=698.72s)]
*  motives, which were not as Gideon Falter suggested about him simply wishing to cross the road to get [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=704.24s)]
*  from A to B. Now we don't have on camera, the, all of the alleged behavior of Gideon Falter. We do [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=709.28s)]
*  have some of the footage. I'm going to show you that as well. But we don't have obviously all the [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=716.88s)]
*  footage of everything involving Gideon Falter that day. We have bits, but it was very clear from the [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=723.12s)]
*  footage that the police officers did not accept the motives Gideon Falter suggested. Let's just [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=729.04s)]
*  hear one clip from that longer video just to give you a flavor. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=734.64s)]
*  Now I should note he was literally there with a group of what I would describe as heavies and [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=746.88s)]
*  someone filming everything as he did. As Vithka Brownet Navarro Media points out, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=770.96s)]
*  one of the men with him has been identified as working for SQR Security Group, a security firm [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=776.08s)]
*  run by two former Mossad agents, which according to the Jewish Chronicle, largely highest vicious [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=781.12s)]
*  soldiers. And this individual has been filmed previously alongside Israeli President Isaac [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=786.48s)]
*  Herzog and Israel's ambassador to the UK, Zibi Hotevelli. I mean, again, we don't know the full [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=792.8s)]
*  details of that, who employs the security firm, what other context they're used in. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=801.52s)]
*  But people have seen the picture of this person and they have noted that he is part of this [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=808.72s)]
*  particular firm and where he's been previously deployed. His services are used elsewhere in [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=814.8s)]
*  that way. Now you can see Gideon Falter walking head on towards the protesters. That is walking [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=820.96s)]
*  towards the direction protesters were coming from. So let's have a look at that. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=826.48s)]
*  We have more footage from Channel 4 News, though, which shows what they say are new [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=851.04s)]
*  exchanges with different officers in different locations. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=855.28s)]
*  Today, Channel 4 News has seen new exchanges with different officers in different locations. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=859.84s)]
*  Well, just listen to that. A police officer, he says another police officer had said that [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=864.96s)]
*  Gideon Falter kept coming, going in and out of the protests. You keep running into the protesters. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=889.28s)]
*  Gideon Falter says that isn't true. Another police officer, another location says, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=896.48s)]
*  he's saying that you keep going in and out of the protesters. Gideon Falter says, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=900.0799999999999s)]
*  I don't know who he is. And the police officer says he's an officer. And then we can see quite [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=903.04s)]
*  the expression painted on Falter's face in response. Now someone who was there filmed one of the [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=907.68s)]
*  Gideon Falter's confrontations between Falter and the police and made clear that the impression of [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=913.92s)]
*  the protesters, well, this protest was that Falter had come from a small pro-Israeli protest nearby [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=919.4399999999999s)]
*  and he felt that his motive was to try and antagonize people with a video person to capture it. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=927.4399999999999s)]
*  Gideon Falter says he wasn't part of that counter protest that was nearby. We don't have any footage [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=932.24s)]
*  to show he was. I haven't seen it. What we do know is he was repeatedly challenged by police officers [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=936.0799999999999s)]
*  who believed he was antagonistic. And we have someone who was there who believed that this [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=941.04s)]
*  individual had come from the counter protest where there is obviously going to be friction. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=946.3199999999999s)]
*  Now Falter denies this, but the problem is we don't have all that footage available to us. And we [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=953.12s)]
*  know the footage he released in isolation is completely misleading. It is striking that people [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=957.5999999999999s)]
*  who do know have my world view to say the least, like David Ivanovich, former Times columnist, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=963.1999999999999s)]
*  agro-centrist who has a real distaste towards the left. Someone who just, yeah, very different [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=969.9200000000001s)]
*  politics to mine, tweets about me a lot. But he tweeted, listening out to the full account of the [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=975.6s)]
*  openly Jewish incident, it is apparent that Gideon Falter was angling for an incident just like this [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=981.44s)]
*  and an officer eventually provided it. I mean, in terms of the police officer's language, it clearly [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=985.2s)]
*  remains deeply problematic, even though we're not aware of the fuller context because we don't have [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=990.1600000000001s)]
*  all the footage and we can't all hear the dialogue. It's not entirely clear, all the dialogue, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=994.88s)]
*  even in the 40 minute version that we can see. The police apologize for it. It's notable, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=999.36s)]
*  though, that when we get this problematic incident, which leads the coverage, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1004.08s)]
*  it's a confrontation with the police, not the protesters. Now let's listen to the former [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1008.88s)]
*  Metropolitan Police Chief and Superintendent, Dal Babby. Openly Jewish is not acceptable. But I have [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1013.12s)]
*  sadly watched the 13 and a half minute clip that's on Sky News. And it's a totally different encounter [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1019.92s)]
*  to the one that Mr. Falter has reported. What you see him doing is attempting to go against the march [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1028.64s)]
*  or trying to push past the officers. And I think for 13 minutes, the officers showed great [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1035.1200000000001s)]
*  restraint. They offered to take him to a crossing point. They offered to help him and the group he [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1040.16s)]
*  was with who were filming the opportunity to cross at a more appropriate place. And so the [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1047.2800000000002s)]
*  narrative that's been pushed for the last few days is not accurate. And I think what you see [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1053.76s)]
*  is the police officers acting with great restraint. Personally, if I was in the police in that march, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1058.64s)]
*  I would have been inclined to have arrested him for assault on the police officer and a breach [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1064.32s)]
*  of the peace. So I think with all of these stories, it's really important that we don't just accept [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1069.2s)]
*  things at face value. And I have over the weekend been asking to see the full footage. And when the [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1075.68s)]
*  full footage was revealed, you have a very, very different account to what Mr. Falter originally [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1081.04s)]
*  said. Well, there we go. That's an interesting perspective, isn't it? Now, Gideon Falter went [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1085.92s)]
*  on Sky News and had his claims challenged by Ben Jamal, who's the director of the Palestine [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1090.96s)]
*  Solidarity Campaign, one of the organizers of the protest. Let's just listen to this. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1094.96s)]
*  Every single march, there are thousands of Jewish people marching, many of them in an organized [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1099.12s)]
*  block. They are warmly welcomed at every demonstration. Some of them have put out [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1105.28s)]
*  public statements, disassociating themselves with what Mr. Falter and his organization were doing [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1114.48s)]
*  at the last march. So that's... Let him come back to you on that. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1120.8s)]
*  First of all, I don't want to continue having a conversation with Ben Jamal. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1124.8s)]
*  Well, that's incredible stuff, because he doesn't like the truth being stated [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1129.44s)]
*  about Jewish activists being present in significant numbers at these protests. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1133.76s)]
*  Suddenly, he doesn't want to continue the conversation. But it is true. Not only have [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1138.56s)]
*  I personally marched with Jewish activists repeatedly, they are very visibly present [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1142.3999999999999s)]
*  at every single of these protests, not least in the Jewish block, but also elsewhere. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1146.56s)]
*  Now, the argument then that comes across is, well, yeah, that's true. That as long as you're Jewish [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1152.24s)]
*  and you toe the line and you oppose Israel's onslaught, you're fine. But if you are visibly [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1157.84s)]
*  Jewish and you don't, then that's when you face the threat of abuse. What I'll just say to that [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1163.76s)]
*  is, well, then it's nothing to do with being Jewish at all, that is it? Because if anyone turns [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1171.36s)]
*  up to a protest on one issue, and then someone who strongly objects to what that protest is aiming [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1177.52s)]
*  to do arrives, then you're going to get friction. Now, Gordian Volta says he wasn't doing chants, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1189.2s)]
*  he didn't have badges and all the rest of it. Well, I mean, why did the police think he was [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1196.16s)]
*  being antagonistic? We don't know, do we? We know he kept going in and out of the protest. That's [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1200.32s)]
*  what they say. It's just, you know, that's the issue, isn't it? What the police were arguing, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1205.28s)]
*  what they were putting forward is they thought that was antagonistic behaviour that he was doing. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1212.48s)]
*  So I guess that's the point, you know, did he remonstrate with demonstrators or not? [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1217.36s)]
*  I have no idea. Because we just got his misleading footage, which didn't show the full picture. And [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1221.04s)]
*  now we have other bits of footage which show actually it's not the narrative put forward, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1228.0s)]
*  but we don't have the full picture. Now, I would say this, I would say this back in May 2019, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1232.88s)]
*  I went to a Brexit Party rally to film a video with the Guardian newspaper, which I did for the [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1240.0800000000002s)]
*  same reason I go to Conservative Party conference every year. We want to try and avoid being in an [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1244.4s)]
*  echo chamber. We try to understand different political phenomena. I don't just go and talk [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1248.3200000000002s)]
*  to left-wing people. And indeed, at the time, the Brexit Party were leading the opinion polls and [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1252.3200000000002s)]
*  went on to win the European elections just afterwards. Well, I kept being mobbed by far-right [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1256.24s)]
*  elements who latched onto the Brexit Party. And the police asked me to leave on the basis that my [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1260.8s)]
*  presence was causing agitation and threatened to quote unquote, cause a breach of the peace. That [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1266.24s)]
*  did not cause a furore at the time. I mean, I tweeted about it and I think people didn't even [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1272.32s)]
*  blink at that. Even though I'd note that three months later was gay bashed by a far-right extremist [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1278.1599999999999s)]
*  and his two accomplices on my birthday, which didn't feed into the conversation about political [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1281.9199999999998s)]
*  intimidation because tiny violin time, I'm left-wing so it doesn't count. Now getting [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1286.08s)]
*  folter claimed in a Sky News interview that he hadn't spoken publicly about his own views [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1290.32s)]
*  about what Israel is doing. So again, we don't know again. I mean, I suppose then he's saying [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1294.48s)]
*  he didn't talk about Israel, for example, at the protests themselves. I don't know. I mean, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1299.9199999999998s)]
*  I think that's worth asking him in detail. But he says that therefore it wouldn't be fair to attack [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1304.8s)]
*  him on that basis because he hasn't publicly stated what those views are. Well, it is certainly [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1312.1599999999999s)]
*  clear that he's very hostile to the protests against Israel's military onslaught. So hostile, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1317.36s)]
*  he's previously called for them to be banned. Let's hear from Gideon Folter giving evidence [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1322.0s)]
*  that House of Commons previously calling for ban on these protests. What I would say regarding [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1325.6s)]
*  these marches is that there have been marches where after four weeks we were asking the police [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1330.8s)]
*  to put in place stronger conditions. And when the police failed to put in place stronger conditions [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1336.4799999999998s)]
*  under Section 12 of the Public Order Act, we did, and with the backing of a number of prominent [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1344.16s)]
*  lawyers, say that we felt that the legal threshold had been met for banning these marches, as indeed [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1350.5600000000002s)]
*  has happened in numerous other civilised countries like France, to put in place a ban on these [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1358.0s)]
*  marches. Look, it's very clear what's happening here. Look, and we need to be clear, anti-Semitism [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1364.4s)]
*  is a very real and grave evil. It needs to be taken very seriously. Something I've gone to great [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1369.44s)]
*  pains to make clear on this channel over and over and over again. To the extent where one of my arch [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1373.28s)]
*  critics who tweets about me again a lot works for the Community Security Trust, ostensibly a charity [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1377.92s)]
*  committed to the very important work of protecting the security of British Jews from racists. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1384.0s)]
*  And I know from Jewish friends, for example, with kids at schools, that the presence of the CST is [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1390.32s)]
*  very, very important to them. But this guy spliced together some of the many times I've spoken about [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1398.88s)]
*  this issue to make an attack video that this shows I'm obsessed with Jewish people. And that was then [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1404.72s)]
*  shared by the head of policy at the CST. Incredible stuff. If I hadn't spoken about anti-Semitism [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1411.2800000000002s)]
*  repeatedly, I'd be attacked quite rightly. So instead, that commitment is flipped into something [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1416.16s)]
*  sinister. I mean, you know, that's just an example of, you know, how is that going to help [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1420.88s)]
*  make people take anti-Semitism seriously? You know, it's just so counterproductive. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1428.8000000000002s)]
*  But it's also true that those of us committed to the end of Israel's genocide of L'Ansel, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1433.0400000000002s)]
*  more broadly to the liberation of the Palestinian people from the hideous oppression they've been [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1436.72s)]
*  so long subjected to, should always be vigilant about the real threat of anti-Semitism. That [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1441.3600000000001s)]
*  there are those who hate Jews who will try and attach themselves to the cause, not coming from [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1446.48s)]
*  the position of humanity, which is where the vast majority of people who object to the oppression [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1450.24s)]
*  of the Palestinian people come from, but from hatred. And do we have a responsibility to make [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1456.08s)]
*  sure that Jewish people in the diaspora do feel safe as an end in itself? And because defenders [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1460.24s)]
*  of Israel's abominable behavior try to tap into that very historically justified fear [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1465.04s)]
*  for Jewish safety, Jewish security. That's just a fact. I mean, you know, the prospects of peace [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1469.92s)]
*  are less, far less likely unless that is addressed. But it's also true that the vast majority, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1476.72s)]
*  as I've said, of people who turn up to these protests, who object to Israel's genocidal [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1484.6399999999999s)]
*  behavior are not anti-Semitic. They object to mass murder. They object to hideous oppression, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1491.04s)]
*  to hideous injustice. And, you know, I suppose I'd implore Falter, and I suppose more importantly, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1495.9199999999998s)]
*  the people cheering all this on, is what impact do you think this intervention is going to have? [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1502.1599999999999s)]
*  The net impact on making people take anti-Semitism seriously. But more broadly, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1505.92s)]
*  those who have been loudly trumpeting this incident in the world of politics, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1512.3200000000002s)]
*  so I'm thinking about Rishi Sanak, and the right-wing media, clearly they do have very [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1516.88s)]
*  clear motives. Those politicians and media outlets know they are apologists for one of the worst [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1522.96s)]
*  crimes of our age. They know they've lost the battle for public opinion. They know they face [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1527.44s)]
*  justified and growing opprobrium. And they know the atrocities committed by Isabel are repulsing [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1531.44s)]
*  people all over the world. And they know that demands for the West to stop compliciting these [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1535.12s)]
*  horrors will only grow. This is desperation on their part, certainly. Indeed, in the last few [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1538.8s)]
*  days, reports from Gaza include variously a mass grave with huge numbers of slaughtered Palestinians [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1544.08s)]
*  in it, including children, of 18 kids being killed overnight in a single airstrike in Ratha, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1548.4799999999998s)]
*  of an unborn baby being rescued from the womb cut out of its dead mother. Some of the worst crimes [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1553.6s)]
*  of our age committed with the complicity of our governments. And that truth can't be hidden. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1560.48s)]
*  And the inevitable consequences can't be reversed. And that's why politicians and the media [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1565.6s)]
*  do want us to focus on these sorts of incidents. Well, we know what the truth is. And we need to [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpgiDYWCZmk&t=1569.84s)]
