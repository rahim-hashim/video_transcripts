# Gaza Ceasefire Set To Collapse Under Trump
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es)
*  Donald Trump, the newly installed President of the United States, has made clear to anyone [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=0.0s)]
*  who is not, I'm afraid, painfully naive that the current so-called ceasefire in Gaza [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=4.72s)]
*  will end. That Israel's genocidal onslaught will not only resume, but will be escalated. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=9.28s)]
*  Let's have a listen. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  Gaza, boy, I looked at a picture of Gaza. Gaza is like a massive demolition site. That place is, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=30.64s)]
*  it's really, it's got to be rebuilt in a different way. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=38.08s)]
*  My mind. You know, Gaza is interesting. It's a phenomenal location. On the sea, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=44.64s)]
*  best weather, you know, everything's good. It's like some beautiful things could be done with it, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=52.64s)]
*  but it's very interesting. But some fantastic things could be done with Gaza. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=58.08s)]
*  Well, it depends. I can't imagine you could have, well, you certainly can't have [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=68.96s)]
*  the people that were there. Most of them are dead. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=73.44s)]
*  Now look, first of all, the jubilation of the Palestinian people in Gaza at the ceasefire was a [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=75.52s)]
*  beautiful sight to behold. They've suffered so much and any respite in that unimaginable [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=80.4s)]
*  suffering has to be welcomed. And the fact that a ceasefire deal was struck, which was the same [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=85.04s)]
*  ceasefire deal which has been around almost since the start of this mayhem, is a damning [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=89.2s)]
*  indictment of Joe Biden, who refused to use the leverage he had, not least Israel being dependent [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=94.08000000000001s)]
*  on US weapons in order to conduct its slaughter. Indeed, the Qatari Prime Minister, Sheikh Mohammed [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  bin Abdul Rahman al-Tani, told Sky News on Friday that the deal followed the same framework as the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=105.68s)]
*  one agreed in December 2023. This is the framework that we have signed [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=112.4s)]
*  two days ago. It's the same framework that we agreed on in December 23, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=118.4s)]
*  which is basically 13 months of a waste of negotiating details that has no meaning and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=124.4s)]
*  doesn't worth any single life that we lost in Gaza, or any single life of those hostages that [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=132.0s)]
*  lost their life because of the one, because they are among everyone else. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=137.68s)]
*  That does not mean Trump is a peacemaker. Note the language he uses in that clip. You see, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=141.44s)]
*  Trump tries to present himself as the peace candidate. When I went to his rallies in [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=145.92s)]
*  Rust Belt states in the build up to his election in November, that was one of his selling points [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=150.72s)]
*  for supporters about not embroiling the United States in foreign wars. That's why he says in [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=154.8s)]
*  this clip about Gaza, I'm not confident that's not our war, it's their war. That's what he's [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=159.52s)]
*  saying in terms of the prospects of a ceasefire holding. He is accepting Gaza from the wars he's [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=165.6s)]
*  talking about, disentangling the US from or avoiding. He's saying it doesn't count in that [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=170.72s)]
*  tally. And he's saying that because when he says he's not confident about a ceasefire holding, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=175.44s)]
*  he knows full well that Israel plans to resume its genocidal onslaught when it believes [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=180.64s)]
*  there is an opportune moment. Now, first of all, is it even a ceasefire? How do you define ceasefire? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=185.2s)]
*  Now for me, I don't know about you, the clue really isn't the word itself, ceasefire. But the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=190.8s)]
*  Israeli military has not ceased firing. Yesterday near Awadah Square in central [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=196.0s)]
*  Raffa, the Israeli occupying forces shot and killed 15 year old Zakaria Barbak as he rode [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=202.24s)]
*  on a donkey. When another man was filmed trying to drag his body away, the Israeli military fired on [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=209.6s)]
*  him as well. This is a thought experiment which I have been forced to indulge ever since this [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=215.6s)]
*  genocidal carnage began. One you should deeply resent because I'm compelled to do so simply [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=221.76s)]
*  because Palestinian life is treated as utterly worthless. So apologies in advance, but just [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=227.51999999999998s)]
*  imagine for one moment that Palestinian militants had just shot dead a 15 year old Israeli boy [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=232.39999999999998s)]
*  riding a donkey. And then there was footage of an Israeli man trying to rescue that body who was [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=237.92s)]
*  then shot at by those same Palestinian militants. Imagine the deluge of outrage in Western media [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=243.84s)]
*  outlets and amongst Western politicians. Would anyone treat that as a ceasefire being respected [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=250.24s)]
*  and remaining in place? Of course they wouldn't because they would treat Israeli life as having [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=254.96s)]
*  value, just as they treat Palestinian life as having no value, as having the worth approximating [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=261.12s)]
*  the common house fly. So with the current so-called ceasefire, note the extremists who [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=268.56s)]
*  surround Trump. His pick for US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, doesn't believe [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=274.24s)]
*  there was any such thing as a Palestinian. Trump has just lifted the pause on £2,000 bonds to [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=280.32000000000005s)]
*  Israel, which were repeatedly dropped on so-called safe zones for Palestinians. Miriam Adelson, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=286.72s)]
*  the Israeli American billionaire, gave Trump $100 million for his election campaign and she [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=293.52000000000004s)]
*  reportedly urged Trump to back the annexation of the West Bank in exchange for her backing. Note [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=299.68s)]
*  she had pride of place at his inauguration. In the West Bank itself, now the pogrom against [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=306.16s)]
*  Palestinians is escalating with terrorist settlers attacking and burning Palestinian villages and [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=313.04s)]
*  vehicles while the Israeli army blocks entrances to Palestinian cities. And crucially, according [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=318.8s)]
*  to Israeli media reports, Trump promised Netanyahu that if they agreed to a ceasefire [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=324.88s)]
*  and the withdrawal of the IDF forces from Gaza, he will support Israel retroactively if it decides [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=330.88s)]
*  to return to fighting and violate the ceasefire. According to the well-connected Axios media outlet, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=337.92s)]
*  Netanyahu said during the meeting that he received guarantees from both the Biden administration [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=345.84s)]
*  and the Trump administration that if negotiations over the second phase of the ceasefire and [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=351.36s)]
*  hostage deal fail and Israel's security demands are not met, Israel would be able to resume the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=355.84000000000003s)]
*  war in Gaza with US backing, Netanyahu said. Indeed, to further quote from them, Sorsas and [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=361.76s)]
*  Smoczcich's party claimed he received assurances from Netanyahu that the war would resume after [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=368.88s)]
*  the initial 42-day ceasefire and the humanitarian aid delivery for Gaza would be changed to prevent [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=380.24s)]
*  Hamas from controlling the aid. And indeed to quote from the Times of Israel, during a high [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=386.88s)]
*  level meeting last week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told those present that Israel will [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=402.96000000000004s)]
*  resume fighting after a hostage deal if one comes about. Channel 12 reports, that's the TV channel [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=408.88s)]
*  on Israel. If there is a deal, he says, and I hope there will be, Israel will return to fighting [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=414.15999999999997s)]
*  afterwards. There is no point in pretending otherwise because returning to fighting is needed [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=420.0s)]
*  in order to complete the goals of the war. Saying that does not thwart a deal, it encourages a deal. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=423.6s)]
*  That's Channel 12 quoting Netanyahu there. Well, I mean, what more to say really? The idea that [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=429.04s)]
*  Donald Trump, who bent over backwards to accommodate the demands of the Israeli right [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=435.76s)]
*  last time he was president, e.g. moving the capital of Israel to Jerusalem, the extremists [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=439.44s)]
*  around Donald Trump and Netanyahu and those around Netanyahu now plan peace for Gaza, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=444.8s)]
*  is, I'm afraid, just beyond delusional. And what was Trump talking about? How Gaza looks like a [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=450.88s)]
*  massive demolition site, but he says it's a phenomenal location on the sea, best weather, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=455.59999999999997s)]
*  some beautiful things could be done with it. Was he talking about redeveloping it for the benefit [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=460.24s)]
*  of the Palestinian people of Gaza to whom Gaza belongs? Let's recall what was said by Jared [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=464.32s)]
*  Kushner, his nephew and advisor in the first term. He was the main architect of Trump's so-called [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=469.92s)]
*  Israeli Palestinian peace the last time, which in practice was just executing the fantasies of the [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=475.44s)]
*  Israeli right. Nearly a year ago, Kushner said Gaza's waterfront property could be very valuable. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=480.24s)]
*  And what did he say about the prospect of Palestinians returning to their homes? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=488.4s)]
*  But also there are real fears on the part of Arabs, and I'm sure you [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=492.64s)]
*  talked to a lot of them, who think once Gazans leave Gaza, Netanyahu is never going to let them [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=496.64s)]
*  back in. Maybe, but I'm not sure there's much left of Gaza. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=502.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, it's clear he has no interest in the idea of them returning to their homes. And the basis [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=509.12s)]
*  for it is, well, Gaza's gone anyway. It's been wiped out. And that was last April. But it's [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=514.0s)]
*  clear what could beckon here. The ethnic cleansing of Gaza, presented as unavoidable, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=518.88s)]
*  given Gaza's been destroyed, and then Gaza redeveloped and colonised by Israeli settlements. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=522.8s)]
*  That's clearly the game plan of the Israeli right. You cannot say you were not warned. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=528.0s)]
*  Trump will not bring peace to Gaza and Palestine, clearly, far from it. And here's a prediction too. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=532.16s)]
*  Trump's allies are planning a crackdown on pro-Palestinian protests. If there is a renewed [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=537.04s)]
*  genocide long sought against Gaza, then protests will inevitably break out across the United States [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=541.92s)]
*  that may well be used to justify a whole slew of authoritarian measures to roll back U.S. democracy. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=546.8s)]
*  Well, the so-called moderates of the U.S. paved the way for that by facilitating the genocide [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=551.5999999999999s)]
*  and then demonising those protesting against it. It may well prove they weren't just the [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3osCi0M0Es&t=556.4s)]
