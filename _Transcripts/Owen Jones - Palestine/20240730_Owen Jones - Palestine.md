# Israelis Riot In Support Of Torture
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [July 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qxSGBggbO4)
*  Israeli citizens are rioting in the streets in support of the right to rape Palestinians,
*  while Israeli politicians are debating the right to rape Palestinians.
*  Now you might think this must be hyperbole, that I must be exaggerating,
*  this simply cannot be happening, that's been distorted, taken out of context,
*  this is exactly what's happening. Let's just be clear about that.
*  In a society in which genocidal mania is spinning out of control.
*  Now there have been repeated multiple reports of Palestinian women and men being raped,
*  and sexually abused, and systematically tortured by the Israeli state for months,
*  and I must make it clear long before the 7th of October.
*  Now you may recall that in May the International Criminal Court's Chief Prosecutor
*  issued requests for arrest warrants for war crimes and crimes against humanity,
*  against both Hamas and Israeli leaders. But whilst those requests for arrest warrants
*  specify torture in the case of Hamas, they did not do so in the case of the Israeli state,
*  not yet anyway, despite an abundance of evidence.
*  Now the International Criminal Court issues requests for arrest warrants if it does not believe
*  the judicial system of a state is capable of taking action itself.
*  This is a principle of complementarity outlined by parliamentarians for global action.
*  As follows, the ICC may only exercise jurisdiction when national legal systems fail to do so,
*  when it is demonstrated that they are unwilling or unable to genuinely carry out proceedings.
*  This may explain why, after months of reports of torture and rape, Israeli military police today
*  sought to arrest nine Israeli soldiers in the Stay Time and Facility, which is described by a
*  lawyer in an interview with the Israeli magazine Plus 972 magazine last month as more horrific
*  than Abby Grabe. Now before I just say more about that interview, the point is this.
*  They know that there is overwhelming evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity,
*  and that the initial request details some crimes, but not many crimes. It doesn't even go into,
*  for example, the bombing campaign in Gaza, focuses primarily on starvation and the depriving of
*  necessities of life from a civilian population. So clearly this is an attempt to forestall that.
*  Now there was a history within Israel of very few soldiers being held accountable,
*  that even when you have examples of soldiers being tried, that either they have no punishment
*  or just a minimal punishment, which is in no way proportionate to the crime. So bear that in mind.
*  Now the interview in Plus 972 magazine included testimonies of Palestinians being raped with a
*  stick in front of the detainees, backing up similar testimonies published in CNN and the New York
*  Times. The interview also detailed other reports of a Palestinian prisoner declaring he had
*  personally witnessed multiple rapes and cases in which Israeli soldiers made dogs sexually assault
*  prisoners. There are now endless reports of Palestinian prisoners being tortured to death
*  by Israeli captors while others have had their limbs amputated because of being restrained for
*  so long during their ordeal. All the evidence suggests that torture has been used on an
*  industrial scale against those detained by the Israeli state, many of them not charged with
*  anything and not guilty of anything other than being a Palestinian, as we'll discuss.
*  Now according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, when Israeli military police raided Sturth Taiman,
*  the soldiers mutinied, reportedly spraying pepper spray at the military personnel arriving to detain
*  the Israeli suspects. The Palestinian detainee was reportedly taken to hospital with severe
*  injuries, to what is described to Haaretz as an intimate body part, with injuries and leaving him
*  unable to walk. Then Israeli citizens and Israeli politicians, including ministers, marched on the
*  base and rioted in support of the soldiers. Prem Thacker, reporter with Zetio, was there on the
*  scene and recorded some of what happened.
*  So
*  when the soldiers were taken to a military court, violent mobs charged it
*  in an effort to free the detained soldiers. Let's see.
*  So
*  armed militias have claimed they've taken over military courts.
*  Now as Prem Thacker notes, Israeli forces have routinely used fists, tear gas, snipers and tanks
*  against Palestinians existing. Mobs attacking a military court to protest holding soldiers
*  accountable for sexual abuse are met with man-to-man pleas to calm down and shoves.
*  Meanwhile, the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, has debated whether it's acceptable to rape
*  prisoners. This is not a sick joke, it's exactly what happened. Let's listen with subtitles provided
*  by the anonymous and brilliant Israeli peace activist who goes by the to the point handle
*  at I Really Hate You.
*  So when the Palestinian politician, Hachmed TV, asks to insert a stick in a person's
*  rectum is what is legitimate, Hanak Milfizki from Likud, the ruling party to which of course
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu himself belongs and is prime minister of, angrily yells back,
*  yes, if he is a nuke, everything is legitimate to do to him. A nuke being a Hamas militant.
*  Now the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, published a video message demanding Israel's
*  military advocate general takes her hands off what he calls Israel's heroic warriors. The
*  national security minister, Itamay Ben-Gavir, announced the arrests were nothing less than
*  shameful. Adding that the defence minister, IDF chief and the military authorities need to
*  back the fighters and learn from the prison service, and that's, by the way, should be clear,
*  he heads it. Adding light treatment of terrorists is over. Soldiers, he says, need to have our full
*  support. The justice minister, Yariv Levin, said he was shocked to see a harsh picture of soldiers
*  being arrested and that it was impossible to accept that, accept this treatment. I mean,
*  just listen to this, do you really think this is a state which is in any way capable of trying
*  these people? Now let's be clear, we're talking about rape here. We're about using rape to torture
*  prisoners. Bear in mind, many of these prisoners haven't even been charged with anything. Now the
*  estimate offered by a Palestinian prisoners rights organisation is that there are 3,380 Palestinian
*  prisoners held as administrative detainees. That's charged without charge or trial, but crucially,
*  that excludes those from Gaza. We have absolutely no idea how many people from Gaza have been
*  detained without charge, but we can imagine based on those existing statistics excluding Gaza,
*  that is a huge number, given of course that's where the military operation is focused. We know
*  that hundreds of Palestinian kids have been detained and that charities warn they're being
*  starved and having their bones broken in detention. Now in this case, four of the soldiers accused of
*  raping this Palestinian man are being represented by a legal aid organisation named Honanou,
*  and guess what the defence they're using is? Self-defence. Now let's listen to this from
*  Erez Tadmo, the speechwriter, former speechwriter Benjamin Netanyahu.
*  That's right, he claimed Palestinian detainees raped themselves. Now a few things, firstly there's
*  a long history involving the Israeli state and rape and sexual abuse. Hedy Viterbo, a senior
*  lecturer in law at Queen Mary University of London writes a detailed Twitter thread about
*  this history including reports of the rape of Palestinians during the 1948 Nakba or catastrophe
*  which accompanied the foundation of Israel of reports in 2010 of the Israeli state sexually
*  assaulting Palestinian children and indeed Save the Children in 2023 found Palestinian child
*  detainees were being sexually abused in Israeli military detention. But let me read out to this
*  post from an Israeli analyst named Shael Ben Afram. He says,
*  Now these allegations admitted they were true and the worst part, none of it, none of this is
*  coming to light because the IDF and government have changed their hearts about it. It's coming
*  out because of because the pressure from the UK, the International Criminal Court and the International
*  Court of Justice was getting too great to ignore. This would get Netanyahu, Gallant and the chief
*  of staff in serious trouble. So they finally said the truth that Israel is routinely torturing
*  inmates, that sexual abuse is fairly common there, that people have been tortured to death.
*  Worst of all, many of the people in this facility were innocent, rounded up by accident,
*  but there was no real verification process before they were subjected to this hell on earth. This
*  can't go on as he concludes there. Well, firstly, it's welcome that he's confirming the truth that
*  the Israeli state is systematically torturing and indeed raping detainees, many of whom are guilty
*  of nothing other than being Palestinian civilians arbitrarily abducted by Israeli soldiers, in other
*  words, hostages. It's also important to know that international pressure too limited, but what
*  limited pressure exists is having an impact. And that pressure is in part coming about because of
*  the work of not least Palestinian journalists who have risked their lives and the biggest slaughter
*  of journalists ever recorded in any conflict to show the world the truth, the truth about what
*  is happening to the Palestinian people. And also those who've been protesting and organizing
*  in countries, for example, like Britain, which is putting pressure on governments.
*  But proper penitence would involve making amends for his own contribution in creating the culture,
*  which allowed the systematic violation of basic human rights. Last December, this analyst posted
*  a picture of Palestinian detainees in Gaza stripped naked, except for their underwear, declaring that
*  humiliating Hamas in an honor society weakens them. Well, how does he feel about that? How does he
*  feel about flouting the Geneva Conventions now in order to defeat the enemy? The problem here is
*  that Israel is a society in the grip of genocidal mania. It is unfortunately striking that after
*  10 months of barbarism, the one thing, the one thing it took to get Israeli civilians to riot
*  was support for raping Palestinians. Just imagine for a few seconds that Palestinians have been
*  rioting in support of raping Israelis. Just imagine that for a minute. Imagine the headlines.
*  Imagine how that'd be served up about what this tells us about the Palestinian people in general.
*  The allegations of rape during the 7th of October attacks were specifically offered up
*  in support of committing genocide, of a genocidal onslaught against Gaza on the basis they showed
*  the collective depravity of people who live there. So what now, eh? What now? The truth is,
*  Israel is in the midst of genocidal mania. That's what we're discussing here. There are courageous
*  voices within Israel, but they are so courageous precisely because they are so isolated. This horror
*  will not end without external action. Israel has to be completely isolated internationally, turn it
*  into a pariah state like apartheid South Africa before it, with an arms embargo, comprehensive
*  sanctions and boycotts. Otherwise, Israeli society will only sink further into an abyss
*  of genocidal depravity. Things are dark now, oh my word, they can get even darker. We are looking
*  at the consequences of impunity, of how genocidal mania takes a life of its own. It just gets worse
*  and worse. A positive feedback loop, nothing is stopping it. This is where total dehumanisation
*  gets you. And that's why pressure has to come from abroad, because those courageous and isolated
*  individuals in Israel are never going to be able to stop the level of depravity that you have just
*  listened to and heard with your own ears and seen with your own eyes. Please like and subscribe,
