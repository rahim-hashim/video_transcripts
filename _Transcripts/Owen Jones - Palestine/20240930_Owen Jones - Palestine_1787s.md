# Israel Has NO STRATEGY, No Endgame - Damning Assessment Of Israeli Analyst Ori Goldberg
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [September 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evTz9SVrRjQ)
*  Now, nearly a year on since this particular chapter all began, there has been a dramatic
*  escalation, particularly, of course, with regards to Lebanon. And we've seen, of course,
*  and we've already done a video discussing this, the assassination of the Secretary-General of
*  Hezbollah, Nasrallah, who was assassinated last week, but crucially with huge numbers, uncountless,
*  we don't know how many Lebanese civilians have been killed. And of course, as ever, that particular
*  death toll has become not even secondary, barely mentioned in all too much of the analysis of what's
*  happening. But we do need to be analytical. What's happening? What's the state of play?
*  You know, what's happening on the ground? What happens next? And we've got a brilliant guest,
*  as ever, Ori Goldberg, who's a brilliant Israeli analyst. We've interviewed, we've, I was using the
*  voyeur we here. All of us have been very lucky to have had the wisdom and insight of Ori before.
*  And you've always been the audience here, very appreciative, rightly so, of everything Ori has
*  had to say. So Ori, thank you so much for joining us again. Oh, it's my pleasure, as it always is.
*  Let's start, actually. I think, I mean, do you think it's fair to say, I mean, you're in Tel Aviv
*  at the moment, obviously, where you live, that the Israeli state has moved into a triumphant
*  phase, more so maybe than at any point. I mean, at the beginning of this, Netanyahu, the Prime
*  Minister, was actually in a lot of political difficulty, blamed for basically having left
*  southern Israeli communities exposed. And there was big question marks about his long-term
*  survival. You know, he was dragging the war out many thought in order to survive politically.
*  His stock, I would say, is pretty high domestically now. I mean, is there basically
*  a mood of triumphalism with regards to what happened in Lebanon as well as Gaza?
*  To some extent, yes. But I wouldn't say that that is the only mood in the Israeli street. And I would
*  also say that this isn't unadulterated triumphalism. Look, Israel has certainly given the world a
*  display of force. But also, this use of force by Israel is also proof of Israel's limitations.
*  The only thing Israel has, and it's quite a thing, don't mistake this, is this use of force.
*  Israel has no strategy, no endgame. The political problem that it is apparently trying to,
*  quote unquote, resolve, that is restoring security for the displaced Israelis from the north,
*  is not actually going to get solved. Israel is not going to achieve any kind of stability in
*  Lebanon. Certainly not if it mounts a ground invasion, even a small-scale one. These targeted
*  assassinations, sorry, I'm using the word targeted because it's such a reflex as an Israeli.
*  These assassinations, they are a display of tactical prowess. But they're also a display
*  of strategic weakness because Israel is getting closure. We're getting Nasrallah. Nasrallah has
*  been a thorn in our side for more than 30 years. And the cheek of the man doing what he's done for
*  the last year, and he's an Iranian proxy and so on. All of these things that he's done, we're going
*  to get him. We have assassinated a large number of senior Hezbollah personnel over the last several
*  days. And we're getting them because they either, these are the official justifications, that either
*  mounted attacks against Israel, or they are responsible for some area of Hezbollah activity
*  that could potentially be detrimental to Israel. But this is like connecting the dots. That's all
*  it is. We have no idea, and we don't actually really care what happens afterwards. We don't even
*  care what happens in Lebanon afterwards, and we certainly don't care what happens to Lebanese.
*  These are all hallmarks of our, I'm calling it that, our Gaza doctrine, which is relatively
*  new for Israel. Israel is very lethal when it wants to. It uses force on civilian populations.
*  It has in the past, but this year has been like no other in those terms. Israel has completely
*  lifted all precautions, all restrictions intended to safeguard the lives of civilians as much as
*  possible. Right now, Israel is defining military targets, that is people who are death worthy,
*  as we call them here. And anybody who gets in the way is fair game. Israel is not only killing off
*  these strategic foes and allowing any number of what we call collateral damage, but we're also
*  claiming that any deaths resulting from our attacks are the other side's responsibility.
*  And that's it. That is a mindset that I cannot over exaggerate the general nuttiness, craziness
*  of this mindset, the detachment from the world of this mindset. I mean, we're basically denying the
*  laws of physics. We're dropping 80 one ton bombs on a residential block in Beirut. There's a bunker
*  underneath it. That's true. Hundreds and hundreds are killed. None of them are our responsibility.
*  You know, this isn't even a question of morals. This precedes morality.
*  This is physics. And what we're saying is we're not concerned with that. That's not. So why am I
*  going into these details to suggest that while Israel seems like a mad bull in a china shop,
*  it is also weak. It's weak because it has no direction. It doesn't know where it's going.
*  It is in rampage. And any attempt to discern a plan here that is kill all the Palestinians or
*  kill all the Lebanese or take over the Middle East, I think is misguided because there is no plan.
*  And just a final sentence, another way of saying how weak we are is that we're
*  effectively retaliating. That's all we're doing. There's no initiative here.
*  Nathaniel talks about a new order. There's no new order here. And even if Israel invades Lebanon
*  and takes, I don't know, builds a zone that's a kilometer long or two kilometers long, that
*  won't restore security. The only thing that will restore security is negotiations with Lebanon.
*  But Israel refuses. Go ahead. Sorry, I'm ranting.
*  No, you never ramble. I mean, before I ask you about the question of Israelis plan,
*  Israel's plan, because I think what you're saying here is Israel's all tactics, but no strategy. But
*  before I ask you about that, in terms of what you're just talking about that general,
*  that mentality domestically, because in 1982, when Israel invaded Lebanon, and for example,
*  you got a terrible atrocity committed by the allies of the IDF in Shabra and Chitae,
*  when vast numbers of Palestinian, Lebanese civilians were killed actually in some of the
*  most grotesque ways possible, really just disgusting crimes. And Ariel Sharon, the then
*  defense minister, was actually found culpable by the Israeli commission. But the point I'm making
*  there is he was forced to resign. You got mass protests by Israelis on the streets. You had a
*  big peace movement. And I just, it's that question of Arab life and how much basically it has been
*  devalued, how cheap it has become, in that there was a significant chunk of Israeli society before
*  who did actually protest about the mass slaughter of Arab civilians in Lebanon and
*  in the Occamite territories. But that seems very marginal now. And the numbers of Arabs being killed
*  is actually much bigger, civilians. I'll see you and raise you, Owen. I don't know how
*  far back it was, but it was 12 years ago or 14 years ago, I forget. It wasn't 40. Israel wanted
*  to kill a senior Hamas commander named Saleh Abush Chaba. And the way we killed him was to shoot
*  a rocket through his apartment window. It turned out that his wife and children were with him in
*  the apartment. There was an official commission of inquiry. I'm not talking about people protesting,
*  talking about the military investigating itself. There was discussion in the press. There were
*  public hearings. There was a sense of what's happened to us returning into them. All of that
*  is gone. Israel is no longer there. After a year in Gaza, we have lost all sense of proportion.
*  Any direct challenge to us is a threat of obliteration. Any attempt to
*  resist our displays of force is another indication of how left to their own devices
*  all Arabs want to ultimately destroy us. And we need to do something about it, which is what
*  Israel is doing now. And returning to your original question about whether there's
*  triumphalism, not so much because we are very careful about articulating the necessity of what
*  we're doing. We're not joyful about it. Well, true. There was some celebration when Nasrallah died,
*  but it's not like there's joy at the death of Lebanese citizens. We're sorry we have to kill
*  them, but we have to do it. We have to attack Hodeidah in Yemen and prevent supplies from
*  entering through one of the only ports that allows hundreds of thousands of Yemenis to live.
*  We have to. We're not achieving any kind of victory. This is self-defense.
*  Triumphant ism, but adulterated. In terms of this question about taxics and no strategy,
*  let me be devil's advocate here. And let me just emphasize for the audience this is being devil's
*  advocate and really emphasizing the devil element of that. Which is if you're the Israeli state,
*  you might go, well, look, if you don't care about Arab life, which clearly the Israeli state does
*  not, you go, well, what's the problem here? Actually, what we've done is obliterated Gaza.
*  So we've abandoned containment and now it's just apocalyptic ruins, but we're not going to get
*  any, you know, there'll be continued guerrilla attacks by Hamas there, but it will be contained
*  within Gaza. And in Lebanon, we decapitated Hezbollah, which was, you know, not just its
*  leader, but actually a lot of its senior Qaeda. And, you know, Iran's power has been get ailed.
*  A lot of them might go, well, actually, it is working. There is a strategy there. And as long
*  as you don't care about the lives of Arabs, it is actually being very successful. What would you say
*  to that? I'll again, see you and raise, let me be a devil's advocate or actually not. Let me just
*  speak as an Israeli and say that the situation here is worsening. It's not improving. All of this
*  isn't getting Israel anywhere. The displaced citizens from the north, they're not going to
*  trust a limited ground maneuver. The only thing they might trust is an Israeli occupation of
*  Lebanon, which is completely unfeasible. But look at Gaza. We set ourselves two goals for the quote
*  unquote war in Gaza. We are going to return the hostages and eliminate Hamas. We've done neither.
*  Okay. So yes, we don't care. Yes, we demolish. Yes, we destroy. Yes, we do whatever the hell we want.
*  It isn't getting us anywhere. It isn't improving our situation. It's making it much, much worse.
*  And I'm not even talking about that's a topic for another conversation about how it accelerates the
*  backsliding of Israeli democracy, limited as it was. You know, the state is crumbling here.
*  Prices are rising at a crazy pace. Everything from apartments to food and supermarkets, jobs
*  are disappearing. Investment is disappearing. Dude, we can't fly out of this country.
*  Okay. There's been announcements in the press over the last few days. We're entering our high
*  holidays this week. That's a period of three weeks. There are no flights out of Israel.
*  There are thousands of Israelis stranded in the airport at Athens as we speak because
*  airlines are not flying here. This country is besieged and it is physically contracting.
*  It's growing smaller and less successful. So that's awesome that we're able to do all of that
*  and kill all the bad guys and demonstrate our general disregard for Arab lives. But it's making
*  our situation worse. So what's the point? That's what I would say. Do you think a invasion of
*  Lebanon is now inevitable? And it is worth bearing in mind that strategically, when Israel has done
*  that in the past, it's always ended in a strategic victory for those it was it was ranged against.
*  What do you think? I don't think it's inevitable. I think there's a lot of pressure from IDF
*  leadership to do that. And I think the pressure is again an indication of the limitations of
*  Israel's mindset is the IDF wants two things here. The first it wants to make good on operational
*  plans that has been in the works since 2006. The IDF has been planning these assassinations
*  since 2006. It's been planning a ground invasion style retribution since 2006. And now it finally
*  has a chance to make good on these plans. So it wants to do that. And the second thing, of course,
*  is redemption with regard to Gaza. The IDF needs a win. The IDF needs a clearly structured plan
*  that will be clearly implemented. And that's why they want an operation, not because they care for
*  security, not because they think it's the ultimate solution. They're also well aware of how overextended
*  they are and how in many ways unwilling soldiers who have fought for the last year in Gaza
*  are to report to Lebanon now and begin a ground invasion. But the leadership wants war because
*  that is the word that will vindicate it. That is the word that will prove to all Israelis that the
*  IDF is actually a capable fighting force. And as far as military organizations go, and militaries
*  are pretty dumb organizations, if you've got a plan and you can execute it to the letter,
*  that's good. That's a moral triumph. And they've got a plan and they see a chance to execute it to
*  the letter. And of course, add to that exactly what you said before, they've stopped caring.
*  They don't care about context. They don't care about implications. They don't care about civilian
*  lives. All they want to do is execute the plan. They're not homicidal maniacs. They are monomaniacs.
*  They're savants. They want to do what they're supposed to be able to do and nobody should
*  disturb them. And actually, they've been at it since October. Since October, the IDF, and I know
*  this personally, because back then I was still invited to seminars being an expert. The IDF has
*  not considered any solution but a war with Lebanon. There have been discussions in the scope of the
*  war, how long it would be, what it might achieve and so on. It has never considered any solution
*  but a war. What about Iran? Because Bayezid al-Natanyah, who was doing a speech, sorry,
*  broadcast in which he basically suggested the Iranian regime may well end up toppling sooner
*  than people think and so on. I mean, many people are moving to a very substantial attack. I mean,
*  to be frank, we did see, of course, the assassination in Tehran of Hamas's leader,
*  which suggested a degree of infiltration in the Iranian state. And there's a suggestion that the
*  Iranian state doesn't even know how much it's been infiltrated. I mean, that was the case with
*  Hezbollah as well. What do you think? I mean, do you think, again, is this just kind of Netanyahu,
*  you know, kind of, you know, is it rhetorical? Is it always actually, do you think there's something
*  substantive there and Israel is trying to goad Iran into a confrontation and it thinks it has
*  a strong set of cards at the moment? First, I think Israel has been trying to goad Iran for a while now.
*  Okay. Not necessarily because it wants a regional war but because that's what happens when you get
*  addicted to what Israel calls escalating to de-escalate. You know, there's no other option.
*  And if you want to go back to the notion of being concerned exclusively with ourselves,
*  the Salafism, that's part of it too. What other option do you have? De-escalation requires
*  negotiations. It requires a conversation. You don't want to have a conversation with the Iranians.
*  That's one thing. Netanyahu's rhetoric is not very different from rhetoric he has used before,
*  including when speaking at the United Nations General Assembly. This is his thing, presenting
*  Israel as the opposite of Iran. I don't, and this whole speaking directly to the Iranian people,
*  he does that every once in a while and it's usually ridiculous. By the way, breeding hilarious
*  memes in Persian on Iranian social networks. Nobody takes him seriously in that sense.
*  He used to be very suave and very charismatic in his delivery of these ominous messages but now,
*  I think the entire world can see that he reeks of effort. Everything he says is belabored. So,
*  the notion that Israel has it within its limited capacity, within its injured, exhausted capacity,
*  to simply move on to the next stage and attack Iran, which is a big deal, I doubt that's true.
*  You know, just like I doubt Hezbollah has it within its capacity to attack Tel Aviv, which would really
*  be a casus belli, a reason to go to war. I don't think that's there, the move to the next phase.
*  Also, again, I think Israel is talking too much. When Israel wants to do things, it doesn't talk.
*  Okay, and Israel is constantly, you know, we're about to invade, we're about to invade,
*  we're about to invade. Yeah, I don't know, maybe, but not a real invasion and that's the final thing.
*  Israel is afraid. Meeting Hezbollah fighters on their home terrain has never worked out for the
*  IDF. Certainly not in the situation that it finds itself in now. So, I doubt we're going to see a
*  ground war. I sincerely doubt we're going to see Iran get involved. Remember what you said about
*  Israel being a blessing and Iran being the curse. That's an inequality that now has worked hard to
*  impose on the global consciousness. Israel is the opposite of Iran. The problem is that inequality
*  seems to be flipping now. You know, the worse Israel looks, the more aggressive and disregarding
*  and just generally, not careless, but impervious Israel looks, the better Iran looks.
*  Iran looks like the grown-up in the room, like somebody who's willing to consider strategic
*  issues, who listens and does what they're told, when they're told, who is able to compromise.
*  So, Iran has a great deal to gain from not joining this and turning it into a regional war.
*  I mean, in terms of what the Israeli state strategy has been though, I mean,
*  what's also been a success is they've, you know, the US clearly has not, I mean, the US state
*  has basically decided that a lot of what Israel has done is not in its interests,
*  but it just hand rings about it. And it doesn't, I mean, that's by the way, not to let them off the
*  hook. If anything, it makes it worse because the point is what the Israeli state knows,
*  that it will get that hand ringing and that irritation, but the US state will just keep
*  handing them arms. They'll keep giving them the diplomatic support. So, basically, Israel's
*  calculation has been we're pissing off the hegemon that we completely rely on,
*  but it doesn't matter because actually it doesn't matter how much we piss them off
*  and how much we escalate things, they're going to continue to back us no matter what. And that is
*  the ultimate insurance because if you've got the hegemon, the only hegemon on your side,
*  you can more or less get away with anything you like, which is what Israel has tested to the
*  structure. Well, we certainly like to think so. And you're right that reality so far seems to
*  substantiate that argument. I would say two things about that. First, notice your use of
*  we don't care because what's going to happen ultimately is what we want to happen. See how
*  that fits in well with the general sense of we don't care. We don't care about Arab lives. We
*  don't care about context. We don't care. We know what's going to happen. I don't think the US is
*  going to flip. I do think, however, that Israel has overdone it. I think Netanyahu's overplayed
*  his hand. I think he's being particularly stupid about the way he has behaved during his visit to
*  the United States. He has also been very particular about broadcasting his support for Trump.
*  And I don't think that's being taken lightly in Washington. The more Israel drives this to the
*  brink, the easier it should be for the United States to step in, not as a peacemaker or not even
*  as an honest broker, but simply as the preventer of catastrophe. I think this will all be, this is
*  all coming to some showdown that will take place over the next few days. Remember the Jewish high
*  holidays, which are also important. I think we're in for a very intense two weeks. I wouldn't be
*  surprised if at the end of these two weeks Israel had invaded a kilometer or two, occupied a kilometer
*  or two of Lebanese territory. I wouldn't be surprised if at the end of these two weeks there'd
*  be a ceasefire that included a deal in Gaza. Right now it's about political will and it's
*  about Netanyahu examining his options. I don't know that it's necessarily easy to snap out of
*  this murderous solipsism, but I think Netanyahu is a very wily operator. I think he identifies
*  opportunities both for himself personally and for Israel. And again, something about the way
*  Israel is preparing for this ground invasion seems off to me. Netanyahu has reaped all of his
*  political points from the bombing campaign. He stands to gain nothing from the ground invasion.
*  So I think we're still in for some dramatic twists. On that, I mean just what you alluded to there,
*  there was this famous, I think it was the US General during the Vietnam War, who said the US
*  should declare victory and go home. And I wonder if you think that is something which, you know,
*  you declare victory somehow and then, you know, you're basically... What do you think?
*  That's definitely there. I mean, it's definitely part of what Israel is trying to do. It's certainly
*  what Israel was trying to do in Gaza over the last few months. So when it, for example, fascinated
*  Mohammed Daif and killed more than 100 or 150 Palestinian civilians in one of the worst,
*  you know, events I've ever seen, described again as a precision attack by the Israeli Air Force.
*  Israel is trying to, again, assassinate senior targets. In fact, this Israeli modus operandi
*  is so familiar now that in Lebanon it has been greatly accelerated. In Hamas, every week,
*  every two weeks, Israel would make an announcement that it had assassinated the commander in charge
*  of whatever. And Israel has already gotten to the point in Lebanon where it is assassinating
*  the person in charge of Hezbollah's rocket unit on the southern frontier or the commander of
*  other Palestinian terrorist organizations. So I think what Israel is trying to do is
*  compile a list that is impressive enough so it can have its mission accomplished moments.
*  That's another reason why I think a significant ground invasion is not in the works, because
*  seems like Israel is going full hog, whole hog, sorry, on this campaign that will ultimately allow
*  it to declare victory and go home. Just finally, what do you think, do you think is a holding
*  pattern for the US elections and what do you think will happen in either scenario? I mean,
*  some would say, you know, will, could there just be a massive escalation? I mean, some would say,
*  well, they've managed to escalate without Donald Trump, but what do you think?
*  I think a massive escalation would be frowned upon by both a Trump administration and a Harris
*  administration. I don't think Donald Trump wants a ground war that commits American forces. If he's
*  made a coherent promise to his base, it's that America is not going to get involved in
*  crapshoots like that all over the globe, including in Israel, and he's not a big fan of Netanyahu
*  anymore. So I don't think any American administration is looking forward to a war. The
*  election is not that far off now, but I would assume carefully that this situation will be
*  resolved before the American election one way or another. Either there'll be a war and the election
*  will take place in the shadow of the war, or there will be some kind of temporary ceasefire that will
*  include Gaza. Look, it's also volatile and also contentious and also laden with all kinds of
*  potential. It's all up in the air. Anything can happen. That's partially a result of Israel's
*  behavior because Israel has made it clear that no rules apply. That can also be used to make a right
*  or left turn and find oneself doing things profoundly differently. I think that's likely
*  because I'm not discerning any kind of committed strategic motivation on Israel's part. I think
*  Israel's game for everything. As long as it can sell this to the displaced Israelis from the north,
*  Israel's game for anything because anything may prove politically useful to Netanyahu.
*  And I really do think anything can happen. I do think that there's a lesson to be learned here,
*  a lesson for the world, and that is that the ultimate result of the kind of pampered entitlement
*  with which Israel has been supported by its Western allies is not an adoption of straight out fascism,
*  okay, or a clear political agenda. It is this murderous, solipsistic rampage where no rules
*  apply, where nothing holds. And I think that is a lesson the world needs to take to heart
*  very quickly and very effectively. We are now at a stage where because we so profoundly don't care,
*  we can do anything. And I'm in mind of the famous conversation between Alice and the Cheshire Cat
*  when she sees him as she's walking through wonderland and she asks him which road she
*  should take to get where she wants to go. And he says, well, that depends on where you want to go.
*  And she says, I don't care. And he says, well, in that case, it doesn't matter which road you take.
*  Israel is there. We don't care. So it doesn't matter what we do. That needs to be addressed
*  very quickly. If Israel needs to be stopped, all of its compounded crimes, all of its heartless,
*  guileless taking of Arab lives and Palestinian lives, they're all, you know, the rotten cherry
*  on top, the rancid cherry on top of the rotten cake is this complete and utter disregard for
*  anything and everything. That's probably the purest form of evil I can envision.
*  A very profound and unsettling place to end, I have to say, but always full of so much insight,
*  nuance, very thought provoking and again, very educational. And for everyone, again,
*  watching or if you're listening to the podcast, but if you're watching, please press like and
*  subscribe, leave your thoughts, leave your comments, always obviously love to read your engagement. I
*  do read through your comments, including the angry ones. Do keep this other way. Take to the
*  conference. I'll show it to the floor. Listen to the podcast, but Ory Goldberg, as ever, such an
*  honor. Thank you so much. Always a pleasure, Owen. And thank you for having me. It's an opportunity
*  and a privilege. Definitely for me as well. And always very appreciated by the audience. Thanks so much.
