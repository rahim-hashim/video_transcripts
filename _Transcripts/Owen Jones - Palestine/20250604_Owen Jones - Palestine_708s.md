# I Was LYING About Israel's War Crimes: Biden Stooge Matthew Miller's Sickening CONFESSION
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY)
*  This is truly nauseating. A man who played a pivotal role in Israel's genocide of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=0.0s)]
*  Palestinian people is Matthew Miller, the former spokesperson for the US State Department [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  when Joe Biden was President of the United States. He was the chief propagandist for the US [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=11.68s)]
*  government as it armed, aided, abetted and indeed directly facilitated Israel's genocide, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=17.12s)]
*  and his role in practice meant defending Israel from the charges against it, deflecting scrutiny, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  muddying the waters, playing a key role in ensuring that Israel's genocidal machine was [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=27.279999999999998s)]
*  maintained, protected indeed from challenges. Now, months after he lost his position, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=34.08s)]
*  when Trump became president, he now comes out and says Israel has without a doubt committed war crimes. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=40.56s)]
*  Let's have a listen. Do you think what's going on in Gaza now is a genocide? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=47.28s)]
*  I don't think it's a genocide, but I think it is without a doubt true that Israel has [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=51.44s)]
*  committed war crimes. You wouldn't have said that at the podium. Yeah, look, because when you're at [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=59.92s)]
*  the podium, you're not expressing your personal opinion. You're expressing the conclusions of the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=63.6s)]
*  United States government. The United States government had not concluded that they've [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=66.88s)]
*  committed war crimes, still have not concluded that. But your personal view is they have. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=71.12s)]
*  Well, so... And they were while you were there. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=75.44s)]
*  But here's... Yes, but here, let me qualify that there are two ways to think about the commission [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=77.36s)]
*  of war crimes. One is if the state has pursued a policy to deliberately committing war crimes, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=82.88s)]
*  or is acting reckless in a way that aids and abets war crimes. And that, I think, is an open [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=88.72s)]
*  question. I think what is almost certainly not an open question is that there have been individual [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=93.04s)]
*  incidents that have been war crimes where members of the Israeli military have committed war crimes. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=99.36s)]
*  So ultimately, in almost every major conflict, including conflicts prosecuted by democracies, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=104.8s)]
*  you will see individual members of the military, of militaries commit war crimes. And the way you [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=111.12s)]
*  judge a democracy is whether they hold those people accountable. But Israel hasn't... [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=116.47999999999999s)]
*  And that's my point is we have not yet seen them hold sufficient numbers of the military [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=121.12s)]
*  accountable. And I think it's an open question whether they're going to. I'm really struck that [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=126.96s)]
*  you think now that Israel did commit war crimes. And yet at the time, and I get why, but at the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=131.28s)]
*  time you were at the podium and you couldn't say that. I mean, personally, that must be very [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  difficult. Well, so the State Department itself had concluded, not in these... They didn't phrase it [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=140.39999999999998s)]
*  in these terms, but I think I did at the podium a few times, had concluded that it was likely [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=145.2s)]
*  that Israel had committed war crimes. But I do think it's almost certain that they have. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=150.23999999999998s)]
*  Firstly, this should be treated as a confession. He knew Israel was committing war crimes as he [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=154.79999999999998s)]
*  claimed otherwise, as he defended them from those accusations. Those who spoke out, of course, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=159.92s)]
*  about war crimes at the time were monstered and silenced. Then note his weasel words. He doesn't [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=165.11999999999998s)]
*  dismiss the charge of genocide very emphatically, I would note. He says, I don't think it's a genocide. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=170.72s)]
*  But then he goes on to say it's an open question whether the state has deliberately pursued a policy [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=175.6s)]
*  of committing war crimes. I mean, the evidence on this is as strong as the evidence for the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=180.56s)]
*  earth being round rather than flat. Israeli leaders and officials have been more open and [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=185.68s)]
*  upfront about their intent to commit war crimes and indeed genocide than any atrocity in modern [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=190.23999999999998s)]
*  history. Even the former Israeli Prime Minister, Eddard Olmert, who hailed from Benjamin Netanyahu's [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=195.6s)]
*  Likud party last month declared Israel as pursuing a war of extermination. Indeed, he called it [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  indiscriminate, unrestrained, cruel and criminal killings of civilians. He went on to emphasize [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=205.6s)]
*  this wasn't because of a loss of discipline, but because of intentional government policy. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=211.84s)]
*  Miller then does more weasel words in the interview about how in almost every major conflict, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=217.36s)]
*  you see individual members of the military committing war crimes. This is a strategy [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=221.44s)]
*  Israel's cheerleaders, those complicit in its crimes, are going to double down on. You'll [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=226.4s)]
*  hear much more of it. Yes, war crimes are committed, but war crimes are always committed in war. That's [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=230.24s)]
*  their line. This defense trashes any semblance of international law, by the way, because any [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=234.8s)]
*  state committing war crimes can just say, well, everyone commits war crimes. No big deal. It is [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=238.8s)]
*  what it is. Sad, but you know, the sky's blue. War crimes are committed in war. Facts of life. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=243.52s)]
*  The fact is, Israel isn't just committing war crimes. It's committing every war crime under [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=253.36s)]
*  the sun every day. Massacring innocent civilians, total destruction of civilian infrastructure, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=257.6s)]
*  deliberate starvation, depriving civilians of the other essentials of life, violent, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=263.2s)]
*  forcible displacement, industrialized torture, rape, we could go on. All of this is clearly [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=267.68s)]
*  government policy. Now, let's listen to Matthew Miller, a State Department spokesperson being [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=273.6s)]
*  challenged by Neil Stanage from the Hill last year. In this case, like I can't go through all [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=278.48s)]
*  six of them and take too long, but one instance, a strike on the Taj 3 tower in Gaza City, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=285.04s)]
*  the UN says was caused by several thousand pound bombs, killing 105 people, including 32 women [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=292.32s)]
*  and 47 children. I mean, should it take eight months to make a final determination? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=298.96000000000004s)]
*  As we have said before, it is very difficult to draw fact-specific conclusions when we don't have [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=304.32s)]
*  someone on the ground and we're in the middle of an active conflict. So what we do is we gather [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=309.68s)]
*  information. We talk to independent organizations to try to gather information, and then we make [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=313.36s)]
*  our assessments. Those assessments are compounded by the sheer scale of this conflict and the number [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=319.84s)]
*  of incidents that we have to review and the limited resources that we have to make those [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=325.2s)]
*  assessments. But I can tell you there are people working hard on it day and night. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=329.28s)]
*  But how does it come? I don't want to belabor the point, Matt, but how does it come that UN, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=332.4s)]
*  Human Rights Watch, Amnesty, International Criminal Court can all find compelling evidence of war [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=337.92s)]
*  crimes by Israel and the United States with its enormous powers of intelligence and direct [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=344.64s)]
*  contact with Israel can't find those? I would say that different organizations have different [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=350.96s)]
*  burdens, different responsibilities, and we take ours very seriously and are taking these [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=354.71999999999997s)]
*  assessments very seriously and I want to finish them as soon as possible. But it's important that [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=358.4s)]
*  we get them right. And then listen to this. They're embedded near civilians. Israel has a right to try [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=362.24s)]
*  and target those civilians, but they also have the obligation to minimize civilian harm and take [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=367.2s)]
*  every step possible to minimize civilian harm. He said Israel has the right to target civilians [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=372.16s)]
*  there. Goodness me. Bear in mind that Matthew Miller's defense amounts to I was just following [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=375.92s)]
*  orders. You may be familiar with this defense. It doesn't have a good pedigree. Let's put it that [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=380.32000000000005s)]
*  way. Here's another Biden propagandist for Israel's genocide. Vedant Petal was Miller's deputy, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=384.72s)]
*  again, spent his time on the podium deflecting scrutiny of Israel's war crimes, denying war [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=390.96000000000004s)]
*  crimes. A year ago, he was asked by a journalist if Israeli soldiers were raping a Palestinian detainee [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=395.6s)]
*  constituted a war crime. Let's have a listen. Israeli police detained soldiers yesterday, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=402.0s)]
*  or the day before yesterday, suspected of raping a Palestinian, sparking protests and so on. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=406.96s)]
*  Apparently, you know, rape and killing and torture and all this thing happens regularly in Israeli [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=412.48s)]
*  detention camps. Does that constitute a war crime to you? So the reports of abuse are deeply concerning [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=418.64s)]
*  and we've been clear and consistent with Israel and the IDF that they need to treat all detainees [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=425.2s)]
*  humanely and with dignity in accordance with humanitarian law. We also, I spoke a little [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=430.48s)]
*  about this earlier in the week, Said, we reiterate the support that an IDF, that the IDF is [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=435.76s)]
*  investigating some of these allegations of serious abuse of Palestinian detainees. And that is news [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=442.16s)]
*  that we welcome. And we're going to let that process and we believe in due process and we're [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=448.72s)]
*  going to let that process play out. Two quick points. Now, if proven to be true, that that's [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=452.24s)]
*  constitute a war crime, doesn't it? I'm not a legal expert, Said. It certainly, I imagine it would be [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=457.76s)]
*  inconsistent with Israeli law. And so, of course, that is why we are, we've been clear that the [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=464.0s)]
*  treatment of any detainee needs to be consistent with international and humanitarian law. So he [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=472.24s)]
*  refused to answer as well as promoting the nonsense that the IDF investigates these crimes, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=478.24s)]
*  so that all history and precedent shows those investigations either don't happen if they deal [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=481.84s)]
*  with sham. Well, according to sludge in a US news outlet, Patel has just joined SKDK, a consulting [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=485.76s)]
*  firm in the United States and guess who one of their clients are? The Israeli Ministry of Foreign [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=493.36s)]
*  Affairs. The firm he's just joined literally promotes the interests of Israel in the United States. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=497.92s)]
*  Well, that was his job really, wasn't it? By contrast, other public officials resigned rather [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=504.24s)]
*  than make themselves complicit genocide. That included Josh Paul. He was director of the State [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=509.59999999999997s)]
*  Department's Bureau of Political and Military Affairs. Tarek Habash, a Palestinian American, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=513.92s)]
*  the Education Department. Harrison Mann, a US Army Major, a Defence Intelligence Agency staffer. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=519.8399999999999s)]
*  And El-Shaleen, who I've interviewed twice on this channel, she used to be on the State Department's [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=526.8s)]
*  Human Rights Bureau. Stacey Gilbert, who served in the State Department. Here's a clip of an interview [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=530.24s)]
*  with Stacey Gilbert, who had a two-decade long career at the State Department before she resigned. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=535.4399999999999s)]
*  In April, Stacey Gilbert was asked for her input on a Biden administration report [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=540.56s)]
*  on whether Israel was committing war crimes in Gaza. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=544.88s)]
*  I was shocked to see that it said in very clear terms, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=548.16s)]
*  it is our determination that Israel is not blocking humanitarian assistance. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=552.7199999999999s)]
*  You had advised that that wasn't the case, is that correct? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=557.1999999999999s)]
*  Yes. The subject matter experts were removed and the report was moved up to a higher level. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=560.0799999999999s)]
*  We were told you will see the report when it is released publicly. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=568.72s)]
*  And then the report comes out and just doesn't include what you had to say? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=573.12s)]
*  I wasn't sure I read that correctly. I read it again and I sent an email [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=578.88s)]
*  then that I would resign as a result of that. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=585.6800000000001s)]
*  Do you remember what you write in your resignation email? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=588.5600000000001s)]
*  I said that report will haunt us. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=590.56s)]
*  And it does. And it haunts me. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=606.7199999999999s)]
*  The determination that Israel is not blocking humanitarian assistance [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=613.92s)]
*  is patently demonstrably false. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=617.84s)]
*  So she resigned because the State Department was covering up the obvious and incontrovertible [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=621.52s)]
*  fact that the Israeli state was blocking humanitarian aid. This itself constitutes, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=625.84s)]
*  of course, a war crime. She worked for the State Department whose spokesperson was Matthew Miller. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=631.36s)]
*  As the Egyptian-Canadian journalist Omar El-Aqed put it, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=637.36s)]
*  one day when it's safe, when there's no personal downside to calling a thing what it is, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTajBAKtNvY&t=642.08s)]
