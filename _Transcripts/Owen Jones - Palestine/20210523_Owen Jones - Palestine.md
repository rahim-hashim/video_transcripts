# Will Israel's Apartheid Fall?
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 23, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgR2zSM_94A)
*  Hello, hello, hello. Apologies for the late start. I'll explain why it's very much worth
*  it. We are very lucky to have two very brilliant guests, one of whom is out in the field in
*  Gaza. So we just had to deal with reception and stuff, but we did it. So we're very, very,
*  very excited to be talking today about what's currently going on in Palestine and in Israel.
*  And as we all know, a ceasefire is supposedly tentatively in place. Now, why we're doing the
*  show? This is why. Episodically, over the last few years, the plight of the Palestinian people is
*  discussed in mainstream circles. It is discussed to some degree on broadcast outlets, in newspaper
*  outlets. And then when a bout of violence subsides, the Palestinian people suddenly disappear. They
*  vanish. We don't have discussions about the plight of the Palestinian people living under occupation,
*  or indeed, as Human Rights Watch, perhaps the most mainstream international human rights
*  organisation, to put it, apartheid. So what we're going to do today is talk to two very, very
*  courageous Israelis, one of whom is from Betsalem, which is a human rights organisation in Israel,
*  extremely courageous human rights organisation. It is not easy to be an Israeli human rights champion
*  of the Palestinian people. And it's become harder and harder and harder. So we're very honoured to
*  have people who show such courage and dedication and determination against huge odds and facing
*  terrible consequences, often personally, for the work that they do. And we're also joined from New
*  York by Abraham Gutman, who was an Israeli refuse-nick. That's someone who did not,
*  on grounds of conscience, participate, join the Israel Defence Forces because of their objection
*  to the occupation. Now, we've seen some horrific scenes over the last few weeks. We've seen
*  a huge loss of life. And we know, of course, all loss of life is terrible, including the loss
*  of Israeli lives. What we see from the death statistics is what underlines what is often
*  called an asymmetrical conflict. That is where one side vastly outnumbers and strength the other.
*  But calling this a conflict itself is inaccurate because one side is a military superpower,
*  armed and supported by the West, and the other is an occupied people who are not a military
*  superpower, armed and backed by the West. And we can see that in the horrific disparity in deaths.
*  Huge numbers of Palestinians have died, including devastatingly many, many children. What we're doing
*  today is talking about what's happened over the last couple of weeks, but we're talking in more
*  depth about the nature of the occupation, about now that word, which is becoming increasingly
*  mainstream, discussing what's happening in the occupied territories, which is apartheid.
*  And what next? Is there any hope? Last week, we spoke to two very courageous Palestinian activists,
*  one in occupied Jerusalem, the other an 18-year-old girl in the Gaza Strip. Today,
*  we're talking to two Israeli voices, as I've said, very courageous voices who have so much to say
*  and from whom we're going to learn a lot. Before I bring them in, just quick housekeeping as ever.

*  documentaries that we've been making, for example, recently about Hartlepool, which got a huge amount
*  of praise, which the videographer rightly deserved. We're going to do many more of those
*  documentaries, but it depends on, of course, your supporters ever, through patreon.com forward slash
*  OwenJones84. You can also support the show and ask questions to the guests by using Super Chat,
*  which you can press below only on YouTube. So do come through to YouTube. Okay, that's enough of
*  me. We're going to go straight to our fantastic guests. I'm going to start with Sarit Mekaili
*  from the Israeli Human Rights Organization, Betsalen. Sarit, it's such an honor to have you with us.
*  Well, it's a pleasure to be on with you as well, Owen. How are you doing?
*  Very well, very well. And I hope you're doing well. Can I just say you're in Gaza, is that right?
*  No, no, no. I'm in the West Bank, in the Northern West Bank. As an Israeli, I'm actually prohibited
*  from entering Gaza, and I've never been able to enter it by my own government, obviously now also
*  by the de facto government of Gaza. I was in the Northern West Bank this morning out in the field
*  in an area northeast of Ramallah that is often the site of settler attacks, where
*  settlers harass Palestinian shepherds. So there we kind of with some activists, and now just
*  kind of like in the Nablus area. So firstly, many of the people watching or listening on the podcast
*  will have heard of Betsalen, but some won't have done. So can you just explain who Betsalen are
*  and what work he do? Yeah. So B'talem is an Israeli human rights organization that's been
*  around since 1989. That's the kind of first intifada, first Palestinian uprising. It was
*  established by a group of Israelis who reached the conclusion there was a need at the time,
*  we're talking about over 30 years ago, for truthful, accurate information about human
*  rights violations by the Israeli authorities under the occupation. And that obviously was stemming
*  from our basic belief assessment position that Israel is violating human rights, that the
*  occupation and that Israel's actions within it violate the rights of Palestinians and violate
*  Israel's obligations under international law. At first, I think the notion behind the organization
*  was primarily that information is the basis for action, that if only Israelis knew what was being
*  done in our name to Palestinians in the occupied territories, this will spur them on to act to end
*  the occupation. You know, fast forward 30 some years later, clearly the occupation has not ended.
*  On the contrary, the occupation is in fact more entrenched than ever. We, B'talem, not only Human
*  Rights Watch, but B'talem views the situation now not only in the West Bank, but under all
*  the areas controlled by Israel. So basically in the entire region between the river Jordan and
*  the Mediterranean Sea as the situation of apartheid. And therefore, as far as B'talem is concerned,
*  and clearly this information in and of itself is not enough. It's still the basis of our work. We
*  still provide accurate, timely, confirmed info about what's going on. But we also do much more
*  advocacy primarily with the international community in terms of advocacy and with Israelis,
*  so the Israeli public, to try and lead to international action that will end Israel's
*  occupation and apartheid regime. As an Israeli organization, even though, and this might kind of
*  like refer to some things we can talk about later, we don't see any way now that the Israeli government
*  is going to accept any end of the current status quo, which is that Israel controls all areas
*  and uses its control to promote its own interests. And therefore, even though we are extremely active
*  with the Israeli public, and we do a lot of work to try and convey the reality on the ground of
*  Palestinians living under occupation and also our messages about the occupation to Israelis,
*  we don't view this as something that could really lead to actual meaningful change. So this is kind
*  of the work that B'talem does. You described it earlier. Certainly, we're not exactly the most
*  popular organization in Israeli public life currently. But I also think it's very important
*  to remember that we do represent, not in a kind of political way, i.e. we don't have any kind of
*  constituency that has elected us. We are self-appointed. But I think we do represent
*  a large number of Israelis, both Jews and Arabs, who care about human rights, who want to end
*  this reality. And we're certainly not a majority and we're not, you know, we're a relatively small
*  minority in our own society. But we do exist here and we try to make our voices heard.
*  But before I ask just, you know, in depth about your work and what's happening on the ground,
*  I mean, you know, again, I have friends who went to Israel and proudly supported B'talem.
*  It's not easy, is it? And so I'm just interested before I ask you, what, how hard is it to be
*  someone like yourself and your colleagues to be able to do the work you do? What kind of pressures
*  do you come under? Well, I think it's a quite a mixed reality. I would say that, first of all,
*  I have to clarify that if I look at what my Palestinian colleagues go through,
*  my Palestinian colleagues were either Israeli citizens or residents of the West Bank and
*  certainly residents of Gaza, the hell they had to go through the last couple of weeks.
*  And their reality, which is one of zero protection from, you know, anyone from the Israeli
*  occupation, from their own government, I count myself extremely fortunate in that I have a lot
*  of options. I have a, you know, I have quite a wide scope to say what I think, to express my
*  positions. And B'talem has quite a wide scope of operations. And we do enjoy a lot more freedom
*  of speech and freedom of association than many other human rights offenders in our, you know,
*  region and in the world. However, that is certainly not the only part of the, you know,
*  the only picture. The government of Israel and various, you know, government affiliated
*  organizations are engaged in extreme campaigning and smear campaigning against human rights
*  organizations or activists who are opposed to this, you know, to the status quo. So we
*  certainly can speak our minds. That's not necessarily to say that anyone is actually
*  listening to us, because very often these smear tactics are quite effective in getting Israelis
*  to turn off. The Israeli authorities have also in recent years worked to legislate against us.
*  Primarily the legislation has led to various bureaucratic hindrances to our work, right? To
*  kind of like a lot of a lot more hassle to do our work under this ongoing incitement against us.
*  Many Israelis have been led to think that human rights organizations are the cause of
*  Oh, hold on. There are troubles that without people actually talking about this reality.
*  Oh, sorry, we lost you slightly there. Carry on. So a lot of Israelis think that without
*  Yeah, so I mean, I think the sad thing is that on some levels, many Israelis think that without
*  people holding up this mirror, right, without people actually reporting and discussing what's
*  going on on the ground is many of the things that they experience as a kind of like bad image or
*  bad PR for Israel wouldn't exist. And this is absolutely absurd, of course, because the problem
*  isn't with the conduit, right? These Israeli human rights groups or international groups or the media.
*  The problem is the reality. The problem is Israeli government policy, the policy of the
*  policy of settlement expansion and the policy that makes Palestinians have no actual protection,
*  no account. There's no accountability for harm against them. And this is the problem. This is
*  what people are seeing around the world. But I think that according to the Israeli government
*  and many kind of like these self proclaimed guardians of Israeli morality and etc. who attack
*  human rights groups would like to blame the messenger. Obviously, I think it's been quite
*  effective, but it's also been quite effective in galvanizing us and in helping us as a community
*  of human rights organizations, not just but selling my organization, but a strong, very,
*  you know, certainly not a massive, but a very committed community of people, both Israeli and
*  Palestinians, Jews and Arabs who are working together to end this reality, to change this
*  reality. And I think that if I think, you know, this kind of recent conflict in Gaza, and I
*  certainly take, you know, clearly the comment that this is not really a conflict, it's absolutely not
*  even in any way. It reminds me of, unfortunately, the previous conflicts I've had to
*  or the previous rounds of hostilities that I've had to deal with in my job at the cellar. But it
*  also reminds me of all of the attacks that followed the attacks against human rights activists.
*  And certainly the first one that was really the strongest was following the first large scale
*  Israeli operation in Gaza, cast led, which led to the Goldstone Commission report and then following
*  that to a massive attack inside Israel against human rights activists. And, you know, we've
*  learned a lot since then. And I think we're very, we've unfortunately had to deal with so many of
*  these public attacks. And some, you know, some of my colleagues also face individual harassment.
*  Personally, I feel like I've not had to deal with a lot of that. But we are extremely united and
*  we're very unapologetic about the work we do both inside Israel and abroad. So when I speak to
*  Israelis, I tell them, and I say it very openly, that I also speak internationally. And our director
*  has been to the United Nations Security Council to call for an end to the occupation, for the
*  international community to do this, to take action. And we repeat this call again and again. As I said,
*  naturally, and I think it's very understandable for people of any country not to be happy
*  when someone holds up a mirror to them that shows a very, very negative image. But certainly I
*  feel like, you know, as an Israeli, I think it's not only my right to speak my mind, try and
*  speak the truth and report it. It's also my duty as an Israeli to speak to both Israelis and
*  internationals and ask them to intervene, to take action, to end this reality.
*  So sorry, just before the recent horrendous events, Human Rights Watch, which is an extremely
*  mainstream international organization, they published a report which described the presence
*  of apartheid. And that's a word which people across the West, obviously, are very familiar with.
*  And it should be noted, of course, for a long time, actually, South Africa was an ally of the West
*  and of Israel, of course. And actually, there was a, you know, a lot of the way history is sometimes
*  rewritten, it was, you know, the people were always fighting against apartheid. And actually,
*  it was a controversial thing to do for a long time. And people are very brave in doing so. Now,
*  obviously, supporters of the Israeli government and of the occupation were very angry about that
*  description. So just tell us based on your work, what are the compar- why is that description,
*  apartheid, so apt? What actually is on the ground to justify using that word?
*  So I think it's very clear, and obviously, I don't speak on behalf of Human Rights Watch,
*  but I do speak on behalf of the tell them that made that specific pronouncement in a much shorter
*  report. We issued a position paper about the entire Israeli regime between the river and the sea.
*  And it's not a legal document, right? We deliberately set out not to write a legal
*  analysis, but a factual and moral analysis, looking at the reality between the river and the sea in
*  which two peoples exist, Israelis and Palestinians, pretty much in terms of the numbers,
*  there's a parity between the numbers of Israelis and Palestinians. But, and we show very clearly
*  in our position paper how on every level, Israel has enacted a regime of Jewish supremacy. This
*  means that myself as a Jewish Israeli, I enjoy all the rights that a citizen in the democracy is
*  entitled to. And that through a whole, through many years of policies and practices, culminating,
*  obviously, in the nation state law that was legislated in Israel and has established
*  Jewish supremacy as an actual principle, a constitutional principle of Israel, through,
*  as I said, the Israeli government, through policies and practices over the years, has created
*  a situation where Palestinians are fragmented between many different areas in Israel proper,
*  the West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem, and each and every one of those Palestinians receives specific
*  and lesser rights and has access to lesser rights than any Jewish Israeli. And Israel has utilized
*  its control over all Palestinians. I'm also talking about the Gaza Strip control from outside
*  to prioritize its own interests and certainly to take over land. And we discussed this whole issue
*  of land takeover quite widely in our position paper. Now, we also state, and this I think is
*  important, that we're not saying, we're not using the word apartheid as a clear and kind of
*  historical analogy that is absolutely accurate to apartheid South Africa. Certainly, there are
*  certain aspects of grand apartheid and certain aspects of petty apartheid that apply and that
*  are quite prominent here. But the utilization of the term apartheid refers to a legal and international
*  international recognized an emerging notion that doesn't place apartheid only in the historical
*  context of South Africa. And I think my understanding and from all of the everything I've read and the
*  briefings I heard from Human Rights Watch, they've been trying to do the same thing.
*  Apartheid is also a recognized crime these days. And Human Rights Watch, I'm not saying that this
*  is exactly identical to what we saw in South Africa, but that this is a violation of international
*  law and reaches the level of an international crime that has been described and is also dealt
*  with today by the International Criminal Court. The International Criminal Court has opened an
*  investigation into the situation in Palestine. It deals with broadly with two issues, the issue of
*  the conduct of hostilities and the issue of Israeli settlements. And these are recognized
*  international crimes and violations of international law. Just two other questions.
*  That it's not an absolute historical analogy, but certainly it refers to
*  utterly unacceptable crimes. Absolutely. Just two more questions. I know you're out,
*  as you say, out in the field in the West Bank. Now we all know the Israeli, the official Israeli
*  narrative, which is Hamas is a terrorist organization. Israel is defending itself from
*  attack. And this is a conflict in which Israel is exercising its right to self-defense. And that's
*  the official Israeli state narrative about what recently happened. What's Betzelem's take on what
*  actually happened and the consequences for Palestinian civilians? So first of all, I think
*  it's important to say that this is a straw man argument because no one is, well, no one barring
*  the most unacceptable positions internationally is saying that Israel doesn't have a right to
*  defend itself. There's a big difference between saying that Israel has a right to defend itself
*  and saying that the price, the cost has to be about 250 people, including 66 children killed in
*  Gaza in two weeks, dozens of high rise buildings and tens of thousands of people losing their
*  homes. So high rise buildings brought down, bombings 24 seven, hundreds of severely injured
*  people and an emerging COVID crisis inside of the Gaza Strip because there's been basically this
*  entire two weeks has been a super spreader event. This does not, so Betzelem would initially, first
*  of all, say that when this is described as the only option for defending Israeli security,
*  we would question this. Secondly, we've written and we are already in the process of researching
*  the specific cases that we've seen and specific incidents we've seen over the past two weeks in
*  Gaza. But Betzelem described again and again how the large numbers of fatalities and civilian
*  fatalities and the vast damage to infrastructure and to property in Gaza is the result of specific
*  decisions and those are political decisions about the open fire policy. So people are being killed
*  and civilians are being killed because of political decisions about, for example, bombing the
*  homes without giving prior warning or those towers that have been destroyed were destroyed because
*  Israeli politicians, decision makers and also military of high ranking officers and legal
*  advisors reached the conclusion that this is acceptable, that this is a reasonable application
*  of international humanitarian law, the laws of war. And we show in previous reports and in kind
*  of like a few emerging reports that we've already issued how this analysis completely empties
*  these laws of any kind of purpose or any kind of content when the purpose of international
*  humanitarian law is to defend and protect civilians. So we would certainly challenge
*  the claim that this is an acceptable way for Israel to defend itself. Certainly we've also
*  denounced Palestinian rocket attacks at Israeli civilians inside Israel. The ICC, by the way,
*  the International Criminal Court is also investigating the conduct of Hamas and its own
*  war crimes that it's perpetrating. But I also think that when we step back aside, it's always
*  in, it's much easier to look at the last two weeks of hostilities, but why not look at the entire
*  context of what is actually going on in Gaza. You know, 14 years of Israeli blockade has devastated
*  the Gaza Strip. And this is on the, you know, following dozens of years of direct Israeli
*  occupation and de-development of Gaza that have caused this, the Gaza Strip to be what it is.
*  We're looking at an Israeli policy now pretty kind of openly declared of dividing and fragmenting
*  and weakening the Palestinian Authority and actually bolstering Hamas when it suits Israel,
*  allowing funding to come in to the Gaza Strip. And also, again, if we step back even
*  further and look at the entire area, the apartheid regime that has created a situation where these
*  kinds of rounds of hostilities, where Israel views the entire thing as something that only has a
*  military solution, which is obviously the opposite of what we would argue. There is no military
*  solution to this situation. But this kind of apartheid regime that is, you know,
*  establishing ongoing rounds of conflict, ongoing rounds of hostilities, which primarily harm
*  Palestinians in a devastating way, but also harm Israelis. And I should also mention that in
*  the last two weeks, we've seen an awful deterioration of the situation inside Israel
*  when it comes to the relationships between Palestinian and Israeli citizens or Palestinian
*  and Jewish citizens of Israel. And I think when, you know, when the entire picture
*  is looked at, so the entire, I think the Betzelins analysis, which is now a much more broad and much
*  more kind of holistic analysis of the entire area and the entire regime allows us to look at
*  the reality in a very open and frank way and to describe it also in a much more accurate
*  and I think truthful way, but then also to demand holistic solutions to this problem.
*  I certainly think that even now in Israel, and this is absolutely absurd and tragic and shocking,
*  Israeli commentators who certainly do not agree with anything I would say, they are themselves
*  talking about the next round that is bound to occur at some point as long as this issue isn't
*  addressed. So I think this really would be the essential unfortunate and terrible prediction
*  that as long as the situation is allowed to continue in this way, the next, you know,
*  explosion, the next round is only a matter of time. Now I should also add to this picture
*  the provocative actions of the Israeli government in East Jerusalem, the intention to remove
*  Palestinians from their homes in Sheikh Sharah. Now another neighborhood of East Jerusalem is
*  facing similar and even more severe actions. It's called Silwan and dozens of Palestinian families
*  are facing legal actions by Israeli settlers supported by the state and certainly
*  working with all arms, all branches of the government to remove them from their homes.
*  This is in Silwan in East Jerusalem. So all of these actions that are taking place, that are
*  guided, that are assisted by the Israeli authorities and that have contributed, and not even talking
*  about the kind of provocative actions of the Israeli police in the al-Aqsa mosque, need to
*  also be viewed in order for us to really understand and begin to offer solutions to what we see around
*  us, to this horrific situation that we see around us in order to not be in the same spot exactly
*  in three, four, five years down the line. Just finally then before I let you go,
*  I mean just firstly what do you say when Israel says they have precision guided weapons for example
*  to avoid killing civilians, what's your response to that? The final point is I suppose a desperate
*  plea for some optimism if possible because it's very easy to look at the situation and think
*  what will happen now is Palestine will slip down the agenda. We do have a global, of course the
*  biggest global emergency since World War II, people will stop talking about the Palestinian cause
*  and the settlements will continue to expand. Within Israel itself it will become ever more
*  a militarized society with civil society squeezed, the siege of Gaza will continue,
*  the rights of national self-determination for the Palestinian people will just slip away and the
*  United States, whoever is president, will continue to support and arm Israel, whoever happens to be
*  in the government and whatever their policy is towards the Palestinian people and you look at
*  that and think there's no hope and the campaigning work of people like yourself, as courageous as it
*  is, is up against this absolute formidable, powerful force. So that's a bleak summary but
*  is there any possible hope for a just and lasting peace which provides national self-determination
*  for the Palestinian people and a secure peace for Jews and Arabs alike? Well Owen, so basically
*  you've just described my list of nightmares, barring one I could add to this, you know, literally of
*  horrors, also climate change and the way it's going to affect our region and the way that
*  us, we as Israelis have managed to mitigate and will probably continue to manage to mitigate some
*  of the worst impacts of climate change through our control of Palestinians, just to add, to give one
*  example, to illustrate this, you know, there's an endemic water shortage in our entire area and this
*  is expected to become worse and deeper as a result of climate change. Israelis have more access to
*  water, we, in the, you know, the way we divide water between ourselves and Palestinians is
*  absolutely unfair. The shared water resources go primarily to Israelis and Palestinians have an
*  even worse water shortage and this is in the West Bank. When you talk about Gaza and Gaza's
*  water issues, the last two weeks have been absolutely awful because, for example, as far
*  as I understand it, a desalination plant has been affected as well, but the water in Gaza is
*  undrinkable and has not been worthy of drinking for many years, as is the entire Gaza Strip.
*  There's, you know, there's this kind of like, it's become a cliche now, a UN report from 10 years
*  ago saying that Gaza in 2020 will not be worthy of human habitation. Now 2020 has long passed, Gaza
*  isn't worthy of human habitations, but humans live there, right? So they do live there, it's not,
*  you know, they live in absolutely horrific and unfathomable conditions. It's unbelievable and
*  this seems to be, you know, just deteriorating all the time. So having said all of this, I'll
*  maybe give you a few, a list of a few of the things that I find currently optimistic about
*  the situation that we are in. But first I should also answer the question about Israel's guided
*  missile. So first of all, I think when you look at 66 children killed in Gaza over the past two weeks,
*  this, you know, this is the burden of proof is on Israel to prove that it is actually
*  adherence to the rules of international humanitarian law. And these, the suspicions that arise from
*  this large number of fatalities of children, women, men who are not involved in the hostilities
*  at the very least require like a very, very serious investigation that we know is not going
*  to happen under the Israeli system because we've researched and we've examined the data and we've
*  already found that it's not going to happen under the Israeli system because we've researched and
*  we've experienced the Israeli investigative system and we have declared already in the past
*  that it functions as a whitewash mechanism, not as a real mechanism to ascertain the truth
*  of these kinds of Israel's military conduct. Also additionally, there are already emerging,
*  and information emerging that calls all of these claims into great doubt. For example,
*  when it comes to the media tower that Israel blew up, that Israel damaged the Al Jazeera tower,
*  Secretary of State Blinken said he did not see any evidence convincing him that that was an
*  you know, a military target and an accepted military objective. Unfortunately, I really do
*  not see any way that Israel will conduct actual transparent investigations into not only the
*  specific conduct of individual soldiers, pilots, etc., but into the decision makers, into the
*  military lawyers who approve these strikes. This is not ever going to happen and it's
*  you know, kind of like a charade, a masquerade that is being performed by Israel in order to
*  pretend that there is some sort of mechanism of accountability. Additionally, I think our past
*  research into, for example, Operation Protective Edge showed, I think quite conclusively, how
*  simply saying that you're taking all feasible precautions to avoid harming civilians and yet
*  again, civilians are being harmed again and again and again from those policies that you've decided
*  on. It's all you know, things that are dictated from above. Those decisions are not made by
*  individual soldiers or individual personnel. These are political or very, very high ranking
*  level, high level decisions. The argument is not convincing when the argument is made and yet
*  civilians are being killed again and again and this continues and it has continued from the beginning
*  of the current round and for its entirety. One final thing is now information has emerged
*  inside Israel and has been reported in the media that in fact some of the targets selected were
*  kind of primarily for show, for PR purposes in order to threaten Hamas, in order to strike fear
*  into Hamas, in order to teach them a lesson. This has slowly been discussed in the Israeli media
*  and again, I think the onus of proof now is on Israel and I think it's very unlikely to be able
*  to, I think it's very unlikely that the Israeli authorities will be willing to provide any actual
*  convincing evidence and we would reject the legal analysis also that comes with it. Now in terms of
*  maybe just to finish on a positive note, I can give you a few a list of things that I've tried
*  to cling to in the last two weeks to make myself kind of like a little bit stronger
*  and I'm very glad you said, you described the conversations you've had with Palestinian
*  activists in the previous program Owen because for me that is actually the essential thing
*  that it seems like in the West and in the international media and on social media
*  Palestinian voices are being heard much more than they have ever been heard in the past.
*  This is at least my personal experience, of course I'm an Israeli and I speak from my own
*  perspective but one of the things that have really been encouraging for me is to see throughout
*  the world, certainly in the US, Palestinians raising their voices much more, reporting from
*  the field, talking from, you know, and broadcasting what is happening in Gaza and this I think is
*  really one of the first times this has been on display so much and listening to Palestinians and
*  listening to what they are going through and what they have done, what they have had to endure for
*  the last two weeks without some sort of like external kind of like resource like Israeli
*  human rights organizations or the media etc. I also think that I've taken a lot of encouragement
*  from the kind of very strong voices primarily in the United States talking about the struggle
*  against the occupation and against apartheid here in our region but comparing it to the struggle for
*  racial equality and justice in the US and I think that listening to speeches by some really inspiring
*  members of Congress and the Senate has been quite extraordinary and does indicate a change as has
*  some of the things I've heard from the US Jewish community that is going through a change itself.
*  It started in 2014 and even long beforehand but those things take time and but they are quite
*  optimistic. Inside Israel there have been dozens and dozens of protests and of demonstrations that
*  are joint between Jews and Arabs talking about not the kind of discredited word of coexistence,
*  it's no longer considered the right term to use but we're talking about partnership, right, about
*  a joint, a shared future and these demonstrations also are very inspiring and you know give one
*  hope that there is a strong group of Israeli Jews and Palestinian citizens of Israel who are not
*  going to be, who refuse to be carried away, to be you know sense feeling to be enemies of one another
*  and this has been quite helpful I think to kind of really
*  resist I think a lot of this official incitement that has been extremely
*  strong in trying to get Israelis to feel like the Palestinian citizens of Israel are enemies,
*  are kind of like trying to you know side with our enemies and also speaking to Palestinian friends
*  who finally, you know several Palestinian friends have told me that they feel that this
*  first, this is the first time in a very long time that Palestinians around all both all sides of
*  the green line and in the Palestinian diaspora have been working together and have been kind of
*  like trying to struggle for a shared future or for a shared struggle, those things have all been
*  very encouraging to me in the last couple of weeks. Sorry we really really appreciate you
*  joining us like this, we've also flashed up the betselem.org slash donate page, I presume that's
*  okay for international donations. Absolutely. So it's www. for those listening, b-t-s-e-l-e-s
*  for mother.org forward slash donate, do support their courageous work if you can. That point
*  about Palestinian voice is very important as I said we had last week two fantastic Palestinian
*  voices, we also have coming up more Palestinian voices including Bashar Murad who's a brilliant
*  gay Palestinian singer who we're very lucky to be speaking to in the coming days but we really
*  appreciate that sorry it was so comprehensive, so detailed and your courage and your insight
*  really came through and I've seen some of the comments people were beyond appreciative of what
*  you had to say so we really appreciate it and your courageous work and thank you for joining us.
*  Thank you all of course and I would also of course we really appreciate your donations and we need
*  this funding but the Betselem website also has a vast amount of information and we are going to be
*  updating it probably on a daily basis from now probably next few weeks with ongoing information
*  about the situation in Gaza and about the emerging results of our inquiries into the
*  Gaza hostility so I encourage you all to go in and there and read the material we upload,
*  we're also obviously available on social media so aside from donations which we appreciate
*  immensely we would also really appreciate that you read and look at our videos and kind of like
*  reach out to us and get in touch with us. It really is a brilliant resource and articles I
*  written in the past I relied on Betselem's fantastic work including what's on the website
*  so do go to Betselem follow them on Twitter as well very very important resource though as well.
*  Thank you so much Sarah stay safe out there and solidarity. Thanks a lot.
*  So now we're going to go straight in to talk to our second guest who we're really honored to have
*  who is Abraham Gutman who I think you're in New York aren't you Abraham let me just double check
*  I'm in Philadelphia. Philadelphia what am I like Philly sorry do apologize. Abraham thank you so
*  much for joining us big honor so could you just talk a bit about your own story because
*  you were born in Israel that's right isn't it you're you're or just tell me about your backstory
*  and I suppose your politicization. Sure and so thank you so much for having me
*  so yeah I was born and raised in Israel I lived there and you know and throughout high school
*  and after and I around 2004-05 in you know high school male school was getting more and
*  more political getting more and more involved in what I saw just you know injustice and what I
*  I seem to be just not didn't add up you know I one of the songs that my father used to sing to us
*  like a lullaby had a reference to a place called Umlabis and I remember him saying is oh this is
*  today Petah Tikva but Umlabis which is an Arabic name doesn't exist anymore so where did it go
*  like what happened and so starting to ask these questions starting to kind of notice what's going
*  on around there was a the second Lebanon war at the time that also involved in military action
*  in Gaza there was a big debate about whether that settlers should leave Gaza or not before the
*  blockade and and really finding that a lot of the conventional you know Israeli left narrative or
*  Israeli central narrative I should say didn't satisfy me that the system itself was problematic
*  and it was not enough just to be a good actor inside the system and and that led me to decide
*  to not join the idea there's a mandatory draft for everybody after high school women are 18
*  three years for men two years for women and that was a tough decision and just like so you talked
*  and that was brilliant I want to center this around the fact that you know the social sanctions
*  I endured as an Israeli are not violations of my civil liberties civil rights the freedom of
*  transportation freedom of and of speech and and livelihood and my ability to to to imagine a
*  future for me and for my children and so and I do want to center this around the fact that you know
*  the the kind of sanction of speaking up is not is not equivalent to this action of just unfortunately
*  being Palestinian between the river and the sea depending on where as it said the level of section
*  kind of differs but it's all terrible and but I chose not to join it was a the army it was a
*  long long process of conversations with family with friends in retrospect then I was very angry
*  I was I felt very you know unheard and kind of you know feeling I'm doing something righteous
*  and now I understand that a lot of people mainly my father and were really worried about me you
*  know it's hard to explain how much the army in Israel is a pipeline for social strata that you
*  know just like in the US and someone for years can wear their college alumni hat right to signal oh I
*  went to Harvard or I went to you know this place or I went to that place and this football team that
*  they and their college football team is still something that is is important to them and
*  something that you forever can situate someone in a conversation asking oh where do you go to college
*  and actually you get a lot of information from the answer right you kind of have an idea of who
*  you're talking to sometimes they're very much the same happens in Israel with the military
*  you know they're in companies that say oh we have a ton of people that come from this unit of
*  intelligence because they're super smart and like you know others and yeah like there's just so much
*  of that going on and so many of my kind of friends colleagues you know in Israel at the time and
*  found jobs through their former commander in the army it's the club and people a lot of people
*  you know still tell kind of war stories whether they're actual war stories or more like the
*  boring funny thing that happened in the base you know so it's really a big part of Israeli social
*  life and I think that what I understand now is that the main thing that people like my father
*  were concerned about is the fact that if I don't participate I will forever not be a part of the
*  club that will forever kind of chase me and so there was a compromise position and so basically
*  to not join the military in Israel there's generally two options and one is to object
*  which is what you kind of imagine like Vietnam style arrest right like you go to the day of your
*  of your draft day and you just don't agree to get on the bus and then you go to jail for a week or
*  two they send you home and and they tell you okay come back you know draft again and it goes in
*  circles and people spend a month in jail for for for for making a political statement and I admire
*  them very very deeply one of the things that this gets is that usually it's covered right that there's
*  media attention about the fact that there are people who don't serve and there's a tradition
*  and of groups of the 18 year olds when they're finished the senior year having writing letters
*  such as they're called which means seniors letter like the letter of seniors in high school
*  explaining why they won't serve and that does get a lot of attention and it is it is important and
*  inspiring thing somewhat the compromise position in my family was to go another route that to kind
*  of reduce a little bit the social sanction and I will ostensibly get out on a medical issue
*  of mental health that I you know am discussing kind of you know my my own anxiety and you know
*  don't tell the Israeli army if they're listening but maybe playing it up a little bit just to you
*  know and just to actually get out and so I I it's important to make that distinction and
*  but still after that you know you're 18 in Israel you're 19 in Israel everybody sees you I also
*  look like the age right and people like oh so what do you do in the army oh what this is the
*  middle of the day and you're not wearing a green uniform like why are you here and and it becomes
*  a very isolating experience and in Israel just like people talk here about Dutch draft dodgers
*  there it's like it's like people who invaded responsibility is the term people use like you
*  don't do your part and so I kind of volunteered as a medic for two years in like the Israeli
*  version of the Red Cross and and and yep it's something that like continues to this day to
*  by many it's funny because in you know in when I talk to you when I talk to Americans when I talk
*  to and people outside of Israel a lot of times and me being in Israel give me kind of positionality
*  that allows me to speak with more authority about the credit about the crisis about the
*  question of Israel about and the crimes of the apartheid that you all discussed before
*  but in Israel a lot of times I don't get that position because I didn't do my part so you
*  didn't you know so who are you to talk and then that's where you see veteran groups as being like
*  very effective internally so I mean we know throughout history occupations forms of colonization
*  corrupt the occupier or the colonizer so if we look at British colonization it always rested
*  on the dehumanization of the of the colonized that was a prerequisite because if you see
*  those who are being occupied or colonized as equal to your own people then you you know one would
*  not find that a tolerable or they're certainly less likely to find that tolerable state of affairs so
*  I'm just wondering just about how that dehumanization works how entrenched it is how
*  consequential it is within Israel and also for those veterans because I know you know there are
*  veterans breaking the silence as an organization that organizes Israeli veterans you know you do
*  get Israeli those who do join and then see the impacts of the occupation and the crimes of the
*  occupation and of apartheid and it has an impact on them you know what happens to those sorts of
*  people so I'm just quite interested in though in in both how dehumanization works and the impact
*  it has which is very common in these forms of regimes and that you know what what how what
*  happens to those veterans who who who see the impact and and has and then speak out
*  Yeah so the the the former the
*  the Israeli army is a peculiar thing you know on one hand it's one of the
*  maybe only armies in the world that by definition you're always at war you're always at the front
*  line on the other hand you can be on the front line for four days a week five days a week and
*  then go home to your you know to your parents house on a 25 minute bus ride depending on where
*  you're serving which is just so bizarre to have such brutal militarization of another people and
*  again we're talking about a size all the river to the sea and is is about the size of New Jersey
*  maybe this is not very much to your audience but we're talking about a very small territory
*  so so the the separation between you know supposedly the front line and the separation and and then
*  where is whom is miles away in terms of the type of freedom and world and you know reality that
*  you live but at the same time it's it's really close and I don't believe that that doesn't
*  that you can see that you can experience that transition without kind of being desensitized
*  so the fact that there's a door that you open there's a line that you cross and then it's okay
*  but it's very very clear to you that you know this is not okay to you and the demonization comes in
*  a lot of forms from from active propaganda and that we see you know and a lot of Israelis and
*  Netanyahu I think in 2003 or 2004 said at the time and that oh you know one day like we won't
*  control the Palestinians the actual threat to Israel as a Jewish state is is the demographic
*  threat right it's the fact that um and the population growth of Palestinian citizens
*  Israel are higher than Jewish citizens of Israel so eventually like it will be really hard to
*  maintain a Jewish a Jewish democracy and what is that calling kind of kids demographic threat and
*  kind of having that and kind of like you know the national zeitgeist that you grow up politically in
*  that can't not influence how you view another people right that there's no way no no there's
*  no amount of like homeless plates that you can share in Jaffa because you know and that won't
*  percolate into your consciousness and and you see this over and over and over again with you know
*  infamously a few elections ago Netanyahu said that the Arabs are going to vote in droves kind of like
*  in a swarm like effect of be terrified they're participating in democracy right so the logical
*  conclusion so to speak is is is that eventually their participation in democracy is a threat to
*  you and and that doesn't make sense because all people should participate in democracy so maybe
*  you know there are less people and then there's another part of this that is sort of like an
*  extra humanization if that makes sense and you know a writer who I rather not reference to why
*  I give a shout out wrote a newsletter when the bombing in Gaza started and she said that
*  the death of Palestinian children is a tragedy but it's an unavoidable burden of power for
*  maintaining Zionism so when you're essentially comparing you know throughout crisis you're
*  talking beginning of the show about asymmetry and casualties and there's a piece that I'm writing
*  that will come out next week and talking about asymmetry of even type of injury you see you know
*  news organization report in the same breath that there were 66 kids killed in Gaza 2,000 injured
*  another 200 250 something killed a Palestinian killed and then there were dozens of Israelis who
*  had panic attacks and as someone who is in the mental health space well like that's important
*  but Gaza has two million people in it if we try to tally the you know the shock injuries of
*  of Gaza that will be impossible right but but only one side of this spectrum of this of this
*  situation has the right to even have a shock injury and that is dehumanization when an Israeli
*  army says that oh you know leveling high rises we are the most humanitarian army in the world we
*  unlike Hamas we give warning we tell people that they can bake it their homes before
*  so if you the difference between you know kind of a human and you know an organism
*  is that we extend beyond life right like it's not only about breathing so when allowing someone to
*  live in homelessness is charitable because you didn't kill them I think that speaks volumes
*  to the type of mindset that someone can parrot that online on the news and you see the news
*  commentary all the time look they're saying we're doing this awful thing but we warned them
*  so and again then comparing that kind of the the the idea that there's a collective trauma in Israel
*  which there is but let's acknowledge that kind of you know the reality of if there's a type of
*  injuries an Israeli can suffer there's a type of Israeli that no plus in Gaza can suffer
*  and and then in terms of the so yes so I think I believe that the occupation corrupts
*  us as a you know militaries are hyper masculine and our our hyper militarized structures
*  they're violent structures there there is and and they're hierarchical in ways that are very in my
*  opinion damaging in terms of our psyche and and and I don't believe that you don't take that home
*  you know after and I also don't believe that just like people talk about how you know universities
*  liberalize people I don't believe that armies don't do the opposite because being an 18 year old kid
*  with a you know in the United States you can't even vote and and you can't even drink alcohol
*  you can't vote and you can't even drink alcohol wearing a uniform and denying passes to a Palestinian
*  that tries to go work and through the checkpoint who's your father's age that's a power trip that
*  no one should experience absolutely in terms of the oh sorry no go for it go for it go just in
*  terms of I'll show you speak yeah the the um the attacks on a folks in breaking the silence these
*  are a veterans a bit of a misnomer that I use because every almost every Israeli is a veteran
*  and but and these are people who served in the military and broke the silence and what they saw
*  they lead tours in places like Hebron and and and and and Nablus to and and place that you can enter
*  to and and Israelis and it's an extremely powerful voice where we need to be careful
*  including with me and I really appreciate you all for having Palestinians before us because usually
*  the directionality is opposite usually I'm allowed to speak first because calling me an
*  Israeli Jew and anti-Semite just doesn't land the same and and then then people you know graduate
*  to having a Palestinian which are the biggest authorities on their own experience in their own
*  oppression and their own liberation by the way so the um um the the problem with with me in a sense
*  and the problem with the relationship like in the silence is it does feed to the respectability
*  politics of who is allowed to speak so these are forces that we need I think we need people like
*  me who didn't serve to talk about why I think we need people who served and saw to share their
*  experience that's critical but we need to be careful that it's all done through and centering
*  Palestinians and it's all done through um uh and without creating barrier to entry to criticize
*  Israel I'm allowed to criticize Israel because I served is a problem but at the end of the day
*  the right-wing people who are driving the propaganda don't make those distinctions and
*  there was brutal harassment including billboards with names of breaking the silence leaders and
*  HSS as traitors so they're extremely courageous people. And just finally and then but this is so
*  fascinating again I'd ask you so many more questions but I have to go and get vaccinated
*  funnily enough so I have to have to leave in a few minutes but uh which I'm very excited about um
*  just finding I'm just interested this time around it does seem different um and I wonder why I
*  wonder if it's to do with Black Lives Matter and the impact BLM has had uh particularly in the last
*  I suppose year or so really um in the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd but also uh you know
*  there is the rise of the US left you have the so-called squad people like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
*  Ilhan Omar uh Jamal Jackson people you know sorry Jamal Bowman you've got a new you know maybe that's
*  part of it as well um and do you think finally do you think things this could be different and
*  actually maybe Israel's overreached and the global tide is turning and western governments will find
*  themselves facing more pressure uh in the way that South Africa ended up feeling more pressure
*  um or their governments western governments came under pressure to act on South Africa which they
*  did not do for many decades that's a very hard question to answer quickly sorry I'll do my best
*  because vaccination is important and good on you and so the here is the kind of how I think about
*  this we need to be both happy about kind of the change in tide and also be more honest about it
*  and I don't mean to like throw a blanket on this conversation in or on the proposition
*  most people started speaking after kids were killed
*  condemning the death of kids shouldn't be a moral like courageous moral act that's that's that's
*  really easy talking about the evictions and shesha the expulsions which is it's it's it's ethnic
*  cleansing east Jerusalem by politically motivated abuse of racist Israeli real estate law that's
*  what we should be talking about all the time because this is not new there was just a supreme
*  court hearing scheduled this time and police decided to you know crack down as much as possible
*  Israeli police on protesters which raised this to kind of international attention in some places
*  but you didn't see progressives and most progressives and talk about this in the United States when it was
*  still shahjarach you saw this when there were you know bombardment of Gaza that yeah the
*  symmetry suddenly becomes so easy to capture without any political analysis so we need people
*  to be not afraid from political analysis calling for a ceasefire is not that hard and unfortunately
*  it is and when it comes to Israel for some reason I don't understand completely why but like we have
*  to push forward this is why it's important that you're having this conversation I also think that
*  we need to be honest about who is talking and who talked from the beginning because it was
*  Ghasida Tlaib the you know one of the two first Muslim representatives and youth representative
*  in Congress and a Palestinian that had to carry this mantle it was Ilhan Omar you know one of the
*  Malay refugee the other half of the first Muslim and of the pair of the first Muslim female
*  representative in the US Congress it was Cory Bush activists from Ferguson where there was
*  Palestinian activists it was a Jamal Bowman it was Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez there's a theme there
*  and one of the themes is that you know there are also people who are people of color who are deeply
*  immersed in racial justice fights in the US just like the anti-apartheid movement was you see also
*  that the same in media the people who have carried the flag to talk about this have not been the
*  usual hosts of like MSNBC right some of the most watched shows haven't mentioned Palestine a week
*  into the crisis you've seen that now we have people like Mary Hassan and Ayman Mouhadin who
*  have platforms and there's this big question of like did people change their minds
*  or if these people were in power or had a voice or have a platform 10 years ago because we had
*  2008 2009 a war in Gaza that would look very similar nothing changed by 2012 2014 you know
*  so like would they have said the same things maybe but they were they were blocked out of politics
*  they were blocked out of those platforms in media they had someone have them as a guest and
*  then there would probably be another guest that says well I respectfully disagree and so I think
*  this is a lot of the fruits of the of organizing and of organizing the ground and of pushing
*  whether in politics or in media to have different voices and you also see that with what Salehi
*  said about Palestinian voices in media as well which I agree has been noticeable to me too
*  and and then I do think now is the question this is the inflection point right so the question is
*  not what happened last week the question is what happens next week Sheikh Jarrah still is under
*  the threat of explosion of families and Sheikh Jarrah are a threat of explosion for houses they
*  lived in for seven years after they became refugees so are people going to pick up this fight
*  and whether groups like APAC suddenly their endorsement which Barack Obama sought Clinton sought
*  and becomes toxic you don't want that endorsement for politicians you don't do the pilgrimage
*  really to the APAC convention because you know you you don't feel comfortable being a party that
*  and someone like um his name is the cave to me Trump lawyer Alan Dershowitz and feels comfortable
*  in which he did until 2016 and so so how do you become kind of that democratic party in the US
*  and how does the left kind of continue to push not only in Medicare for all not only on black
*  guys man but also in Palestine as a complete analysis not only of what justice looks like but
*  also on what using funds you know for a just way people always ask how are you going to pay for it
*  when someone um when someone raises a social policy well got four billion dollars for you
*  sitting right here and so if not because it's the right thing just do it for the money I guess
*  Abraham we really really appreciate you joining us like that that was absolutely fantastic
*  and so educational so enlightening and so full of humanity um which this this conversation needs
*  more of than ever and to have to have that moral clarity when talking about oppression is a very
*  important thing indeed and you provided that in spades so we really really appreciate it
*  and thanks so much for joining and everyone please do you follow Abraham Gutman
