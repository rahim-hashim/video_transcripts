# Conservative DESTROYS Government Over Israel's GENOCIDE
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [June 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4)
*  Now look, you're not exactly used to me praising conservative politicians, but this conservative [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=0.0s)]
*  MP has shown more moral clarity over Israel's genocide against the Palestinian people than 80% [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=4.8s)]
*  of Labour MPs put together. And it comes to something when I'm here praising a Tory MP, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  and specifically praising them as they attack a so-called Labour government. I'm talking about [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=14.88s)]
*  Kit Malthouse. He is a former Tory minister. He was a close ally of Boris Johnson. Not my [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=20.72s)]
*  usual bedfellow. Can tell you that from nothing. He has been superb as of late about Israel's [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=26.48s)]
*  genocide. The other week he asked a very, very important question to Labour's Middle East editor, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=31.36s)]
*  who was a nepo baby named Hamish Falkiner. He asked if he'd taken legal advice for himself, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=37.28s)]
*  the prime minister and the foreign secretary and other ministers for their own legal liability in [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=42.24s)]
*  the coming reckoning. Reckoning is a word I keep using. Let's hear what he said about Israel's [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=46.96s)]
*  aid massacres. The fact I'm using this phrase, aid massacre, but let's have a listen. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=53.44s)]
*  Madam MP, as the honourable lady indicated, we're all frankly getting a bit fed up with the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=58.72s)]
*  theatrics in this chamber. And if I'm honest with the minister, it feels like the whole house is [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=62.959999999999994s)]
*  being played. He shows up, he mouths the words, full of condemnation and being appalled. And very [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=67.6s)]
*  occasionally the government leaks out just enough sanctions, frankly, I'm afraid colleagues, to keep [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=76.16s)]
*  the Labour benches from open revolt. And yet since he last appeared, as others have mentioned, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=82.08s)]
*  22 new settlements announced and the Israeli government has replaced the unredistribution [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=87.84s)]
*  system with a shooting gallery, an abattoir where starving people are lured out through [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=94.32s)]
*  combat zones to be shot at. If the situation were reversed, we would now be mobilising, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=101.2s)]
*  quite rightly mobilising, the British Armed Forces as part of an international protection force. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=109.36s)]
*  So here's my question. What's the difference? Minister. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  I hope the honourable member will forgive me. He talks of theatrics where I come to the house [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=122.24s)]
*  and provide an update and he delivers a speech saying that we should do more. I just want to [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=127.92s)]
*  remind him and remind the house that the Labour government has a profoundly different position [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=134.56s)]
*  towards these issues than the Conservative government before us. We have taken a series of [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=141.2s)]
*  steps most recently, most recently on the 20th May. Whether... [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=146.32s)]
*  Order, order, order. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=156.08s)]
*  They're killing dozens of people every day. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=157.2s)]
*  Order, order. Minister. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=159.84s)]
*  We have taken steps. We will continue to take steps. We have led the international community [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=161.92s)]
*  in the most recent of those steps and I and we are under no illusion of the severity of the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=166.72s)]
*  situation that we face. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=172.72s)]
*  That's me clapping, not the Labour Minister there, that's me clapping the contribution of the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=175.76s)]
*  Conservative MP. Very well said, I have to say, by Kit Mothouse. He talks about the UN system of [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=179.12s)]
*  humanitarian assistance being replaced by a shooting gallery, an abattoir, gruesome language, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=184.48s)]
*  but it's true. He knows that all we're getting from the government is rhetoric and empty rhetoric [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=190.24s)]
*  at that. Now, Hamish Falconer, I called him a nepo baby, very rude of me. He's the son of Tony [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=195.36s)]
*  Blair's former flatmate, Charlie Falconer. Look, I'm sure I'm being really unfair. I'm sure he's [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  just risen to the top of Labour politics purely in his own steam, just because of his own talent, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=206.24s)]
*  not because of his family background. Anyway, he says that the government position, the Labour [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=211.36s)]
*  government position on Palestine and Israel is much better than the Tory government and of course, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=219.12s)]
*  Kit Mothouse is a Conservative member. I mean, the bar's on the floor here. I would note Kit [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=224.56s)]
*  Mothouse didn't serve as a minister in the Tory government after 7th October. He was a back bench [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=228.96s)]
*  in that period, but in no way can Labour claim the moral authority which Hamish Falconer is [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  discussing. There's no question the Rishi Sinai government facilitated genocide, just let's get [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  that out of the way. That's what happened. Keir Starmer at the beginning of the genocide, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=246.32s)]
*  the Labour leader at the time, Labour opposition leader, quite notoriously backed Israel's right [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=250.95999999999998s)]
*  to impose a siege on the Palestinian people. That is a war crime, which he then went on to claim he'd [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=256.24s)]
*  never said. What that did is mean there wasn't pressure on the British government to not [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=261.04s)]
*  collaborate with war crimes. Because the people are going, well, he's an opposition leader, he didn't [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=267.92s)]
*  have power. The opposition leader at the time had huge potential power because actually the polling [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=272.16s)]
*  showed at the very beginning that the British public opposed Israel's onslaught. There was a [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=276.72s)]
*  massive gap between the political elite and public opinion, but he stopped public opinion from [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=280.8s)]
*  pressuring the government because he was the leader of the opposition and rather than critiquing the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=287.44000000000005s)]
*  government for facilitating a heinous crime, he actually backed the right of Israel to commit a [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=292.48s)]
*  war crime and then gaslit us over it. When predominantly Muslim councillors resigned in [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=299.6s)]
*  the aftermath, a Labour source briefed a stooge journalist that the party was shaking off the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=304.08000000000004s)]
*  fleas. Labour opposed the ceasefire for 136 days of genocide of the poverty, forcing opponents of [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=309.52000000000004s)]
*  this barbarism to resign if they wanted to support a ceasefire. Epis who opposed the genocide had [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=316.0s)]
*  disciplinary action taken against them. When Labour backed the ceasefire eventually, it's because they [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=321.36s)]
*  were backed into a corner and actually they defeated a counter proposal from the Scottish [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=326.56s)]
*  National Party which would have meant Israel facing actual consequences rather than rhetoric. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=331.36s)]
*  Now, when the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA was smeared by Israel as being full of terrorist [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=336.8s)]
*  supporters, the Labour frontbench legitimised those smears, I'm particularly talking actually [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=342.64s)]
*  about Lisa Nandy, who was a shadow international development secretary at the time. In government, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=346.48s)]
*  they suspended just 8% of arms deals. Crucially, they continued to supply crucial components for [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=351.2s)]
*  F-35 jets to slaughter the Palestinian people. When after 20 months of daily genocide of the [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=358.15999999999997s)]
*  poverty, they decided to finally call Israel's behaviour intolerable, they took entirely tokenistic [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=363.28s)]
*  action, sanctions against some extreme settlers rather than the government. The Israeli ambassador [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=368.56s)]
*  was summoned for that nepo baby minister we're talking about to express his disappointment, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=373.03999999999996s)]
*  oh god, I bet she was terrified, creaking under boots. And negotiations over a trade deal we should [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=377.04s)]
*  never be negotiating with, with Israel, have been suspended, which was completely in the mind because [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  the UK embassy in Israel the following week trumpeted a visit by the UK trade envoy to Israel. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=388.0s)]
*  So that meant nothing at all. Hot air, nonsense. As Israel commits in full view of the world with [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=394.40000000000003s)]
*  British help and assistance, the most heinous crime is imaginable. And here's a crucial point, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=399.20000000000005s)]
*  you will now hear the British government use words like intolerable, intolerable. You might go, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=405.92s)]
*  well that's very strong language, come on, give them credit. How much stronger than intolerable [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=410.16s)]
*  can you get? Intolerable? I mean that's right up there. Aren't I just being unreasonable, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=413.52000000000004s)]
*  just want the moon on a stick. Here's the key point, always focus on this point. The British [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=417.36s)]
*  government is intentionally and carefully and studiously avoiding calling anything Israel does [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=422.72s)]
*  a war crime, let alone genocide. Note the difference with Russia, they're very clear Russia's [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=429.04s)]
*  committing war crimes, something I would never dispute. And it's not to belittle atrocities [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=434.32s)]
*  committed in Ukraine to note that Israel's war crimes are significantly, significantly more [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=439.68s)]
*  heinous and we're actually arming them rather than arming the victims. The reason they're doing this [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=444.08s)]
*  is because if they use war crime, if they said Israel was committing war crimes, that would have [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=450.08s)]
*  profound legal implications. It would force the government to end all arms sales and impose [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=455.2s)]
*  sanctions and it would criminally implicate the British government because then questions [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=460.0s)]
*  obviously would then arise. When did Israel begin committing war crimes as far as the government's [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=465.52s)]
*  concerned? What from the get go when they said it's war crimes? Is that when suddenly war crimes [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=469.76s)]
*  were committed after that? If they then, well how would they answer that question? Because then [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=475.6s)]
*  they'd have to answer how long was it before you realized they were committing war crimes? Or why [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=483.84s)]
*  did it take so long for you to realize they were committing war crimes given all the evidence? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=489.52s)]
*  The government's own complicity in war crimes and genocide will be exposed, that's the issue here. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=493.52s)]
*  Listen to this from the health secretary Wes Treating for example. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=498.15999999999997s)]
*  The situation in Gaza as the prime minister has said repeatedly is utterly horrific and [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=501.35999999999996s)]
*  intolerable. The scale of loss of civilian life, the attack on humanitarian aid workers that we've [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=506.96s)]
*  seen, the destruction of civilian facilities including hospitals has been a horror show frankly [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=514.0s)]
*  and we've worked with other international allies and partners to try and unblock the barriers to [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=520.96s)]
*  aid, to end the siege in Gaza, to get aid in and people out of harm's way including children [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=528.16s)]
*  that we've been successfully evacuating for treatment here in the UK thanks to generous support. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=534.0s)]
*  Hot air, just hot air. He won't say, he hasn't said that Israel's committing war crimes, which [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=540.32s)]
*  by the way the failure of journalism just continues. Why aren't they doing, you see a [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=544.24s)]
*  proper journalist here, journalists would just be hammering them on the issue of war crimes and they [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=548.88s)]
*  would be quoting war crimes experts, genocide scholars, all the rest of it and they would be [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=554.32s)]
*  giving examples of the obvious war crimes being committed. For example just siege, deliberate [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=559.44s)]
*  starvation, let alone the mass slaughter of innocent people, mass destruction of civilian [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=564.1600000000001s)]
*  infrastructure. We could go on. Westreeting knows Israel's committing war crimes, he knows that. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=568.72s)]
*  I can, I will bet you everything I own he knows Israel's committing war crimes. That makes it [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=573.84s)]
*  worse. Azarva Sultana, a very very principled and courageous Labour MP, suspended as a result from [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=579.4399999999999s)]
*  the party for voting against Tory benefit cuts which drive children to poverty and not let back [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=586.16s)]
*  in the party clearly because of her opposition to genocide. As she noted, when I called out UK [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=590.3199999999999s)]
*  complicity in the genocide in Gaza, Westreeting called it cheap. Now he calls it a horror show, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=596.4s)]
*  as if Britain isn't enabling Israeli genocide with arms and surveillance, a parlor game to him, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=602.16s)]
*  a cheap performance while Palestinians are massacred. Really important point there about [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=607.84s)]
*  the surveillance flights, British surveillance flights, which huge numbers have been conducted, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=610.9599999999999s)]
*  what are they doing? What's the purpose of these surveillance flights? What have, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=615.28s)]
*  what's the intelligence they've gathered? What evidence of war crimes have they gathered? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=619.6s)]
*  What war crimes have they facilitated? You see, just the other week, an Israeli, sorry, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=622.48s)]
*  a British minister was boasting that it is really a big Israel party that Britain was helping these [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=629.28s)]
*  surveillance flights. Another minister called Israel a friend and an ally. It's very clear that's [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=638.96s)]
*  the position of the British government, despite this rhetoric. Let's listen to Kirstama, the [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=643.52s)]
*  prime minister himself being questioned on Sky News. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=647.92s)]
*  Well, look, it's taken Sky News far too long to be asking these questions. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=677.92s)]
*  But obviously that's welcome. The fact these questions are now being asked shows, albeit 20 [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=706.64s)]
*  months on, how things are crumbling for the pro genocide lobby. Also note that Starmer is [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=713.04s)]
*  no longer vigorously pushing back at the accusation of genocide before, you know, he was like, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=720.4s)]
*  now he didn't, he's not, he's not standing his ground firmly there at all. I'd say he looks [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=725.76s)]
*  rattled and that's because he realizes a reckoning is coming. The fact that he's [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=732.16s)]
*  going to use it now talking about genocide, mainstream media outlets, the genie's out the [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=735.44s)]
*  ball because now what's increasingly going to happen is that's just going to be part of the [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=739.2800000000001s)]
*  narrative about genocide being committed. When before it was just us yelling very loudly, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=744.48s)]
*  look, you've all forced this on the agenda. All the people who's protested, spoken on social media, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=748.6400000000001s)]
*  you know, done everything you can to expose what's happening. You've brought us to this point. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=753.36s)]
*  This is an example of pressure as well as the work of Palestinian journalists and Palestinian [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=759.5200000000001s)]
*  civilians who have suffered in the case of Palestinian journalists, the worst massacre [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=763.68s)]
*  journalists in history by showing the world the truth, which the media hasn't been showing [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=768.3199999999999s)]
*  of the grievous atrocities being committed with exceptions in the media, but the overall [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=773.92s)]
*  problems generally, if you want an accurate picture of what's going on in Gaza, you're [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=778.9599999999999s)]
*  going on Twitter and see what Palestinian journalists are saying is more likely to get there. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=784.0s)]
*  All of that's brought us to this point. We should always remember the courage of [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=787.3599999999999s)]
*  Palestinian journalists, the lions of the world's press pack, the most courageous journalists [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=789.76s)]
*  in history. Indeed, and a sign of how things are changing, in Boundary Street yesterday, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=793.92s)]
*  Kistama met with the King of Jordan. Now there is a tradition for political journalists to yell [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=799.2s)]
*  questions at prime ministers, you know, like, will he be sacking this minister over a scandal? Are [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=803.68s)]
*  you going to sack him, prime minister? Are you going to sack him, prime minister? When did you [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=810.64s)]
*  get these donations, prime minister? You know, that kind of thing. Take a listen to these questions [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=813.2s)]
*  from a journalist. Let's just take you from there, across to Downing Street, where King [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=818.56s)]
*  Abdullah of Jordan is... Are you doing everything you can to stop the killing in Gaza, prime minister? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=823.52s)]
*  Thousands of women and children are dying in Gaza, prime minister. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=830.64s)]
*  How many more innocent people need to die before you call it genocide, prime minister? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=835.1999999999999s)]
*  Why are you not doing more, prime minister? Thousands of women and children are dying, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=840.88s)]
*  prime minister? Why are you not doing more? For the press there, despite those repeated questions [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=845.68s)]
*  from either the King or Kirsten Arman. I'm going to be honest, when I first heard that, I honestly [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=852.3199999999999s)]
*  thought someone had dubbed the questions on, in a kind of like, these are the questions people, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=857.1999999999999s)]
*  you know, journalists should be yelling. Because only accredited journalists with passes can get [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=860.7199999999999s)]
*  onto Downing Street to yell questions at politicians. I did some digging, and it turns out the journalist [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=864.64s)]
*  is Alexis Heenan at Sky News. Alexis Heenan, you're a real journalist asking the questions [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=869.68s)]
*  that need to be asked, actually scrutinizing the government about something that really matters, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=875.8399999999999s)]
*  which is its complicity and what a consensus of genocide scholars believe is a genocide. You put [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=880.2399999999999s)]
*  most of your colleagues to shame. You see, the media narrative that survived 20 months of genocide [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=885.68s)]
*  or depravity has been Israel's waging war self-defense. And let's have a side debate [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=891.3599999999999s)]
*  whether the response is proportionate or not, where we can all agree to disagree, rather than [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=895.84s)]
*  one of the great crimes of history has been perpetrated in front of the whole world, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=902.0s)]
*  which our government is facilitating. With the debate being, what will the government do to stop [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=905.76s)]
*  this crime from happening? And what is the legal liability of the government? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=910.32s)]
*  That's where we should have been at a very long time ago. Are we reaching a tipping point? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=917.2s)]
*  Things are changing in broadcasters. It seems so. Let's not underestimate the determination [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=923.12s)]
*  of a political and media establishment to protect themselves from the coming reckoning. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=928.24s)]
*  What is abundantly clear is we've got them on the run. That's what's clear here. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=932.64s)]
*  We're now at the stage of Israel's cheerleaders realizing they're going to be remembered alongside [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=937.44s)]
*  the other great monsters of history, and they're panicking about it. They didn't think it would [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=942.96s)]
*  ever happen to them. But here's the thing, almost none of the great monsters of history thought [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=948.0s)]
*  they'd go down in history as one of the great monsters. Quite the opposite. Consistently, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=953.28s)]
*  they thought they'd be remembered generally as heroes. Invariably, they also thought they [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=960.24s)]
*  were victims. You see, you didn't think it would happen to you, but you should have done it. Because [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=964.64s)]
*  all the evidence that this was one of the great crimes of history was there from the start, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=971.04s)]
*  and you chose to support it, to defend it, and to try and silence and destroy those speaking out [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=974.56s)]
*  against it. Actions. Consequences. There's no excuses, and a reckoning is coming. And you know [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPcWNLAiM-4&t=982.3199999999999s)]
