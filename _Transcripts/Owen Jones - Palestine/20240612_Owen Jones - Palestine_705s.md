# Israel CONFESSES Genocidal Intent
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [June 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVa4A81ZC9c)
*  This example is so shameless, so gratuitous, so overt, it's worth analysing as a case study.
*  The Israeli state has just come out and admitted its genocidal intent, boasted about it even.
*  Well, not for the first time, clearly. As the Israeli-American associate professor of Holocaust
*  and Genocide Studies, Radzi Galas, put it, it is rare for a state to be so open about its intent.
*  Normally, that's the most difficult element of genocide to prove. South Africa's written case
*  against Israel alleging genocide at the International Court of Justice had several
*  pages of genocidal intent and incitement from Israeli leaders and officials, and that was
*  printed back in December. Alas, it is very out of date by now, with many, many new additions.
*  Nonetheless, with the ICJ case ongoing and with the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal
*  Court issuing requests for arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*  and his defence minister Yoav Galan, alas, though not yet, for genocide, it is crucial to keep
*  documenting evidence of genocidal intent. Which brings me to a tweet issued by the official Twitter
*  account of Israel. That's right, it's an official Twitter account. Frankly, this Twitter account is
*  just wild. The state of Israel has an official Twitter account, which is simply at Israel,
*  which behaves like an alt-right troll account, appropriately enough, which is used to monster
*  opponents of Israel's genocidal policies, to push propaganda, and so on. Now this week,
*  they published a tweet which read, and I quote, we need to talk about the elephant in the room.
*  Seventh, it is also reported that guards and civilians held Israeli hostages captive in their
*  homes. The world must condemn this in the strongest terms. In the attached video,
*  it has a narrator with subtitles and that declares in the video that many guards and civilians
*  participated in killing, in raping, in looting. It then includes footage from an interview with
*  the former Israeli hostage, Mia Shem. It includes her saying in Hebrew, there are no innocent
*  civilians there, which it then translates into English for subtitles, so an English audience
*  can understand it. And it includes those subtitles in big, bold letters. You have to ask a very
*  straightforward, very simple question. Why did the state of Israel choose to put this tweet out?
*  When you study English at high school in the UK, a very basic test, they ask you to apply
*  to communication, its audience, purpose, and format. What I'm trying to say is a high school student
*  can obviously understand what these sorts of tweets intend to do. The audience are those in
*  western states, the states who arm and support the Israeli state, who facilitated this genocide
*  from day one, who are increasingly disgusted, repulsed by the mass slaughter of civilians,
*  tens of thousands. The purpose is to tell them they shouldn't be disgusted, because actually there
*  are no such things as innocent civilians. That Gaza's civilian population is collectively guilty,
*  that they are murderers and rapists and looters, and therefore they are fair game. You shouldn't
*  cry over them, you shouldn't mourn them, you shouldn't be angry about their slaughter,
*  because they are guilty. They are legitimate military targets. The format gets even more
*  disturbing. It's a video intended of course to stir up emotion, notably in order to override
*  the natural human feeling of empathy. But the Israeli state has put this particular tweet out
*  as an ad. In other words, it has paid, the state of Israel has paid Elon Musk to promote this
*  tweet to reach as many people as possible, to spread the message far and wide across the world
*  that Gaza's population, their civilian population, are collectively guilty. Now a few things here.
*  When it says many Palestinian civilians took part in the 7th of October attack, that's just a lie.
*  There was evidence of civilians crossing the border and taking part in the attack,
*  absolutely. But even the highest possible estimates would make that the tiniest, tiniest proportion
*  of Gaza's pre-war population of 2.2 million. Of course, if anyone commits war crimes, whoever they
*  are, they should face justice. War crimes charges are not confined to competence, to soldiers,
*  they're applied to civilians as well. So for example, for the purposes of international law,
*  Israeli settlers in the West Bank are classified as civilians unless they serve in the so-called
*  Israel Defence Forces. And Israeli settlers have been committing, and are right now committing,
*  blatant war crimes, such as slaughtering Palestinian civilians, including children, for example.
*  Now in any case, the Israeli state is asking us to impose collective guilt on the Palestinian
*  population as justification for a murderous onslaught which has killed tens of thousands
*  of Palestinians in post-famine and wiped much of Gaza off the face of the earth. Would it thereby
*  believe that inflicting the same treatment on Israel would be justified? I'll return to that
*  point. Now, note how all of the interviews, of all the interviews with hostages that Israel could
*  have selected, of all the quotes from hostages they could have selected, they specifically went,
*  in this very short video for, there are no innocent civilians there, which as they say,
*  they intentionally put in big bold letters and they are obviously endorsing that as a state.
*  Why else would they put it in the video in those terms and then promote the ad as using money to
*  get that message out to as many people as possible? This here is just one example, of course, of
*  genocidal mania, which is crucially officially sanctioned and encouraged by the Israeli state.
*  They've already promoted this genocidal mania within Israeli society and they wish to export it
*  all over the world. Now, it's rare for a state, as I say, to be avert with its genocidal intent.
*  Normally, the difficulty in legally establishing the threshold of genocide has been surpassed,
*  is the question of intent. What's the motive of genocide? Israeli leaders and officials have
*  engaged in genocidal incitement as well as straightforward expressions of genocidal intent
*  all the way through from the very beginning. So when I say from the very beginning, I mean,
*  for example, on October the 9th, when Yov Galant, the Israeli defence minister who the International
*  Criminal Court's chief prosecutor has issued a request for his arrest, declared that Israel
*  was imposing a total siege on Gaza, preventing the entry of all the essentials of live food,
*  water and fuel on the grounds Israel was fighting human animals. Or Isaac Herzog,
*  the president of Israel, who declared on the 13th of October, it is an entire nation out there that
*  is responsible. It is not true this rhetoric about civilians not being aware, not involved.
*  It's absolutely not true. They could have risen up. They could have fought against that evil regime,
*  which took over Gaza in a coup d'etat. That is straightforward collective guilt, which is a
*  precondition of genocide, making all civilians their targets. Isaac Herzog is an important
*  example because we can't simply dismiss this phenomenon conveniently as exclusive to what
*  is described as the Israeli right. Isaac Herzog is a veteran Israeli labour politician.
*  We also know Benjamin Netanyahu repeatedly indulged in this form of rhetoric. For example,
*  he declared just last month that 80% of Palestinians across the West Bank support the 7th of October
*  attacks, clearly again as the foundations for collective guilt with all the consequences that
*  entails. Across Israeli society, such genocidal sentiments are encouraged. Aviva Klompas is the
*  former speechwriter, the Israel's delegation at the United Nations. She's one of the main
*  influences in Israel's digital war. In February, a day after six-year-old Hind Rajab's body was
*  found along with her relatives, many of them children, after they'd been slaughtered by
*  the Israeli army, who also blew up the ambulance sent to rescue her, murdering two paramedics,
*  the day after Aviva Klompas shared an article dating back from October, that is four months
*  earlier. So she suddenly chose to share this article, which was one of the worst attempts at
*  an article I've ever read. I mean, it would flunk any basic tests of credible journalism.
*  She included a link to the article with quotes, but with her own words. New evidence from October
*  7 suggests Arab women and children were among the attackers and partook in murdering Israeli
*  civilians. How convenient that this just comes a day after little Hind Rajab's body is found
*  and there is mass revulsion around the world centering on Israel's mass slaughter of children.
*  Then she suddenly tweets that out. What on earth was the function of this tweet other than to
*  plant into people's heads that those who are clearly non-combatants, women and children,
*  are also guilty and thus fair game. Mohamed Shahada, the brilliant head of communications
*  at the NGO Yoram-Med Human Rights Monitor, who I must recommend you follow, he's an invaluable
*  resource all the way through this, he tweeted the following, Israeli civilians burned a Palestinian
*  baby alive with his parents and then celebrated our wedding and chanted Ali on the grill. I didn't
*  know about this particular story, there were too many. It's truly disturbing by the way. In July
*  2015, Israeli settlers firebombed a Palestinian family home, killing three, including the 18-month
*  old Ali Dababashesh. He was burned alive and his two parents who also died of their injuries weeks
*  later. Outside the court, Israeli settlers chanted, where's Ali? There's no Ali. Ali's burned. On the
*  fire. Ali is on the grill. It's just one example. Now to continue with Mohamed Shahada's tweet,
*  Israeli civilians launched dozens of pogroms in the West Bank over the past 16 months. Many
*  Israeli civilians live in stolen homes or in stolen land. 350,000 Israeli civilians took part
*  in the Gaza genocide as IDF reservists. Israeli civilians committed several sexual assaults
*  against Palestinians since October 7th, documented in today's UN report. Israeli civilians voted
*  convicted terrorists into office in the most extreme openly fascist government in Israel's history.
*  94% of Israeli civilians think the IDF is either using about enough or too little force in the
*  Gaza genocide. I can do this all day. Does that give a green light to kill all such Israeli
*  civilians who are genocidal maniacs? Of course it does not give such a green light. The point,
*  by the way, that's the point Mohamed is making. Collective guilt is, as I've said,
*  the precondition of genocide. I would know that Israeli society is currently in the grip
*  of genocidal mania. There are very courageous Israeli voices resisting that and they are courageous
*  precisely because they're so isolated. That does not mean in any way violence against Israeli
*  civilians is justified. It certainly does not justify doing to Israel what Israel has done to
*  Gaza. The dynamics, of course, importantly stated is that Israel is the occupier armed and backed
*  by the West and Gaza is the occupied. Palestine is the occupied. Indeed what Israel has done to
*  Gaza is one of the most obscene crimes of our age. The real answer is for the land to be shared by
*  Palestinians and Jewish civilians on the basis of equality and justice. But in the meantime,
*  the Israeli state has not been subtle. There is no excuse for those who say, I did not know,
*  those who feign ignorance. Israel has made it clear that it is intent on genocide and it's made
*  it clear over and over and over again. And that's why there must be no hiding place for those who
*  aided and abetted Israel in this crime. They must be held accountable as well. Please like and
