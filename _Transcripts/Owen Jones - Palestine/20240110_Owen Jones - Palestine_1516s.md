Video Description: I'm delighted to interview Ofer Cassif, an Israeli politician of the leftist Hadash party. He has signed a petition backing South Africa's genocide claim against Israel - and he explains why he's done so, the horrors currently enveloping Gaza, the attempt to silence him, the genocidal rhetoric of Israeli leaders, and what happens next.

# Israeli Politician Backs Genocide Investigation - Now They're Trying To Silence Him w/ Ofer Cassif
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE)
*  Hello, I'm delighted to be joined by Offa Kasif, who is a very courageous Israeli politician, a member of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=0.0s)]
*  Hadash party, which is a left-wing party which brings together both [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=7.84s)]
*  Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=10.88s)]
*  Now Offa has, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=14.64s)]
*  many of you may have seen, been in the headlines because he has supported the case made by South Africa, which has filed [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=16.16s)]
*  a case alleging genocide in the International Court of Justice. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=22.0s)]
*  Offa, firstly, a huge honor to be joined by you. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=25.12s)]
*  Thank you for having me and thanks for the compliments. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=29.04s)]
*  More than deserved. Can you just tell me why did you decide to back South Africa's case? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=32.08s)]
*  Well, there are two main reasons. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=37.839999999999996s)]
*  First of all, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=39.92s)]
*  I think that what's going on in Gaza should be investigated. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=42.96s)]
*  I don't want to say categorically that there is a genocide that goes on in Gaza, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=48.16s)]
*  but I do want to say that what's going on there should be investigated. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  Unfortunately, for more than three months there, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=60.06s)]
*  now, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=62.88s)]
*  Israel has been, you know, launching a terrible assault on Gaza, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=64.08s)]
*  including the missing people. I imagine, I'm afraid, that there are already [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=69.04s)]
*  around 30,000 [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=74.72s)]
*  dead [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=77.44s)]
*  in Gaza. More than 70% are innocent civilians, mainly children [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=78.80000000000001s)]
*  and women. We are talking now about apparently 10,000 children who were killed. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=83.36s)]
*  Children, not minors, but children. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=89.52s)]
*  We are talking about the total destruction of Gaza Street. More than 70% of the buildings are either [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=92.88s)]
*  totally destroyed [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=100.0s)]
*  or cannot be [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  lived in. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=104.24s)]
*  The United Nations that just published a couple of days ago that [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=105.52s)]
*  the Gaza Strip as a whole is on the brink of being a place that people cannot live there. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=110.08s)]
*  So, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=118.56s)]
*  apparently, you know, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=120.3s)]
*  it seems that some crimes are, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  or have been done there. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=126.08s)]
*  And so that should be investigated. And my signature is to investigate. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=128.72s)]
*  Israel, as part of the convention against genocide, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=135.68s)]
*  is not above the law. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=139.92s)]
*  It's not above the international law. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=141.84s)]
*  It's an, in that sense, the government should be investigated. And this petition, by the way, and I will, if I have the time, I'll [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=144.32s)]
*  elaborate on that later. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=152.14s)]
*  The petition, in my view, is not anti-Israel. It's not against Israel. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=154.8s)]
*  It is against the government of Israel. But because the government of Israel is the enemy of Israel, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=158.96s)]
*  it is eventually [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=164.0s)]
*  for the interest of Israelis as well to sign this petition. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=165.44s)]
*  The second thing is that the ICJ, as opposed to the ICC, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=169.6s)]
*  cannot [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=174.08s)]
*  prosecute any individual, either politician or military [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=175.6s)]
*  personnel, person or something like that. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=179.5s)]
*  The ICJ has the authority [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=182.24s)]
*  to issue [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=185.36s)]
*  a decrease or decisions, for instance, and that's the most important thing in my view by signing and by the end of the appeal itself, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=186.8s)]
*  that the ICJ has the authority [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=195.12s)]
*  to decide that the war, the assault on Gaza should be stopped immediately. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=197.76s)]
*  I support that. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=203.12s)]
*  First and foremost, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=204.96s)]
*  in order to save lives, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=206.56s)]
*  not only of Palestinians, of course, mainly of Palestinians as far as the death toll is concerned, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=208.72s)]
*  but I want to save the Israeli hostages. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=215.12s)]
*  The government hasn't been doing anything to save the hostages. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=219.04000000000002s)]
*  There's a huge negligence, a criminal negligence by the government on the eve of the massacre, the totally [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=223.04000000000002s)]
*  condemnable, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=231.12s)]
*  sick criminal [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=233.52s)]
*  carnage done by Hamas, which we totally condemn, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=235.58s)]
*  and I expect any human being, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=240.16000000000003s)]
*  mainly the supporters of Palestinian liberation, to condemn Hamas for this massacre. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=242.72s)]
*  But as I began to say, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=248.0s)]
*  the government [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=252.24s)]
*  neglected the south of Israel for many years [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=255.18s)]
*  and allowed the massacre to take place. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=259.12s)]
*  And many people in Israel, including many of the families of the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=262.48s)]
*  victims of the massacre in Israel, the hostages say the same. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=266.72s)]
*  I have to say that I'm in touch on a daily basis with some of the families of the victims, including the hostages. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=270.8s)]
*  Some of them, of course, not all of them, but some of them totally support [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=278.24s)]
*  my and my friends, my colleagues, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=282.08s)]
*  political views and stance. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=284.64s)]
*  So to get back to your question, and then [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=287.36s)]
*  the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=291.28s)]
*  signature is to express [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=292.64s)]
*  my will [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=295.68s)]
*  for ending the war and saving lives. And by the way, not only of Palestinians and the hostages, and again, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=296.96s)]
*  because the government doesn't do anything to save the hostages because they are dying there, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=303.92s)]
*  they are dying there, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  because they have no treatment. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=310.48s)]
*  Many of them are old, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=313.44s)]
*  sick, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=315.68s)]
*  and they don't get, they are assaulted by Hamas. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=317.20000000000005s)]
*  They are under the bombarding of Israel as well. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=321.44s)]
*  There are illnesses there, etc. etc. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=324.64000000000004s)]
*  But the government doesn't agree to do whatever it's possible, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=327.76s)]
*  they can, to release them immediately. And we all say all for all, that means prisoners exchange. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=332.48s)]
*  But if hypothetically the ICJ [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=338.40000000000003s)]
*  issues the decision that forces Israel hypothetically to end the war, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=342.24s)]
*  so then the chances of releasing the hostages are going to get greater. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=348.40000000000003s)]
*  And I also don't want Israeli soldiers to be killed. Israeli soldiers have been killed on a daily basis, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=353.12s)]
*  but not for the security of Israel. This is a sham. This is a brainwash by the government. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=359.92s)]
*  They are sacrificed by Netanyahu and his thugs, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=365.04s)]
*  especially the more bigots ones, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=369.12s)]
*  on the altar of their own survival, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=372.24s)]
*  of the government's survival. That's a terrible crime against Israel. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=375.20000000000005s)]
*  I want it to be stopped. And if the decision by the ICJ stops it, I've done my share. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=380.40000000000003s)]
*  What's been the response from the Israeli government supporters of, for example, Likud, the coalition government politicians, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=388.08s)]
*  commentators on the right, pro-war commentators? What sort of response have you had? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=396.15999999999997s)]
*  Response to my signature, you mean? I didn't hear. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=401.35999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. Yeah. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=403.84s)]
*  I'm sorry. First of all, as far as the public discourse in general is concerned, you know, the social network, etc. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=405.84s)]
*  I do have some support, and I must use this opportunity to express my gratitude for those who support me, Palestinians, Jews, Israelis, and Arabs as well. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=414.47999999999996s)]
*  But of course, it seems that the dominant or the hegemonic discourse is very hostile, not to say violent. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=427.91999999999996s)]
*  And by the way, under the auspices of this fascist government, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=438.32s)]
*  and the prime minister who has been supporting violence against his own, you know, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=443.12s)]
*  objectors, not only now, but throughout the years, especially since this government was formed one year ago. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=449.65999999999997s)]
*  But as far as the parliament is concerned, I'm very concerned about their own concern. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=457.59999999999997s)]
*  I'm concerned about that. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=464.08s)]
*  According to the Israeli law, a law that was enacted [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=466.0s)]
*  in 2016, and we oppose to, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=470.16s)]
*  if 70 members of the Knesset out of 120, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=473.92s)]
*  and 10 of whom must be from the opposition, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=479.52000000000004s)]
*  sign a petition [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=484.24s)]
*  to expel [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=486.64s)]
*  a member of the Knesset. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=489.28000000000003s)]
*  So there must be a discussion that first and foremost in the [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=491.52000000000004s)]
*  Knesset committee, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=496.40000000000003s)]
*  if 70 percent of the members of the Knesset committee votes for the motion to [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=498.4s)]
*  expel or impeach, if you like, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=504.56s)]
*  a member of the Knesset, then it goes back to the assembly, and there [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=507.28s)]
*  there's a vote. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=511.84s)]
*  And if 90 out of the 120 of the members of the Knesset vote for [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=513.36s)]
*  this impeachment or expulsion, so the member of the Knesset is [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=519.1999999999999s)]
*  expelled. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=523.76s)]
*  And I mean, not on the spot. It takes years to two weeks before, so to use it to appeal to the Supreme Court, etc. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=525.36s)]
*  So the first stage already succeeded because they collected yesterday evening [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=534.64s)]
*  more than 70 signatures. Now I must say [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=539.52s)]
*  the guy that the member of the Knesset to began with this motion when he initiated it is a fascist. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=543.6s)]
*  So I'm not surprised. He's part of those who [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=550.96s)]
*  knows Avigdor Liberman's party. It's called Israel Our Home. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=555.52s)]
*  It's a fascist party. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=559.76s)]
*  The leader of the party, Avigdor Liberman, is also a violent [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=562.72s)]
*  person, politically speaking. I mean, he's [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=568.64s)]
*  not only politically actually, but [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=572.4s)]
*  he was actually [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=575.6800000000001s)]
*  charged with hitting a minor, but that's not our issue now. He's politically [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=578.32s)]
*  violent. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=584.96s)]
*  And so I'm not surprised. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=586.32s)]
*  I'm not surprised either by those [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=589.12s)]
*  thugs from the so-called Jewish power and [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=591.76s)]
*  religious ionism or even worse than the fascists. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=595.9200000000001s)]
*  They resemble Oswald Mosley, if you like. You know, if the Likud resembles the Inuk power, they resemble [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=600.8000000000001s)]
*  Oswald Mosley. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=607.2s)]
*  And [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=610.08s)]
*  so [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=612.32s)]
*  in that sense, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=613.28s)]
*  I'm not surprised and I'm not even angry because those are their views. I'm angry at the situation that allowed them to be in power. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=615.12s)]
*  I am angry at those members of the Knesset of Yesh Atid, of Yair Lapid's party who signed [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=624.4s)]
*  and who are supposedly democratic and liberals. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=631.68s)]
*  And they [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=635.92s)]
*  signed [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=637.6s)]
*  in order to silence [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=640.4s)]
*  my opposition because legally they know they have no basis. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=642.4s)]
*  The attorney of the Knesset opposes the motion [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=646.8s)]
*  professionally. She says there's no reason because the law [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=650.4599999999999s)]
*  says very explicitly [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=655.68s)]
*  the only three reasons [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=657.92s)]
*  that [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=660.88s)]
*  members of the Knesset can sign and expel [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=662.16s)]
*  another member of the Knesset who is or she is elected. Let's not forget. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=666.64s)]
*  Is either if that member of the Knesset supported terrorism, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=673.36s)]
*  racism or armed struggle against Israel. Neither of them is relevant to me and to my signature. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=679.74s)]
*  Quite the contrary. Those who call for the elimination of Gaza and there are ministers who say so, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=687.28s)]
*  explicitly it was published. It's not my interpretation or imagination. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=693.5799999999999s)]
*  Those who call for the elimination, extermination of Gaza, a minister who called to bomb Gaza with an atomic bomb [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=697.46s)]
*  is too ignorant to understand that it really may influence Israel too. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=705.7800000000001s)]
*  The prime minister [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=711.62s)]
*  who referred [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=713.22s)]
*  to the people of Gaza as Amalek, which in the biblical sense, it's a people that deserve extermination. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=714.82s)]
*  The president of the country signed a bomb [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=722.5s)]
*  He signed a bomb, a farewell, a bomb voyage, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=726.98s)]
*  greeting on a bomb that statistically speaking [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=731.28s)]
*  may have been killed children. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=736.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=739.38s)]
*  Neither of them is going to be impeached. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=740.5s)]
*  It's normal. That's the dominant public discourse, but someone like me who opposes any kind of violence [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=743.54s)]
*  of Hamas and of Israel's [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=752.98s)]
*  is going to perhaps be impeached. That shows [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=755.86s)]
*  to which bottom, to what abyss [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=759.78s)]
*  our society, unfortunately, and the Knesset deteriorated. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=764.02s)]
*  I mean, that's what I want to ask you. In South Africa's case, the second part deals with genocidal incitement intent. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=768.74s)]
*  And that itself is illegal. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=775.7s)]
*  In order to show intent. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=778.26s)]
*  Exactly. So in the 1948 genocide convention, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=779.62s)]
*  makes it clear that's a criminal act and signatories have a duty, a legal duty, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=783.7800000000001s)]
*  to prosecute people who engage in genocidal intent. And I'm just interested in that atmosphere [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=789.94s)]
*  you just mentioned from Benjamin Netanyahu, as you say, Amalek, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=794.82s)]
*  where God orders the killing of all men, women and children and sucklings and livestock [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=798.1800000000001s)]
*  to human animals. I mean, it's just every day you just get, you know, that document's out of date now. That section's out of date. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=804.34s)]
*  Because there's been so much incitement since. And then, so just wondering, that does seem to be kind of spiraling out of control, that kind of genocidal rhetoric. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=811.78s)]
*  The rhetoric is unbearable. And it dominates the public discourse and it dominates the government's discourse because Netanyahu is totally dependent upon the most [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=820.3399999999999s)]
*  fanatic components of his government. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=830.9s)]
*  Let's not forget that there are three serious charges against Netanyahu that he faces [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=834.02s)]
*  trial and bribery, for instance. He knows for sure that the chances of going to prison [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=838.98s)]
*  once and if he's convicted are quite, you know, great, are quite high. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=845.46s)]
*  He wants to do, he will do anything [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=853.38s)]
*  to refrain from going to prison. So he's actually under the total [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=856.66s)]
*  power and control of the most fanatic and bigots in his government like Smotrich, Ben-Gvir and others. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=862.1800000000001s)]
*  By the way, they're even worse than them. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=869.86s)]
*  And I don't know if the people know, but we are talking about people, Ben-Gvir was convicted in Israel, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=872.4200000000001s)]
*  you know, the court in supporting terrorism. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=879.86s)]
*  Until one year ago, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=884.58s)]
*  he had in his living room [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=887.0600000000001s)]
*  a picture of Baruch Goldstein who massacred 29 Palestinians while they were praying in [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=889.8599999999999s)]
*  the Hallel and he had the picture and he referred to him as his hero. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=898.02s)]
*  He didn't take it off the wall because he stopped agreeing with him, but because he knew that that way harm [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=901.06s)]
*  is a chance to become a minister or to stay as a minister, but his views are still the same. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=908.26s)]
*  He supports genocide quite clearly and is the [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=914.5799999999999s)]
*  a national security minister is in charge of the police. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=918.5s)]
*  The police, by the way, has become a sort of a private militia of his. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=922.98s)]
*  Smotrich is a Jewish supremacist who believes ideologically [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=929.9200000000001s)]
*  that the Jewish race, as it were, of course, is superior. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=936.1s)]
*  He, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=940.9000000000001s)]
*  not too many years ago, said very explicitly that he refuses that his wife [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=942.34s)]
*  is going to give birth in a [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=948.1800000000001s)]
*  or to be in a hospital, the same room with Arab women. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=952.5s)]
*  So, and this is only the tip of the iceberg. They control the Israeli public discourse and they control Netanyahu. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=956.74s)]
*  And that doesn't, by the way, say to say that Netanyahu bears no responsibility because he is under such a control. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=964.5s)]
*  No, because eventually he chooses what to do. He chooses what to do. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=972.2600000000001s)]
*  So it is for sure his guilt. So [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=977.46s)]
*  this is the atmosphere. This is the atmosphere. And I must say [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=981.7s)]
*  that they put some of the blame on the international community that allowed [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=987.22s)]
*  this situation to emerge. It could be stopped. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=992.5s)]
*  And it could be stopped ages ago if the international community, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=995.94s)]
*  and by the way, Britain is one of the main factors here, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=999.78s)]
*  by forcing Israel and the Palestinians to end the occupation and reach a just peace. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1003.06s)]
*  Everybody knows. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1010.9599999999999s)]
*  Everybody who doesn't suffer from vacuum between his one's ears [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1012.7399999999999s)]
*  knows that the only way to stop the bloodshed [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1017.3s)]
*  is by ending the occupation and the siege from Gaza. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1022.5799999999999s)]
*  FNP for now, we're talking about stopping the war. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1026.5s)]
*  If we're talking about the tropical, you know, situation, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1029.86s)]
*  ending the war, exchange of prisoners, releasing the hostages, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1034.5s)]
*  and reaching a just peace without siege, without violence, without occupation. No other way. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1038.8999999999999s)]
*  Unfortunately, the international community [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1047.62s)]
*  actually has been sacrificing the Palestinians and the Israelis together. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1050.5s)]
*  The international community has been sacrificing. It doesn't care at all [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1056.02s)]
*  about the lives of neither Palestinians nor Israelis. That's a huge shame [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1067.6200000000001s)]
*  on the international community and mainly the United States. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1075.6200000000001s)]
*  I mean, just finally on that, I mean, I guess in terms of the [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1079.3s)]
*  hope, I suppose, or something practical, what would your plea be to those in states like Britain or [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1083.06s)]
*  the United States? I think it's very interesting. There's a new, younger Jewish left in the United [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1090.98s)]
*  States, which is leading many of the struggles at the moment in support of peace and in solidarity [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1095.54s)]
*  with Palestinians. But also in terms of the future, in terms of Israel, because you are [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1101.3s)]
*  the encapsulation of this great history of Jewish humanism, social justice, for which there wouldn't [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1104.9s)]
*  be a left. I say this a lot, but it's true. There wouldn't be a left on a global scale [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1111.06s)]
*  without the contribution of that Jewish tradition. Absolutely. Absolutely. In my view, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1117.1399999999999s)]
*  I'm a socialist. I'm a Marxist. That's my main self-identification. But I'm not [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1125.78s)]
*  delineated to Judaism, not in the religious sense. I'm totally atheistic, but I am Jewish [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1136.1s)]
*  and I'm not ashamed of that. And I am not delineated. In my view, the heritage [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1143.3s)]
*  of the prophets is mainly be a dissident. I mean, if we look at Jeremiah, for instance, Isaiah, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1150.58s)]
*  Amos, Amos, and others, they actually were prophets against the ruler. They paid huge [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1161.62s)]
*  price. You know, they stood against the kings once the kings behaved in an unjust manner. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1174.4199999999998s)]
*  I think that in that sense, the real heritage and legacy of early Judaism is justice, is equality. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1183.54s)]
*  Of course, I have my own criticism of other components of Judaism because they are terrible [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1195.8600000000001s)]
*  malicious components as well. I'm not idealizing any kind of religion, neither Judaism nor others. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1202.02s)]
*  Each and every religion has its own positive and negative ingredients, so to speak. But the basis [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1210.5s)]
*  of Judaism, in my view, of the prophets, the message of the prophets is to seek justice. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1219.54s)]
*  And I'm afraid that Judaism, that Jewish power party or religious Zionism party and others, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1228.98s)]
*  as individuals and other groups, the kind of Judaism they endorse and they follow is a deformed [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1239.22s)]
*  one. It is a twisted one. So my struggle, personally speaking, alongside my struggle for [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1248.66s)]
*  justice is also to save, as it were, the Judaism from the claws of those who deform it. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1260.34s)]
*  And by the way, I must say, this is another thing which is very important for me. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1274.66s)]
*  My signature, for instance, with which we are dealing mainly, is not against Israel, is against [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1279.06s)]
*  the government of Israel. It's because the government of Israel is against Israel and [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1285.54s)]
*  against the Israelis. I consider myself to be fighting for justice, but justice is for all. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1290.1s)]
*  It's also for Israelis. And in contrast to many who believe that there is a kind of zero-sum game [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1296.8999999999999s)]
*  between the Israelis and the Palestinians, the Arabs and the Jews in the land, as if [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1305.62s)]
*  if one side wins, the other loses and vice versa. As opposed to that, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1313.06s)]
*  I believe that it's either a win-win situation or a lose-lose situation. Either both people win, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1319.54s)]
*  that means peace, security, prosperity, liberation, democracy, justice, or both people lose. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1326.66s)]
*  Go to hell if you like. Those are the two alternatives. And because of that, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1335.38s)]
*  it's also the interest of the international community. Because this war, if it goes on, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1340.4199999999998s)]
*  if it doesn't stop, everybody knows that it's not going to stop there between Israel and [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1348.1s)]
*  Hamas or Israel against Gaza. It's going to spread. It already began to spread to the north. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1356.7399999999998s)]
*  A war with Hezbollah, the death toll is going to be much worse than the Palestinians, especially [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1361.94s)]
*  have been suffering from in the last three months. And of course Israel too. It's the worst massacre [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1375.3799999999999s)]
*  that the Israelis have been suffering ever since Israel was established. It's going to be much [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1380.98s)]
*  worse. We are talking thousands, tens of thousands of Israelis, Lebanese, Palestinians who may be [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1387.22s)]
*  killed. And I'm not talking about the destruction, et cetera, if a full-fledged war is going to [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1393.78s)]
*  begin in the north. But if the international community doesn't stop, that it will happen. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1401.22s)]
*  And then Iran is going to get into the business. And then the United States and the EU, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1407.14s)]
*  we are on the brink of a serious threat of a world war. So it's the interest of the international [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1411.8600000000001s)]
*  community, not only for justice, although for me it's the main thing, but it's also, you know, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1419.7s)]
*  so to speak, out of the politics. It's the interest of the international community to get involved and [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1428.1000000000001s)]
*  stop the war and lead the region to real peace. There's a chance, but we do need you. That's [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1436.26s)]
*  also the interest of Israel. It's very important for me to say, of Palestinians and of Israel as [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1442.98s)]
*  well. And I wish we get there soon because the alternative is a total destruction on a global scale. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1447.94s)]
*  Offer, it's been such a privilege and you're quite correct throughout history, those who often stand [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1458.8200000000002s)]
*  up against horrible violence and injustice and oppression, often vilified and attacked and [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1464.74s)]
*  ostracized and threatened at the time, they end up being vindicated by history. And those who vilify [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1469.86s)]
*  and attack them often end up damned. And I think it's pretty obvious how this one's going to pan [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1475.6200000000001s)]
*  out. I don't really think it needs to be, you don't need to be a prophet to work out how this one. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1480.18s)]
*  I have to say I'm not a prophet, but let's not forget that as opposed to many Israelis, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1486.34s)]
*  Netanyahu is not a king. Very good, very good way to end I think. It's a huge honor. Please [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1490.74s)]
*  for everyone who's watching or listening to this, do share the video, get off his message out. We [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1498.98s)]
*  need it heard very loudly and clearly. Do like as well, leave comments, subscribe. Offer, thank you [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1503.22s)]
*  so much. Thank you, it's been a pleasure. Thank you, all the best. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51vnDL0zifE&t=1509.14s)]
