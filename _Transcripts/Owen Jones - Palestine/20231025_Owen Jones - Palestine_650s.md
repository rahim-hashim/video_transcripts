# Exposed WITCH HUNT Against Palestinian Supporters Underway
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcVVVSgt7LY)
*  Okay, this is important. A witch hunt is currently underway against those who oppose Israel's hideous
*  assault on Gaza, who oppose the mass death and maiming of thousands of innocent people,
*  the collective punishment, the siege, the forced removal of civilian populations, the mass destruction
*  of civilian infrastructure, the bringing of a healthcare system to the brink of collapse.
*  Indeed, against those who believe there will never be a lasting peace which protects both Arabs and
*  Jews alike until there is justice for a Palestinian people who've suffered the longest belligerent
*  occupation in modern times, colonization, the theft of their land in favor of illegal settlements,
*  apartheid as defined by human rights organizations in Israel and the West. We could go on. Now,
*  cancel culture. We've heard that term bandied around a lot, haven't we? And in response to
*  this video, a lot of, I would describe the usual suspects, let's call them that, shall we? Will go,
*  hold on a minute, I thought you said cancel culture doesn't actually exist. Well, let's be
*  clear. We've always had an attempt in rich countries to silence and intimidate those who
*  either challenge the interests of the wealthy or who challenge the foreign policy of their
*  establishments or indeed both. Now, most are at least aware of McCarthyism in the United States.
*  That was the late 40s and early 50s at the beginning of the Cold War in which those accused
*  of being communists, rightly or wrongly, often they just had a progressive disposition,
*  had their reputations and indeed lives ruined. And that helped, for example, neutralize the power of
*  organized labor in the United States. That was actually known as the second Red Scare at the time
*  because the first came after Russia's October Revolution in which we had violent police
*  repression, arrests, mass deportations. Why do I just give that context? Because
*  this has always happened throughout history and it's often erased in terms of what actually
*  happened, I suppose. Now, we often hear about cancel culture today. Often that simply refers
*  to famous people with massive platforms getting criticized on social media, not quite the same,
*  and then using that to claim they're being silenced, which they claim in their newspaper
*  columns on TV, radio, in their books, in public events, you get the picture. Now,
*  let's talk about how those who've had the temerity to think killing innocent people is bad
*  and that oppressed people should be oppressed, how they're being treated.
*  Firstly, there's the tube driver who led a chant of free Palestine when he had a tube full of
*  Palestinian pro-Palestinian demonstrators. Let's just listen to this superstar. He must be protected
*  at all costs.
*  Keep all those people in your prayers. Have a good day.
*  What happened there is a son did a front page splash screaming at him, as did various politicians,
*  and then he got suspended from his job. That's what's happened. Well, I hope and trust his union
*  and his fellow workers are doing everything they can to stand by him, but just a little thought
*  experiment. Let's just think about this. Imagine he had a tube full of people protesting against
*  Russia's invasion of Ukraine and he had chanted free Ukraine. Well, you think they'd be outraged
*  here? Do you think he'd have been suspended? We all know otherwise. That just would not have
*  happened. Now, let's turn to another example, which frankly I find completely twisted. Michael
*  Eisen was the editor of eLife, a prominent science journal. He's Jewish. He has his raily family.
*  He shared an article from the brilliant, statistical website, The Onion. The headline
*  of this article was, Dying Garzans Criticized for Not Using Last Words to Condemn Hamas,
*  an article which rightly damns collective punishment and how anyone speaking about the
*  hideous loss of innocent Palestinian life has to caveat with condemnation of Hamas. Now, he
*  retweeted it with the comment, The Onion speaks with more courage and insight and more clarity
*  than the leaders of every academic institution put together. I wish there was a Onion University.
*  10 days later, he tweeted, I've been informed that I've been replaced as the editor in chief
*  of eLife of retweeting a Onion piece that caused that indifference to the lives of Palestinian
*  civilians. This is an absolute scandal. Let's be very clear about that. It is disgusting. It is
*  absolutely appalling. It caused a revolt at eLife. Lara O'Urban was one of them. She said,
*  it's with great sadness I have to resign from his eLife editor and early careers advisor after
*  her boss, of course, Michael Eisen was fired. And she said for using his freedom of speech to stand
*  up once again for the people who were silenced and had a bigger statement than that. Now, here's
*  some other outrageous examples. The Frankfurt Book Fair, a Palestinian author, Denia Shibley,
*  a very celebrated author, was due to receive a prestigious award. A jury had awarded her the
*  two 2023, I'm not going to say, was it Liberateur Pr√© Award for her novel, Minor Detail. That was
*  cancelled, that event. It was also claimed on semaphore that MSNBC quietly took three
*  of its Muslim broadcasters off air after Hamas's attack. So a scheduled Thursday night episode of
*  the Mehdi Hassan show on streaming platform Peacock, Mehdi is a friend of mine, I've known him for
*  years. He's an amazing, one of the best journalists I've ever come across and is absolutely incredible
*  on this issue. Also, they reversed the plan for Aima Molleddin to fill in for Joe Reed's host,
*  an Egyptian-American journalist who aggressively previously questioned Israeli leaders on strikes
*  in Gaza. I've tried to see Mehdi since being back on air, but what the hell happened there?
*  I mean, taking off three Muslim anchors. Here's another example, the Israeli-British historian
*  Avi Shlaim, who was born actually back in 1945, just before the foundation of Israel. His brilliant
*  work challenged the official Israeli historical narrative. Benjamin Netanyahu's followers, to say
*  the least, are not a fan of his work. His lecture on the formation of the state of Israel at Liverpool
*  Hope University was cancelled. Here's another example, an agent at the top creative art agency,
*  she's called Maya Dakhil, he represents the likes of Natalie Portman, Madonna and Tom Cruise, was
*  forced to resign after expressing her fears of potential genocide. And for those who think that's
*  hyperbolic, the United Nations has warned about the danger of genocide and called for the Palestinians
*  to be protected from that risk. Conversions at the United States have been banned, for example,
*  a major Palestinian campaign organisation, the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights, they had a long
*  standing planned event in Houston. Their main speaker, the congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, she's
*  the first woman of Palestinian descent elected to Congress, one of the first Muslim, first two
*  Muslim women, the other of course being Ilan Omar. It was cancelled after the Orthodox Jewish Chamber
*  of Commerce pressured Hilton Hotels into cancelling it and tried to portray it as a Hamas
*  front, absolutely outrageous. Palestine Legal in the US have said they spoke to people being fired
*  from their jobs for sharing social media posts or signing statements that support Palestinian human
*  rights. On Friday, the Pulitzer Prize winning novelist Viet Nguyen was supposed to speak
*  at a major literary venue. The talk was abruptly called off, apparently because an open letter he'd
*  signed about the violence and destruction in Palestine, as well as his past, correct, support
*  for the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel. In Ireland, an Irish woman was
*  sacked from her job after an Israeli tech firm for her pro-Palestinian sentiments. In Israel itself,
*  huge repression. The courageous ultra-orthodox journalist Israel Frey, who said, Kaddish,
*  that's the Jewish prayer for the dead, for victims both of the Hamas massacre and Palestinians
*  being killed in Gaza. A mob turned up to his house and threw fireworks at his home
*  forcing him into hiding. Activists from the Jewish Arab peace movement detained just for putting up
*  posters calling for Jewish Arab unity and peace slogans. Detentions across the country, people
*  being fired with even expressions of sympathy for Palestinian kids being described as sympathy for
*  Hamas. The academic Yuri Horesh suspended from his academic job in Israel for supporting Hamas,
*  in quotes, a lie, a total lie, no hearing, removed from the college's website, proposing the horror
*  unleashed against Gaza. I'll have a separate interview if it's not already up with Yuri Horesh
*  about his experience. You can see what's going on here, can't you? There's a deliberate and vicious
*  attempt to silence and intimidate those who oppose a war crime being committed with the support of
*  Western governments. That's what's happening. And this has to be fought back. It's obviously
*  not just an attempt to suppress freedom of speech, a basic right in a democracy,
*  and intimidate people. It is about trying to crush solidarity with Palestinian people
*  in order that the Israeli massacre in Gaza can continue with active Western support
*  because they know that if they can neutralize and intimidate their opposition then we won't
*  build a movement to pressure our governments to cease this absolute horror. That's the point of
*  this exercise. It's a political point. It's a political move. It's not simply vengeance,
*  it's not an emotional spasm. It's a clear and deliberate attempt by those who support what
*  Israel is doing to silence their opponents, to stop them being in a position to build sufficient
*  power and pressure on their own governments to cease the crimes currently being committed and
*  which have been committed for a very very long time. So we have to show courage. We have to stand
*  up for everyone who speaks out in support of the Palestinian people and who speaks out against war
*  crimes and those who support a just and peaceful settlement which will offer our Jews peace and
*  security. So be aware of what's happening. Do keep sending me examples. I'm going to keep coming up
*  with examples. We've got to fight this. Everyone on the platform has to fight this. There's a
*  responsibility to do that. But yes, all the free speech mob, all the cancel culture mob,
*  where are they now? Not so vocal. A lot of them are just cheering this on. It was never about
*  free speech. For a lot of these people what they meant by free speech was the right to say things
*  which were offensive and racist about minorities who lack a voice and suffer persecution and then
*  having a response to that. What we're talking about here are war crimes being committed and
*  people being victimized because they stand against it. That's what's happening here. There's a
*  difference. Do send me the examples in the comments box. I would love to see those comments and to
*  try and do everything I can to raise awareness. Please like and subscribe. Do support us on
