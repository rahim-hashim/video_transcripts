# Has Israel's Impunity Been Destroyed By ICJ And ICC? Prof. Heidi Matthews Gives Masterclass
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fpXXiSeo-g)
*  Now, this is arguably, I think, been the most disastrous week for Israel in terms of its
*  quote, unquote, international standing since its foundation. We've had the International
*  Criminal Court Chief Prosecutor issue requests for a response against its leadership. We've
*  had three European nations on top of those who've already done so, recognizing the state
*  of Palestine. And we now have the International Court of Justice issuing provisional orders,
*  more orders, demanding Israel ceases actions, military actions in Ra'far, as well as unimpeded
*  UN fact-finding missions, and to open the Ra'far crossing, which is obviously crucial for humanitarian
*  aid. Now, I really want to talk about the significance of what the ICJ in particular
*  means. I'm going to talk about the ICC and Lusov as well, but I'm really delighted to be joined by
*  Heidi Matthews, Assistant Professor of Law at Osgoode Hall School, Hall Law School, sorry,
*  York University, specializes in law of war and particularly looking at questions of genocide.
*  I've been following Heidi's work all the way through this horror, and you've been a lifeline
*  for so many of us. So thank you, Heidi, for your brilliant work, and it's an honor for you to talk
*  to you. Well, it's so kind, lovely to be here. Just what your first general take in the International
*  Court of Justice ruling. Yeah, so this has just been with us for a few hours. So those of us in
*  the nerdy International Court of Justice universe are kind of sitting with it, reading the majority
*  opinion, but notably some appended declarations by the judges. We could talk about that as well,
*  because it's part of the Israeli government's spin on what this order actually constitutes.
*  So I'll give the kind of simple version, which I think is very difficult to upend of what the
*  court said. But the basic reading here is that the court made the factual finding that Israel's
*  attempts or efforts, Israel itself called these extraordinary efforts, at ensuring both adequate
*  provision of humanitarian aid and assistance. So that would be food, medicine, water, fuel,
*  all of that, shelter, etc. to the population, as well as efforts to minimize civilian harm in the
*  context of RAFA. The court sided with South Africa very, very clearly saying, we don't accept
*  the contention by Israel that it's taken these extraordinary measures, or really any measures
*  that would be sufficient to satisfy its obligations under international law. And so the reason why I
*  started with the factual finding there, as opposed to starting from from what was actually ordered,
*  and then working backwards to the facts, is that the factual findings that the court made, so
*  rejecting Israel's contentions and accepting very clearly those of South Africa with respect
*  to this question, is that it helps us make sense of what the order actually is, because there is
*  some spin swirling around the order right now. So for folks who are into this kind of thing,
*  you can find this online, but the first order, and I'll just read it, and I'll let you know where
*  the punctuation is, because this has become an issue. So the first one, the most important
*  part of this order from a ceasefire perspective is as follows. Israel is ordered to, quote,
*  immediately halt its military offensive, comma, and any other action in the RAFA government,
*  comma, which may inflict on the Palestinian population, sorry, group in Gaza, conditions
*  of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part. So to my mind,
*  in light of the factual determination that I started with, this is a very clear order from
*  the court to the Israeli government that it must immediately halt any military activities within
*  RAFA. Yeah. But so on, oh, no, go on, because, because I was going to put the spin, the Israel
*  Foreign Ministry spin. You give the spin. So they come out with their joint statement with the head
*  of the National Security Council, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, rah, rah, rah,
*  South Africa is really mean, charges of genocide, false outrage is a morally repugnant war of self
*  defense. We're trying to get our hostages back. Obviously, they've killed more than hostages and
*  they've rescued by military means. Israel has not or will not conduct military actions in the RAFA
*  area, which may inflict on the Palestinian civilian population in Gaza conditions of life
*  that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or part. So they're like, OK, yeah,
*  fine, we're doing that anyway. Yeah, exactly. And that doesn't accord, though, does it, with the
*  fact, because all the way through the ruling, the court makes clear things were terrible in January,
*  that things have got a lot worse and there's a humanitarian catastrophe. So the whole point
*  of what they're saying is this is a catastrophe now in Gaza. Yeah, exactly. So and the court is
*  at pains to kind of walk us like in the 18 page majority order itself is at pains to walk through
*  the progression of the deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Gaza in general,
*  and also with respect to RAFA in particular. And so it talks about the order it made in January,
*  about how it reaffirmed the order and then modified it twice. Most recently, at the end of March,
*  it noted very clearly that its worry at the end of March that the situation was about to deteriorate
*  even more has been has come to fruition, basically. So the risk of deterioration that the court was
*  concerned about has intensified. And it's that significant change in circumstances that justifies
*  ordering these new measures. And so the idea that either Israel is permitted to carry out military
*  activities, if they don't have a genocidal impact, or as one of the judges appears to be suggesting,
*  Israel's permitted to carry out defensive but not offensive activities as though that were
*  real and operative distinction in terms of the law of war. Neither of those interpretations to my
*  make any sense with respect to the factual findings that the court has clearly made.
*  And it's clear. I mean, when we're talking, just in terms of what they're actually talking about
*  here, they're saying that could bring about the physical destruction of the Palestinian group in
*  Gaza, conditions that would bring about physical destruction in whole or in part, that's genocide.
*  That's just short, that's the definition of genocide.
*  It's part of the definition of genocide. So if you look at Article Two of the Genocide Convention,
*  there are five different ways, different kinds of acts that can constitute genocide,
*  and causing conditions of life that could bring about the physical or that are intended to bring
*  about the physical destruction in whole or in part of a group constitute a genocidal act. And that's
*  actually really I'm glad you mentioned that because it's an it's an important specification.
*  I had inferred from previous court orders, including the one in late March, that the specific
*  genocidal act that the court was concerned with, more concerned with than others, was this sub act,
*  in other words, causing conditions of life calculated to bring about physical destruction
*  in whole or in part, as opposed to, for example, killing members of the group. Obviously, that's
*  happening too. But it was it's been apparent in each of the court's orders that actually what
*  it's really concerned with is this kind of system wide, population wide, humanitarian catastrophe,
*  which now the court in this order comes out clearly and says has now devolved into something worse.
*  It says it's a disaster.
*  I mean, that, in terms of talking about it being a disaster, must surely mean,
*  because it's not spelled out in those terms, that Israel has failed to abide by the specific
*  orders issued by the court, which are orders, whatever the former president of the ICJ,
*  the kind of semantic horse she unleashed in a interview with the BBC, I believe,
*  is because these orders were in order to prevent, to protect the Palestinian people, a protected
*  group from physical destruction in whole or part as in genocide. And one of those is critical is
*  access, unimpeded access to humanitarian aid in order to satisfy the needs of life.
*  Now, they've clearly refused to do that. And obviously, the overwhelming evidence being what
*  it is, but also that's a key plank of the International Criminal Court's prosecutors
*  request for arrest warrants for Netanyahu and defence minister Yov Galan, isn't it? So that's
*  the point to get what they're saying is, because they had to issue that order in January, then
*  additional order in March, because they clearly hadn't done so. And now they're saying things are
*  disastrous. So they must be saying you are failing to satisfy the, like you are flouting our orders.
*  And these are orders to prevent genocide.
*  Yeah, absolutely. You'll see my head turning here just because I have another screen where
*  I look for like precise language. But yeah, so the court says this, and I'm quoting now from today's
*  order, the court is not convinced that the evacuation efforts and related measures that
*  Israel affirms to have undertaken to enhance the security of civilians, in particular, those
*  recently displaced from Rafa are sufficient to alleviate the immense risk. And that risk
*  is the risk of genocide, namely, but not limited to having conditions of life inflicted to bring
*  about physical destruction and holer in part. So some might now look at this and go, well,
*  yeah, what does it all really mean? I mean, in fact, it's quite interesting, actually, because
*  Judge Dyer Tladi, who's from, just to be clear, which which nation again, I can't remember now.
*  I think he's a South African judge.
*  Yes, he is. He is South African. You're right. Yeah. And you know, he says, with no words to
*  describe the horrors and guards of the words, apocalyptic, exceptionally grave, disasters and
*  gastrostrophic, you know, he's saying they don't even get justice, basically. And, yeah, I mean,
*  he took it. So he's, he talks about all of that. But he says at the end of the day, you know,
*  he said, this is just a court. I mean, and he does make that clear. He said they were basically
*  saying there are limits to. Israel can, you know, Israel just goes well, you know, they've got the
*  ICC now, they've got the ICJ, they've got various European nations, clearly, you know, they're
*  becoming increasingly isolated and but they're still, they're still carrying on. So what does
*  it all mean? Well, I'll do my best. Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, I've resisted using language
*  that says, you know, this is a big test for international law, because it seems that every
*  prominent or important case gets, gets touted as a as a test for international law. And, you know,
*  and if we don't see, you know, an immediate and sort of satisfactory resolution, then international
*  law has failed and, you know, isn't a lot, you know, isn't alive or an operative kind of factor
*  in geopolitical, you know, operations. And I think that's just, that's a little bit too simplistic.
*  That being said, this is a test in the specific sense of for Biden, but others, particularly
*  states who are members of the International Criminal Court, which we'll talk about as well.
*  And so I think from from the perspective of this judgment, you know, Biden and his administration
*  have been kind of clear that they were opposed to what they called a large scale operation in
*  Rafa. And they've resisted basically using Israeli talking points, that what is happening in Rafa
*  constitutes a large scale operation, they say it's limited and targeted, and, you know, done in a way
*  that provides maximal protection for civilians, etc. And of course, that's not true.
*  And so what we see, again, the importance of the factual finding here, in addition to the order
*  itself, is that the court has found that Israel's claim that this is not a large scale offensive,
*  with the kinds of humanitarian impacts that a large scale offensive has on the population,
*  is implausible. So I, you know, we haven't seen, I don't think yet, unless you've seen something
*  that I haven't a response from, from the US yet here. No, no, not as we speak. Yeah, it's coming,
*  I guess. So we can all look forward to, you know, Matt Miller, whoever trying to do this language
*  game too. But it'll be interesting to actually see how they choose to, how they choose to
*  do this. But you know, some kind of spin is coming. The real point, though, is that as I said,
*  the court has found that this humanitarian situation is a result, effectively, of a large
*  scale operation. And even if it weren't a large scale military operation, using some kind of,
*  you know, other, like, definition of what a military offensive means, the humanitarian impact
*  is such that it cannot continue, right, because we're at disaster level. And I think the other,
*  just quickly, the other factual finding that I haven't seen others talk about here, but I
*  think is really important is the role of the force displacement, right. So the court finds that over
*  800,000 people having been forcibly displaced from Ra'afah under the guise of evacuation orders,
*  to parts of Gaza that are not fit for human habitation, essentially, that that in and of
*  itself constitutes a humanitarian disaster. And that's before the offensive even starts,
*  right? Like, we're not even in that zone, the force displacement is enough to get to that point,
*  I think. And so what that means, just really quickly, so what that means for Biden is, okay,
*  so the court has found that we are, in fact, in a large scale offensive, there is, in fact,
*  a humanitarian disaster. You know, is Biden going to admit that that's what's happening, or will he
*  continue to spin it as not what's happening? And we might see, I think we will likely see some kind
*  of resolution at the Security Council, in terms of enforcing this order. And then, you know, the US
*  has a choice to make. Before I ask just how this fits together, ICC, the International Criminal
*  Court, what just, yeah, we did, we mentioned that briefly, because judges sometimes set out their
*  own thoughts separately, don't they? They set out there, and some of them have, I just wonder
*  your general thoughts on what that tells us, what the judges have said. Yeah, I'm not entirely sure
*  what's going on here either. So what the order of this would have been if the judges received the
*  majority opinion, so the judges who wrote separate declarations, who agreed with the majority order,
*  but are interpreting what the impact of that order means differently. In other words, interpreting
*  it not to mean an actual end to hostilities in RAFA, but just an end to like the hostilities
*  that cause the risk of genocide, right? There are a few judges who've taken that position.
*  There's a question about whether they have taken that position sort of in a quite, what would be,
*  I think, a very cynical manner, which is to say they looked at the majority opinion, they looked
*  at the way that the order was drafted, which admittedly is, could have been clearer from a
*  grammatical perspective. And they thought, okay, we can agree to this using our interpretation,
*  which is more restrictive than the one that the majority is advancing.
*  Yeah, that is unfortunate, because again, the fact that the judges have actually come out and said,
*  we only think, I don't know how you'd even describe it, we're in favour of a non-humanitarian disaster
*  offensive in circumstances where we know a humanitarian disaster is already underway.
*  But that's what they've said, essentially.
*  Actually, I kind of think it's odd that all the judges don't just issue their own declarations.
*  It just seems a bit lazy for anything. It's a bit like, oh, I've put in a vote. I'm done now.
*  I've got other cases.
*  But it gives us certainty. The problem is when you've got everybody weighing in on what they
*  understood the Oxford Comet to mean, then we're in trouble, right?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. That makes sense. So putting this together, now with the International Criminal
*  Court Chief Prosecutor issuing these arrest warrants requests, so this is a very important
*  request for arrest warrants this week. Though it has to be said, I mean, you know, by Kenneth
*  Roth, the former head of Human Rights Watch says this is someone with a very conservative approach.
*  His special advisor says the evidence is absolutely overwhelming. They're extremely confident these
*  arrest warrants will be issued. I mean, is this the week Israeli impunity really just collapsed?
*  One would have thought, and again, this is where we're in this zone of a political test for the
*  core institutions of international law in the post-World War II United Nations era, frankly,
*  because what we have seen in response to Karim Khan's going public on Monday that he has
*  requested these warrants. Not just on the part of the US and Israel, which we would have expected
*  a very strident response. The US has a complicated relationship with the ICC
*  when it prosecutions their servants purposes, such as in the Ukraine Russia case
*  with warrants against Putin. They have no problem. They're very supportive, but overall
*  have been at times extremely hostile to the court and of course, are not a state
*  member of the court. Neither is Israel. So we would have expected, I think, the kind of really
*  strident frontal assault essentially that the US and Israel have come out with. What was more
*  surprising and worrying to me watching all of this unfold this week is the way in which other
*  Western liberal democratic allies, primarily English speaking, but not only of Israel have
*  taken the same stance. Countries that are not only members of the International Criminal Court,
*  but have been historically extremely important members of the court from the perspective of
*  providing funding, personnel, negotiating the statute, populating the court, etc. So all kinds
*  of both political material and intellectual support for the project of this court over the
*  last 25 years. Those states have also come out and basically repeated the script that somebody
*  in Washington or Israel has come up with, which is to say, charging these three Hamas leaders with
*  Netanyahu and Gallant constitutes a form of false moral equivalency. So there's literally a paragraph
*  that every senator and congressperson in a bipartisan fashion, as well as officials from
*  all of these other states, Canada, the UK, Germany, have just repeated all week long. And that to me
*  raises a lot of questions about the extent to which those states, again, who are important
*  members of the court, are now acting in a way that is at minimum gives the impression of a lack of
*  cooperation, which is a legal obligation on those states who are members of the court.
*  I do wonder, I mean, how far do you think the net could end up being cast? Because obviously,
*  we've got the moment, and I wonder if you think partly this is this kind of,
*  because the international law has been so rigged in favour of the global north, this is symptomatic
*  of the global north's decline and the global south flexing itself. But Israel is still protected by,
*  it's got the super, you got the hegemon on side that helps, that's where they currently are.
*  But how, because obviously, if we look at other, like in former Yugoslavia, you didn't just put on
*  Milosevic, you didn't just hold them legal accountable. And I don't just, you know,
*  the genocide convention obviously was set up because of and in the aftermath of the Holocaust.
*  And the argument then was, I was just following orders doesn't cut it, you can't get away with
*  that. And I'm just, at the moment, it's, we've got Jov Galan and Benjamin Netanyahu in the frame.
*  But I mean, you can't just argue they're the four guys legally, could this end up, I mean,
*  what of, you know, the question at the moment of arms sales to Israel by states, which now we've
*  got the ICC and the ICJ, doesn't that put a lot of people in quite a lot of legal jeopardy in theory?
*  Yeah, so, so a bunch going on there, but I'll start backwards. So the question of arms sales,
*  yeah, so states who are engaged in significant military trade with Israel and also
*  assistance of other kinds. So, you know, the US being obviously at the top there, but also
*  Germany following next, and then the UK and then some other states that, you know, it's not a
*  massive amount of assistance, but Canada, you know, my own state nationality provides assistance as
*  well. And all of these states are bound by an international legal framework around arms,
*  the arms trade that they have enacted within their own domestic law. And so in the US,
*  you'll hear things like about the Leahy law, you know, Germany has its own regime that it detailed
*  at the ICJ, etc. There's a, you know, a legislative regime in each country that's set up to do this.
*  And the basic idea is that states are not permitted to engage to authorize arms exports
*  when there is a substantial or serious risk that the destination country will use those arms to
*  commit serious violations of international law, war crimes, crimes against humanity,
*  genocide, you know, etc. So, you know, way back now in January of this year, with the first order
*  from the International Court of Justice, which did find that there was at minimum a substantial
*  risk that genocide would occur in Gaza. At that point, all of these states were on legal notice
*  that they were selling arms in a situation where there was a substantial risk at minimum,
*  if not an already ongoing genocide, right? So, so the duty to seriously look at one's domestic arms
*  trade regime and ask those questions about compliance was, I mean, let's just say heightened
*  domestically by that court. But also there's an international level obligation. So an obligation
*  that's separate from whatever domestic export regime a state has. There's also, of course,
*  an international obligation to prevent or punish genocide. And clearly part of the obligation to
*  prevent includes not engaging in military trade or assistance where there is a serious risk of
*  violation. So that's been in play for quite some time now. You know, I'm sure your audience knows
*  about litigation efforts in various countries to try and get a handle on that.
*  We interviewed a solicitor leading some of that particular attempt in Britain.
*  Oh, great. Yeah, yeah. So your audience will know about it. Yeah. So that's been going on for some
*  time. Whether the ICC move, so the prosecutors move at this point, it doesn't like create a new
*  obligation. I think it just it builds or strengthens the evidentiary foundation for states when
*  they're reviewing the compliance with their domestic laws. So if the you know, assuming
*  that these arrest warrants are issued, what that means concretely is that judges at the
*  International Criminal Court have decided that there are reasonable grounds to believe that these
*  accused persons have committed these crimes. And those crimes, you know, the ICJ has given us
*  certain determinations around genocide. The crimes that the ICC have charged don't include
*  genocide critically, we could talk about that too, but extend to war crimes and crimes against
*  humanity. So now we've got like the whole terrain of international criminality, we could say is
*  covered essentially. Yeah. But with the in the case of the chief prosecutors arrest warrant requests,
*  there could be other charges. And also there could be secret of what they're called. Secret
*  arrest warrants, they're not called that. What are they called? What's the legal term for that?
*  Sealed. They can be sealed. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So there are a bunch of different options.
*  Arrest warrants. Look, it's open to the prosecutor once a warrant has been issued
*  to seek to amend the charges, right? To add additional warrants to add additional individuals.
*  Yeah. Because torture is not there. And people look at this and think, come on,
*  torture. Come on. Now there's so much evidence about torture.
*  So you have torture. Torture is there for Hamas, I believe. Yeah. Which is reasonable, but there's no
*  yeah, there's no non at all for that massive widespread evidence about torture. I mean, CNN,
*  et al. You know, CNN and media organizations like that have reported overwhelming evidence. So anyway,
*  who knows? Yeah, no, totally. And I think like, just just quickly, like, there's, you know,
*  the prosecutor has, there's a litany of crimes that could be charged against Israel in these
*  circumstances, and choices have to be made, right? And so the prosecutor is going to be making
*  certain decisions that have to align with expressed priorities of his office, with,
*  you know, investigative constraints, resource constraints, all that kind of thing, and also
*  with the overarching theory of the case. And the theory of this case is that Netanyahu and Galant
*  are involved in a common plan. I'm just going to use the language here from from the prosecutor,
*  a common plan to use starvation as a method of war and other acts of violence against the
*  Gazan civilian population, as a means to eliminate Hamas, secure the return of hostages,
*  but also to collectively punish the civilian population in Gaza. And so,
*  Oh, but crucially, as well, they say who they see as a threat to Israel, I look at that,
*  I think, yeah, how could that not be genocidal by definition? Yeah, if you think the if you think
*  the civilian population poses essentially an existential threat to your nation, that is
*  genocide. That's the basis of genocide. Yeah, like, well, I mean, it's one it's one way in which we
*  get to genocide quite quickly, right? There's a number a number of reasons for which you can
*  commit genocide. But I think what you're saying is, is it makes clear one of the contextual elements
*  that is needed for crimes against humanity. And that is a intentional attack that is widespread
*  or systematic directed against the civilian population itself. And so that's partly how the
*  prosecutor gets there. What that's the other thing I wanted to talk to you about. And that is about
*  genocide, as people understand genocide, because it strikes me that one of the ways
*  I suppose it both both by Israel itself, or Israel, officially, official Israeli spokespeople,
*  ministers, all the rest of it, and their cheerleaders, is they've manipulated people's
*  lack of understanding of genocide, including how common genocide is throughout history.
*  So as a consequence, the Holocaust basically becomes the main reference point for people,
*  it because it feels, I mean, obviously, I mean, the Holocaust was the show was an
*  particularly heinous genocide. But I suppose in that sense, it what we're talking about is
*  the Holocaust is an outlier, it strikes me because it was an industrialized attempt to
*  exterminate an entire people, which succeeded in killing two thirds of all European Jews in very
*  short space of time. And it was against an entirely defenceless civilian population.
*  So for example, when I was argued with Piers Morgan, probably for a punishment for something
*  I did in the past life, last November, and I pointed out to him, he'd said that Wush's
*  attack on Ukraine was genocide. I would question that myself, and these are brutal evasion.
*  Anyway, whatever. Who knows? But anyway, but he said, because that was because the difference is,
*  and what Israel did was self-defense. But that's not what, how genocide starts is neither here nor
*  there. It's either genocide or it isn't. But what he's twist, what that it taps into is people
*  don't understand how common genocide is and how it often emerges during an armed conflict,
*  where you have an armed group, supposedly representing or part of an ethnic group,
*  which then the civilians get exterminated in Rwanda, as one example, or in Bosnia.
*  Yeah, no, totally. Yeah, so this has been referred to as the with, and I'll talk a little bit about
*  the Canadian context for a particular reason. But this has been referred to in recent developments
*  here as the Holocaust prototype, right? And so, which is a fundamental misunderstanding
*  of the nature of genocide, as it was conceptualized by Raphael Lemkin, who, of course, came up with
*  this in the 40s, and then how it got institutionalized, which actually looks a bit different,
*  quite a bit different in the genocide convention itself. And then how that-
*  He's a Jewish, Polish lawyer.
*  Yeah, totally. Yeah. No, no, no, no, no, that's super helpful. Thanks.
*  So he had a, in some sense, is a broader understanding of actually what constituted
*  genocide anyway, that works itself out in terms of the treaty. And then that works itself out in
*  terms of inclusion in the Rome Statute, other tribunals in the 90s, and then a series of
*  judicial developments that kind of make meaning of the actual text of the convention itself.
*  And so, a few things that people, if you look at the text of the genocide convention itself,
*  and I've alluded to this before, but we don't actually need killing, right? Like, theoretically,
*  you could have, it's difficult, obviously, factually, and would be very rare. But if you're
*  just looking at interpreting the statute itself, you don't actually need killing of individuals,
*  in order to bring about the destruction of a group. There is a debate about what the meaning
*  of physical destruction means, and if it can encompass the capacity of a group to actually
*  survive in time as a group, notwithstanding the fact that there may not have been a massive
*  amount of death. So all of that to say that there's this internal debate within the law of genocide
*  around that. But certainly, the Holocaust as a prototype is just a, it's a misleading,
*  it sort of undergirds a bunch of misleading ideas about what the law of genocide means,
*  but also about, as you say, what it means historically. So, you know, this idea, which
*  Israel continues to put forward, that military operations conducted
*  in self-defense, and we can have a debate about whether self-defense applies here,
*  that's for another day, right? But let's assume that Israel's acting in self-defense.
*  This Gaza is technically occupied under international law.
*  Yeah, correct. Yeah. Yeah. And so it's not that, and I want to be clear there, it's not that Israel
*  wouldn't have the right to defend its citizens in some fashion, but it's a question of whether it
*  can resort to the use of actual war to do that, right? Armed conflict. There are other ways you
*  can do that, policing operations, counter-terrorist operations, counter-insurgency operations, you
*  know, etc. You don't have to do all-out war. So anyway, let's assume all-out, you know,
*  some military response to the level of armed conflict was actually required. Okay, fine.
*  Once that the conduct of that operation starts having genocidal impacts on the civilian population,
*  then the story has changed. So, and this is something that South Africa has been
*  hammering home at the ICJ for months, is that you can't, nothing, not even self-defense,
*  justifies genocidal actions. And so the two are not mutually exclusive by any stretch of the
*  imagination. Because just on that, I mean, again, all of these are very different. I mean,
*  it's the point, you know, genocides, the way they, you know, that historical context, how they
*  unfold, all they different. But I just think it's striking Rwanda, you had, you know, the genocide
*  against the Tutsis by the Hutu extremists. And obviously, you know, you could start the clock
*  in theory and go, well, in 1990, the Rwandan Patriotic Front, who represented the interests,
*  suppose, of the Tutsi minority, invaded Rwanda from Uganda, committed, I would note, a lot of
*  atrocities, killed a lot of innocent people. They were also accused of, for example, rape.
*  And then Hutu extremists declared this was an attempted genocide, that they were going to commit
*  genocide against the Hutus. And then up to and during the genocide, the Rwandan Patriotic Front
*  killed huge numbers of people. No one looks at that and go, well, that's self-defense then.
*  You would never, you would never, obviously, that, you know, and I guess, obviously, you know,
*  because there you had people being machete to death. It was a different, in this case, it's bombs
*  and starvation. But I mean, that's the point, isn't it? People don't often understand how
*  genocides often play out, where it is a case of atrocities can be committed against the group,
*  which represent all the civilians of a group, which then commits genocide. I mean, because
*  Hutus were killed and they were, their rights were violated. That doesn't, yeah, people don't,
*  and it's the same in Bosnia, Bosnian Serb civilians, thousands of Bosnian Serb civilians were killed.
*  Yeah. That doesn't, yeah. And we often talk to you about like the Rwanda case, as though it was
*  limited to those three months of horrific kind of, you know, expedited murder. Whereas, you know,
*  that armed conflict continues across, you know, a variety of borders.
*  Democrat, Republican, Congo, yeah. So the other point there is incitement really comes in,
*  doesn't it? I mean, because the other point I would just, all the point I want to make is
*  Israel has been told you have to take criminal action. You have to take action against those who
*  incite genocide. And they just carried on inciting genocide across, because this is the point,
*  sometimes you'll see a figure on national television. And the point is, Israel has a
*  responsibility under the Genocide Convention, which it put into its own law, it's statute
*  book in 1950, to prosecute those people. And it hasn't done so. It hasn't prosecuted any of these
*  ministers or politicians or media outlets. Yeah, absolutely. And so a couple, this will come up,
*  not only with respect to South Africa's genocide case, but also to the ICC arrest warrants.
*  Part of what we're going to see in terms of Israeli objections to both the jurisdiction of the ICC,
*  and also the admissibility of this particular case, is this argument around something called
*  complementarity. That's a principle that undergirds the ICC institutional system. It just means,
*  essentially, that the ICC needs to be a court of last resort, primary jurisdiction for
*  prosecuting genocide, but also war crimes and crimes against humanity lies with the domestic
*  system. And we've seen Israel making its case already at the ICJ in this respect, saying, look,
*  we know the difference between hate crime and incitement. We have an excellent Supreme Court,
*  fabulous jurisprudence, Judge Barak, we're able to take care of this ourselves. We see Matt Miller,
*  like the other day, saying the same thing, the US position is that Israel's legal system is very
*  sophisticated. Israel has jurisdiction here, international jurisdiction isn't warranted.
*  But the thing about complementarity is that it only comes into play as a means through which
*  the admissibility of a case at the ICC can be rejected if that state is pursuing
*  charges against the same individuals that have been named and for the same conduct.
*  In general, we don't see prosecutions either for incitement or other violations of IHL
*  in Israel right now. But we certainly don't see cases against Netanyahu and Galat himself.
*  And so that's the quick...
*  Jason Vale Israel would have to prosecute Benjamin Netanyahu
*  and Joe Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity for that to work as a defence.
*  Yeah.
*  Brilliant. Heidi, I think we've gone through so much there. It's been a real tour de force.
*  You can see why I've been looking to Heidi's wisdom and knowledge all the way through this.
*  We went to a lot of great granular detail. So do like, press subscribe and leave your comments.
*  But Heidi, that was great. Thank you so, so much.
*  Great. Thanks so much for having me, Owen.
