# Dozens Of Palestinians Massacred To Rescue Four Israeli Hostages
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [June 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBQed9zgtdc)
*  The last eight months have brimmed full of unspeakable and indescribable horror. I say
*  that literally as a writer, the words simply are not there to describe atrocities of this magnitude.
*  Even for those of us who have no illusions in the West's political and media elites,
*  it is this that has shocked us to our very core. I mean this of course as well as the
*  daily live streaming of horror, the mass slaughter of tens of thousands of Palestinians, the maiming
*  so many dead, killed, slaughtered children, the suffering, the grief of so many of their loved
*  ones being so savagely butchered. I'm not talking about the life of a Palestinian not being treated
*  as having equal worth to that of an Israeli or a Westerner. We're not even close to an
*  approximation of this. It is the lack of pretense that Palestinian life has any real meaning at all.
*  The first video I made about this horror on the 9th of October had a very simple title.
*  Palestinian Lives Matter. That's because it was clear from the beginning that the decades-long
*  dehumanisation of the Palestinian people was now going to have its most hideous expression.
*  Let me just give you a hypothetical scenario. Four Palestinians have been arbitrarily held by the
*  Israeli military. Palestinian fighters stage an armed intervention and free them. In the process,
*  they slaughter over 200 Israelis, many of them children. Huge numbers of Israeli civilians are
*  maimed. Footage shows Israeli mothers screaming over the bodies of their slaughtered Israeli
*  children. How would this be reported by the Western media? As a daring operation to release
*  unjustly held Palestinians? No, let's be clear. It would be treated as a massacre,
*  rightly, as a despicable atrocity, as indicative of the utter depravity of Hamas.
*  So, what then of Israel's operation to free four Israeli hostages who were seized
*  on the 7th of October? Let's be clear, as I've always been clear from the very start.
*  Taking civilians hostage is a very serious war crime. No cause on earth justifies kidnapping
*  or killing innocent people. Anyone with a sense of humanity should want these hostages
*  to be returned to their loved ones. One of those freed was Noah Argemani, and the footage of her
*  being seized, driven away on the 7th of October from her boyfriend, taken on a motorcycle,
*  begging for her life, that haunted me for weeks afterwards. I'm sure it did for so many others.
*  Now, the sense of relief felt by the loved ones of these four Israelis will simply be indescribable,
*  not least her mother, who is dying of terminal cancer. Here are the facts. Israel has killed
*  far more of its hostages than it has secured the release of by military means. That includes,
*  of course, the three Israeli hostages who were killed by Israeli troops despite waving white flags
*  and screaming in Hebrew, underlining that if they were going to be shot and killed by Israeli troops,
*  then what hope for Palestinian civilians? But there's also overwhelming evidence that many
*  other Israeli hostages have been killed by Israeli missiles, which is unsurprising given
*  bombs with the combined explosive power of several Hiroshima bombs have been detonated in a strip of
*  land no bigger than East London. Now, the only mass release of hostages has taken place through
*  a ceasefire and an exchange of prisoners. In the meantime, Israel has laid waste to Gaza,
*  slaughtering tens of thousands of civilians, including at least 15,000 kids, imposing famine
*  amongst so many other horrors. In this operation today, the Israeli army massacred huge numbers of
*  innocent civilians in Nusarit camp, including children. Now, the footage I've seen is horrific
*  beyond words. Palestinian parents wailing over the bloodied corpses of their kids, the mangled bodies
*  of civilians covered in blankets, indescribable injuries. Now, here's how the operation reportedly
*  took place. According to Al Jazeera, Israeli troops used a humanitarian aid truck and a civilian car
*  to sneak into central Gaza. This in of itself is the war crime of Pafidi. That is a deception
*  where you promise to act in good faith with the intention of breaking that promise once the enemy
*  has become vulnerable as a consequence. It will put all aid workers at risk because now all
*  humanitarian aid trucks will be under suspicion of containing Israeli soldiers, which will at any
*  moment massacre huge numbers of Palestinians. Now, we constantly hear accusations that Hamas use,
*  whether it be hospitals, indeed aid trucks for military purposes. That's routinely presented as
*  evidence for their depravity and to justify destroying civilian infrastructure. So what now
*  are we supposed to say about the Israeli state behaving like this? This in itself will undoubtedly
*  further slow what little aid is getting into Gaza and that itself will kill many more Palestinians.
*  Let's listen to this testimony from a Palestinian man who survived what we should be describing as
*  a massacre.
*  What does this all mean in practice? It will mean far more death and destruction. There are
*  reports that other hostages were killed in this operation, but those reports of course need to be
*  confirmed. It will almost certainly mean far more hostages are killed given Israel keeps recovering
*  the corpses of hostages and the longer this is dragged out, the more likely they are to be killed
*  and the only proven means to release significant numbers of hostages is through ceasefire and
*  prisoner exchanges. Netanyahu will ride the wave of jubilation in Israeli society. Those demanding
*  a ceasefire will now be marginalised. The Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz was expected to
*  resign over a lack of strategy for Israel's military rampage. He's now cancelled his speech.
*  The most popular demand will now be to release all the hostages by military means. The hostage
*  deal negotiations with Hamas will surely be trashed by this. Those demanding more blood and slaughter
*  in Israeli society now have the wins in their sails. The consequences will be huge numbers of
*  Palestinians slaughtered, butchered by weapons or starved to death. We've seen the immediate
*  price paid by Palestinians, but the price to come will be incalculable. Yet many media headlines
*  have simply erased the horror suffered by Palestinians. So for example, in this Washington
*  Post headline, it was, for Israel, a rare day of joy amid bloodshed as four hostages rescued alive.
*  There isn't even a pretense here that Palestinian life has any worth at all. None at all. Is it
*  understood that the rest of the world hears this? How do you think we look to the rest of the world?
*  And I will tell you, depraved. David Lammy, the shadow Labour Foreign Secretary who's set to become
*  the Foreign Secretary of the British government when Labour wins an inevitable landslide in a
*  month's time, tweeted, It's now 245 days since October 7th when these hostages were kidnapped from
*  the Nova Music Festival by Hamas terrorists. Their rescue is a glimmer of hope in the darkness.
*  Not one single mention of the horrors inflicted against the Palestinian people. I've met David
*  Lammy many times and I know that if you asked him, do you think Palestinian and Israeli civilians
*  have equal and innate worth, he would undoubtedly answer, yes, of course I do. But how is it possible
*  for him to justify such a statement based on that tweet alone? How would he justify it?
*  Those politicians and commentators celebrating this operation should be asked, do you think that over
*  200 Palestinians, many of them children, being slaughtered is an acceptable price to pay for
*  four Israeli hostages? Get them to say it on record. They should also be asked, do you think
*  the war crime of Pufferdy, in this case, pretending to be a humanitarian atroc is acceptable?
*  Get them to say that on record too. I want to say this as well. As I've said, the taking of
*  hostages was a grave war crime. It is good to see that after hospital tests it's been confirmed
*  the Israeli hostages released are in good health. That doesn't detract from the horror of them being
*  taken and kept away from their loved ones for so long that we will undoubtedly hear their testimies
*  in good time. Let us not forget the thousands of Palestinians seized by the Israeli state, often
*  without any charge and detained under horrific conditions. These are the Palestinian hostages
*  held by the Israeli state. Now we've heard allegations of sexual violence presented as
*  central evidence of the unique barbarity of Hamas. What then to make of these details in a New York
*  Times article, which you can only find by reading to the very end. Now these details are horrific.
*  I must warn you of that in advance. Eunice Alhamlawi is a senior nurse from Al-Shifa Hospital who was
*  arrested in November. Let me read. Mr Alhamlawi, the senior nurse said a female officer had ordered
*  two soldiers to lift him up and press his rectum against the metal stick that was fixed to the
*  ground. Mr Alhamlawi said the stick penetrated his rectum for roughly five seconds causing it to bleed
*  and leaving him with unbearable pain. A leaked draft of the UNRWA report detailed an interview
*  that gave a similar account. It cited a 41-year-old detainee who said that the interrogators made me sit
*  on something like a hot metal stick and it felt like fire and also said that after another detainee
*  died after they put the electric stick up his anus. That's rape. If we heard such a report from an
*  Israeli captive at the hands of Hamas it would be front page news and lead news bulletins as key
*  evidence of Hamas' depravity. But in this case, buried in a New York Times article. Again, the lack
*  of pretense that Palestinian life matters at all. It is the most disgusting spectacle of my life.
*  The consequences of that will be felt not just in this hideous present but for many,
*  many generations to come. Please like and subscribe, do leave your comments,
