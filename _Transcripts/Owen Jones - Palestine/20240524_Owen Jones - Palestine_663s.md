# ICJ Delivers Hammer Blow To Israel
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2PmQAUSBvU)
*  The International Court of Justice, the world's highest court, has ordered Israel to immediately
*  halt its military operations in Raffa, the last part of Gaza which has not been reduced to near
*  total destruction, where most of Gaza's pre-war population was forced to flee by the Israeli
*  state as it laid waste to their homes, their schools, their hospitals, their universities,
*  their mosques, their churches, their roads, their ancient monuments. The order is against
*  its military offensive as well as any other action of the Raffa Governorate which may inflict on the
*  Palestinian group in Gaza conditions that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or
*  in part. In succinct terms, that is genocide. They voted 13 to 2 with one of their judges voting
*  against because they have a blanket opposition to any involvement by international law in
*  conflicts they define as political disputes, the other being Israel's own judge. Now let's listen
*  to the president of the court as he issued this provisional order, brought as a result of course
*  of South Africa's general case against Israel for the crime of genocide.
*  Court considers that in conformity with obligations under the Genocide Convention,
*  Israel must immediately halt its military offensive and any other action in the Raffa
*  Governorate which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring
*  about its physical destruction in whole or in part. The ICJ judgment notes that the situation
*  has deteriorated since its first provisional orders back at the end of January and that the
*  humanitarian situation in Gaza is now disastrous. As stated in its order of January 26, 2024,
*  was a serious risk of deteriorating, has deteriorated and has done so even further
*  since the court adopted its order of March 28, 2024.
*  In this regard, the court observes that the concern that it expressed in its decision
*  communicated to the departals on February 16, 2024 with respect to the developments in Raffa
*  have materialized and that the humanitarian situation is now to be characterized as
*  disastrous. The ICJ also ordered Israel to allow a UN fact-finding mission in Gaza. Note how Israel
*  has prevented international journalists and independent agencies analysts from entering
*  and ordered Israel to open the Raffa crossing which is the main means which humanitarian aid,
*  not leased food, can enter Gaza. Israel has done everything it can to stop that aid getting in and
*  reaching the people who need it and closing the Raffa crossing has simply accelerated this
*  humanitarian catastrophe. Let's have a listen. The court wishes to emphasize that the measure
*  indicated in paragraph 51 to A of its order of March 28, 2024 requiring I quote, the unhindered
*  provision at scale by all concerned of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance
*  and of course necessary states that the respondent maintain open land crossing points
*  and in particular the Raffa cross. It's worth noting the written contribution of Judge Dyer
*  Clady. He says there are no more words to describe the horrors in Gaza. The words
*  apocalyptic, exceptionally grave, disastrous and catastrophic have all been used to describe the
*  current situation and all seem to pale in comparison to what was unfolding before our very eyes.
*  Almost daily we are confronted with gut-wrenching accounts of victims and survivors and images of
*  unimaginable suffering. That this is happening in an age in which international law has been said
*  to have matured into a much more socially conscious legal order is simply incongruous.
*  They add that the court has today in explicit terms ordered the state of Israel to halt
*  its offensive in Raffa. Now what does this all mean in practice? Well Israel's tried to
*  twist the meaning of the order based on linguistic ambiguity with far-read annunciations of South
*  Africa in their statement and claiming Israel has not and will not conduct military actions in the
*  Raffa area which may inflict on the Palestinian civilian population Gaza conditions of life that
*  could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part. Yes well in other words
*  what they're doing is disregarding the facts of the total horror unleashed against Gaza's people
*  as described in the ICJ's own statement in support of the order in favour of course in
*  this case by Israel of this distortion. Now we all know what Israel's response in general will be.
*  Indeed within minutes of the order Israel was pummeling houses in central Raffa with missiles
*  which is an answer in itself. Israel has wantonly flouted the previous ICJ orders not least on
*  facilitating access to humanitarian aid. This of course being a key plank of the
*  ICC chief prosecutor's request for arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*  and his defence minister Yoav Galan for war crimes and crimes against humanity.
*  Now the ICJ order comes on top of those ICC arrest warrant requests as well as more European nations
*  recognising the state of Palestine. Never in all the decades since Israel was founded in 1948 has
*  the state faced such a weak of bitter international rejection. Well Israel's leaders and cheerleaders
*  should know that far worse is to come. This is the behaviour of a rogue state, I don't even see how
*  anyone can credibly rebut that. They predictably Israel responded to all that with smears, lies,
*  deflections as they have done in response of course to this ruling now. A recurring theme is
*  abusing the grave evil of anti-Semitism, the very real and always profoundly dangerous hatred of
*  Jewish people. Now the ICC was condemned as anti-Semitic by the likes of Benjamin Netanyahu
*  and now the ICJ has been condemned as anti-Semitic. Listen to this.
*  This is vile as an attempt to evade accountability for monstrous crimes of course but it is also
*  hideously irresponsible because it stops people believing in anti-Semitism being real, which it is
*  and that's dangerous. As much as Israel screeches all of this does actually have consequences. Let's
*  just listen to this analyst on Al Jazeera.
*  I'm going to go back to the ICC and I'm going to go back to the ICC and I'm going to go back to the ICC and I'm going to go back to the ICC and I'm going to go back to the ICC and I'm going to go back to the ICC and I'm going to go back to the ICC and I'm going to go back to the ICC and I'm going to go back to the ICC and I'm going to go back to the ICC and I'm going to go back to the ICC and I'm going to go back to the ICC and I'm going to go back to the ICC and I'm going to go back to the ICC and I'm going to go back to the ICC and I'm going to go back to the ICC and I'm going to go back to the ICC and I'm going to go back to the ICC and I'm going to go back to the ICC and I'm going to go back to the ICC and I

*  going back to the it it.
*  Let's we travel the two countries like that let's move.
*  OK.
*  And at this time because it's boldly venlit pike which cookies of facts education widely
*  under a guise of resist and you know being that tęsrop the U. S. deal with that is going to be honest about by tomorrow and we look forward to some of the things that fought, what became out of law during that particular time it was something early
*  that Онгся the most.
*  What's going to happen.
*  in that instance, can they really find themselves now, two years later,
*  objecting to the court and trying to undermine it?
*  It's going to put the White House in a very difficult position as well.
*  Well, here's the problem. The international order has clearly long been rigged in favour of the global North,
*  despite pretenses, but clearly there are some checks and balances to prevent a total dissent
*  into complete bloody anarchy.
*  Well, Israel's cheerleaders are doing a setting fire to all of that,
*  all in the name of protecting Israel from accountability for its monstrous crimes.
*  In this context, the global South is flexing its muscles, as we've seen South Africa do,
*  effectively, so effectively throughout this whole process.
*  Now, given President Joe Biden was forced to speak out against a RAFA offensive,
*  he said that this would be the red line and then the US would withdraw weapons.
*  Thanks to political pressure, I should say, brought by the movement against Israel's genocide,
*  this all puts him in an extremely difficult position.
*  How can he take on the ICJ over something he himself was forced to warn about?
*  We should be clear. The ICJ order is legally binding.
*  Israel should, as I've said, be treated for what it is.
*  It's a rogue state.
*  Arms transfers to Israel should surely be ruled illegal in such circumstances.
*  There needs to be sanctions against Israel.
*  Now, if this wasn't a state ally to the West, all of that would just be treated as a statement of the obvious.
*  If you take together the ICJ's rulings and the ICC Chief Prosecutors' request for arrest warrants,
*  the overall picture is gruesomely clear.
*  This is one of the great crimes of our age.
*  That was obvious from the very start.
*  And everybody who backed this and legitimised it will be damned from history.
*  You were warned from the start and you refused to listen.
*  Israeli leaders made it clear from the very beginning what they were going to do.
*  They left no room whatsoever for interpretation of their statements, no ambiguity,
*  as they promised to unleash some of the worst crimes of our age
*  and then spent around eight months every single day committing virtually every crime under the sun.
*  We cannot let them get away with this.
*  We have to hold them to account.
*  Not just Israel's own leaders, but Western politicians and media outlets and commentators,
*  not just for justice, but to stop these horrors repeating themselves over and over again.
