# ‘Starmer Must RESIGN’ - Labour Leaders
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [November 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE)
*  Keir Starmer's made a choice. He's made a decision. There is, at this very moment, a humanitarian [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=0.0s)]
*  calamity of biblical proportions unfolding in Gaza. Around one in every 240 Ghazans have been killed [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=5.04s)]
*  in the space of one month, including those missing, presumably dead. That's closer to one [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=12.72s)]
*  in every 200 Ghazans dead, killed in the space of a month. And this is only the beginning. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=19.52s)]
*  The Israeli state is bombing schools, hospitals, ambulances. I watched the aftermath a bit earlier [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=26.88s)]
*  of the bombing of one of those convoys, a convoy of ambulances. And what I saw, the bloodied, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=36.64s)]
*  mangled corpses, those who had survived but suffered grievous injuries, many of them, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  or some of them, I presume, will not survive. The blood, so much blood, the anguish, screams and cries. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=50.96s)]
*  That will stay with me for the rest of my life, personally. Now, the IDF admitted to bombing [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=60.48s)]
*  this convoy of ambulances in case it was disputed. They claimed Hamas was using them. Now, I'm giving [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=67.12s)]
*  this as context. It's important context. Always have to have this context of what's happening [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=72.56s)]
*  in Gaza every time we do these videos. Let's just listen to a CNN report about this convoy of ambulances. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=77.67999999999999s)]
*  These ambulances were part of a convoy that was heading south towards the Raffa Crossing. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=84.64s)]
*  The Red Cross had been informed that the convoy was leaving the hospital towards the Raffa Crossing, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=88.24s)]
*  and perhaps most damningly we've just been hearing Jessica from the Red Cross who confirmed [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=94.16s)]
*  that they had been given information about this particular convoy that was due to leave [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=100.0s)]
*  the Shifa Hospital on its way to the Raffa Crossing. What we know about the attack is that there are [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=104.88s)]
*  several casualties, many wounded as well, and that this does appear now to have been a convoy [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  of wounded Palestinians being taken to the Raffa Crossing that was hit as part of that IDF strike, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=120.0s)]
*  now claimed by the IDF again with the idea that this was part of their operation to take on Hamas. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=126.32s)]
*  The evidence that we're getting from those sources not just inside the Al-Shifa Hospital, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=134.64s)]
*  but again from the Red Cross does seem to contradict that. So the evidence from the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=139.51999999999998s)]
*  medics and the Red Cross contradicts Israeli claims, and I don't know about you, but I think [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=143.44s)]
*  I'll stick with the Red Cross and the medics. Now even if there was a Hamas operative it would never [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=147.27999999999997s)]
*  justify bombing a convoy of ambulances. You see the Israeli state is so emboldened, so emboldened [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  by the support they're being provided by western states as they commit a massacre, a massacre which [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=159.68s)]
*  is currently taking place of biblical proportions as I've said, that they're just going and declaring [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=166.48s)]
*  we're committing war crimes everyone, just so you know, we're committing war crimes. It isn't subtle [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=172.48s)]
*  to say the least. Now Starman knows that approaching 4 000 Palestinian children in Gaza have now been [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=177.92s)]
*  slaughtered. That's more than the total number of all people of all ages who were killed in the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=182.96s)]
*  Northern Ireland Troubles over the course of three decades. Now he knows there's a humanitarian [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=187.44s)]
*  catastrophe caused by the lack of clean water and food and fuel and electricity and health service, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=193.28s)]
*  the health services in collapse. He is a lawyer and he does know that collective punishment of [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=198.0s)]
*  civilians and the indiscriminate slaughter of civilians are grave war crimes. He knows too that [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=201.76s)]
*  Israeli politicians and officials, he knows what they're saying, that subtlety is not their forte. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=207.12s)]
*  He knows about the genocide or biblical references from Netanyahu calling for the killing of all men, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=213.28s)]
*  women and children or the various calls for Gaza to be reduced to a city of tents [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=217.84s)]
*  or as the defence minister put it, we will eliminate everything. We could go on and what Starmer [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=223.52s)]
*  has done is support an Israeli onslaught which underpins these crimes against humanity. Now he [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=227.68s)]
*  knows that his position means there's no pressure on our conservative government and they can [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=233.12s)]
*  continue to give carte blanche to Israel to behave just how it likes. That has now led to two Labour [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=236.96s)]
*  council leaders to demand Keir Starmer resign. Two council leaders, that does not normally happen [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=241.52s)]
*  when you have an opposition leader this close to an election. To put it mildly, let's just listen. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=248.96s)]
*  In a letter the Burnley council leader wrote, I joined the Labour party because of the values [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  of standing up and speaking out against injustices across the world. Sadly Keir Starmer has not stood [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  up for Labour values hence why we are calling upon him to stand down and the leader of Pendle [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=267.03999999999996s)]
*  council added unfortunately he has failed to listen and we ask that he considers his position [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=273.44s)]
*  and resign to allow someone to lead our party who has compassion and speaks out against injustice [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=279.91999999999996s)]
*  and indiscriminate killings of human beings. Now Keir Starmer's not going to resign, fine that's [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=286.56s)]
*  obvious. Thanks to a conservative implosion, Labour has a whopping polling lead. None of that [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=292.4s)]
*  has anything to do with Keir Starmer whose personal ratings plummeted by 12 points in the space of a [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=298.08s)]
*  week according to Delta poll which I think we can largely attribute to him backing a campaign [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=302.64s)]
*  unleashed by Israel which is slaughtering huge numbers of children and innocent civilians which [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=309.91999999999996s)]
*  doesn't generally go well down well actually with huge numbers of people in this country who would [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=314.0s)]
*  have thought it. The reason for the Tory implosion is Partygate, an unprecedented cost of living [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=318.4s)]
*  crisis, corruption, scandals, conservative civil war, the Liz Truss experiment that enough was [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=322.88s)]
*  sufficient to finish off a normal government, the NHS collapsing, public services and infrastructure [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=328.0s)]
*  falling apart, Rishi Sunak being an embarrassing shambolic waste of space but he is achieving [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=332.08s)]
*  Keir Starmer what Tony Blair took years to accomplish when he was prime minister [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=336.32s)]
*  not leader of the opposition which was to become a hate figure amongst sections of his own electoral [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=341.12s)]
*  coalition. That's what's happening to Keir Starmer. He's exposed the fact clearly he doesn't care [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=345.52s)]
*  about human rights anyone who now claims that is off their trolley. He doesn't care about human life, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=350.08s)]
*  he doesn't care about international law and that therefore he will do in power what Blair did which [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=355.84s)]
*  is be at the beck and call of the United States in whatever horrors they decide to back or unleash [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=360.0s)]
*  that's what gave us the calamities of Iraq and Afghanistan. Now as Shabab Khan at ITV says multiple [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=364.32s)]
*  Labour MPs I've spoken to are expressing frustration that they're essentially being told that party [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=370.4s)]
*  policy in Gaza will simply follow the White House. One usually supporter of a Starmer tells me it's [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=375.44s)]
*  a lack of leadership and will ultimately hurt us. Firstly you're spineless you should come out and [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=380.8s)]
*  actually do something resign and obviously your careers are more important than the small matter [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=385.2s)]
*  the mass slaughter of innocent children but this is what he is like and what he will be like in [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=389.84s)]
*  government which is why anyone who thinks we're going to have a transformative government is I [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=394.4s)]
*  think delusional. I think we're going to end up with something a bit like Theresa May a politician [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=399.2s)]
*  who has no clear political principle and will just be at the mercy of events. It goes on to say it's [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=404.24s)]
*  an interesting divide at the moment many Labour MPs publicly calling for a ceasefire around a third [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=412.0s)]
*  while many are doing so privately but there's still plenty within the party who believe Starmer's [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=417.04s)]
*  position demonstrates he can be an international leader while they're off their trolley. He also [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=420.72s)]
*  says blimey a Labour MP reached out to say there's no point Starmer trying to convince people that [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=424.96000000000004s)]
*  humanitarian pauses the answer when he will literally be arguing for a new position as soon [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=428.64s)]
*  Biden and Starmer Sunak announced one. Well indeed. Now Starmer refused to condemn war crimes on the [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=432.56s)]
*  basis politicians shouldn't be doing running commentaries. Well let's just expose that as a [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=437.92s)]
*  nonsense based on his own previous statements. As to whether each and every act is in accordance [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=441.84s)]
*  with the law well that will have to be adjudicated in due course. I think it's unwise for politicians [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=446.4s)]
*  to stand on stages like this or to sit in television studios and pronounce day by day which acts may or [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=453.84s)]
*  may not be in accordance with international law. I think it's not the role of politicians. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=461.68s)]
*  Is Vladimir Putin a war criminal? Yes. Yes. What I've seen already amounts to war crimes [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=466.32s)]
*  particularly the awful attacks on civilians. Absolutely brazen the state of this honestly [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=473.04s)]
*  the absolute state of this. Now there is a Labour revolt. Labour councillors across the country have [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=481.12s)]
*  been demanding a ceasefire. 25 Labour groups council groups have demanded a ceasefire. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=485.44s)]
*  Just according to a poll a third of Labour councillors just a third say they're satisfied [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=491.12s)]
*  with the leadership position on Israel and Palestine. I'm just going to be clear now just say what I [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=495.68s)]
*  actually think it's my job. In terms of because various councillors have been leaving the Labour [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=500.08s)]
*  party that third of Labour councillors who say they're satisfied with the leadership position [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=504.32s)]
*  in Israel and Palestine they're the people who should be leaving the Labour party they're the [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=507.92s)]
*  ones who are supportive of war crimes and they're morally no different to you know to Assad in terms [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=511.92s)]
*  of sorry supporters and cheerleaders of Assad in Syria. What's the distinction here? When people [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=521.36s)]
*  quite correctly myself included condemned Assad for barrel bombing carpet bombing civilian areas [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=526.0s)]
*  I thought the point of that was we oppose the indiscriminate murder of civilians not oh we only [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=532.88s)]
*  do that when it's a western foe and people go we didn't march against Assad well yeah we weren't [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=539.6s)]
*  arming and supporting Assad were we? That was the whole point. I mean and actually these scenes were [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=544.72s)]
*  saying from Israel if they were being those atrocities committed by a state opposed to the [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=549.6s)]
*  west then these people would be demanding we go to war with them that's what would be happening. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=553.9200000000001s)]
*  It is a bleak low moment. KSlam of course he should resign he should complete I mean the guy is [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=559.9200000000001s)]
*  abject you know his whole leadership campaign a travesty he won't resign what he will be is [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=566.5600000000001s)]
*  someone who wins by default and then a terrible prime minister that's my prediction we'll see if [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=573.2s)]
*  I'm wrong let's see how he's doing after two years in power and how popular he is and how much given [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=577.52s)]
*  him there's no enthusiasm for him now and the fact he's already alienated large sections of [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=583.9200000000001s)]
*  labors natural supporters before he's even in power not going to end well um so I would say [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=589.5200000000001s)]
*  to KSlam supporters and his aides enjoy the way up because you're not going to enjoy the way down [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vUqeMx-9nE&t=595.6s)]
