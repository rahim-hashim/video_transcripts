# Don't Let Israel Use Christmas To Hide Its Crimes
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [December 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS1Tw-2cF2o)
*  Christmas. It's a time when we're supposed to switch off, to forget about our own troubles,
*  let alone the world's. Now, if you're, say, a state committing horrendous war crimes,
*  slaughtering innocent civilians with impunity, starving them, destroying their civilian
*  infrastructure, wiping out their healthcare system so that they're exposed to disease and
*  untreated underlying health conditions, this provides something of an opportunity. Particularly
*  if, say, you're a state largely armed and backed by nations dominated by the Christian religion,
*  knowing that the peoples of those countries will be celebrating Christmas with their families,
*  understandably seeking out joy and escape from anything that is distressing and painful
*  to read, listen to and watch. You know that those people, if you're that state, have a particular
*  power to put pressure on that state to cease unleashing their barbarism so that they're
*  otherwise occupied and distracted, you can commit horrors under the cover of Christmas.
*  I am, of course, describing the state of Israel as it escalates its murderous terror against what
*  remains of Gaza. What remains of Gaza? That should be a blood-curdling thing to write,
*  but it is true. As a new study finds, Israel's military onslaught is amongst the deadliest
*  and most destructive in recent history. That is quite the accolade to have given the horrors that
*  have been unleashed by humans against each other. In just over two months, it has caused more
*  destruction than was achieved by Syria's Assad regime and its Russian ally against Aleppo over
*  the course of four years, what was unleashed by the Russian army against Maripol in Ukraine,
*  as well as the three-year US-led campaign against ISIS. Proportionately, it is more destructive and
*  deadlier than the Allied bombing of Germany in World War II, which took place over many years.
*  Two-thirds of all structures in northern Gaza have been destroyed, as well as a quarter of buildings
*  in the southern area of Khan Yunis. 70% of school buildings have been damaged and many of them were
*  shelters for displaced civilians. According to the US academics who did this study,
*  and this is quite something to read, Gaza is now a different colour from space. It's a different
*  texture. They add Gaza is one of the most intense civilian punishment campaigns in history. It now
*  sits comfortably, they say, in the top quartile of the most devastating bombing campaigns ever.
*  Now how anyone on earth can possibly still indulge this deranged and frankly nauseating
*  fantasy that Israel is somehow seeking to avoid civilian casualties is beyond me. I don't think
*  anyone really does. The ones who are still trying to make this preposterous claim are self-evidently,
*  in my view, lying through their teeth. But consider this study by the New York Times,
*  which found that in the first six weeks of the onslaught against Gaza, Israel routinely used
*  one of its biggest and most destructive bombs in areas designated safe for civilians. Just think
*  about that for a second. These are around Â£2,000 bombs as they were used in southern Gaza, where
*  Israel ordered civilians to move supposedly for their own safety. So Israel claimed that these
*  were safe zones, ordered civilians to flee there, and then when these civilians, men, women, children,
*  babies, fled there, Israel dropped in them the biggest, deadliest, most destructive bombs that
*  their military possessed. Now consider just one Israeli military strike, which killed just before
*  Christmas, a Gaza aid worker and 70 members of his extended family. 70 members, many extended families
*  in Gaza huddling together and spending their last moments together as they wiped off the face of the
*  earth, often entire bloodlines. According to the UN Secretary General, on average one or two UN
*  employees has been killed every day of Israel's onslaught. That's unprecedented in the history
*  of the United Nations, but when you consider just this one example I just gave you, as you remember
*  that so many entire families of Palestinians have been wiped out during Israel's onslaught,
*  I think it's time to ask yourself, all of us, all of ourselves a question. What is Israel still
*  bombing? Given this is one of the most destructive military campaigns in history, given it's
*  proportionately unleashed more death and destruction than the allied forces were responsible for against
*  German cities over a much longer time period, ask yourself what possible targets of military value
*  could there possibly be to bomb? On Christmas Eve, an Israeli strike on the magazine Refugee Camp
*  killed at least 70 Palestinians. The bodies of men, women, children and babies were scattered
*  everywhere. Some were reportedly beheaded by the blast of that explosion. One of those babies killed
*  was two weeks old. A Christmas Eve massacre conducted by the state of Israel. Here's another
*  example. A 13 year old boy shot and killed by Israeli drone strike attack. Guess where he was?
*  He was in a hospital in Kahn Eunis, the Al-Anal hospital. Another Israeli strike in Kahn Eunis
*  on Christmas Eve is also believed to have killed 23 Palestinians. It's not just the bombs of course.
*  Listen to this. According to the United Nations, in one incident the so-called
*  Israeli defence forces reportedly took away families from a building in Gaza city where
*  they were sheltering. They then allegedly summarily killed at least 11 unarmed Palestinian men in
*  front of their family members. They then reportedly ordered women and children into a room and either
*  shot at them or threw a grenade in the room. If such reports of atrocities committed by Hamas
*  militants against Israeli civilians, we will listen to you on Christmas Eve, you can be sure
*  President Joe Biden would be decrying rightly the obscenity and depravity of Hamas. But instead he
*  stands behind these forces reportedly committing such atrocities and indeed he is arming them
*  to the teeth. We don't know how many such atrocities are being committed right now by the
*  IDF. We know from the Euromed Human Rights Monitor, which is an independent NGO based in Geneva,
*  that there are multiple reports of such field executions taking place against civilians during
*  raids on Palestinian homes. Now because foreign journalists are prevented from accessing Gaza
*  and Palestinian journalists in Gaza are being slaughtered in huge numbers and it's so dangerous
*  a war zone, we have no idea whatsoever how many Sunriq field executions are being committed by
*  the IDF. In other words, massacres of innocent civilians. There are also multiple reports of
*  Palestinian men who were detained and now released who are sharing their experiences
*  of extreme torture by their captors. Again, all examples of what are grave,
*  grave war crimes allegedly being committed by Israeli forces in this continuing onslaught.
*  Here's another example and this is all of this is hideous but listen to this. Israeli soldiers
*  raiding Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza desecrated allegedly the bodies of dead patients
*  with bulldozers. They let a military dog maul a man in a wheelchair and they shot multiple
*  doctors even after vetting them for terror links. These were allegations by staff and patients which
*  have been reported on by CNN. The head of pediatric services there says the IDF used these bulldozers
*  to dig up bodies recently buried in a makeshift graveyard in the hospital's courtyard. Allegations
*  backed up by the nurses there and there were videos showing decomposing human remains scattered all
*  across the hospital grounds. Here's another incident. Four pregnant women reportedly raising
*  white flags were shot by the IDF on their way to hospital and then bulldozers ran over their
*  corpses where they were left to rot in the sun for over two weeks. Truly Israel is playing a
*  monstrous game here. How hideous, how depraved can its actions be before western governments say
*  enough is enough is enough and it turns out to the benefit of Israel there is apparently no limit
*  at all. It must be said I can keep reading out these violent atrocities, not easy to do, not easy
*  to listen to but I don't say this lightly it won't be the bombs and the bullets that kill most people
*  that's not normally what happens in such horror. As the UN Secretary General Antonio Ghetteres says
*  four out of the five hungriest people on earth are now in Gaza. Most of the population now are
*  classed as suffering severe hunger. Famine beckons in Gaza. As the Israeli human rights organization
*  Betzlen puts it, for 80 days Israel has prevented the entry of vital supplies fuel, food, water and
*  medicine intentionally leaving people starved and without water. Furthermore Israel's plans to flood
*  Hamas's tunnel network with seawater according to a senior hydrologist risks in his words
*  ruining the basic conditions for life in Gaza. This is one of the elements of genocide and
*  so you're clear about what would happen it would mean that the seawater would seep into the aquifer
*  that Gaza's population relies on for 85 percent of water. So while much of the west peacefully
*  celebrates Christmas in the comfort of warm and safe homes it's not presents being wrapped in Gaza
*  but dead bodies, dead bodies of civilians who have been massacred by a western backed state.
*  Now Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has the cheek to issue a Christmas message in which
*  he justifies Israel's mass slaughter of Gaza. In it he says that Israel is facing monsters.
*  Let's be clear those who slaughter innocent civilians including children including babies
*  and who deliberately starve them and deliberately make the conditions of life impossible they are
*  monsters but more to the point they are war criminals and these are all grave war crimes.
*  Now the IDF have also tweeted that we wish all those who celebrate in Israel and around the world
*  a happy Christmas and a happy new year. Truly moving stuff from the Israeli defence forces
*  while they slaughter Christians in the historic birthplace of Christianity. Like the Christians
*  they slaughtered who were sheltering in the churches of Gaza that they attacked. In the west
*  bank Israeli forces are on the rampage including in Bethlehem itself of course where Jesus Christ
*  was born if you're a believer in Christianity over 2000 years ago. Now let's listen to the Christmas
*  message of Munther Isaac. He's the pastor of the Christmas evangelical Lutheran church in Bethlehem.
*  We will be okay despite the immense blow we have endured we the Palestinians will recover
*  we will rise we will stand up again from the midst of destruction as we have always done as
*  Palestinians although this is by far maybe the biggest blow we have received in a long time
*  but we will be okay but for those who are complicit I feel sorry for you will you ever recover from this?
*  Your charity and your words of shock after the genocide won't make a difference
*  and I know these words of shocks are coming and I know people will give generously for charity
*  but your words won't make a difference words of regret won't suffice for you
*  and let me say it we will not accept your apology after the genocide
*  what has been done has been done I want you to look at the mirror and ask where was I
*  when Gaza was going through a genocide? Well indeed indeed there'll be those who cheered on this water
*  or who stayed silent which itself too should be considered the crime of complicity who will end up going
*  we're sorry we're sorry this is so horrible we we didn't know what would happen if only we knew then
*  what we knew now there were no excuses it was obvious from the start what would happen this was
*  predictable and predicted and they can't get away with this complicity this is one of the great
*  crimes of our time it was aided and abetted by western governments and media outlets
*  so much blood has been lost and I'm afraid so much blood is yet to be lost too and those responsible
*  should never ever be able to scrub it away otherwise these horrors will just repeat themselves
*  over and over again now Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged that Israel will intensify its onslaught
*  he says that this campaign is not close to being over listen to the horrors I've read and consider
*  the genocidal implications of that commitment from Benjamin Netanyahu so yeah this is a pretty
*  grim video to post on Christmas Day but the Israeli state is counting as being distracted
*  the crimes being committed against Palestine haven't stopped for the holidays and so reporting
*  on them must not stop either and I'll continue each day as best as possible to do so including
*  many interviews to come not least of Palestinians whose voices need to be heard unspeakable horrors
*  have been committed many more unspeakable horrors to come and as citizens of nations whose governments
*  are allowing this atrocity of historic proportions to happen we've got a responsibility to speak out
