# Israel Reveals Its REAL PLAN
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxSz5F-TXps)
*  So there we have it. There is no excuse for the British or American governments. Israel is being
*  completely, openly, explicitly clear about their intentions. Their foreign minister, Eli Cohen,
*  was today quoted as saying, at the end of this war, not only will Hamas no longer be in Gaza,
*  but the territory of Gaza will also decrease. It is very clear what he means by that, which is that
*  Israel intends to annex at least part of Gaza. To be clear, this is illegal, not slightly illegal,
*  not a bit illegal, completely illegal. As it stands, Israel is already guilty of what is
*  regarded by the United Nations as the illegal occupation of Gaza. That's because even though,
*  for now, troops are not on its soil, it is under blockade from air, land and sea, and the control
*  of water, food and basic supplies is controlled by Israel. It is also guilty of the direct illegal
*  occupation and colonisation of the West Bank. Now, to quote, for example, UN Security Council
*  Resolution 2334, the Security Council reaffirmed this afternoon that Israel's establishment of
*  settlements in Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem, had no
*  legal validity, constituting a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to
*  the vision of two states living side by side in peace and security within internationally recognised
*  borders. Now, there are around 700,000 Israeli settlers who live illegally in the occupied West
*  Bank in 279 settlements. That's grown from 520,000 since 2012. Now, according to the UN, there have
*  been 3,372 violent incidents by settlers injuring 1,222 Palestinians. Last year,
*  settler violence reached the highest levels ever recorded, but Israel failed to investigate or
*  prosecute that violence. Now, right now, largely unreported, given the horror currently being
*  unleashed in Gaza, is that there's been a sharp uptick in violence killing Palestinians in the
*  West Bank at the hands of Israeli forces and Israeli settlers. So important we talk about this,
*  because the fact there is silence is allowing Israel to act with impunity in this occupied
*  territory. Now, at least 64 Palestinians have been killed since the 7th of October.
*  At the latest example, two Palestinian teenagers killed by Israeli forces near Ramallah. Now,
*  before this episode, Amnesty International reported torture and ill treatment by Palestinians,
*  of Palestinians by Israeli forces, as well as incarceration without charge, including children.
*  Now, Amnesty International documented the mass seizures of land and property in the West Bank,
*  unlawful killings, forcible evictions, ethnic cleansing, arbitrary restrictions,
*  and the denial of nationality. There are 175 checkpoints there and other roadblocks,
*  a draconian permit scheme, and all of that, in the words of Amnesty, has the effects of controlling
*  and fragmenting Palestinian communities. They close these checkpoints arbitrarily, throttling
*  an already crippled Palestinian economy. Now, the West Bank has forgotten a lot of this. There are
*  2.7 million Palestinians living in the West Bank compared to around 2.2 million in Gaza, but it is
*  key to understand what has been a deliberate, long-lasting attempt to throttle and destroy
*  the Palestinian right to national self-determination, which is at the core of all of this. We can't
*  understand what's happening without talking about this. Now, in 2005, those settlements in Gaza were
*  abandoned and soldiers removed from its soil, but that was part of an attempt, a cynical attempt,
*  by the Israeli right to consolidate and expand the settlements of the West Bank, thereby denying the
*  rights of the Palestinians to have their own nation. Now, the Israeli state has been so openly
*  clear about their intentions, a land grab of the land of Gaza. Now, the other day on Sky News,
*  Zippy Hotevelli, who is the British ambassador to Israel, was on with an outrageous interview.
*  But she is on record as supporting the annexation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. She regards that
*  as Yugeya and Samaria. It's all based on the Bible, a biblical justification for seizing the land of
*  the Palestinian people, not just some random extremists made British ambassador. Because if
*  you take, for example, Benjamin Netanyahu, in March, he addressed the UN Greater Assembly
*  with a map of a greater Israel encompassing the West Bank and Gaza. Now, as the Palestinian
*  authorities representative to Germany, Leith Arafat, posted on Twitter, no greater insults
*  at every foundational principle of the UN than seeing Netanyahu display before the UN General
*  Assembly a map of Israel that straddles the entire land from the river to the sea. And adding that
*  with this map that Netanyahu negates Palestine and its people, while attempting to spin the audience
*  with rhetoric about peace in the region, all the while entrenching the longest ongoing belligerent
*  occupation in today's world. The far right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, also gave a speech
*  with a greater Israel map. And in that speech, he said there was no such thing as a Palestinian
*  people. I mean, these are just extreme declarations, which are the official position
*  of the Israeli state. Now, there are courageous, incredibly courageous Israeli fighters for just
*  peace who I'm constantly in awe of. And they're so courageous because tragically public opinion has
*  become so hostile to Palestinians long before the current atrocity. A few years ago, a poll found
*  that half the Israeli public wanted to expel Arab citizens from Israel itself, and they represent
*  about a fifth of its population. We're not talking about the West Bank or Gaza here. Now, there's
*  talk, which has been dressed up in humanitarian language, of allowing Gaza's population to flee
*  to Egypt. Now, Egypt is run by an unpleasant dictatorship, Sisi, also backed by the West,
*  who has committed himself terrible, grotesque human rights violations, including massacring
*  protesters. They have pointed out publicly that Israel's leaders crave the permanent expulsion
*  of Gaza's population, so the Sinai, to Egypt, and that when they are forced to be removed,
*  they will not return. And they're absolutely right. That's what history tells us. In 1948,
*  the so-called Nakba, the foundation of Israel, when 700,000 Palestinians were expelled from their
*  homes. In 1967, after the Six Day War, you have the so-called Naksa, when between 280,000 and
*  325,000 Palestinians were driven from their homes, several Palestinian villages raised to the ground.
*  Now, the history of Palestinians is that when they are driven from their homes, when they're forced
*  out, they do not come back. Now, Israel is openly talking about seizing Gaza's land. That's their
*  foreign minister who has said that, and that's completely consistent with the official position
*  throughout of the current incarnation of the Israeli state. Gaza, which is already tiny,
*  no bigger than East London, one of the densest, most populated areas on earth, throughout,
*  they are being opened. There is no excuses for pretending we do not know the war aims of the
*  Israeli state. Their leaders and officials are saying things like, we will eliminate everything,
*  that Gaza will be reduced to a city of tents. One of Israel's top military lawyers said,
*  if you want to destroy Hamas, then you have to destroy Gaza, because everything in Gaza,
*  almost every building there is a stronghold of Hamas. Now, we've already seen the devastating
*  civilian death toll from a few days of aerial bombardment. Think now of weeks and months of a
*  ground invasion in a densely populated strip of land with the aim of annexation and colonization.
*  We are talking here about an already pre-existing plan to destroy the very existence of a Palestinian
*  nation, to make it completely impossible. I mean, the West Bank completely fragmented
*  because of all those settlements and checkpoints making life unbearable.
*  Gaza under a siege now for 15 years, a terrible blockade, and now a siege which is just
*  overtly against international law, with Israel talking overtly about taking their land and,
*  you know, Joe Biden warning them against an occupation or the rest of it.
*  The US is clearly not putting any pressure, any meaningful pressure on Israel to not do that.
*  And that's what we're talking about here. We're talking about a land invasion of Gaza with
*  catastrophic consequences, and then a potential purge, ethnic cleansing of the civilian population
*  and the colonization of their land. Don't say you weren't warned. This is what's happening.
*  Nobody in their own mind can say that these war crimes, which are being spoken about in public,
*  are in any way have any basis or justification based on the terrible atrocities committed by Hamas
*  on the 7th of October. Listen to what they're saying. Believe them. They mean it. Please like
