# Gaza Onslaught May Help "OBESITY": Pro-Israel Lobbyist
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU)
*  What do you even say? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel's murderous assault on Gaza may lead to a reduction in obesity, which may improve [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=1.96s)]
*  the life expectancy of the surviving Palestinian population. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=7.2s)]
*  That's a claim made by one of the main pro-Israel lobby groups in Britain, UK Lawyers for Israel, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=11.28s)]
*  and specifically its chief executive, Jonathan Turner. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=17.64s)]
*  This comes in the context of the winds beginning to shift against Israel in certain countries [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=21.52s)]
*  in the West, like Britain, as the enormity of the crime being committed against the Palestinian [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=26.04s)]
*  people has become impossible to suppress or ignore. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=30.56s)]
*  Israel's cheerleaders are on the defensive, and they are doubling down on a strategy they've [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=33.92s)]
*  had since day one of the genocide, to sow doubt in the estimated death toll in Gaza [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=38.6s)]
*  caused by the Israeli assault. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=44.16s)]
*  In this particular case, there was a debate at the cooperative group's annual general [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=46.599999999999994s)]
*  meeting over a motion proposing that the retailer stop selling Israeli produce. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=51.16s)]
*  This is an example of the crucial strategy of boycott, divestment and sanctions, a campaign [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=55.8s)]
*  modelled on the struggle against apartheid South Africa to use whatever levers are available [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=60.28s)]
*  to isolate this genocidal and apartheid state. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=65.52s)]
*  The motion cited figures, estimates by public health academics in a letter to The Lancet, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=69.0s)]
*  the world's most prestigious medical journal, that was published last July, so 10 months [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=75.47999999999999s)]
*  ago when they suggested at that point that up to 186,000 people could have been killed [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=80.2s)]
*  in Gaza at that point. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=86.4s)]
*  That's because as they noted in conflicts, though calling a genocide a conflict is obviously [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=88.52000000000001s)]
*  problematic, it's difficult to come up with an all-encompassing word in this particular [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  case, but the number killed through indirect causes such as lack of medical care dwarfs [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=96.2s)]
*  the number directly killed by violence, and the official death toll in Gaza only refers [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=101.68s)]
*  and indeed excludes those who are missing and under rubble, for example. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=107.96s)]
*  Well we will talk more about the death toll, but first of all, let's just go through this. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=112.28s)]
*  In a letter to the cooperative group's secretary, Jonathan Turner, chief executive of UK Laws [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=118.44s)]
*  for Israel, wrote that it was totally false and misleading to cite these figures, and [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=122.33999999999999s)]
*  he said the following, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=126.52s)]
*  before was obesity. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=136.96s)]
*  Goodness me. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=139.56s)]
*  Goodness effing me. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=142.24s)]
*  I should note, by the way, that even before the genocide began, Gaza was subjected by [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=143.24s)]
*  Israel to the longest siege of our time. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=147.44s)]
*  In early 2006, at the beginning of that siege, a senior advisor to the then Prime Minister [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=150.4s)]
*  Edwin Olmar said that the Israeli policy was designed to put the Palestinians on a diet, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=154.60000000000002s)]
*  but not to make them die of hunger. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  The strategy here was supposedly to make Palestinians turn against Hamas. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=162.78s)]
*  Well that itself, in that case, back in 2006, that's a war crime. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=167.1s)]
*  It's collective punishment. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=171.66s)]
*  It's also terrorism, by the way, using form of violence, which is what such a siege in [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=172.66s)]
*  practice is, to achieve political ends. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=176.34s)]
*  Meanwhile, in 2012, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz published a leaked document which [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=179.98s)]
*  calculated the minimum number of calories needed to keep a human alive. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=185.26s)]
*  This is an Israeli official document. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=189.58s)]
*  The point is they were deliberately trying to keep what entered Gaza to the bare minimum. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=191.74s)]
*  In September 2022, so over a year before the end of October, a World Food Programme document [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=195.98000000000002s)]
*  estimated that one third of the Palestinian population, 1.78 million, suffered from food [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=201.86s)]
*  insecurity, with 1.1 million severely food insecure, with 90% of those living in Gaza. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=207.10000000000002s)]
*  Now, at the beginning of the genocide, Israeli leaders and officials announced they would [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=215.42000000000002s)]
*  block the essentials of life entering Gaza. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=218.94s)]
*  They said we are fighting human animals. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=221.48s)]
*  And in April 2024, two US government agencies concluded that Israel was deliberately preventing [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=223.56s)]
*  humanitarian aid from getting into Gaza. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=228.32s)]
*  But at the beginning of March, over two months ago, Israel imposed a total absolute siege [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=230.88s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=236.76s)]
*  Absolutely nothing is allowed in. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=237.76s)]
*  Not food, not medicines, not fuel. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=238.76s)]
*  We could go on. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=240.23999999999998s)]
*  At the same time, Israel has destroyed agriculture, domestic food production, livestock. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=241.23999999999998s)]
*  So the ability to produce food destroyed whilst food is not getting in, as well as other essentials [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=246.58s)]
*  of life. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=251.52s)]
*  Now, the latest report from a UN-backed agency, the UN Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=252.52s)]
*  states that the entire population of Gaza faces high levels of acute food insecurity, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=259.14s)]
*  with half a million, or one in five, facing starvation. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=263.22s)]
*  Now since the total blockade imposed two months ago, 57 Palestinian children have reportedly [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=267.34000000000003s)]
*  died from the effects of malnutrition. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=272.42s)]
*  Now UK lawyers for Israel have formed, to say the least. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=276.34s)]
*  In February 2023, before the 7th October, a display of artwork made by Palestinian children [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=280.46s)]
*  at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London was removed after they submitted a complaint. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=286.65999999999997s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=291.06s)]
*  Because they claimed it made Jewish people feel vulnerable, harassed and victimised. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=292.06s)]
*  A really good example there, by the way, of how you get this weaponisation of, I guess, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=294.85999999999996s)]
*  emotional harm. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=302.9s)]
*  There's this attempt to just destroy the meaning of actual trauma. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=304.38s)]
*  So that if anyone just says they claim they're traumatised, regardless of context, then if [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=310.38s)]
*  you don't accept it, then you've somehow committed an antisemitic act. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=318.73999999999995s)]
*  And we've seen this over and again used to shut down any sentiments of solidarity towards [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=324.38s)]
*  the Palestinian people. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=329.58s)]
*  Now Brian Whitaker, former Middle East editor of the Guardian newspaper, has done a thread [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=331.84s)]
*  about the activities of UK lawyers for Israel, including how they've used lawfare to pressure [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=336.79999999999995s)]
*  arts venues and youth centres, youth theatres for example. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=341.59999999999997s)]
*  Now the UK government is complicit in genocide and it only suspended 8% of arms deals under [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=345.03999999999996s)]
*  acute legal pressure, continues to export crucial components for F-35 jets to rain death [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=349.76s)]
*  and destruction of Gaza. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=354.23999999999995s)]
*  But that 8% was too much for UK lawyers for Israel and they threatened to take the government [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=355.23999999999995s)]
*  to court to force them to keep selling them those weapons. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=360.84s)]
*  Now this attempt to suggest that a total siege imposed on an entire population, which is [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=364.52s)]
*  a war crime, noticeably, but is somehow doing the Palestinian people a favour by reducing [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=369.2s)]
*  obesity levels, is obviously a grotesque, disturbed example of the attempt to stop the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=372.64s)]
*  Western public from understanding the gravity of the crime that their governments are directly [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=377.91999999999996s)]
*  facilitating. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=382.32s)]
*  The truth is that the death toll in Gaza is much bigger than the official statistics suggest. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=384.05999999999995s)]
*  The Economist is a right of centre magazine, which spent months and months supporting Israel's [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=388.52s)]
*  murderous onslaught. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=393.02s)]
*  They're now getting cold feet like others, who were either cheerleaders of this abomination [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=394.02s)]
*  or who sought to remain silent as hideous crimes were committed in their name. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=398.03999999999996s)]
*  Now they released the Economist estimates about the death toll in Gaza which are absolutely [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=402.96s)]
*  terrifying. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=406.71999999999997s)]
*  They know that the number of Palestinians estimated by Gaza's authorities to have [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=407.71999999999997s)]
*  died from traumatic injuries, that's important, is 52,615. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=410.71999999999997s)]
*  Based on their estimates, the Economist estimates based on cross-referencing, different lists, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=416.32s)]
*  they believe that a low estimate of deaths from traumatic injuries is 77,000, whilst [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=421.15999999999997s)]
*  the higher estimate is 109,000. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=425.88s)]
*  109,000. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=427.88s)]
*  They're only discussing violent deaths. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=428.88s)]
*  That's people who've been bombed, shot, incinerated, suffocated under rubble, shredded, decapitated. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=432.08s)]
*  We could go on, and sorry to be so graphic, but we need to be clear what's happening here. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=439.4s)]
*  As we've already established, the number who die from violent causes, for want of a [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=444.0s)]
*  better word in conflicts, is invariably only a fraction of the total death toll. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=448.8s)]
*  In Yemen, for example, it was estimated that 60% of the estimated deaths in that war between [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=453.76s)]
*  2015 and 2022 were attributable to indirect causes like food insecurity and a lack of [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=458.6s)]
*  accessible healthcare. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=464.04s)]
*  I'm not going to belittle the horror of what Yemenis were subjected to. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=465.04s)]
*  I've written for years about the Western Black Saudi assault on Yemen. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=468.08s)]
*  I went to Yemeni refugee camp and made a documentary about it. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=471.91999999999996s)]
*  Two points here. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=475.88s)]
*  The Western Black Saudi assault wasn't responsible for all those deaths. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=477.0s)]
*  There were other parties, of course, involved in that conflict. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=480.15999999999997s)]
*  And the other is, however hideous the situation in Yemen, it was never anywhere near as apocalyptic [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=483.08s)]
*  as Gaza. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=488.12s)]
*  The number of people killed in the space of seven years was a much smaller fraction of [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=489.12s)]
*  the death toll in Gaza in the space of 19 months. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=493.28s)]
*  In Gaza, we have the near total destruction of the entire healthcare system. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=496.79999999999995s)]
*  Think of all the people, by the way, with cancer, heart conditions, diabetes, you name [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=500.6s)]
*  it. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=503.88s)]
*  We have a total siege plus the near total destruction of the ability of Gaza to produce [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=504.88s)]
*  its own food. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=508.44s)]
*  We have the destruction of nearly all homes and thus the lack of shelter, the displacement [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=509.44s)]
*  of almost the entire population multiple times, the lack of available fresh water. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=513.28s)]
*  We could go on. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=517.72s)]
*  If 109,000 Palestinians have been killed because of violence alone, well, frankly, I would [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=518.72s)]
*  be scared to even try estimating the overall death toll at this point. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=523.0400000000001s)]
*  Bearing in mind that the pre-war population was something like 2.2 million or 2.3 million. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=526.0400000000001s)]
*  So that would mean around 5% of the entire population suffering violent deaths in just [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=531.0s)]
*  19 months. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=534.88s)]
*  And if that number who have died, if the number who have died because of multiple and intersecting [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=535.88s)]
*  indirect causes is much bigger, which it will be, then we could easily be looking at a worse [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=542.12s)]
*  death rate than Cambodia under the four years of the Khmer Rouge. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=546.96s)]
*  No wonder the Israeli state has gone to such lengths to slaughter those documenting the [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=552.32s)]
*  abominable crime that is committing against the Palestinian people. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=556.08s)]
*  I want to end by talking about Hassan Ezzia, a Palestinian journalist who is beloved in [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=559.44s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=565.44s)]
*  People in Gaza have been getting in touch with me about him today and who has been so [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=566.44s)]
*  courageously documenting the genocide that has been committed against his people, documenting [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=570.44s)]
*  the crimes in unbearable circumstances. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=575.2s)]
*  Now, the crime committed here speaks to the utter barbarism of what we are discussing. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=578.0s)]
*  Hassan's work has been used by mainstream news outlets like Sky News, CNN, the New York [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=583.4399999999999s)]
*  Times. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=588.68s)]
*  He had nearly 600,000 followers on Instagram alone. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=589.68s)]
*  Last month, Israel bombed a media tent outside the Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=593.8s)]
*  Two of his fellow journalists were killed, but the Israeli military made clear that he [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=598.16s)]
*  was their target because they had falsely smeared him as a Hamas militant. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=602.0799999999999s)]
*  He survived but with grave injuries, burns, amputated fingers, amongst other things, and [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=605.6s)]
*  he was being treated in the hospital's burn unit. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=610.12s)]
*  A few weeks ago, he told the US media outlet Monday Vice, it would not be difficult for [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=612.4s)]
*  the occupation to assassinate me, again, especially with the increasing incitement I hear and [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=617.8000000000001s)]
*  see against me. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=621.6800000000001s)]
*  They may target me inside the hospital in this room of mine. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=622.72s)]
*  What can I do? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=625.64s)]
*  And yesterday, that's exactly what Israel did. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=627.32s)]
*  They bombed the burns unit of our hospital so they could kill this journalist who they'd [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=629.6s)]
*  already maimed. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=633.92s)]
*  Just let the scale of that depravity sink in. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=636.84s)]
*  Israel tries to murder a journalist, someone who's not competent. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=641.68s)]
*  They kill his colleagues in the process. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=645.36s)]
*  They leave him severely injured in a hospital burns unit, and then weeks later, as he's [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=648.92s)]
*  suffering because of the injuries they've already inflicted against him, they bomb the [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=654.24s)]
*  hospital burns unit to kill him. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=658.68s)]
*  So few regimes have behaved with this level of shameless barbarism, particularly when [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=663.4s)]
*  they were flaunting it in front of the whole world. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=668.8s)]
*  And yet, despite the biggest massacre of journalists in the history of human civilisation, so few [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=671.92s)]
*  Western journalists have said a thing about the butchery of their colleagues. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=676.72s)]
*  That moral disgrace alone will scream through the ages. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRuVbBINgU&t=680.88s)]
