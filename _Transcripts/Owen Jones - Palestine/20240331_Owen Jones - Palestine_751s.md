# Israeli War Crimes COVERED UP By UK Government
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [March 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnoLqtI0iV8)
*  This is a smoking gun and it could not be more important.
*  Now Alicia Kearns is a conservative MP.
*  She's also the chair of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee.
*  As I've said a few times now, she's actually done a significantly better job at scrutinising
*  the government over Gaza and Israel's crimes than say the Labour Front Bench.
*  She's also a former Foreign Office and Ministry of Defence official,
*  which is extremely relevant here.
*  Now a leaked recording has been published by the Observer of her speaking
*  at a Tory fundraising event for West Hampstead and Fortune Green Conservatives.
*  Let's just listen to that now.
*  They have not said it.
*  They haven't stopped arms exports.
*  They've done a few very small sanctions on Israeli settlers
*  and everyone internationally has agreed that settlers are illegal,
*  that they shouldn't be doing what they're doing as the way to continue the lies we put in.
*  The position that David has taken, which has to do with the same position as me,
*  I still feel very tough on him, is that Israel has an absolute right to self-defence.
*  And I have sat in bunkers and worked with Israeli soldiers and I feel very proud to do so.
*  I would do it again tomorrow.
*  But the right to self-defence has a limit in law.
*  It is not limitless.
*  And unfortunately, some of the ways in which Israel is prosecuting this
*  is making their long-term security less certain.
*  It is making our long-term security less certain.
*  I'm amazed that our national threat level has not gone up.
*  And it breaks my heart because I know it can be done differently.
*  So the problem is we need a long-term security with Israel.
*  That does not happen without Palestinian state.
*  That is how it ultimately under my hands.
*  You cannot, I said two and a half years of my life fighting ISIS.
*  You cannot destroy ideology.
*  You cannot form it into a filtration.
*  So we need that long-term solution.
*  Well, there's a few things here really.
*  I did of course say that I thought Alicia Kearns had done a much better job than Labour on this issue.
*  Well, I mean, that is a low bar, but nonetheless.
*  And clearly there is much I disagree with in terms of content and tone.
*  Now, for example, this incessant framing about the implications of Israel committing what I
*  firmly believe is a genocide or war framed on the terms of Israel security.
*  Now, clearly I want Israeli civilians to be safe.
*  I think the land belongs to them and Palestinians to be shared on the basis of justice and equality.
*  That has to be the starting point for any lasting peace.
*  But if you start from the principle that the value of a life of a Palestinian and Israeli
*  civilian has equal worth, which you should, that is asking for the world as things stand,
*  then the focus should be on the murderous crimes being committed against Palestinians
*  on a daily basis.
*  Given far, far, far, far, far more Palestinians have been killed than Israeli civilians and are
*  being slaughtered every single day rather than framing mass slaughter as about increasing the
*  risks to Israel when the risk of anything even remotely approaching the scale of what Gaza has
*  suffered happening to Israel is essentially non-existent.
*  Now, for a start, the idea of is not going to make the mistake of 7th October when the hubris of
*  Israel in which its leaders believed Gaza was a sealed tomb meant they left southern communities
*  undefended.
*  I mean, the army didn't turn up for several hours.
*  I do think it's striking before getting to the meat of what she said that she says that she
*  surprised Britain's national threat level on terrorism hasn't gone up.
*  So am I, incidentally.
*  And clearly what she's saying here is a mass slaughter of innocent people in violation of the
*  basic norms of warfare will radicalize huge numbers of people and increase the risk of terrorism.
*  Well, yes, that should be a statement of the obvious.
*  But whenever such an attack actually happens and anyone makes a link to Western foreign
*  policy, that is denounced.
*  They're denounced as outrageous and indecent and making excuses for terrorism when that context
*  is offered.
*  So let's be clear now.
*  This is perhaps the biggest mass radicalization event in history, given a repeatedly stated
*  genocidal intentions of Israeli leaders, B, the footage of the atrocities they have committed
*  and the destruction they've unleashed, which too many people now have seen.
*  See the fact IDF soldiers keep gleefully posting their own war crimes on social media as fodder
*  for comic amusement and D, the crucial role of the West in arming and supporting this
*  historic crime.
*  It is essentially inevitable.
*  I'm sorry to say this.
*  It's macabre.
*  It's horrible.
*  But it is essentially inevitable that there will be terrorist attacks and innocent people
*  are going to be killed.
*  So when that happens, let's loop back to what Alicia Kern said here and note the murmurs
*  of approval of a statement of the obvious at a conservative fundraiser.
*  But the real crucial element here is she stated that the British government has received advice
*  from its own lawyers that Israel has breached international humanitarian law and failed
*  to make it public.
*  What that means legally speaking is Britain has to immediately end all arms sales to Israel.
*  As the Observer notes, legal experts said that not to not do so would risk putting the UK in breach
*  of international law itself, as it would be seen as aiding and abetting war crimes by a country
*  it was exporting arms to.
*  So the government is suppressing this legal advice and not acting on what legal advice that
*  legal advice demands, which is an arms embargo.
*  It also means the UK would be legally obliged to cease sharing intelligence with Israel because
*  that also makes the state directly complicit in criminality.
*  Now, the Observer also notes comments by the British barrister, Sir Geoffrey Nice, who
*  prosecuted the former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic that countries supplying arms to
*  Israel may now be complicit in criminal warfare.
*  The public should be told what the advice says.
*  Now, let's listen to what David Cameron said on the 9th of January in the House of Commons
*  when he was questioned by Alicia Kearns.
*  It's not about arms exports.
*  It's about international humanitarian law being upheld when it comes to aid, when it
*  comes to the way in which it strikes have been prosecuted, everything else.
*  One question on arms exports, we've moved from them in any realm, in any respect.
*  So you've never had a piece of paper put in front of you by a foreign office lawyer that
*  says that Israel is in breach of its international humanitarian commitments under international
*  humanitarian law.
*  Look, the reason for the answer to this question, I can't recall every single bit of paper that's
*  been put in front of me.
*  Well, he's a slippy little slo-and-so, isn't he?
*  Always has been, always will be.
*  As I said at the time, it was extremely obvious from that exchange that the foreign secretary
*  had received legal advice that Israel is in breach of international humanitarian law.
*  He was trying to navigate two problems here.
*  One, he didn't want to admit that he'd received such legal advice because that would
*  mean accepting the inevitable consequences that legally follow from such advice.
*  And two, that it is a criminal offense to lie to a parliamentary select committee.
*  So he tries going off on a tangent and then falls back on the risable claim that he cannot
*  remember every piece that's put in front of him.
*  Well, perhaps not, but I would say the idea he would not be able to remember if he had
*  seen legal advice as foreign secretary, making it clear that Israel is in breach of international
*  humanitarian law is farcically absurd.
*  I know it, he knows it, we all know it, so let's just skip the pantomime, shall we?
*  As Middle East Eye reported after that performance, the foreign secretary recommended arms sales
*  to Israel despite serious concerns in the foreign office that Israel had breached international
*  law according to a government document filed in the High Court.
*  Now, what should happen here as a bare minimum is the official opposition, the Labour party,
*  should demand arms sales are immediately ended as per the legal obligations of the UK as
*  well as intelligence sharing.
*  But instead the shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, simply says the revelations raise
*  serious concerns about whether the government is complying with its own law and that the
*  government must publish the legal advice.
*  Well, obviously, but firstly, look, David Lammy and the Labour leadership back to his
*  onslaught and only belatedly back to ceasefire long, long, long after it was clear Israel
*  had committed multiple egregious violations of international law.
*  There is no excuses there.
*  They wrecked a motion from the Scottish National Party, above all else on this issue, because
*  it included reference to Israel being guilty of collective punishment.
*  That is holding Israel to account for committing war crimes.
*  So they're facing compromised and not even doing what should be the bare minimum.
*  But look, it's an absurdity many of us will obviously never get over that we're even
*  having to discuss this.
*  Obviously, Israel has committed so many violations of international law from the very start
*  from a siege, which is causing famine as well as depriving Palestinians of all the
*  basics of life, from indiscriminate destruction of civilian infrastructure to the violent
*  dismantling of the health care system to massacring civilians via bombs and bullets.
*  The biggest rate of killing since the Rwandan genocide, as one new official puts it.
*  We could go on and on and on.
*  Now, let's just look at some of the latest revelations from the Israeli newspaper Haaretz
*  in order to align that point.
*  Now, Israel's claim that 9000 terrorists, as it puts it, have been killed since this
*  nightmare began last October.
*  Now, bear in mind that if we include those buried under the rubble and officially described
*  as missing, and I do keep having to say this, I'm afraid they are overwhelmingly long dead,
*  then at least 40,000 Palestinians have suffered violent deaths since the 7th of October.
*  So Israel claims less than a quarter of those are Hamas militants.
*  As Haaretz says, based on what they've been told by defence officials and soldiers, many
*  of those classed as terrorists are actually simply civilians who cross into an invisible
*  line drawn by the IDF, so-called kill zones, where everyone and anyone is fair game.
*  Now, we've heard how Israel has claimed its mass, forcible displacement of civilians
*  is a humanitarian gesture.
*  That is used to justify claiming that anyone who remains or enters into these areas are
*  legitimate targets.
*  All of these accounts of mass killings of so-called terrorists are often simple massacres
*  of civilians.
*  Every single one of those killings is a war crime.
*  Now, this underlines what we should already know.
*  The vast majority of those slaughtered by Israel in Gaza are innocent civilians.
*  Absolutely, clearly, incontrovertibly true.
*  Now, today we also hear Israel's lodged a proposal with the United Nations to dismantle
*  UNRWA, the main humanitarian agency in Gaza.
*  Now, that is completely incompatible with the provisional orders of the International
*  Court of Justice for Israel to ensure access to humanitarian aid in order to prevent genocide.
*  As, of course, famine sweeps Gaza.
*  To conclude, no excuses.
*  None.
*  It's extremely clear and undeniable that a crime of historic proportions is being committed
*  with the full, active complicity of the British Government.
*  Knowingly so.
*  The Government know this.
*  They are willingly aiding and abetting a monstrous crime.
*  Which is why all of this should be treated as evidence for a future war crimes tribunal.
*  I'm going to keep saying this.
*  I know it's widely believed that Israel's impunity means that Israeli leaders and those
*  who aided and abetted them as they committed all of these crimes means everyone involved
*  in this absolute despicable slaughter are going to get away with it.
*  I no longer believe that.
*  I don't believe it anymore.
*  I think this crime is too big to have seemed to avert too shameless.
*  Public opinion in the states Israel depends on to continue its murderous persecution of
*  the Palestinians is shifting decisively against it.
*  Israel has betted everything.
*  Bet the house on the fact that nothing will change.
*  That Israel will continue to enjoy limitless impunity from its western protectors.
*  I don't think that's going to be the case.
*  I don't think they're going to get away with it.
*  It might be 10 years.
*  It might be 20 years.
*  It might be 30 years.
*  But I firmly believe now that a lot of people are going to end up in jail for this.
*  And we should push remorselessly to make sure accountability and justice happens.
*  But of course, that's not enough.
*  That's not going to stop the mass slaughter in here and now.
*  And that's why we have to keep speaking out as loudly as we can.
