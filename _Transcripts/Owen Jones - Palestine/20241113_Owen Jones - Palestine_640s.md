# Israeli Newspaper ADMITS Tel Aviv Thugs Started Amsterdam Riot
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [November 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg)
*  This is frankly wild on multiple fronts. This concerns how you can now find out the truth, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=0.0s)]
*  or at least some of it, of what happened in Amsterdam in the Israeli media of all places [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  after the western media turned reality on its head after violence started by racist, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=11.44s)]
*  genocidal supporters of Maccabi Tel Aviv Football Club. The western media erased much of this [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=16.96s)]
*  reality up to and including portraying footage of Maccabi hooligans attacking local residents [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=23.12s)]
*  as the opposite. That is reversing it to claim that the footage showed Maccabi fans being attacked. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=29.36s)]
*  Now I explored that by interviewing the woman who recorded that particular evidence. Well now the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=36.4s)]
*  truth has made it into the pages of Israeli newspapers. This is rightly surreal. Yediyoth [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  Aronof is Israel's highest circulation newspaper. A piece published of what happened in Amsterdam [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=48.32s)]
*  last week was headlined. This is what a pogrom looks like. This is the new anti-Semitism. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  So you think you know where this is all going right? Same goes when you read the subheading. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=59.12s)]
*  The outrageous anti-Semitic attack in Amsterdam was meticulously planned by its Muslim population [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=63.28s)]
*  beforehand which Dutch officials and police ignored. Already there, blatant racism just [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=69.2s)]
*  ripping off discussing how the outrageous anti-Semitic attack was quote unquote meticulously [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=74.4s)]
*  planned by its Muslim population beforehand. Imagine a headline discussing a racist attack [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=80.16s)]
*  meticulously planned by a city's quote unquote Jewish population. Anyway you get then get into [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=86.08s)]
*  the meat of the text and it reads and this is how it honestly this is the first paragraph. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=91.12s)]
*  This is what an Israeli woman who arrived in Amsterdam two days before the soccer match between [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=95.12s)]
*  Maccabi, Tel Aviv and Ajax clubs wrote about the atmosphere in the city. There were huge gatherings [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=98.96s)]
*  and shouts of death to Arabs in Amsterdam's main squares alongside violence against people holding [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=103.84s)]
*  Palestinian flags. What the f- literally just coming out there and writing from the outset the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=108.64s)]
*  proof that violence started because Israeli football hooligans were chanting genocidal chants [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=115.68s)]
*  literally calling for the extermination of an entire ethnic group the Arab population in a city [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  with an Arab population whilst it says attacking people holding Palestinian flags. Wait for the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=125.6s)]
*  next bit it quotes the Israeli woman again. We didn't know that the organized violent reaction [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=130.16s)]
*  from the other side was coming. Leaving the game 10 Maccabi Tel Aviv fans were roaming the train [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=134.32s)]
*  looking for a Palestinian to beat up. Their words. They didn't find one. They arrived at the central [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=139.12s)]
*  station. At first everything was fine she recalled. Sorry just just just one moment there. Just [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=144.72s)]
*  casually throwing in an example of a large roaming gang of Maccabi fans trying to find Palestinians [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=151.76s)]
*  to in their own words beat up. So we have there clear evidence of racist violence intended by [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=158.16s)]
*  Tel Aviv hooligans from the very outset. It then goes on then as they left the station we suddenly [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=165.28s)]
*  heard explosions of very loud firecrackers and many Maccabi Tel Aviv fans started running. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=170.24s)]
*  Amsterdam police Peter Holler condemned the attack on the Israelis two days later clarifying that [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=175.44s)]
*  the Israelis started the riots. Because so there we have clarity that in fact the Dutch police [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=180.0s)]
*  themselves stated the facts in that the riots in Amsterdam were in fact started by Israeli fans. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=184.56s)]
*  The journalist then goes on to outline an argument between both her and a Dutch Palestinian [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=190.8s)]
*  journalist who grew up in Gaza and formerly worked for New York Times about what happened. It then [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=194.32s)]
*  sets out allegations which have been extensively aired and discussed in mainstream media outlets [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=199.04s)]
*  about attacks on Maccabi fans. There's no question there were attacks on Maccabi fans which I'm not [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=205.6s)]
*  going to defend. We'll talk about that. It then has this totally wild throwaway line. The soccer [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=210.4s)]
*  match itself was peaceful. Arab fans were denied entry and the planned chaos erupted right after. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=214.88s)]
*  Sorry what the hell? Arabs were denied entry just casually thrown in. That's a very serious [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  allegation of racist discrimination there. I don't know Dutch law but in say Britain discrimination [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=225.04000000000002s)]
*  the provision of goods and services when it comes to protected characteristics is strictly [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=229.52s)]
*  prohibited. Now the article discusses how the attackers conveyed the message that among the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=233.76s)]
*  Israelis were soldiers from Gaza who received compensation and needed to be hunted down and [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=238.72s)]
*  dealt with. Now to be clear I oppose any attacks on Maccabi fans and there is clear evidence of [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  some anti-Semitic rhetoric in these attacks. I oppose violence unless someone is say being [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=247.68s)]
*  attacked for example by a Maccabi fan and they need to defend themselves. What we're discussing [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=252.96s)]
*  here is firstly the order that the violence was triggered by Maccabi Tel Aviv fans and that this [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=256.8s)]
*  violence was driven by racism and indeed genocidal racism as this account in an Israeli newspaper [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=262.24s)]
*  makes clear which is making claims of a pogrom against Israelis. I mean it's completely crazy [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=268.32s)]
*  because it discusses Israelis Israeli fans fans of specifically Maccabi Tel Aviv roaming looking for [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=278.48s)]
*  Palestinians to beat up which is the sort of behavior you'd expect in a pogrom. Now this has [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=290.72s)]
*  been completely erased because it completely destroys the narrative that has been woven. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=297.36s)]
*  On the point there about soldiers we know for a fact that there were Israeli soldiers present. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=302.0s)]
*  Soldiers that is who have served in Gaza and I will bet everything I have on this have been [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=305.12s)]
*  involved in grotesque grave war crimes and they should be under arrest to stand trial for what [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=310.0s)]
*  they've done not say rampaging around the streets of Amsterdam literally relishing their genocide [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=316.88s)]
*  and committing violence against locals to celebrate as there is an abundance of evidence to support. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=321.52s)]
*  We also know from the Jerusalem post that Mossad accompanied the Maccabi football team. Now this [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=327.04s)]
*  is particularly relevant given the racist bile this article concludes with it talks of those [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=332.64s)]
*  responsible being of Arab origin adding this is the new anti-semitism. Dude have you read your own [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=336.8s)]
*  writing you've literally written down the rampant racist genocidal racist killing all Arabs and [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=343.84s)]
*  violence Maccabi Tel Aviv fans including as I say seeking to hunt down Palestinians do you not [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=351.52s)]
*  understand that this is the behavior of pogrom. The cognitive dissonance here is totally wild. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=356.23999999999995s)]
*  I talked to Israeli leftists because I was so baffled as to why such details in Israeli media [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=362.0s)]
*  would be included and they they thought it was just because they saw it as a non-issue is no big [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=367.03999999999996s)]
*  deal. I mean the piece that goes on to detail the size of the Muslim population there in not a subtle [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=371.6s)]
*  dogmasal way well as Israeli journalist Gideon Levy puts it the North African immigrants the Arabs [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=377.84000000000003s)]
*  and the Dutch people who rioted saw the horrors in Gaza over the past year they're not willing [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=384.64000000000004s)]
*  to remain silent about them for them the victims are their brothers and their compatriots and who [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=388.48s)]
*  can remain indifferent when your people are slaughtered so cruelly every Moroccan waiter in [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=393.84000000000003s)]
*  every remote Dutch town has seen much more of Gaza than the experts in Arab affairs in Israel [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=398.08s)]
*  no decent person could remain indifferent to the images from Gaza this is from the pages of harets [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=402.71999999999997s)]
*  now you have Maccabi fans on the rampage screaming death to Arabs singing a song which relishes [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=408.47999999999996s)]
*  in the killing of Palestinian children they're dragging down Palestinian flags from private [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=413.44s)]
*  homes and setting fire to them throwing stones you know various missiles at people's private homes [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=418.71999999999997s)]
*  attacking cab drivers we could go on you know tooling up with iron bars the local Arab population [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=426.16s)]
*  the city these hooligans have arrived arrived in to call for their extermination include as the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=431.68s)]
*  local Dutch Arabs know that Dutch Muslims know soldiers who have committed war crimes as well as [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=436.08000000000004s)]
*  Mossad itself complicit in grave war crimes that's not to justify any violence which I don't it's to [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=441.6s)]
*  point out by definition that is obviously a highly combustible situation which explains why for [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=446.64000000000004s)]
*  example Russian teams are banned from such tournaments now there is more oh there is more [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=452.4s)]
*  according to a new report by NOS the Dutch public broadcaster violence involving Israeli fans the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=458.15999999999997s)]
*  night before the match was so bad that the local police and authorities nearly called off the match [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=462.96s)]
*  and 10 Israelis were arrested that timeline is important this is about what happened before [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=468.71999999999997s)]
*  the subsequent violence escalated which was presented as the first violence but these details [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=475.35999999999996s)]
*  were erased by western media covers and western politicians why can't I read about that in western [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=480.96s)]
*  newspapers why is it just some Dutch broadcaster how is it possible to find out that Israeli [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=484.96s)]
*  fans were being arrested before all of this because of their violence let's call let's call [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=492.08s)]
*  this what it is it is racism I mean it's not even subtle racism we saw an attempt to spin a narrative [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=498.71999999999997s)]
*  where the local Arab and Muslim population instigated the violence and with the sole or [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=504.15999999999997s)]
*  main perpetrators of violence and a racism and that was used to justify betraying them as [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=508.64s)]
*  dangerous hateful extremists lots of rhetoric about how dangerous Muslims in Europe are now the rampant [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=512.96s)]
*  racist violence with Israeli fans as they literally rampaged in support of a genocide being perpetrated [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=520.4s)]
*  as they rioted all of that was erased now let's just see this clip from Al Jazeera a taxi driver [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=525.12s)]
*  who wants his identity to be protected told us on his lawyer's phone what happened when he was [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=530.8s)]
*  filming makkabi supporters tearing down Palestinian flags a hooligan dressed in black came to my taxi [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=536.16s)]
*  and tried to drag me out and started to damage my car another person came with an iron chain and [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=544.0799999999999s)]
*  hit my car several times I reported this to the police but they didn't take action his lawyer is [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=549.28s)]
*  documenting other cases of violence and racism committed by makkabi fans what we saw is several [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=555.76s)]
*  footage of the makkabi fans screaming in the middle of Amsterdam kill all the Arabs rape all [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=562.96s)]
*  the Arabs and all kind of horrific things which should not be in any city center in the world [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=570.64s)]
*  this is just astonishing rampant racist violence by these ready thugs are raised where is that [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=576.4000000000001s)]
*  featuring across the coverage in the western media now that lawyer I would know is now working on [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=582.8000000000001s)]

*  because you opposed racist football hooligans perpetrating violence as they celebrate genocide [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=601.84s)]
*  at the same time as you didn't support any violence now the truth matters here there has [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=609.2s)]
*  been a determined attempt to smear silence anyone who has challenged the narrative of what happened [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eD-eEibXpg&t=614.08s)]
