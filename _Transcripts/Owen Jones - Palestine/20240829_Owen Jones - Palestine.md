# Has Israel BLACKMAILED International Criminal Court?
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [August 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIxx7c7Ubaw)
*  Where are the International Criminal Court's arrest warrants against Israeli leader Bendy
*  Netanyahu and his defence minister Yoav Galan? It's now been three months since the chief
*  prosecutor of the ICC, Karem Khan, requested arrest warrants against the two Israeli leaders
*  for war crimes and crimes against humanity, as well as three Hamas leaders. It is then
*  left to the pre-trial chamber of the ICC with three judges to accept and issue these arrest
*  warrants. In the case of the Russian President Vladimir Putin, an arrest warrant request over
*  the invasion of Ukraine was submitted on the 22nd February 2023. That was accepted by the
*  pre-trial chamber with arrest warrants issued on the 17th March 2023, so that's 23 days later.
*  It's now been 101 days since the ICC chief prosecutor issued requests for arrest warrants
*  in relation to Israel and Palestine, so over four times the length of time and counting.
*  Since then, Israel has continued on a daily basis to perpetrate some of the worst atrocities
*  of the 21st century, including atrocities which qualify as the worst kind of crimes
*  which humans can possibly commit against other humans. So I am going to ask, is Israel,
*  is the Israeli state blackmailing or threatening the ICC and specifically the three judges in the
*  pre-trial chamber? Now this might seem like tinfoil hat conspiracism, but I've always been on that
*  wing of the left that tries to keep away from unjustified conspiratorial thinking and stick
*  to the facts. That doesn't mean conspiracies don't happen, they very much do. Just claims about them
*  shouldn't be plucked out of thin air. I'm not doing that, as we will see. I will make the case
*  for why we should at least consider what I'm setting forth here. Now first of all, I would
*  note before I go on to that, that six days ago the ICC chief prosecutor wrote to the three judges
*  to implore them to issue the arrest warrants. These three judges are Judge Julia Matoc from Romania,
*  Rain Alapino Gansu from Benin, or Rain Alapini Gansu, Nicolas Guil from France. Now his application
*  notes that the International Court of Justice, the world's highest court, ruled that Israel's
*  continued presence in the occupied Palestinian territories is unlawful, and that includes Gaza.
*  He notes the tens of thousands of Palestinians killed, the massive destruction of civilian
*  infrastructure and the mass displacement of the overwhelming majority of the population. Israel,
*  he notes, has deprived the Palestinian population of objects indispensable to their survival.
*  He also notes this didn't begin on the 7th of October, in fact he refers to survivors making
*  that case, and that the case continues from an ICC investigation, which has been ongoing since 2021,
*  that precedes his tenure as chief prosecutor with the situation being referred to the court since
*  2018. He emphasises that it is settled law that the court has jurisdiction on this situation,
*  we'll come on to that, but this is on the grounds that Palestine is a member state of the court and
*  that its jurisdiction, the court's jurisdiction, extends over the occupied Palestinian territories
*  with the Oslo Accords no bar to that investigation. The Oslo Accords, which are dead in any meaningful
*  sense, negotiated of course back in the 90s as opposed to a peace agreement between Israel
*  and Palestine, often presented as an excuse to suggest that the court doesn't have jurisdiction,
*  which has no legal foundation, and he goes into great detail about why that's true.
*  Now the investigation is urgent because as this statement notes, the situation in the occupied
*  Palestinian territories, including Gaza, is catastrophic, owing in large part to the
*  ongoing criminality described in the applications. He notes the relevant article of the court's
*  statute that the arrest of persons named in applications appears necessary to prevent them
*  from continuing with the commission of that crime or a related crime which is within the
*  jurisdiction of the court and which arises out of the same circumstances. He says this is manifestly
*  evident in this situation where victims are struggling with death, hunger and disease.
*  The court, he emphasises, must act now because time is running out for the people of Gaza.
*  It should be noted that the previous British Tory government, Obviously Sunac, submitted a
*  wrecking attempt on the grounds the ICC did not have jurisdiction, even though, as the chief
*  prosecutor notes, that is a nonsense. Now the Labour government has rightly dropped that. It
*  turns out losing parliamentary seats because of your complicity in genocide can indeed yield
*  results. However, the ICC pre-trial chamber granted the British government's request a chance to be
*  heard when it could have been dismissed, given it is groundless and that is worrying. Why did they
*  do that? Now this brings me on to the question of blackmail threats. Back in May, it was revealed
*  in The Guardian that Yossi Cohen, the former head of Mossad, allegedly threatened the previous chief
*  prosecutor of the ICC in secret meetings to try and pressure her into abandoning an investigation
*  into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in occupied Palestinian territories.
*  According to The Guardian, earlier this year, his activities were authorised at a high level
*  and justified on the basis the court posed a threat of prosecutions against military personnel,
*  according to a senior Israeli official. Another Israeli source briefed on the operation against
*  the former chief prosecutor Ben Suda, saying the Mossad's objectives were to compromise the
*  prosecutor or to list her as someone who would cooperate with Israel's demands. He is alleged to
*  have told her, you should help us and let us take care of you. You don't want to be getting into
*  things that could compromise your security or that of your family. Cliche bad guy in a film,
*  isn't it? It's not subtle, it's crude. Gangster. Baddie in a film. One-dimensional baddie in a film.
*  Now to quote The Guardian, the Mossad also took a keen interest in Ben Suda's family,
*  members and obtained transcripts of secret recordings of her husband, according to two
*  sources, with direct knowledge of the situation. Israeli officials then attempted to use the
*  material to discredit the prosecutor. It's very much nice family you've got there,
*  shame if anything happened to them. This was about far lower stakes, it's about the chief prosecutor
*  opening up an investigation into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. This was before
*  Israel's genocidal onslaught against Gaza, in which Israel's position internationally has
*  disintegrated as Western public opinion shifts against it, piling pressure on an increasingly
*  ostracized state as it commits heinous atrocities against the Palestinian people. Israel is now
*  acting like a desperate cornered animal. We know how Netanyahu and his cabal responded to the ICC
*  chief prosecutor's request. Netanyahu denounced him as one of the great anti-Semites in modern
*  times, just destroying the meaning of anti-Semitism. Again, I go on about this a lot, it's just the
*  irresponsibility of doing that. When anti-Semitism is very, very much real and rising. He said that
*  the action was callousy pouring gasoline on the fires of anti-Semitism that are raging around
*  the world. It just underlines the kind of aggression and anger. And therefore,
*  I would suggest his determination to do something about it. Jov Galant, the defence minister,
*  said it was a disgraceful attempt to intervene in the war. Finance Minister Bezelil Smotrich declared,
*  we have not seen such a show of hypocrisy and hatred of Jews like that displayed by the court
*  in the Hague since Nazi propaganda. The Nazis also spoke in the name of morality and there was
*  nothing there besides anti-Semitism. I should say that Benjamin Netanyahu himself compared
*  the chief prosecutor to the Nazi judges of the 1930s who persecuted the Jewish people.
*  So they're just making direct comparisons with the Nazis as they commit heinous war crimes
*  and genocide. Now, if the arrest warrants are issued, this will be a huge blow to the state
*  of Israel, not because they'll suddenly have their leaders arrested, if only. I would imagine
*  they would just avoid traveling abroad. It would open up the question of criminal corpability for
*  those who cooperate with Israel's genocidal onslaught. It would deepen the isolation of
*  the Israeli state and help further push public opinion into demanding governments cease arming
*  Israel and providing it with crucial diplomatic support and aid as it commits war crimes and
*  crimes against humanity. Now, these are high stakes. So do we really think the Israeli state
*  would have gone to all that effort to manage the former chief prosecutor, but now an actual arrest
*  warrants loom over Benjamin Netanyahu and his defense minister, they're just going to be hands
*  off? Really? I'm skeptical. I'm going to put it that way and I think the truth will out and I think
*  it's worth discussing. I would note that the chief prosecutor's case received the extensive
*  simultaneous backing of top lawyers, which was published on the same day, setting out the
*  overwhelming legal case. I would also note though that, well, if there's any justice,
*  many charges are still pending from the genocide of bombing campaign to the question torture,
*  which is overwhelming evidence. The original arrest warrant centers on the question of starvation.
*  Now, I mean, notice that yesterday, talking about starvation, the Israeli state's army
*  fired on a world food program convoy in Gaza, which had received multiple clearances from
*  the Israeli military authorities. It was clearly marked as it moved towards an IDF checkpoint
*  that has led to the world free program suspending its work. I bet Israel's absolutely devastated
*  that the world free program has suspended its work in assisting the desperately hungry people of Gaza
*  after its forces accidentally on purpose fired at that convoy. I think that really does underline,
*  does it not, the basis of the original request for arrest warrants? Though we know Israel is desperate.
*  It has committed some of the worst crimes of our age, but it is losing on its own terms. It's not
*  won its war aims. We know Mossad has a long gruesome history in order, you know, in terms
*  of achieving Israel's aims. We know Mossad has a history of menacing the ICC. We know that Israel's
*  position is globally in a lot of trouble. So given the stakes here, given the delay, you've got to
*  wonder, whatever the truth is, delay is unacceptable. Palestinians are being slaughtered every day that
*  the ICC doesn't act. That must be exposed. As must be at the same time exposed the criminal
*  complicity of Western leaders who have allowed this monstrosity to continue and facilitated it
*  every step of the way. Please like and subscribe, or hear your thoughts, your comments,
