# Gary Lineker SHAMES BBC Over Gaza
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc)
*  So few public figures have spoken out against Israel's genocide of the Palestinian people, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=0.0s)]
*  and that includes here in Britain, despite the British government's complicity in arming [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=5.4s)]
*  and facilitating that genocide. One exception is Gary Lineker, long-time footballer and [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=9.82s)]
*  beloved sports presenter and a household name for many decades, and he's been vilified [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=15.48s)]
*  for it, not least for sharing my own content on the genocide. I'll come on to that. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=19.96s)]
*  First of all, let's hear him being interviewed by Amal Vajan, who I should say used to be [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=24.64s)]
*  my boss when I was at The Independent. That was the newspaper, The Independent. Let's [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=28.08s)]
*  have a listen. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=31.84s)]
*  You could be partial. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=32.839999999999996s)]
*  I know where I stand on this. I'm sorry, it's more important than what the BBC, what's [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  going on there is, you know, the mass murder of thousands of children is probably something [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=39.28s)]
*  that we should have a little opinion on. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=45.26s)]
*  But the BBC as a whole needs to be impartial about it. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=46.92s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=50.36s)]
*  It needs to be factual. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=51.36s)]
*  It needs to be impartial about no conflict, doesn't it? And it's hard- [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=52.84s)]
*  Why does it have to be impartial? It wasn't impartial about Ukraine and Russia. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=57.56s)]
*  And you might say that the- [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=61.2s)]
*  Why does it have to be impartial about? I understand if it's partial about our government [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=63.28s)]
*  and things in this country and everything like that, but something that's going on that [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=67.16s)]
*  far away, why does it- [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=72.16s)]
*  Because the Israeli position is that what is happening in Gaza, and by the way, I'm [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=74.6s)]
*  not here as an advocate of the Israeli government, but the Israeli position is that what is happening [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=78.6s)]
*  in Gaza is a response to the slaughter and capture of innocent Israelis on October the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=82.36s)]
*  7th. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=87.44s)]
*  And that- [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=88.92s)]
*  Which was awful, which was truly awful, but you've also got- [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=89.92s)]
*  And that full context needs to be there when discussing what's going on in the past. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=90.92s)]
*  But that's not the full context, is it? Because the full context starts way before October [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=93.96s)]
*  the 7th, doesn't it? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=98.32s)]
*  It sounds like you think the BBC's in a complete mess on impartiality. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=99.32s)]
*  No, I don't. I don't think the BBC's in a mess. I think the BBC has it. It's very difficult [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  for the BBC. I think the BBC generally does a really good job of it, but it's not always [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=106.36s)]
*  I think facts are the most important thing that they- It's like that old thing, isn't [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=113.96s)]
*  it? If it's raining outside, you don't need someone's opinion to say it's not raining. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  What you want to see is actually what is the weather outside. So I understand why it's [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=124.32s)]
*  so difficult for the BBC, and it really is. And I feel for the people at the top because [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=130.0s)]
*  the amount of lobbying that will be going on and from people with, you know, that aren't [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=136.12s)]
*  very impartial must be immense. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=141.76s)]
*  In the words of the award-winning journalist Richard Sanders, this is absolutely humiliating. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=144.56s)]
*  Amar Rajan, who has presenter on the Today programme, has one of the most powerful jobs [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=149.4s)]
*  in British media, lectured on basic journalism by a man whose job is to talk about football. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=153.96s)]
*  Rajan's comments encapsulate everything that is wrong with the BBC's coverage of Gaza. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=159.48000000000002s)]
*  The BBC doesn't involve identifying two political positions and coming down halfway [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=163.68s)]
*  between them. As Garlick has to point out to him, it's to do with facts. A few things. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=167.88s)]
*  Amar Rajan said the BBC was required to offer context, and that included, to quote him, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=172.84s)]
*  the Israeli position is that what's happening in Gaza is a response to the slaughter and [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  capture of innocent Israelis on October 7th. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=181.84s)]
*  Okay, very straightforward question here. Would he have said Hamas would argue that [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=185.4s)]
*  What happened on 7th October is a response to the slaughter and capture of innocent Palestinians. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=189.48s)]
*  After all, in 2023 alone, prior to 7th October, 240 Palestinians, including more than 40 children, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  had been killed. Thousands and thousands of Palestinians had been killed, for example, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=200.95999999999998s)]
*  between 2008 and 2023. Obviously going beyond that, before that. But we're talking about [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=206.0s)]
*  vast numbers of people. And over the years, tens of thousands of innocent Palestinians [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=211.67999999999998s)]
*  had been detained, kidnapped. Not just those I'm talking about, who put through kangaroo [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=216.8s)]
*  military courts with trials headed by judges who also happen to be Israeli soldiers. But [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=221.24s)]
*  those trials lasting minutes and being conducted in Hebrew, including with confessions signed [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=225.56s)]
*  under pressure and indeed often under torture with reports, indeed testimonies of sexual [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=229.68s)]
*  abuse as well as torture coming from children. As Save the Children revealed in a report [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=236.76000000000002s)]
*  before 7th October, the conviction rate is over 99%. It should be noted that children, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=241.44s)]
*  as I say, are put through these absurd trials because Israel is the only state on earth [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=248.28s)]
*  which routinely tries children in military courts. I'm not just referring to these kangaroo [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=251.76s)]
*  courts, I'm referring to what's called administrative detention, where Israel can [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=256.72s)]
*  detain Palestinians, including children again, without trial or charge. Again, kidnapping [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=260.64s)]
*  them in the middle of the night from their families without them being told what for, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=266.44s)]
*  including then putting them somewhere without the knowledge or their families knowing where [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=271.16s)]
*  they happen to be. So as it happens, Hamas did argue that 7th October was, to paraphrase [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=277.0s)]
*  Amal Rezan, a response to the slaughter and capture of innocent Palestinians. I bet everything [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=283.12s)]
*  I have that Amal Rezan would object to that argument on the grounds that Hamas committed [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=289.04s)]
*  war crimes on 7th October, which no context can justify and therefore that context is [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=294.62s)]
*  taken away and not used as context by the BBC. And so we are back once again at that [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=300.7s)]
*  brilliant adage, nothing can justify 7th October, that everything can be justified by 7th October. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=307.38s)]
*  After all, there's no question that war crimes were committed in 7th October. There [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=314.65999999999997s)]
*  was also no question that Israel's war crimes since are far, far, far deadlier, far, far, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=318.7s)]
*  more destructive, far, far, far more systematic, that they have happened every single day now [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=326.26s)]
*  for 564 days, that they are within the context of an overall crime, which is the illegal [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=331.58s)]
*  occupation of Palestinian land. And these are crimes facilitated by our own governments, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=339.21999999999997s)]
*  which include the British government, which the BBC is supposedly there partly to scrutinise. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=344.21999999999997s)]
*  Now the obvious response to me here is, well, the BBC isn't endorsing Israel's official [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=350.09999999999997s)]
*  position that they're in, it's just offering up its context. No, the BBC is saying that [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=353.74s)]
*  this is a credible and legitimate argument. It does not believe this is a credible and [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=358.94s)]
*  legitimate argument when made by Hamas. That is not offered up equally as context. Now [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=364.66s)]
*  as the former BBC presenter, Krishma Patel, brilliant former journalist, well, she's [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=371.06s)]
*  a current journalist, but former BBC journalist, she resigned from the corporation over Gaza. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=377.46000000000004s)]
*  She put it like this, impartiality has become an excuse for poor journalism, for imposing [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=381.26s)]
*  false balance and washing one's hand of the backbreaking work of following the evidence. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=385.21999999999997s)]
*  I saw this first hand while I was in BBC newsrooms. Controversial story areas, Gaza, migration [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=389.58s)]
*  were subjected to this 50-50 debate format because few were brave enough to reach evidence-based [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=395.7s)]
*  conclusions about what's actually going on and who's culpable. BBC news, it's time [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=399.42s)]
*  to stop hiding behind this neutral observer myth and start doing the work. Gary Lineker [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=403.34s)]
*  The key point Lineker puts here is that famous phrase about journalism. If someone says it's [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=408.9s)]
*  raining and another person says it's dry, it's not your job to quote them both. Your [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=412.97999999999996s)]
*  job is to look out the fucking window and find out what is true. Countless statements [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=416.62s)]
*  of genocidal and criminal intent issued by Israeli leaders and officials not reported [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=421.02s)]
*  on by the BBC, let alone their coverage shaped around these statements as revealing the nature [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=426.58s)]
*  and intent of what Israel is doing. Israeli statements repeatedly treated as credible [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=432.02s)]
*  when the denials and all the rest of it of atrocities despite Israel's long history of [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=438.29999999999995s)]
*  deceit. The horrors of 7th October described as such complete with emotive words like massacre, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=443.02s)]
*  not so with a far, far greater numbers of atrocities committed against Palestinians [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=448.41999999999996s)]
*  since multiple atrocities not even reported on. Far greater weight attached to Israeli [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=451.94s)]
*  life than Palestinian life, Palestinian life barely given any worth. We could go on. As [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=457.02s)]
*  for that comparison made by Lineker as regards Russia and Ukraine, let's just listen to [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=461.74s)]
*  this as an example. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=466.46000000000004s)]
*  Léa Lysak Okay, well, Ina, thank you very much for just [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=467.46000000000004s)]
*  sharing your thoughts and your understanding of what is potentially in that deal. Ina Sofsson [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=470.74s)]
*  joining us from Kiev as Ina was saying, fighting continuing of course, so our thoughts are [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=475.5s)]
*  with you. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=480.5s)]
*  Ina Sofsson So our thoughts are with you. As a BBC presenter [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=481.5s)]
*  ever said this when interviewing a Palestinian in a conflict zone, no. Palestinian guests [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=484.34000000000003s)]
*  instead routinely interrogated and treated practically as though they were in the dock. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=488.54s)]
*  The fact is, the BBC has not stuck to the facts or impartiality. It has airbrushed the [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=493.42s)]
*  genocide and erased the facts. Gary Lineker has told the truth here and has far more journalistic [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=498.38s)]
*  integrity than BBC management. I would know by the way that Gary Lineker was embroiled [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=503.46000000000004s)]
*  in a firestorm back in November 2023 because he shared a clip of my interview with Raz [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=507.5s)]
*  Segal, an Israeli-American associate professor of Holocaust and genocide studies, adding [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=512.1800000000001s)]
*  simply worth 13 minutes of anyone's time. The Times newspaper reported this at the time [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=517.08s)]
*  with the headline BBC staff's anger after Gary Lineker shares Israel-Gaza genocide video. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=523.0s)]
*  One paragraph read as follows, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=528.08s)]
*  The post caused dismay among BBC staff. One raised concerns that it would be bloody awful [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=529.5600000000001s)]
*  for any Jewish colleagues to have to work with Lineker. It's pretty shit for any Jew [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=534.34s)]
*  having to work with quite a few folk here right now, they added. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=538.36s)]
*  Here was a classic example of the absurdity of conflating Israel with Jewish people. Because [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=542.0400000000001s)]
*  what was being argued there is it would be a trauma for Jewish people to work with Gary [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=546.88s)]
*  Lineker because he shared the thoughts of a Jewish-Israeli expert in Holocaust and genocide [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=551.4399999999999s)]
*  studies when discussing the actions of a foreign state. Absolutely preposterous. The truth is, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=557.28s)]
*  actually, so many public figures know a terrible evil has been committed and they have chosen [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsbsNhjipCc&t=563.2s)]
