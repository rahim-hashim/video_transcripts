# Israel INVADES Syria - Western Media And Politicians Complicit
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [December 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE)
*  Israel has invaded Syria in a blatant act of illegal aggression. Why isn't this fact being [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=0.0s)]
*  plastered all over the western media? Why isn't this fact being condemned by western politicians? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=5.92s)]
*  Well, the answer for that speaks for itself. Israel, of course, is treated as being above the law, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  as having total impunity, as being able to behave exactly as it so wishes, invading, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=16.4s)]
*  occupying, annexing, colonising. It's not just invading Syria, it is pummeling Syria with bombs [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=23.759999999999998s)]
*  in an attempt to destroy the potential military capacity of any new Syrian state, clearly treating [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=31.28s)]
*  any new post-Assad government as inevitably hostile to Israeli interests as it is seen by Israel, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  or they are seen by Israel. It's reported that Israeli tanks are up to 16 miles away from the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=44.16s)]
*  Syrian capital Damascus and have certainly gone miles beyond the Golan Heights into a so-called [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=49.44s)]
*  buffer zone patrolled by the UN. The claim made by Israel is that a disengagement agreement signed [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=56.16s)]
*  between the Assad regime and the Israeli state in 1974 has now collapsed. An agreement that should [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  be noted that the Syrian regime has refused to challenge in that half a century. That's despite [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=66.64s)]
*  the fact that the Golan Heights is illegally occupied by the Israeli state. It is Syrian land, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=71.52s)]
*  it belongs to Syria and indeed the Syrian people, and which any new Syrian government [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=78.88s)]
*  should demand is returned to Syria. What Israel is doing is invading Syria for the transparent [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=84.56s)]
*  reason of annexing yet more land. This is their habit. They claim the Israeli state, they need a [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=90.24s)]
*  buffer zone. Then that buffer zone becomes permanently occupied, land they settle, then they [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=95.91999999999999s)]
*  demand yet another further buffer zone to protect what they already stole and then guess what happens [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=100.16s)]
*  then to that buffer zone. You guessed it, the Israeli state steals it, occupies it, de facto [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=105.28s)]
*  annexes it and colonises it. Now what I'm doing is merely stating what international law says, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=109.76s)]
*  which the British state by the way is supposed to abide by, that the Golan Heights are illegally [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=115.04s)]
*  occupied. They belong to Syria. So let's listen with that in mind to Pat McFadden, a key government [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=119.92s)]
*  minister, a key player in the Starmid government. The United States we know has bombed some targets [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=127.44s)]
*  inside Syria over the last 24 hours. Israel has done the same. Where does that leave the UK? Do [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=132.88s)]
*  you fully support the action that they have been taking? What I think Israel is doing is making sure [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=141.44s)]
*  its position in the Golan is secure. One of the things to note about this, this has partly happened [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=145.84s)]
*  because of Israeli action against Iranian proxies around the region and that has left Iran weakened [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=154.64s)]
*  and that is partly why the Assad regime has fallen. So the action that Israel has taken over the last [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=162.4s)]
*  few days will be to make sure that its position in the Golan is secure. So that's supported by the UK? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=167.28s)]
*  We will always support Israel's right to defend itself and make it make itself secure. So what [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=174.16s)]
*  he's doing there is a thumbing up his nose, sticking up his fingers at international law, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=180.16s)]
*  supporting Israel's right to flout international law, to cement its illegal grip over occupied land. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  Even after all that's happened, despite the international criminal court leaving Benjamin [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=191.68s)]
*  Netanyahu a wanted man with an arrest warrant for war crimes and crimes against humanity, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=196.32s)]
*  still framing Israel's behavior as self-defense. What the Israeli state does or says is doubly [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=202.24s)]
*  legally illiterate. Just because a Syrian government has changed doesn't mean the 1974 [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=209.76s)]
*  agreement doesn't still apply. The Syrian state, the Syrian nation still exists. This is simply [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=214.16s)]
*  an excuse for a land grab. Indeed just last month Israel's finance minister Bezelal Smotrich [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=220.16s)]
*  called for Israel's borders to be withdrawn all the way to Damascus. He says it is written that [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=225.92s)]
*  the future of Jerusalem is to expand to Damascus, a greater Israel. Believe them the first time [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=232.4s)]
*  when they tell us who they are. As Sina Tusi, research associate at the National Iranian [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=241.44s)]
*  American Council and senior official at the Center for International Policy puts it, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=246.16s)]
*  Israel is systematically destroying what remains of Syria's military, naval bases, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  warehouses, aircraft, leaving it defenseless for a generation. It seized 235 square meters of [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=254.72s)]
*  Syrian land which he notes is equivalent to 60 percent of Gaza. Yet he says, yet the world and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=260.88s)]
*  Syria's new rulers are silent, a bid for total regional hegemony. Indeed Israel is battering [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=266.48s)]
*  Syria with air strikes. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights they have hit 322 [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=272.72s)]
*  targets since the Assad regime fell on Sunday including warehouses, aircraft squadrons, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=277.52000000000004s)]
*  radars, military signal stations and numerous weapons and ammunition depots. We can see images [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=283.12s)]
*  of some of those air strikes. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=289.28s)]
*  Now we can see a map of entirely unprovoked aggression by the Israeli state against Syria [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=312.4s)]
*  sharing where bombs are being dropped across what is after all a sovereign nation. Now let's [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=317.2s)]
*  quote Omar Al-Shogh. He's a 29 year old Syrian refugee, director for detainee affairs at the [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=323.44s)]
*  Syrian Emergency Task Force. He was first arrested by the Assad regime at an anti-government protest [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=331.84s)]
*  when he was just 15 years old. Arrested seven times. He spent three years in detention suffering [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=337.03999999999996s)]
*  torture every day including electric shocks, beatings with cables, his fingernails removed. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=342.64000000000004s)]
*  Both of his cousins were killed by the regime. He says the international community should [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=349.20000000000005s)]
*  celebrate the fall of Assad regime and simultaneously speak up against the Israeli [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  occupation and expansion in Syria. Syrian weapons are the property of the Syrian people. No one has [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=357.44000000000005s)]
*  the right, inverted quotes, to destroy them but the Syrian people themselves. As the journalist [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=364.40000000000003s)]
*  Murtaza Hussein at the brilliant DropSite News puts it in response to that, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=370.16s)]
*  Israel appears to have deemed the new regime in Syria as hostile and is eliminating its weapons [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=373.52000000000004s)]
*  preemptively in order to zero out even hypothetical capacity to threaten it. That said, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=378.32000000000005s)]
*  obviously Syria will rearm and no attempt was made by Israel to seek a pragmatic relationship. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=384.08000000000004s)]
*  Here's a critical point. Israel has repeatedly bombed Syria under Assad over and over again in [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=389.44s)]
*  fact and the Assad regime did not lift a finger in response despite some trying to present this [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=393.92s)]
*  regime as some anti-imperialist champion of the Palestinian people. To quote the Israeli newspaper [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=399.44s)]
*  Haaretz, not only does Syria not play an active role in the resistance front in quotes but Assad [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=404.32s)]
*  prevented pro-Iranian militias from attacking Israel from its territory and ignored Israel's [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=410.71999999999997s)]
*  airstrikes on Iranian targets in Syria. This past April Mohammed Reza Zahedi, the commander [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=415.2s)]
*  of the Quds force in Syria and Lebanon was assassinated in Lebanon. Of course again an [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=420.96s)]
*  assassination with no Syrian response. That's on top of the Syrian regime slaughtering and [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=427.04s)]
*  imprisoning thousands of Palestinians according to the action group for Palestinians of Syria [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=432.0s)]
*  who now report the release of multiple huge numbers of Palestinian refugees [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=436.16s)]
*  who are imprisoned by Syria's regime being released. Indeed here's an interview just to [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=441.6s)]
*  put everything in context from a few days ago. It's with, I don't even know how to describe this [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=447.76s)]
*  individual. His name is Elihu Yozian. He's a former member of Israeli unit 8200, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=453.84s)]
*  8200 military intelligence. Earlier in the year 8200, sorry military intelligence, earlier in the [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=461.52s)]
*  year he did an interview on Israeli television which he declared Gaza is the enemy. He was making [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=467.52s)]
*  the point that he wasn't Hamas the enemy. He said Gaza is the enemy. He declared Israel needed to [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=471.76s)]
*  level the ground there, kill the largest number possible because he said, and I'm quoting here, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=476.15999999999997s)]
*  the woman there is an enemy, the baby there is an enemy and the first grader is an enemy and the [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=481.12s)]
*  Hamas militant is an enemy and the pregnant woman is an enemy. Going on to say that we see a boy [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=486.08000000000004s)]
*  carrying chocolate in his band yet the same boy will learn how to use a clash n' cov in the first [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=491.12s)]
*  grade. He is a terrorist although he is a boy. Well nice to know what we're dealing with isn't it? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=496.0s)]
*  Here's what he just said a few days ago at Syria. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=502.72s)]
*  Russia and Iran. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=511.04s)]
*  Well this was just before the fall of Assad and it's clearly what the consensus [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=541.04s)]
*  view was for the Israeli state to keep Assad in power in his weakened state because he's a weak [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=552.48s)]
*  enemy. He says a weak enemy serves my interest. No one can guarantee he'll come after Assad's fall. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=557.92s)]
*  It could be an enemy more defiant than the Iranian regime. So he says now I know I have a weak Assad [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=563.28s)]
*  whom I can attack in Syria every so often in coordination with Russia and without any [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=568.5600000000001s)]
*  threats. Now the Turkish foreign minister has released a statement condemning Israel's invasion [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=572.88s)]
*  but Turkey keeps invading Syria as well and is invading right now Syria. The Turkish regime is [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=578.24s)]
*  the enemy of the Kurdish people. It's waged a violent war to suppress their legitimate right [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=585.36s)]
*  to national self-determination. It's waging war at the moment against the Kurdish area of Syria, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=590.72s)]
*  notably Kobani, where the Kurds drove back the advance of ISIS a few years ago. It's of course [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=596.08s)]
*  Turkey, the Turkish state, nurtured Islamist militants who cannot be trusted with Syria's [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=603.0400000000001s)]
*  future. Welcoming the downfall of a brutal dictatorship which is clearly despised by its [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=606.88s)]
*  people who it waged a merciless war against, leveling entire towns and cities in the process [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=612.64s)]
*  does not mean wanting Syria handed to these militants. The Syrian people have the right [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=618.32s)]
*  to national self-determination and freedom not to be a battleground for foreign powers. Yes, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=622.8s)]
*  that includes Russia and Iran and it includes Israel, Turkey and the United States and its allies. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=628.88s)]
*  The Assad regime was no friend of the Palestinian people. The polling of the Palestinian people by [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=634.16s)]
*  Palestinian organizations consistently found that Palestinians hate Assad more than almost any other [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=639.1999999999999s)]
*  foreign leader but Israel is seeking to neutralize the potential threat of a new Syrian government [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=644.88s)]
*  and to initiate yet another land grab to steal land to colonize it as Israel's want, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=650.48s)]
*  all facilitated against again by our western media and our western politicians. We have to hold them [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo4PEC5wTIE&t=656.4s)]
