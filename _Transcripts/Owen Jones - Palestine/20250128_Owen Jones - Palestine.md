# Palestinians Are HOSTAGES, Too: The Truth Covered Up By A Racist Western Media
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg)
*  Palestinians are hostages too. Indeed, there are far more Palestinian hostages than their unjustly [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=0.0s)]
*  imprisoned Israeli counterparts, and the conditions they've suffered are overall much worse. As both [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=6.16s)]
*  Israelis and Palestinians who've been held in protracted captivity are released to their loved [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=11.52s)]
*  ones, this is important to discuss. It's been a time of profound trauma both for those held captive [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=16.72s)]
*  and their families and their friends, and seeing the footage of them being reunited [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  is profoundly moving. What's lacking is moral and political consistency. As ever, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=26.4s)]
*  the coverage in the Western media has been deeply racist, once again stripping away the human worth [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=31.84s)]
*  of Palestinians, be they living or slaughtered. Now, I've come under fire on this question from [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=38.239999999999995s)]
*  apologists for Israel's genocide onslaught who seem to harbour the illusion that they can [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=44.32s)]
*  both be cheerleaders for one of the most obscene crimes of our age and retain some sort of moral [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  high ground. Guess what? You can't. That's because of language I've used to describe the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=54.72s)]
*  exchange agreements which have freed both Palestinians and Israelis who've been held [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=59.68s)]
*  in captivity. Put simply, it's difficult to settle on a pithy description. Many Western media [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=63.36s)]
*  outlets settle on hostage and prisoner exchange agreements, but this erases the fact that many [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=68.64s)]
*  Palestinians are themselves hostages. As I've said from the beginning, the taking of Israeli [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=73.6s)]
*  civilians as hostages by Hamas and other militants was an indefensible war crime. They should never [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  have been taken and they should all be free. Those same human rights apply to the far greater [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=84.08s)]
*  numbers of Palestinians who've had their freedom taken away with no just cause. Indeed, in 2021, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=89.52s)]
*  three Palestinian NGOs estimated that one million Palestinians had been incarcerated since Israel's [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=95.92s)]
*  occupation of the West Bank and Gaza began in 1967. Of those, 50,000 were children and 17,000 were [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=103.2s)]
*  women. Crucially, tens of thousands of Palestinians were subjected to administrative detention [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=112.32s)]
*  before 7th October. What's administrative detention? As the Israeli human rights organisation [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  Bexline puts it, in administrative detention, a person is held without trial without having [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=122.96s)]
*  committed an offence on the grounds that he or she plans to break the law in the future. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=127.6s)]
*  As this measure is supposed to be preventative, it has no time limit. The person is detained [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=132.0s)]
*  without legal proceedings by order of the regional military commander based on classified evidence [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=136.72s)]
*  that is not revealed to them. This leaves the detainees helpless, facing unknown allegations [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  with no way to disprove them, not knowing when they will be released and without being charged, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=146.24s)]
*  tried or convicted. Spending months or years behind bars without being charged or even told [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=150.4s)]
*  what you're accused of. These are hostages. But what are those Palestinians who are convicted? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=157.76s)]
*  Well, most Palestinians stand trial in Israeli military courts. These trials are over in minutes. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=162.72s)]
*  The judges and the prosecution are serving Israeli soldiers. The trials are conducted in Hebrew, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=169.76s)]
*  and the conviction rate is over 99%. These are sham trials. Israeli citizens living in the West [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=176.0s)]
*  Bank, on the other hand, are covered by Israel's civil justice system and are tried in civic courts. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=182.48s)]
*  Welcome to apartheid. As for children, as Shimon Rice watched, put it in 2015, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=188.39999999999998s)]
*  Israeli security forces have used unnecessary force to arrest or detain [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=194.24s)]
*  Palestinian children as young as 11. Security forces have choked children, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=198.24s)]
*  thrown stun grenades at them, beaten them in custody, threatened and interrogated them [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=203.68s)]
*  without the presence of parents or lawyers, and failed to let their parents know their whereabouts. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  In other words, kidnapping. It gets worse. According to a Save the Children report in July 2023, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=213.52s)]
*  months before October 7, child detainees are subjected not only to physical abuse, with 86% [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=220.32s)]
*  reporting being beaten and nearly half injured as they're arrested, including bullet wounds and [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=226.56s)]
*  broken bones. Child detainees reported being sexually abused by Israeli soldiers as well. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  It was estimated at the time that between 500 and 1,000 Palestinian children were held in military [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=239.92s)]
*  detention every year. Israel is the only country on the face of the earth which systematically [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=246.24s)]
*  imprisons children through military courts. The main alleged crime against these children [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=252.72s)]
*  was stone throwing, which carries a prison sentence of up to 20 years for kids. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=258.16s)]
*  As an Amnesty International report into Israel's apartheid in 2022 found, Israel has long used [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=264.48s)]
*  torture against detainees. Indeed, as they noted, a 2000 report by the Israeli state Comptroller [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=269.6s)]
*  found that in the first inter-father between 1988 and 1992, Israel's security agents had used [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=276.24s)]
*  systematic torture against Palestinians and regularly lied about it. That included painful [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=281.59999999999997s)]
*  shackling and binding, immobilization, stress positions, sleep deprivation, the use of threats, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=286.8s)]
*  including against family members, sexual harassment, prolonged and extensive use of [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=291.36s)]
*  solitary confinement. Since 7 October, these heinous practices have only intensified and are [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=295.2s)]
*  much worse. There are more than 300 Palestinian children in Israeli custody, with 112 of them in [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=301.12s)]
*  administrative detention. We don't know the full number of Palestinians held in administrative [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=307.92s)]
*  detention, but by the end of June 2024, the Israeli Prison Service said they had 3,340 [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=313.36s)]
*  Palestinians in administrative detention. Remember, these people are held without charge of trial [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=320.72s)]
*  and have no idea why they're even there. Indeed, Israel is also guilty of the crime against humanity [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=325.76s)]
*  which is the mass, forcible disappearance of civilians. Thousands simply disappeared [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=331.2s)]
*  without their families being told where they are. How are these not hostages? Consider the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=336.4s)]
*  conditions these Palestinian hostages are being subjected to. Consider Sti Teimun, a prison camp [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=342.24s)]
*  with conditions which are gruesome beyond description. According to the Israeli human [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=348.32s)]
*  rights organization, Betselem, the testimonies of Palestinian detainees reveal that Palestinians [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=352.16s)]
*  currently in Israeli prisons are being subjected to harsh arbitrary violence on a frequent basis. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=357.2s)]
*  Sexual assault, humiliation, degradation, deliberate starvation, forced lack of hygiene, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=362.64s)]
*  sleep deprivation, restriction and punishment of religious worship, confiscation of all [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=367.59999999999997s)]
*  grief and personal belongings and denial of adequate medical care. Indeed, Palestinians tied to beds in [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=371.52s)]
*  nappies and then repeatedly beaten up, cases of their genitals being electrocuted. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=376.48s)]
*  Now there's overwhelming documented evidence of rape and gang rape of Palestinian detainees. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=383.92s)]
*  Take Dr Adnan al-Bersh, one of Gaza's most prominent doctors and head of orthopedics at the [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=390.16s)]
*  now destroyed Al-Shifa hospital. According to the Human Rights Watch, other detainees testified [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=395.44s)]
*  that three Israeli soldiers had taken it in turns to rape him with their M16 rifles. It's believed [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=400.72s)]
*  Dr al-Bersh may have died because he was literally raped to death by Israeli soldiers. In another [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=406.4s)]
*  example, Israeli soldiers were filmed gang raping a detainee. Because Israel's authorities feared [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=412.96s)]
*  further arrest, warrants, overtorture and rape, there was a rare attempt to arrest the soldiers [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=418.56s)]
*  responsible which triggered literal riots on the streets of Tel Aviv attended by Israeli ministers [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=423.28s)]
*  who were there literally rioting in support of the right to rape. Just imagine we were discussing [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=428.56s)]
*  this is the treatment of Israeli hostages at the hands of Palestinian militants. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=435.28s)]
*  All of this would just be used to show just the utter barbarism, evil beyond imagination. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=442.24s)]
*  Not so here. I mean it's ludicrous, it's ludicrous, it's absolutely ludicrous. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=449.52s)]
*  I mean this just shows the power of racism, how racism is used in these situations, justifying [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=456.08s)]
*  of course a western ally subjugating an entire people and subjecting them to unimaginable horror [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=463.2s)]
*  in the process. It just shows the power of racism. As soon as the people suffering, literally just [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=469.92s)]
*  limitless barbarism, are not seen as you or I, as like us, people like us, any barbarism can be [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=477.76s)]
*  justified or the outrage has turned off. Even a fraction of this we were discussing were the [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=485.20000000000005s)]
*  hostages taken by Hamas and other militants, which I've said is a serious war crime in its own right [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=493.84000000000003s)]
*  by the way. Just imagine, just imagine the discussion. Indeed, little wonder Gideon Levy, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=498.72s)]
*  the courageous Israeli journalist over a year ago discussed the much worse human conditions suffered [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=506.0s)]
*  by those Palestinians deprived of freedom compared to their Israeli counterparts. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=510.72s)]
*  What they do now to the prisoners is unbelievable. I can almost say in certainty, even though I'm not [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=514.5600000000001s)]
*  sure, that the Palestinian prisoners in Israel get much worse human conditions than the hostages [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=522.24s)]
*  in Gaza. You know, they they hold hundreds of Palestinians, they handcuffed for weeks and months [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=532.08s)]
*  with their eyes covered. I would note the self-proclaimed liberal Zionist, Shial Ben-Efreim, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=542.72s)]
*  who was originally tweeting in support of Israeli soldiers humiliating detainees by [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=547.6s)]
*  parading them, mostly naked in front of cameras, came to change his mind last July, saying he was [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=551.84s)]
*  stupid and ashamed for believing that reporting by the New York Times and CNN on the horrors [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=557.2s)]
*  inflicted against Palestinian detainees were all anti-Semitic lies. As he noted, not only were these [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=561.6s)]
*  detainees subjected to obscene torture, he says, worst of all, many of the people in this facility [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=566.64s)]
*  were innocent, rounded up by accident. Wow, the penny really has dropped. Again, despite his change [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=571.36s)]
*  of heart, continuing to show his naivety there. Now, some will go, some of those detained are [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=577.52s)]
*  Palestinian militants. Absolutely. No question about that at all. There were also Israeli soldiers [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=582.32s)]
*  amongst those who were taken on the 7th of October. In all of these cases, they should be treated as [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=586.88s)]
*  prisoners of war with all the rights that entails. And I note that has not been respected either by [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=590.96s)]
*  those Israeli soldiers who were taken captive and the far greater numbers of Hamas militants. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=597.92s)]
*  But the point is, and this really is the point, Israel has kidnapped Palestinians en masse on an [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=605.52s)]
*  industrial scale. It is right, as I've kept doing, absolutely right to condemn, to have more [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=609.76s)]
*  consistency, to condemn the taking of Israeli hostages. There was no defence. They should all [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=615.6s)]
*  be freed and they should always have been freed. If you are not a racist and you believe that [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=620.5600000000001s)]
*  Palestinian civilians have equal worth to Israeli civilians, then you should support the freeing of [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=626.48s)]
*  the far greater numbers of Palestinian hostages, including children. Indeed, there's more [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=630.88s)]
*  Palestinian children in Israeli custody than the total number of Israeli hostages taken on 7th [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=636.32s)]
*  October. You should also note that the conditions endured by Palestinian hostages are overall much, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=641.36s)]
*  much worse. Indeed, the far worse crimes perpetrated against them that we know about, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=645.76s)]
*  which have been identified. And people go, well, I mean, just even talking about this is going to [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=653.28s)]
*  set outrage off, isn't it? Facts, talking literal facts. I mean, you know, it's absolutely right [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=658.48s)]
*  that firstly, anyone who takes hostages, that's a crime. And any further crimes committed against [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=667.4399999999999s)]
*  those hostages need to be investigated. What we know about is the crimes, the violence perpetrated [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=676.08s)]
*  against innocent Palestinians who haven't been convicted of anything are much worse. And there's [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=685.2s)]
*  many, many more of them. Not just because of the media, because our media is racist. Not even [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=690.32s)]
*  subtly racist. This isn't subtle. Now, all hostages should be released. The failure of the [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flu7xSwsqLg&t=698.1600000000001s)]
