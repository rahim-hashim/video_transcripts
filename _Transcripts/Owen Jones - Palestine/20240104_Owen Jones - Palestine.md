# UK Must Expel Israel's Ambassador
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiWBtSgNkJE)
*  Zippy Hotevelli, she's Israel's ambassador to the United Kingdom and she is quite something.
*  Now she's supposed to be taking to the airwaves, I'd imagine, to do PR for Israel's murderous onslaught
*  against the Palestinian people in an effort to win over public opinion here in Britain.
*  But given her, and let's just call them, astonishing performances, I can only imagine
*  she's doing a better job than most at opening the eyes of the British public to the crimes
*  been committed by the Israeli state against the Palestinian people. But whatever the
*  unintentional consequences of her utterances, there is nothing funny about Zippy Hotevelli.
*  The British government needs to expel her, and immediately. I'll explain why,
*  but let's just listen to her being interviewed on LBC in London to set the scene.
*  And in order to get to this underground tunnel city, those areas must be destroyed. And one of
*  the things we expose to the world after getting into the areas in Gaza that we try to find all
*  those tunnels and underground metro city that Hamas has built, thanks to this great support of
*  Iran, Qatar, the international community, generosity, everything turned to be this horrible
*  terror city. One of the things we realized that every school, every mosque, every second house
*  has an access to tunnel. So this is, and of course, that's an argument for destroying the whole
*  of Gaza, every single building in it. So do you have another solution how to destroy the
*  underground tunnel city that this is the place where the terrorists hide, where they have all
*  their ammunition, and this is the rockets that are still fired on Israeli cities. You know how
*  Israel started its new year, we didn't have fireworks, we had rockets instead of fireworks.
*  So let's just be clear about what she said here. She claims every school, every mosque, every second
*  home has access to tunnels. She's then told by the presenter, that's an argument for destroying the
*  whole of Gaza, every single building in it. And she responds, do you have another solution?
*  Well let's just be clear about that. That is genocidal. Wiping out the whole of Gaza, presenting
*  that as the only choice. As it is, the Wall Street Journal estimates that around 70% of Gaza's homes
*  have been damaged or destroyed in a bombing campaign whose intensity has very few precedents
*  and that's already had a catastrophic death toll. But I don't really need to unpack the consequence
*  do I of wiping out the whole of Gaza which would mean mass death from bombs alone followed by, well,
*  total mass death because Gaza is then rendered inhospitable. This is a genocidal commitment
*  from the Israeli ambassador to the United Kingdom and that is a criminal act. It's a violation of
*  the 1948 convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide to which the United
*  Kingdom and Israel are signatories. Under article 3 it lists five punishable acts. A genocide, B
*  conspiracy to commit genocide, C direct and public incitement to commit genocide, D attempt to commit
*  genocide and E complicity in genocide. Now we could debate E for example complicity in genocide
*  because complicity holds some ambiguity as a term. Having looked into it, it can mean deliberately
*  practical assistance, encouragement or moral support that has a substantial effect on the
*  perpetration of the crime. As for C, direct and public incitement to commit genocide. That is a
*  slam dunk case in this case. Inciting genocide as a criminal act for both the British and Israeli
*  citizen as per the legal obligations of the states they are citizens of and using a public broadcast
*  to advocate for a genocidal act in this case wiping out Gaza should clearly be understood as
*  inciting genocide. Now I hate playing this game of if this was about X there would be no debate but
*  such is the level of dehumanization that is Palestinians are implicitly treated as not being
*  human beings in most of the West. I unfortunately feel compelled. If the prominent representative
*  of the Palestinian people went on national radio and declared there was no choice but to destroy
*  the whole of Israel then there would be no debate about whether it was genocidal and indeed Israel
*  would quite rightly declare such a statement to be genocidal. There is no question about that so as
*  the saying goes case closed. Now as we've been discussing at great length this week on this
*  channel South Africa has filed a case against Israel in the International Court of Justice
*  alleging genocide. This relates to committing genocide but also broader duties to prevent
*  genocide that includes the duty legal duty to prosecute the incitement of genocide as a criminal
*  offense. Let me quote from that case Israel it says is continuing to violate its other fundamental
*  obligations under the genocide convention including by failing to prevent or punish the direct and
*  public incitement to genocide by senior Israeli officials and others. Now there has been a
*  unhinged orgy of genocidal sentiment in Israel from Israeli leaders including the Prime Minister
*  President, members of the Israeli cabinet, the Israeli parliament, Israeli army officials,
*  soldiers on the ground we could go on but what this means under the convention is that is a legal
*  responsibility on the part of Israel in this case to prosecute its ambassador to the United Kingdom
*  Zippy Hotevelli for her direct and public incitement to genocide. Now Britain can't prosecute a foreign
*  ambassador fine but it can expel an ambassador for committing a grave criminal offense one which
*  Britain considers a criminal offense as per its responsibilities as a signatory to the genocide
*  convention of 1948. I would note to her comments on Sky News on 13th of December in which in response
*  to being asked if she rejected a two-state solution she answered the answer is absolutely no.
*  There was a lot of press attention about this at the time but she also said something else
*  which requires comment. She said why are you obsessed with a formula that never worked
*  that created this radical people on the other side. This is that again created this radical people on
*  the other side. What is she talking about here? She means of course the Palestinian people. The
*  reasonable inference here is by radical she means extreme and she is engaging in the dehumanization
*  of the Palestinian people. Extreme and dangerous I would say is the inference because if she means
*  collectively the Palestinian people are extreme in a dangerous fashion she's suggesting as other
*  leading Israeli politicians have said that there were no innocent Palestinians or as some have put
*  it, uninvolved Palestinians. Back in 2015 she also declared we need to return to the basic truth of
*  our rights to this country. This land is ours all of it is ours. We did not come here to apologize
*  for that. She further fleshed that out by declaring between the sea and the Jordan River there needs
*  to be one state only the state of Israel. Now she clearly doesn't support giving Palestinians in
*  Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem democratic rights in this single Israeli state between the
*  river and the sea. So what does she mean? A Palestinian people which continues to just exist
*  there disenfranchised, depressed and therefore inevitably extremely angry as she describes them
*  a radical people permanently though within Israel's de facto borders. Well it stands to reason that is
*  not her long-term plan at all. The Palestinian people for her are unwanted. Now she's also claimed
*  that the 1948 expulsion of Palestinians when Israel was founded the Nakba in which hundreds
*  of thousands of Palestinians were violently driven from their homes was a popular Arab lie. In any
*  case it's clear that Zippy Hotevelli is not only an extremist she has clearly committed a crime
*  under the 1948 genocide convention and therefore she should be removed from British soil. This
*  would have an important impact. It would mean that Israeli leaders and officials currently
*  throwing statements of genocidal intent and incitement around like murderous confetti would
*  be forced to acknowledge there could be consequences because as things stand they're behaving with
*  impunity because they believe quite rationally they will suffer no consequences and therefore
*  they feel emboldened to keep making such statements further radicalizing Israeli society including
*  it should be said Israeli soldiers on the ground. The problem is our political elite keep cavorting
*  around with this extremists. When students correctly protested against her at the London
*  School of Economics in 2021 including Jewish students the then Home Secretary Priti Patel
*  smeared them with accusations of anti-Semitism as did other Tory ministers. Now Labour leader
*  Keir Starmer meanwhile tweeted about the protests at the time this is totally unacceptable intimidation
*  and threats of violence will not be tolerated. This was a totally baseless smear about these
*  protests from the Labour leader. Now on the 19th of November the Labour Muslim Network representing
*  Labour's Muslim members and supporters wrote a letter to Keir Starmer setting out their expectation
*  that no further engagements be made or platforms shared by Labour party representatives
*  with the current Israeli ambassador Zippy Hotevelli. Alas this is an ambassador Keir Starmer has
*  repeatedly met and she has issued warm words about him. The fact is a grave crime has been
*  committed right now a grave crime with the active support of the West that comes in the form of say
*  weapons aid and also political and diplomatic cover. Western politicians not bystanders that
*  actively complicit and involved and Zippy Hotevelli has committed a criminal act on UK soil and it's
*  now time for us to demand her immediate removal. There's a change.org petition demanding this
*  which so far has over 61 000 signatures I'll include the link in the description on social
*  media. Now there's much more to come on this current horror including the case of genocide
*  presented by South Africa against Israel but also so many interviews to come as well as I suppose
*  in-depth looks at the actual truth on the ground that so much of the media is refusing to cover.
