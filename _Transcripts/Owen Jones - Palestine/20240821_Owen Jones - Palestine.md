# Israeli Holocaust Scholar Why Gaza Is Genocide - w. Prof. Omer Bartov
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [August 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDePmAFle4A)
*  One of the most important voices for me throughout this has been Professor Omar
*  Bartov, who is the Samuel Pissar Professor of Holocaust and Jesai Studies at Brown University.
*  I interviewed Professor Bartov many months ago. So much has happened. And I'm afraid to say,
*  when we say so much has happened, what we're talking about is a colossal amount of human
*  suffering. Tens of thousands have been killed, injured, vast amounts of trauma, unspeakable
*  trauma on a daily basis as we speak. Now, he's written a brilliant piece for The Guardian
*  newspaper, which was entitled, as a former IDS soldier and historian of genocide, I was deeply
*  disturbed by my recent visit to Israel. And I've been thinking about this piece since I read it,
*  which was last week, so it was published just over a week ago. A huge amount of moral clarity,
*  of humanity, scholarly, evolution of thought, questioning. So we're going to talk about that
*  and much else. But first, it's great to see you as ever. Thanks for joining us.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  I just want to start just actually by this. You talk basically, in large part, about an
*  evolution of your own thinking, that you'd written in the New York Times last November,
*  that as a historian of genocide, I believe there's no proof that genocide is now taking
*  place in Gaza. Though it's very likely you say war crimes and even crimes against humanity are
*  happening. And then you warn, you say from history, it's important to warn of the potential for
*  genocide, rather than belatedly condemn it after it has taken place. But this following a visit
*  to Israel, and it should be noted, I should make it clear, of course, you're an Israeli-American,
*  you've been convinced that it's no longer possible to deny Israel's engaged in systematic war crimes,
*  crimes against humanity and genocidal ideations. And I think the key central point here is where
*  you write, it is also clearly indicated the ultimate goal of this entire undertaking from
*  the very beginning had been to make the entire Gaza Strip uninhabitable and debilitate its
*  population to such a degree that it would either die out or seek all possible options to flee the
*  territory. That brought to mind to me Giora Ireland, an Israeli general who wrote a piece
*  for Fathom, which is a journal I should say is affiliated to BICOM, the main pro-Israel lobbying
*  organisation in Britain, which was cited in South Africa's case, alleging genocide, in which he
*  set that out as a strategy, stay and starve and die or leave. And he's an advisor to Yo Gallem,
*  the defence minister. Do you think basically that now, that's been the strategy from day one?
*  The starting point is the entire population, we don't want them there and how we get from them
*  being there to not being there, that's where the questions emerge. What do you think?
*  Well, this is really the question and I'm not sure we'll ever know for certain what the plans were
*  and if there were any clear plans at the beginning. My own sense is that judging by the
*  general incompetence of army planning for the separation and the various voices that were
*  raised, I think that there were pressures in one way or another. I think there were people,
*  meaning I don't think that there was a clear plan from the beginning that everybody agreed on,
*  but rather that there were various pressures, including of course the ideas by Yo Gallem.
*  The general idea, I think, was a combination of the goals that they had declared at the beginning,
*  that they wanted to destroy Hamas and to free the hostages and that they wanted revenge and they
*  wanted to flatten as much as Gaza as they could. This is, I think, the general outline that they
*  had, but the operations as they started rolling them out, and I think we talked about it last time,
*  there was a certain tactics that the idea for deuce already in 2014 and that was scaled up
*  to the whole of Gaza rather than to these more limited operation of 2014 and that means that in
*  the areas in which you operate, you first of all destroy them. You destroy them by air bombardment,
*  by shelling, by tank fire, by bulldozers and then you move in the infantry. So if you scale that up
*  to saying I'm going to destroy Hamas entirely, then you are assuming already that you're going
*  to destroy much of the area. Now as they were failing to do that and as Hamas continued to fight,
*  I think increasingly that those who were talking about taking over the whole thing
*  got the upper hand because had the army been more effective, and if had it been able to,
*  and I'm not sure it was, but had it been more effective in accomplishing its goals,
*  maybe there would have been fewer pressures, but since this was not going well
*  and very slowly, I think those pressures built up and you can see that in the kind of policies
*  that are being carried out right now. So a few weeks ago there was a report that the whole northern
*  third of Gaza, and this was a very detailed report with aerial photography and so forth,
*  that whole area has been flattened. Now there there seem to be about 300,000 people there, so
*  most of the people have been kicked out and most of the buildings have been destroyed, universities,
*  houses, schools, a new road has been paved and army camps have been built there, Israeli army camps.
*  Now whether this was the plan at the beginning, I'm not sure, but as it is rolling out, this appears
*  to be the case. So if you try to connect this to the notion of is it a premeditated genocidal plan
*  or not, my own sense is that the whole thing was not premeditated, but that it has become that,
*  and so in that sense my evolving thinking has to do also with the evolving policy on the ground,
*  and that by now conditions are such that if you look back at what has happened you can see
*  that over time this is what the IDF has accomplished, and at some point,
*  and I don't know that we'll ever know at which point, this became by and large the strategy.
*  Now can it work? I'm not sure, but it depends very much on outside pressures,
*  as well as to some extent on internal Israeli politics, but internal Israeli politics right
*  now is at a stalemate and Netanyahu has probably more power now than he did several months ago.
*  Will Barron What you wrote actually
*  brought to mind what the International Criminal Court's Chief Prosecutor wrote in his application
*  for arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Galant for crimes against humanity and war
*  crimes, in which he set out in detail, well, he partly explained what the war crimes and crimes
*  humanity alleged were in service of. One of them was to collectively punish the civilian
*  population of Gaza whom they perceived as a threat to Israel. And I mean if I go back to what
*  on the 9th of October 2023 Major General Ghassan Ali and said, Israeli Army Coordinator, Government
*  Activities and Territories, he said that Hamas became ISIS and the citizens of Gaza are
*  celebrating instead of being horrified. Human animals are dealt with accordingly. Israel has
*  imposed a total locating Gaza, no electricity, no water, just damage. You want to go to hell,
*  you'll get hell. Clearly no demarcation. He means the entire civilian population. That's what he's
*  talking about. Do you think that's what, you know, I mean, could she say whether or not there's a
*  blueprint or not? I mean, and lots of genocide throughout history clearly didn't have blueprints
*  at all at the beginning. That's, I mean, we'll talk about that. But it was that this idea that
*  the population, the civilian population collectively is held actually to be a threat,
*  that you can't demarcate the enemy, military enemy and the civilian population. And that's
*  where Israel starts with and then works backwards. Yeah, so first of all, there were many statements,
*  not only by Ghassan Ali and but many others, of course, at the beginning, that we should wipe
*  them out, that there are no uninvolved people, that everybody is involved somehow. You add to that
*  the sort of rationale that the IDF is trying to sell that, well, they're using the civilian
*  population as human shields. Of course, if you operate in Gaza, there is no other way but to
*  operate from within populated areas, because it's a very small area, very densely populated. So
*  anywhere you operate, there are civilians there. And so if you connect the statements that were
*  being made at the time and the policies that have gradually rolled out, you see a logic there.
*  Whether that logic was there at the beginning or not, as I said before, is a plan.
*  That's not entirely clear. The ICC, the prosecutor was a bit wary of saying that too,
*  and he really focused more on policies of deprivation of food, of hunger,
*  because it was easier to prove that. Now, generally speaking, I think you're totally
*  right, that is, generally speaking, the problem, as it is seen by Israeli policymakers and the
*  military, is that Gaza is an area that is full of densely populated by Palestinians, mostly by
*  refugees, and that it is from that mass of population that, as Israeli policy makers see it,
*  violence emanates toward Israel. And how do you solve that issue? Now, obviously, there are two
*  ways, generally speaking, of doing that. One is political. That is, you have to find some way
*  of living side by side. The other is military. And if it's military, the military has not been
*  able to resolve that. And this is not something that started this year or last year or in 2014.
*  This goes back, as I write in this piece, at least to 1956. That is that most of the Palestinians
*  living in Gaza, mostly descendants of Palestinians, would live very close to Gaza in towns and villages
*  in southern Israel, what is now southern Israel, northern Negev, southern Israel.
*  And so if you don't find a political solution to this, you have to find a military solution to this.
*  And that military solution can be either to fence them in, which is what Israel has been trying to
*  do, and all this attempt by Netanyahu for years to bribe Hamas, in a sense, to have money go to Hamas
*  from Qatar so that Hamas could run the business in Gaza. And he could say that he cannot negotiate
*  with Hamas because they are so radical. And of course, he can't negotiate with the people in the
*  West Bank because they're so ineffective, and therefore we can just manage things.
*  That kind of policy failed on October 7th. And so if you can't manage it and you don't want to
*  politically resolve it, what is left? What is left is some kind of destruction. You have to flatten it,
*  you have to debilitate the population, and if you can, you have to push it out. So the logic of this
*  has always been there. And it's based on the Israeli decision, which is not only by
*  people like Netanyahu, he goes way back. He goes to people like Dayan, Moshe Dayan in the 1950s.
*  We cannot reverse things. We took over their land, and they know it, and they will keep fighting us.
*  And then the question is, do we have a political solution to this or a military one?
*  And from the 1950s, the answer is a military one. And that's how you get to where you are now. There
*  are moments where there were attempts to handle this differently, including Moshe Dayan himself,
*  of course, at some point in his life, and then under Rabin during the 1990s, the first half of
*  the 1990s. But if those go away, then what's left is the military. And you have to use the
*  military against a civilian population because Hamas is an expression. It's a very radical
*  expression, but it is an expression of a will by a population to resist. One can say clearly Hamas
*  is not very popular in Gaza right now. But whatever happens, if the population stays there,
*  if Hamas goes away, then something else will appear there. The issue will not go away,
*  as long as there is no political solution to it.
*  So just because about your position now, I mean, as you wrote in the piece, you spoke about the
*  rhetoric spouted by Israeli leaders since 7 October now being translated into reality.
*  So the point was that that rhetoric was genocide, but that didn't mean
*  genocide was inevitable. That was a possibility, and you were warning against it. But you said now
*  that's been translated into reality, namely as the 1948 UN Genocide Convention puts it,
*  that Israel was acting with intent to destroy in whole or in part the Palestinian people in Gaza,
*  such as by killing, causing serious harm, inflicting conditions of life meant to bring about the
*  grief destruction. So just to be clear, is that where we're at? This is a genocide which is ongoing
*  as we speak. Is that your clear position? Yeah. I mean, I think we can't, as I write that, I mean,
*  I've tried to be as careful as I can, or as I could, to not jump to conclusions.
*  I think by now, we can say that there was genocide or rhetoric at the beginning,
*  and now there are actions on the ground. And I dated my own evolving thinking to May 8,
*  because on May 8, the IDF moved into Rafah, and it was asked not to do so by the Americans.
*  And they did so anyway, and they triumphantly said that the Americans had told them that they
*  can't move in because there's so many civilians there. And they said, no, no, no, we can move the
*  civilians. And they triumphantly said, yes, we did. We succeeded in moving them. And indeed,
*  they moved 800,000 people, so moved them. I mean, they evicted them from Rafah, and they moved into
*  the coastal area. Now, for many of these civilians, this was the second or third or fourth time that
*  they'd been displaced. And they were moved into an area that had been a very, very, very, very
*  very, very, very large area that has no infrastructure. And so the population now has been
*  shuttled around again and again and again. The humanitarian conditions there are absolutely
*  appalling. There's now more and more just the other day they identified polio there.
*  IDF troops have been inoculated for polio, but what about the population there?
*  What appears to be the case is that the population is being gradually debilitated. That is, it is
*  being brought to a situation where its own life, its own existence is being made impossible. These
*  are conditions that assure the weakening massive death of the population, which will then lead it
*  to die out there in large numbers or to flee. And that's what the UN resolution on, convention on
*  genocide, calls genocide. Now, the one thing that remains, and that's why I sort of spoke about
*  genocidal actions. Now, admittedly, it's a bit of a cop-out to say genocidal actions, because what
*  are genocidal actions? They're actions of genocide. But the one thing that remains and may never be
*  clear, and the ICJ, the International Court of Justice, may also leave it open, is whether there
*  was a premeditated plan to do that or whether this was an evolving kind of operation that ended up
*  doing, carrying out these genocidal actions. I have to say that historically,
*  that's what happens in most genocides, including in the Holocaust. There was no, in 1939, there was
*  no premeditated plan to kill all the Jews of Europe. It was an evolving policy, incremental.
*  1941, wasn't it? Yeah, the Vansi Conference. Yes, but even that, I mean, you probably don't want
*  to get into that, but the Vansi Conference is also problematic because the killing actually
*  begins before, and what the Vansi Conference says would be the policy is actually not the policy
*  that is eventually carried out. So, you know, it's more about coordinating state agencies than
*  rolling out a particular clear plan. So genocides are usually like that. But if you can show that
*  there was an intention at some point, and that is what is expressed in the Vansi Conference, yes,
*  to kill 11 million Jews in Europe, that is stated clearly in Vansi. If you can show that there is an
*  intention at the beginning, at some point, maybe October 8th, maybe two months later, we just have
*  to kick them out, or we have to take over the whole territory and make life impossible for them,
*  then it would be easier to say, yes, this is strictly speaking genocide. If not, and I suspect
*  that it'll be probably, it's unlikely that this will be found, in part because I think it's unlikely
*  that such orders actually went out, that there's anything in writing like that. Then we will be
*  able to say this was a genocidal operation which led or attempted to create a situation where
*  Palestinians would either leave or be completely debilitated. And this is what has happened up to
*  now. Reports are absolutely devastating. And it's not clear to me, even if all of this were to stop
*  right now, what will happen to the population? It'll take decades to recover. The long-term effects
*  are enormous. And as you saw in the Lancet report, the expected death rate is much, much higher
*  than the 40,000 that we're talking about now. Because we know from precedence that the vast
*  majority of people actually end up dying because of indirect causes rather than violence.
*  I mean, just on that, in terms of, you say, in terms of things being written down, it's striking
*  that last month there was a report in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz that Benjamin Netanyahu ordered
*  the Israeli army to turn off recordings of meetings, that it was normally an automatic operation.
*  But immediately after 7th of October, he ordered the recordings to be turned off and the army
*  complied with that order. Yeah, look, I mean, Netanyahu, again, he's, partly it's so that we
*  don't have a record of operations, but partly it's Netanyahu's own paranoia, because Netanyahu
*  basically would like to erase the record of all his major errors, or what led to the fiasco of
*  October 7th and the fiasco that has been happening ever since. We have to say that while on the one
*  hand, and that's the most important issue, of course, Israel has been conducting a war of
*  destruction in Gaza, the situation of his own citizens, of the people that he is supposed to be
*  to care for, that is of Israeli citizens, has greatly deteriorated since October 7th.
*  There are tens of thousands of displaced people that thousands and thousands of reservists being
*  called up again and again, and then when they come home, they have no jobs, they have no businesses,
*  the state is not supporting them. People are now being forced, people being displaced and
*  are being forced by the government to go back to their homes, which have been destroyed and are
*  unsafe, because the government doesn't want to pay for it anymore. And that's quite apart from,
*  of course, talking about what's happening in the north. So Netanyahu doesn't want to have any record
*  of anything because his government is both incompetent and has a particular interest,
*  and its interest is not the interest of most of the citizens of the state. Its interest is both
*  gradual ethnic cleansing in the West Bank and the destruction of Gaza, and to the extent that it's
*  possible, and it looks like he's succeeding in that, to perpetuate Netanyahu in power for the
*  foreseeable future. Just because we started talking there, just about the historical context,
*  and this is what I wanted to do. One of the things I want to talk to you as one of the world's
*  preeminent experts on genocide, of course, which is, do you think that cheerleaders for this
*  horror have benefited somewhat from a kind of widespread ignorance about genocide in its history,
*  in that the Holocaust is often people's main reference point? And I'm putting this to you
*  as a question. The Holocaust is an outlier in many ways. That was the industrialized,
*  systematic extermination of the Jewish people in a very short period of time, the attempt
*  across borders to seek out every last Jewish person and murder them.
*  If we look at other genocides, take Rwanda, there you had an armed conflict, where, for example,
*  if you were going to be, I mean, this would be a completely misleading historical narrative,
*  but you could say, well, this all began in 1990, when the Tutsi rebel army, the random patriotic
*  front invaded from Uganda and committed many terrible war crimes. When they did, they killed
*  hundreds of civilians accused of rape, and actually went on to kill huge numbers of Hutu civilians.
*  It was said by Hutu extremists that they're going to commit genocide against us. It was
*  posed as an existential threat, which is we either kill them or they're going to kill us.
*  With the Nazis, that had to be invented. I mean, it was the idea that the Bolsheviks are all Jewish,
*  there's a Jewish conspiracy, and they're going to kill us. They're going to destroy Western
*  civilization. But do you think that's what people don't often understand, that genocides often arise
*  where you have conflicts, where you actually have atrocities not just perpetrated on one side,
*  and those other atrocities are then used to justify genocide law and law, because that is
*  what happened in Rwanda? Well, look, I mean, there are two issues here. The one that you mentioned
*  obviously is correct, and many people have pointed out, that is that when people talk about genocide,
*  and when they talk about international laws, it was created after World War II,
*  and the Genocide Convention, there's a predilection to compare whatever happens to the
*  Holocaust, and if it's not, so to speak, as bad as the Holocaust, not as systematic, not the
*  numbers are not as high, then you say, well, it's not exactly genocide, maybe it's something
*  not as big. And that's of course an error, and if you look at the Genocide Convention itself,
*  that's not at all what it says. But there is a tendency to grasp the genocide at the term
*  because it describes such, it evokes such extreme evil, and that's used by everyone. So,
*  you know, in Israel after October 7th, the argument was that Hamas tried to
*  carry out genocide against Israel, and this was just like the Holocaust,
*  and people who opposed Israeli policies from the very beginning, it has to be admitted, said,
*  oh, this is genocide of the Palestinians. And so people just go directly to that term because then
*  you don't have to explain anything anymore. So that's true, and that's a problem with the term,
*  and many people have pointed it out. I still think it is an important term, but I tried to use it as
*  carefully as possible, and I think people should. And the second question is different,
*  I would say. The second question is, how do we, when we talk about genocide, how do people explain
*  to themselves what they're doing? And I would say that in all genocides, including the Holocaust,
*  including Rwanda, including the genocide of the Herero in 1904, the genocide of the Aminis in 1915,
*  Campuchia in 1975, in all those cases, the people carrying out the killing
*  see themselves as victims. They see themselves as victims of the people they are killing,
*  and they also imagine that if they don't kill those people, and especially because of the manner
*  in which they're killing them, then those people who are now their victims will turn around and
*  victimize them and do to them what is being done on them. And so in that sense, genocide is often
*  a cycle of perception or reality, and it's not necessarily different of victimization.
*  The second thing is that in all genocides that I can think of in the 20th century and in the 21st
*  century now, there is either a reality or a semblance of war. This is created under war-like
*  conditions. And again, you can go through all the genocides that I mentioned. The Germans come in
*  1904 to German Southwest Africa, now Namibia, with an army. They're going to quell an uprising. It's
*  a war. And they issue a vernichtungsbefehl, an extermination order, this General von Trotter,
*  the German general. The Ottomans in 1915, they're in a war. And they're saying the Amin is a
*  collaborating with the Russians who are invading us from the east. The Germans, of course, see
*  themselves in a war. They're fighting a war against the Jews. They keep saying the Jews are the
*  partisans, not only in 1918 when they, so to speak, stabbed us in the back, but during, in 1941, the
*  partisans and the Jews. Hitler says to Himmler, treat them like partisans. And partisans, of course,
*  have to be executed because they are not regular forces. And so there's always a semblance of war.
*  And the people carrying out the killing are usually wearing uniforms, usually under army control or
*  police control, and usually perceive themselves not as murderers, but as soldiers, as soldiers
*  fighting to protect their own people. So in that sense, modern genocide is very much built
*  around this notion, first, of victimization, and secondly, of a general kind of military
*  confrontation. And the people being killed, even though they may be babies, old people, pregnant
*  women, are somehow perceived as connected to the enemy who will destroy us if we don't destroy them.
*  It makes me think, actually, I was in Serbia last week interviewing Russian dissidents who often go
*  to Serbia for these reasons. And interesting because, of course, Serbs were victims of genocide
*  in World War II at the hands of the Croatian Ustashy, who was so vicious the Nazis often
*  thought they were out of control. And, of course, you know, the Serb civilians, thousands were killed
*  in the Balkan Wars of the 90s. And this Russian dissident told me that on a recent ruling over
*  Srebrenica, which was just to be genocide, on one of the tallest towers in Belgrade, the capital,
*  they put a big neon sign rotating saying, we are not a genocidal people. I just thought there's
*  some, I mean, I thought there was always some parallels. It's quite interesting, actually, that
*  Ariel Sharon, the former prime minister of Israel, was himself quite sympathetic to Bosnia,
*  to some nationalism. But it's that sense of victim, we are victims. And there was the basis,
*  it's not untrue, but that was then used to justify heinous atrocities. But still, there was a
*  self-perception of victimhood. Well, you know, I mean, one sort of funny item is that both
*  two major Israeli chiefs of staff, Bar Lev and Elazar, who was the chief of staff in 1973,
*  came from Montenegro and had sort of own family history with that region. During the war in the
*  1990s in the former Yugoslavia, Israeli sentiments were very much on the side of the Serbs.
*  And that was because people remembered Tito and the partisans fighting against the Nazis. And this
*  was one of the major sort of insurgencies against the Nazis. People didn't know very well that
*  during the Nazi occupation of Serbia, the Germans killed, first of all, all the
*  Jewish Serb men very quickly because they used them as hostages. There were partisan actions against
*  the German army. The Germans started taking hostages and killing them. That only increased
*  the resistance against the Wehrmacht. And so the Germans, by now they had quotas that they had to
*  kill 100 Serb men for every German soldier killed, but it was not very effective. So they said,
*  well, maybe we can square the circle and kill Jewish men
*  because then the Serbs won't really care and we will fill the quota. And so they killed 7,000
*  Jewish males. And then they enclosed the women and children in camps. And they thought, what are we
*  going to do with them? They're now in these camps just north of Belgrade. And they brought a gas van
*  and drove those people, thousands of them, through Belgrade in gas vans as they were dying
*  to be then buried because they were dead by the time they got to the other side of the city to
*  be buried on the other side of Belgrade. And the population, of course, could hear everything that
*  was going on. So this kind of memory that existed in Israel that, yes, the Serbs were fighting on
*  our side because they were fighting the Germans where the Croats were not only killing Serbs,
*  they were collaborating with the Nazis and killing Jews, was itself kind of rosy. But it's
*  interesting that in Israel there was very strong support for Serbia, probably the only country
*  associated with the West that was supportive of Serbia because of these memories. And you know,
*  the interesting thing about that war is that all those names of the Ustasha and
*  the organizations of World War II resurfaced during the war in the former Yugoslavia. So these
*  long memories of victimization, one of the other came out. There's actually a movie about that
*  called Underground by Kusturica that is precisely about how these memories of World War II
*  resurface and become the sort of leitmotif of the war in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s.
*  That's really, really fascinating by the way, really fascinating context.
*  I was just interested because of your trip to Israel about the resign, the kind of general
*  mentality and you went there to do a talk and you were kind of barracked by protesters who targeted
*  the talk you were doing very angrily. And I'm interested in this because in states which are
*  committing atrocities in which there is widespread consent and acquiescence, which is something that
*  needs to be understood because in any society the number of people are sociopaths is tiny,
*  it's 2%. So what we're talking about are people who are loving, who grieve, who have their hearts
*  broken, who have fears, anxieties, who would see someone suffering in the street and want to help
*  them and how because of dehumanization that makes them acquiesce or actively supportive of atrocities.
*  And you watch Israeli television, you get people debating, killing children on the basis that they
*  end up being terror, you know, just kind of you look at it and think what has happened.
*  But I'm just interested in what your thoughts are, how that mentality, how it can become so widespread.
*  Because I interview and I use this channel intentionally to interview extremely courageous Israeli
*  citizens who are standing up and they are so courageous because they're so isolated.
*  You look at the polling, it's bleak, 60% oppose all humanitarian aid, which just means everyone dying.
*  And Jewish Israelis are divided between thinking not enough firepower has been used
*  or just enough has been used with 2% saying too much has been used. And you look at that and think
*  how is this possible? So I'm just interested in what you think about that because sometimes there's
*  a sense of, well, they're not seeing what's really happening. But I don't know, I just think
*  everyone's got the internet, you know, it's not like this is all on a lot of stuff, the terrible
*  stuff's not on, it's not like you watch it on British television, you see on the internet.
*  What's your thoughts? What's happening? And what can we learn from that?
*  Well, you know, the first thing I would say, just statistically,
*  is that up to now, in 10 months, the IDF has killed at least 2% of the population of Gaza.
*  We don't know exactly how it breaks down to fighters and non-fighters, but the majority are
*  civilians and the majority of the civilians are children. 2% of the population in 10 months is
*  enormous. So we have to take that into account. There's only one other case in which 2% of the
*  population were killed and that's in Syria, but it took in the 21st century, but it took 13 years.
*  And here it's been done in 10 months. How does the Israeli public, why does it behave in this way?
*  Look, there was an interesting, of course, one more horrifying case that apparently an
*  errant Hezbollah missile hit a Druze village and killed 12 children who were in a playground.
*  And in Israel, although these are Druze and they're Syrian Druze, I don't know how many of them
*  were Israeli citizens because there's a kind of conflict there whether to become Israeli citizens
*  or not. The public was completely appalled, the killing of 12 children, and there was a lot of
*  talk about that and that Israel must strike back. And of course, the Druze community was very angry
*  and asked for revenge against that. And when you mention the dying the same day, in fact, more than
*  that, larger numbers of children were being killed that very day in Gaza and nobody even talked about
*  it. So what I'm saying is that these kind of situations create actually, at least for a while,
*  a sense of solidarity in your own group and people feel very sentimental. They feel that they care
*  for each other, they volunteer to help each other, they feel morally elevated because they
*  are now helping each other in a situation of war, of violence, of threat, of insecurity.
*  And that sense of solidarity can translate also into total blocking off of the other side,
*  of not thinking about it at all. Yes, Israelis can, of course, watch exactly what's going on in Gaza.
*  Most of them don't. It's not broadcast on Israeli TV, as you know, of course. You see Gaza only
*  through the gun sights of Israeli soldiers. But it's easy to get that information. Most people don't
*  want to get it. And when you raise it with them, as I was writing, and literally people's eyes glaze
*  over, they just want to change the subject. And that's if they don't really get angry at you.
*  You know, that's among liberals whose eyes glaze over. If it's people from the right, they will get
*  very angry at you and say, all those people are involved. They all cheered when our women were
*  raped and so forth. Now, is that rare? It's not rare. I mean, we've seen it in many other places.
*  There wasn't that much, there was a little bit, but not much resistance to the bombing of open
*  German cities by the RAF in World War II. Most people, you know, they cared about the blitz.
*  But when the RAF was burning people alive in German cities, people thought it was fine.
*  So in war you have that. But in Israel, there's a much longer process of dehumanizing Palestinians.
*  And that's something that I think now has sort of surfaced much more clearly. So people never
*  really cared much about what was happening to Palestinians. People lived for decades in
*  Gaza. People lived for decades right next to the fence of Gaza and right next to the war,
*  the so-called security barrier of the West Bank. And their own children, husbands, grandchildren
*  were patrolling those places, were breaking into people's homes. And they were completely
*  indifferent to it. They thought this can be managed. What Israelis saw as being managed for the
*  people upon whom this kind of policy was being implemented, it was dehumanizing, brutalizing.
*  And this was not seen at all in Israel when you raise the question of the occupation.
*  In Israel, even during the protests against the judicial coup, the Jewish people were
*  in the months leading to October 7th, between February and October 2023, if you raise the
*  question of occupation, most people among the protesters said that's not the issue.
*  We don't have time for that now. We have to protect our own rights that the government is
*  trying to take away from us. And so after October 7th, with the horror of what happened that day,
*  and it was pretty horrific, there have been exaggerations which are totally unnecessary.
*  And I don't know why they had to be recycled. But the event itself was a massacre of hundreds and
*  hundreds of civilians. With that, coming on top of a general dehumanization of Palestinians,
*  I think explains why people in Israel are so totally indifferent to what is being done in
*  their name and often by their own children in Gaza. A couple of final things linked together,
*  really. Firstly, just the role of Western states, because there is something quite unique about this,
*  in that to have what is a crime of this scale. And you mentioned, even if we go by the, I mean,
*  I would regard the official death toll as, for the reasons often explained, 40,000 is
*  a drastic underestimate. They exclude those buried under rubble thousands. They exclude indirect
*  deaths. I mean, if every single hospital in Britain and the United States was suddenly destroyed
*  without a war, that would mean a massive death, a huge death sentence imposed on vast numbers of
*  people. It's a war and the hospital system's been destroyed. Cancer patients, people with
*  health conditions, diabetes, we could go through the list. Just the general stress imposed,
*  people who are elderly and firm. I mean, it's just endless. Hunger, illness, spreading, polio at the
*  moment, as well as the reporting systems broken down. So even then, with 40,000, as you know,
*  you mentioned Syria, that's 2% over 13 years. Iraq, 1% over 20 years. Yugoslavia, 1% over 10.
*  I mean, it's a hideous total. I mean, it just seems, I mean, the wig history of history was
*  buried on the Somme and in Auschwitz-Birkenau, with the idea of history just becomes more
*  enlightened and progressive and all the rest of it. But isn't it just, what's your thoughts about
*  this? It's 2024 and we have Western states, including a government, the Democrats, in the
*  United States, and they have armed and supported with, and the difference with previous occasions
*  is this is live streamed. I mean, Palestinian journalists, the biggest slaughter of journalists
*  in history, so it's huge cost. They posted these atrocities all the time on a daily basis. It's
*  one of the most evidenced crimes in history. What does this tell us? I don't know. I'm just trying
*  to, that was a long way. I mean, I'm not trying to work out what I mean by this, but you know what
*  I mean? I mean, it's just the scale of the crime and the scale of Western complicity.
*  There's something, that is quite unique, isn't it, given where we're at?
*  Look, I mean, first of all, it's obviously, as you say, it's extremely depressing to think that we
*  are now, you know, quarter of the way into the 21st century. The century began, it was supposed
*  to be the end of history, you know, was supposed to be a much better time. And the case in Gaza,
*  I can think of various other situations that we're in now, where people seem to have entirely
*  forgotten the lessons of the 20th century, just the rise of populism, of extremism, of racism.
*  But this is a particularly horrific case, as you say, it's being broadcast live. It's being
*  broadcast live, and yet at the same time, it's not. That is, there are very few people on the ground
*  from other organizations, so it's being broadcast live largely by Al Jazeera, which is taking also
*  an extremely heavy toll on lives. So we can sort of get into a very
*  depressing conversation about where humanity is going and how international law has been shown
*  to be useless, and the international order is just allowing this to happen. And I think,
*  in part, you can say that, but I prefer to think about it differently,
*  maybe because I don't just want to get into this doomsday kind of mood. My sense is that
*  things could have worked out differently, and that even now, despite the terrible price
*  that is being paid, things can be not simply turned around, but actually can lead to
*  some kind of resolution of an extremely long-term crisis. So let me say first, I think that if
*  President Biden in November or December 2023 had actually acted differently after hugging
*  Nathaniel and all that, had said to Nathaniel, listen, you have to stop fire now, and if you
*  don't, you're on your own. You can do whatever you like, but you're not going to get political
*  coverage, diplomatic coverage, and you're not going to get the stream of shells and bombs and
*  all of that. Then we would not have been where we are, which is that the United States now is
*  trying desperately to prevent a regional war. Nobody knows where that war might go. I mean,
*  what we're seeing now can be just peanuts compared to what will happen. And nobody wants it. It's not
*  that Iran actually wants it. It's not that Hezbollah actually wants it. It's not that the IDF wants it,
*  but the trajectory of the ground and a number of bad actors, the worst of whom right now is
*  Nathaniel, seem to want it and may lead to it. But there was a way to prevent it. It was not taken.
*  So it isn't just a kind of determinism. It had to do with particular decisions and wrong decision
*  being made at that time. But I would say that even now, it is possible to change this trajectory
*  entirely. Now, it won't bring people back to life. And the destruction that we spoke about in Gaza is
*  a generations long event now. And the effect that this will have on the population, on the children,
*  is unimaginable. But in terms of politics, there is another way. And one has to say that what we saw
*  now is the limits of power, that nobody can win this conflict. Israel cannot win this conflict.
*  The Palestinians cannot win this conflict. Iran cannot win this. Nobody can win. And if you
*  finally reach the conclusion that you cannot win militarily, you have to find a political way out
*  of it. One should have thought about it from the beginning, that wars have to be led by politics,
*  not the other way around. But now, I think that many Israelis realize that the limits of their
*  own power, the more Israel is fighting this war, the weaker it is getting by the day. It's getting
*  weaker politically, and it's getting weaker militarily. And so there may be some hope. It's
*  possible that it will go the other way around. It's possible that Israel will become an apartheid,
*  pariah state, living on its sword, increasingly isolated. And it could last like that for several
*  decades before it implodes. But one has to hope that it will be helped from within and from without
*  to reach a different goal that many people in the region would like to see. The fact that it hasn't
*  happened is in part also a failure, obviously, of Israeli leadership, also Palestinian leadership,
*  but also of international leadership. And one would hope that internationally, whatever else
*  we have to say about them for their own national interests will act differently and enforce a
*  different kind of resolution to this ongoing catastrophe. Well, maybe a slightly hopeful or
*  not as depressing place to end as it could have been, given everything. Again, always an honor,
*  a masterclass as ever. Your clarity, your moral clarity, academic clarity shine through as ever.
