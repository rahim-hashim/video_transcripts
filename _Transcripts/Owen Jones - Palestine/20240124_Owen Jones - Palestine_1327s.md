Video Description: It’s called ‘pinkwashing’ - the use of LGBTQ+ rights to justify Israel’s brutal oppression of the Palestinian people.

Whether you’re straight or LGBTQ+, you need to hear why this argument is based on outrageous lies - and why it has nothing to do with freeing LGBTQ+ people at all.

# How Israel Abuses Queer Rights To Justify Oppressing Palestine
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU9dbWQDa9Q)
*  Those responsible for inflicting terrible human suffering and those who defend it will use any
*  means to justify it, no matter how grotesque. Now that's why this matters. Regardless of your
*  sexuality or your gender identity, I want the straights and the queers alike to hear this and
*  I think you're going to be surprised by a lot of what you hear. Now we need to talk about pink
*  washing or the use of LGBTQ people and their rights to justify Israel's brutal oppression
*  of the Palestinian people. That is ethnic cleansing and illegal belligerent occupation,
*  which is the longest in modern history. A siege, which is also the longest in modern history.
*  Illegal colonisation, land theft, those settlements, apartheid as international and Israeli
*  human rights groups have defined it. Brutal mass incarceration without charge, torture,
*  mass extrajudicial killings. We could go on. And in the here and now, of course,
*  the mass slaughter of Gaza combined with an all out war on the conditions which sustain life,
*  combined with genocide or rhetoric from the top down, which has led to South Africa hauling Israel
*  before the International Court of Justice to face the charge of genocide. Now LGBTQ people
*  and their rights have repeatedly been used by Israel and its apologists to justify its crimes.
*  This is known as pink washing. Israel knows that in the Western countries, which provide it with
*  weapons and support, it's those with progressive politics who are most likely to oppose injustices
*  such as the oppression of Palestinians. And it also knows that the same progressives disproportionately
*  care a great deal about LGBTQ rights. So here's a way of sowing division and confusion among that
*  camp or even winning the support of some self-described progressives. Now it should be
*  said that Israel itself is a relative newcomer to LGBTQ rights. It legalized homosexuality in
*  1988 by repealing the law criminalizing same sex relations, which was imposed by the British
*  Empire when it ruled Palestine back in 1936. Now same sex marriage is still illegal in Israel for
*  that matter, so what interfaith marriages, but clearly LGBTQ rights for most Israeli citizens
*  are far better in Israel than most other countries in the region. And Tel Aviv Pride in particular
*  is used to showcase Israel as a beacon of LGBTQ rights. Now some important points to begin with.
*  I'm a passionate advocate of LGBTQ rights as an LGBTQ person. I want all LGBTQ people to live
*  happy, secure, free lives, liberated from oppression, persecution, rejection, fear, stigma,
*  and abuse, and violence, and the grinding misery of the closet. That isn't to say that I regard
*  the oppression of LGBTQ people as the only form of oppression that matters.
*  Vitally important though, of course it is. There are those I call oppression nimbies. Nimbies standing
*  for not in my backyard. That's those who only care about oppression when it impacts their particular
*  characteristic and frankly to hell with everybody else. Now that itself doesn't even make sense on
*  its own terms because LGBTQ people everywhere do not necessarily only suffer oppression and
*  need violence because they're LGBTQ. Far, far from it. That's even true in countries like the
*  one I'm from, the UK. There's a massive gap in lived experience between me, a gay man who's white,
*  middle class, cis, that is my gender identity corresponds with that assigned at birth,
*  and say a working class black gay man. I might get a lot of homophobic abuse online. I've suffered
*  street level threats and homophobic violence or linked to my public platform as an openly gay man,
*  but I don't suffer the systemic form of oppression a black gay man may suffer because of police
*  harassment, racist persecution by the justice system, discrimination in terms of jobs, education,
*  the provision of housing and other goods and services, high rates of poverty. We could go on
*  and that's without even discussing the racist and homophobic abuse they may receive as well. Now in
*  fact I would never dream of comparing anything I've gone through with that experience. There's a chasm
*  separating us. Now a queer person is not just a queer person. There can be many other things too
*  and suffer oppression accordingly and that's an important principle so let's keep it in mind.
*  Another important principle to keep in mind is unconditional solidarity. I object to the oppression
*  of and violence against civilians, whoever they are and whatever they think. If I saw someone
*  suffering a racist attack in the streets I wouldn't whip out a questionnaire and ask the victim as
*  they're being bludgeoned to death to tell me their views and a whole range of social issues
*  before I decide whether or not to help them. Again that is an important principle to remember
*  and extrapolate. Being part of a minority which suffers oppression should make you want to have
*  empathy and stand with others who suffer oppression though tragically alas it does not. There are so
*  many tragic examples to the contrary. The oppression of LGBTQ people can be used to justify
*  the horrific oppression of other groups even those groups which obviously include LGBTQ people as
*  well. Now pinkwashing is part of a long-standing western colonial tradition of claiming the west's
*  civilized advantages if you like as justifications to oppress and colonize those they portray as
*  uncivilized and thus deserving of being oppressed. As much as I'd wish there was a consensus on the
*  horrors of say the British Empire to expose us as a self-serving nonsense I'll instead give an example
*  a regime I hope there is a consensus on Benito Mussolini's fascist regime in Italy which
*  justified its invasion of Abyssinia in 1935 by drawing attention to the oppressive use of
*  chattel slavery there. Now today's far-right government in Israel includes raging homophobes
*  the finance minister Bezalel Smotrich was himself described himself as a fascist homophobe the
*  far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gurvir took part in anti-gay so-called
*  beast parades and repeatedly petitioned to have Jerusalem pride cancelled prime minister Benjamin
*  Netanyahu previously appointed extremist Avi Meyers to his government who has viciously
*  anti-LGBTQ views combined with misogyny and anti-arab racism. Now Israel's shift towards
*  overt far-right politics obviously means the ascendancy of more homophobic anti-LGBTQ anti-queer
*  politics. Now the Israeli state has sought repeatedly to blackmail queer Palestinians
*  as the Israeli newspaper Haaretz quoted a soldier an Israeli soldier in unit 8200 a military
*  intelligence unit as saying if you're homosexual and know somebody who wants a wanted person and
*  you need to know about it Israel will make your life miserable any such case in which you fish
*  out an innocent person from whom information might be squeezed or who could be recruited as
*  a collaborator was like striking gold for us and for Israel's entire intelligence community.
*  During my training course in preparation for my service in this assigned role we actually
*  learned to memorize different words for gay in Arabic it goes on to say that Israel's internal
*  intelligence unit the Shin Bet put a cruel choice between gay Palestinians betray their people by
*  spying for the regime a risk being cruelly put to death all in exchange for keeping their secret
*  or have their secret exposed and be ostracized from their families exposed to violent attacks
*  and perhaps even murdered. Now in 2023 a militant group named Lyons Den executed a resident of
*  Nablus in the West Bank claiming he'd collaborated with Israel offering intelligence what led to
*  Israel's targeted assassination of two Palestinian militants after he'd been blackmailed into
*  collaboration using a sex tape so there was a striking example there. Now a key point of course
*  here is to actually listen to Palestinian queer activists themselves rather than those claiming
*  to act on their behalf those who aren't really interested in their freedom whatsoever they're
*  just using the using them to justify the broader oppression of the Palestinian people. Now Al-Qoz is
*  a Palestinian LGBTQ movement and they offer up to international activists five ways to support queer
*  Palestinians. One of those asks us to realize that colonialism patriarchy and homophobia are
*  all connected forms of oppression and points out that singling out incidents of homophobia
*  in Palestinian society ignores the complexities of Israel's colonization and military occupation
*  being a contributing factor to Palestinian LGBTQ oppression. They specifically ask us to steer
*  clear of pinkwashing they say that includes perpetuating or voiding perpetuating ties and
*  tropes of presenting Palestinians as inherently oppressive or Israel as a liberal state that
*  protects LGBTQ rights saying this is counterproductive and fractally racist. They say
*  Israel is a settler colonial state offering no rights to Palestinians queer or otherwise
*  and they say their struggle as queer Palestinians is against Israeli colonialism as much as it is
*  about fighting homophobia and patriarchy in Palestine rejecting Israel's pinkwashing tactics
*  in which they say they lie about saving LGBTQ Palestinians from their society and that's a
*  crucial point as we've noted LGBTQ people are not simply oppressed because they are LGBTQ.
*  Now as for this go to Gaza and get executed trait which keeps getting thrown at queer activists
*  who oppose the mass slaughter of Gaza this hypothesis was previously tested to destruction
*  by the US model actor and activist Reign Dove who did exactly that went with the delegation of fellow
*  queer activists to Gaza who were openly visibly queer and met with local queer
*  gals and Palestinians and found themselves persecuted or killed but indeed welcomed.
*  Now in the current onslaught we've seen the truly hideous spectacle of Israeli soldiers holding the
*  pride flag in the rubble of Gaza including one which was inscribed in the name of love. Now the
*  idea of the pride flag being unveiled in the bombed wastelands of Gaza surrounded by the
*  remains of slaughtered Palestinians trying to yassify mass murder is so nauseating it's actually
*  difficult to even think of the words. Since this current episode began I've been myself been
*  bowled with hundreds or maybe even more thousands of messages from people who clearly have no actual
*  authentic interest in LGBTQ people or LGBTQ rights who only refer to us when they think we're a
*  convenient weapon to justify oppressing other people many of them are themselves clearly profoundly
*  homophobic they gleefully suggest that I go to Gaza and be executed and often go to graphic
*  detail about how that will happen some of them keep sending me photographs of gay men being thrown
*  off roofs by islamist fundamentalists claiming that Hamas none of these photographs are from Gaza
*  or did have anything to do with Hamas they're pictures of ISIS executions in Syria now some
*  have even mocked up AI images of me personally being thrown to my death death off from roofs
*  they've coined a phrase homosexual which they think is terribly funny I've been spammed by
*  accounts located in Israel looks very much like a coordinated campaign to me gleefully reveling in
*  the idea of being executed and making up again oh so hilarious drives like queers for Palestine being
*  like chickens for KFC so what's the truth here well firstly a bit of history the general claim
*  that Islam is inherently hostile when it comes to gay people is rather more complicated when
*  you look at history now an important caveat here the way we see people as being say gay or straight
*  in today's world is a relatively modern phenomenon and we need to be careful about crudely imposing
*  modern concepts on past times but if we look at the Ottoman Empire which ruled Palestine until
*  1918 there was a far more liberalized approach to same-sex relations than most of Europe in the
*  19th century a law introduced in 1858 is widely understood as decriminalizing same-sex relations
*  across the Ottoman Empire including Palestine when it was often brutally oppressed in other
*  places but even before then there were many examples of it being tolerated quite like the
*  image of caliphates cultivated by for example the likes of ISIS now in the early modern period even
*  there were lots of references by Western European visitors to the Ottoman Empire to sodomy and the
*  distinction wasn't about being gay or otherwise again it's just a concept which didn't exist in
*  that sense but rather active and passive partners now homosexuality was only criminalized in Palestine
*  in 1936 by the British Empire under the British mandate criminal code ordinance 1936 with a maximum
*  penalty of 10 years imprisonment now it was actually repealed in the West Bank in 1951
*  after it was annexed by Jordan so actually Jordan and the West Bank repealed this law in 1951
*  37 years before Israel did and notably 26 years before the UK partially decriminalized
*  homosexuality so the West Bank isn't actually illegal to be gay and hasn't been for a long time
*  now a horrendous story which keeps circulating on social media concerns the truly hideous story of
*  Ahmed Abu Mariyah now he was a 25 year old gay Palestinian from the West Bank who was found
*  beheaded after trying to seek asylum in Israel and Canada because of threats from his own community
*  now the misleading narrative was that he was beheaded by the authorities or when it's posted on
*  social media that's often the given implication that's not true the Palestinian police arrested
*  an acquaintance of his as a suspect a hideous story now what I'm saying doesn't mean obviously
*  that the West Bank is some good place to be gay it isn't despite the law there's a huge social
*  stigma attached to being gay there in Gaza itself the 1936 British law remains I've previously come
*  into attack on social media for pointing this out as though I'm saying or letting Hamas off the hook
*  and clearly are arguing that this itself is the fundamental explainer in terms of the plight of
*  LGBTQ people in Gaza and as we've seen it can be repealed as it has been with West Bank and Israel
*  itself now according to the Human Dignity Trust a LGBTQ foundation founded by British barristers
*  with the aim of promoting pro-gay legislation worldwide there's little evidence of the law
*  being enforced and it appears to be largely obsolete in practice none of this is to absolve
*  Hamas of other crimes not least the war crimes they've committed against Israeli civilians or
*  indeed repression committed in other ways against fellow Palestinians there's no evidence of queer
*  Gazans being executed because of their sexuality I mean there have been executions by Hamas for
*  other reasons overwhelmingly for alleged collaboration with Israel also a few examples
*  of say murder last reported examples were five men executed in 2022 and before that in 2017 now
*  clearly someone who passionately opposes the death penalty all of that should be opposed but it
*  doesn't let's be honest distinguish Hamas in that particular regard from the United States now there
*  is the reported example in 2016 of a commander of Hamas's military wing Mahmoud Istoui widely
*  reported as being accused of being gay in the western media and executed accordingly but when
*  you read into it it's far more complicated than that seems to be that he was the victim of an
*  internal power struggle he was accused of various crimes like embezzlement reportedly professed his
*  innocence of all claims he was tortured reportedly went on hunger strike maybe even died in the
*  course of that hunger strike and then being shot after his death with the claim then that he was
*  executed in any case it's extremely unlikely it was due to allegations he was gay that may have
*  actually just been added to discredit and humiliate him now Gazans are being imprisoned for being gay
*  it's actually hard to find evidence of that that's not to say Gaza is a good place to be LGBTQ it
*  clearly is not the major problem here like the West Bank and like many other countries in the region
*  is intense social stigma not just countries in the region many countries all over the world let's be
*  honest now as Dorgam Abu Salim a gay Palestinian from Gaza wrote in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz
*  there's no doubt that life a member of the LGBTQ community in Gaza is both arduous and dangerous
*  I would know I grew up in Gaza but what he does is reject what he describes as a well-documented
*  Israeli campaign to vilify Palestinians and exploit LGBTQ Palestinians all while turning
*  blind to what he calls Israeli homophobia he argues that many Gazan used wish to leave Gaza
*  not simply because of their sexual orientation but because of the misery inflicted upon them by
*  Israel's continued siege and its debilitating large-scale military assaults that rendered Gaza
*  nearly unfit for human habitation as well as Egypt's closure of the Ra'afah crossing now he also
*  suggests that the 1936 British mandate code is open to interpretation and quoting a Palestinian
*  legal expert could even allow homosexuality depending on age consent and extortion he also
*  says that the clandestine nature of gay Gazans is a familiar experience nearly everywhere in the world
*  from rural American towns to conservative Israeli cities and illegal settlements in the West Bank
*  Palestine there's no exception finally he says to suggest that Gaza's woes begin and end with
*  Hamas is both dishonest and lazy to say that only LGBTQ people in Gaza are suffering is disingenuous
*  now this is from 2018 before the current horror which has been unleashed of course against Gaza
*  in another article in the same Israeli newspaper Haaretz there's an interview with a queer Gazan
*  who says the gay community in the Gaza Strip is huge and claims that the number of people who are
*  secretly involved in gay relationships is increasing he says I know about 150 gay guys in the Strip I
*  met them all during the past four years and then he adds that it's hard to keep a secret in Gaza
*  rumors spread there quickly and everybody knows everything about everybody again that's interesting
*  detail or nuance from an Israeli newspaper there's a website called queering the map which is pretty
*  heartbreaking I have to say in many ways it allows LGBTQ identifying users to post geotagged posts
*  and that includes several posts from Gaza so some examples include a post in central Gaza someone
*  has written the only thing that keeps me patient in Gaza is the sea and you another posted at the
*  edge of a pier says a place where I kissed my first crush being gay in Gaza is hard but somehow it's
*  fun and made out of a lot of boys in my neighborhood I thought everyone is gay to some level others
*  include messages supporting Palestinian liberation in solidarity with all my Palestinian brothers and
*  sisters you are loved free Palestine another please know despite what the media says there are gay
*  Palestinians we are here we are queer free Palestine then there's this particularly
*  heartbreaking example I've always imagined you and me sitting out in the sun hand in hand
*  free at last we spoke of all the places we would go if we could yet you are gone now if I'd known
*  that bombs raining down on us would take you from me I would have gladly told the world how I adored
*  you more than anything I'm sorry I was a coward now clearly being queer in Gaza before this onslaught
*  began was hard overwhelmingly because of social stigma again not something specific to Gaza but
*  queer sexual relations indeed love clearly did happen and the same queer Palestinians suffered
*  the horrendous oppression imposed by Israel's 16-year long siege of Gaza and of course many of
*  them themselves before that's offered Israeli military occupation and the experience of being
*  refugees who or descendants of refugees who were driven from their homes in 1948 and what now
*  well what now queer gardens are having their homes destroyed 70 percent of course have damaged and
*  destroyed so that will be the case for most queer gardens they've been overwhelmingly displaced from
*  their homes proportionately speaking that will mean 85 percent of them they're being left unable
*  to access food and clean water they're living under the daily terror of bombs they're being
*  denied medical care they're losing loved ones killed by Israeli weapons they are themselves
*  being maimed and killed if we estimate that around three percent of any given population is LGBTQ
*  that means around a thousand LGBTQ gardens have been killed by the Israeli military since their
*  onslaught against Gaza began and it also means approaching 2 000 have been injured all of these
*  together are far greater horrors than the social stigma they face because of their sexual orientation
*  so in some pin watching is a cynical grotesque attempt to use the oppression of LGBTQ people
*  to support ethnic cleansing occupation siege land theft colonization mass incarceration
*  and before this hideous episode the mass slaughter of Palestinians including 6 376 Palestinians were
*  killed between 2008 and the 6th of October 2023 again some of those will have been queer and of
*  course now since then the horrors unleashed against Gaza it's got nothing to do with advancing the
*  rights of Palestinian queer people who like other Palestinians suffer hideous oppression
*  now the cynicism for all of this is underlined by western support for say Saudi Arabia a state
*  which engages in far more hideous oppression of LGBTQ people including numerous barbaric executions
*  and this whole narrative goes against what queer Palestinians themselves are saying
*  like the queer Palestinian activists I've quoted like Bashar Murad a queer Palestinian singer
*  who I've interviewed unlike the countless queer Palestinians who've been in touch with me
*  sending me direct messages since this horror began now indeed in the here and now a group called
*  queers in Palestine have issued a statement entitled no pride in genocide talking of their
*  immense feelings of frustration and disgust at the sight of Israeli soldiers raising pride flags in
*  Gaza adding we see through their despicable tactics of weaponizing homophobia and queer
*  violence for colonial means we need to listen to them it should not need to be said that the
*  road to liberation of LGBTQ people doesn't come through the murderous oppression of a people who
*  have suffered so many decades of brutal subjugation and now face what many are describing as genocide
*  and indeed the apologists for Israeli crimes do not actually care about the rights of LGBTQ people
*  they're simply using LGBTQ people as a convenient ruse to justify those crimes don't forfeit don't
*  use oppression to justify others and often far far greater forms of oppression and have a consistent
*  approach to fighting oppression if you really want to stand with queer Palestinians then that must
*  mean you stand against the overwhelming oppression they suffer as Palestinians queer or straight
