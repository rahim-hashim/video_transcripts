# Starmer's DIRE Answer On Gaza Genocide - w. Hamza Yusuf
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [June 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpT3uoufL9A)
*  Spoiler, Labour are going to win the next election by a landslide. We need to talk about
*  what a Labour government will mean in terms of Israel's genocide war on Gaza. Some will
*  go, well, we need to be talking about what the government's doing and all the rest of
*  it. We've been talking about that for months, quite rightly. The British government under
*  Rishi Sinak has directly facilitated one of the great crimes of our age, including continuing
*  to sell arms, provide political and public support for Israel, which it has done from
*  the very start. Rishi Sinak should be condemned for that for the rest of his life. But we
*  have to scrutinise the next government. It doesn't make any sense now to focus on the
*  conservatives because there's less than no chance of them winning the next election.
*  So we have to talk about what the next government, which will take power in about two and a half
*  weeks. And there's no better person to speak to than Hamza Youssef, who is a brilliant
*  British Palestinian writer who we've interviewed before about the horror being facilitated
*  by the British government. Hey, buddy, how you doing?
*  Good, thanks. How are you?
*  Very good, how's that? Because they can see you as ever. So let's just start, actually,
*  I want us to start with Keir Starmer, the next inevitable prime minister. So we're very
*  clear about that. He was on LBC and was asked about whether Israel was committing genocide.
*  Abiy in Paddington, does Sir Keir Starmer agree with the use of the word genocide?
*  In what sense?
*  I imagine in Gaza, Israel committing genocide in Gaza.
*  Well, look, I've said repeatedly, Israel has to exercise its right to self-defense within
*  international law. No, Abiy, anyway, I'm not going to sit in an LBC studio and pronounce
*  that something is either genocide or not.
*  Yeah, this typifies what Keir Starmer is all about. I mean, even when he when he's asked,
*  he's he's sitting in the studio and he's saying, oh, you know, it's not for me to sit in the
*  studio and decide what is a genocide. And obviously, he didn't have that same use that
*  same yardstick when it was when he was asked about Russia. I think when whether they was
*  committing a war crime or even a genocide. And this this characterizes Keir Starmer's
*  approach, especially on Palestine, he treats it with indifference, he treats the Palestinian
*  court with indifference. And there's no urgency on his end to to even I mean, this is the
*  ICJ has said this plausible genocide, numerous we've passed the point of of whether it is a
*  genocide or whether you know, if the word is acceptable to use, there is now precedent,
*  if you like. And I know the case is still ongoing. But the fact Israel is on trial for genocide at
*  the World Court is enough of a reason to actually begin applying the term. But he actually has
*  formed because when he was asked about the Amnesty International report on apartheid, again, he
*  couldn't he couldn't he rejected it. And actually, if you talk about significance, or what that means,
*  if you if Israel gets begins to be treated as a genocide or state, a state that committed genocide,
*  it applies that bit of pressure on them. And, you know, it's not it's not only any state would want
*  to have, but by kind of shielding them from that and kind of just giving me mouth commitments about
*  Palestinian state or, you know, without actually getting into how how can that come about? How can
*  we apply pressure on Israel? As I said, it typifies case diamonds approach. I think what's striking
*  about as well is technically we can listen to that clip and go well, he hasn't ruled out the
*  fact that Israel may be committing genocide. And, and the reason I bring that up is if I take I
*  don't know, Afghanistan, the invasion of Afghanistan, I think terrible crimes were committed by Western
*  forces. I don't think that was genocide. At the invasion of Iraq. I think that's one of the great
*  crimes of our age. I think it's a heinous bloodbath. I don't think that was genocide. The point I'm
*  making is the threshold is very high for even contemplating whether or not a state is committing
*  genocide. But if you think a state might if you can't say, No, I don't think it's genocide. If you
*  if you're not able to say that, then you must be indulging the idea that terrible crimes have been
*  committed and therefore is open to debate and discussion about whether that could constitute
*  genocide. Do you see what I mean? The point I make it is he has got to a point in theory where he's
*  not ruling out genocide, you could frame that answer in that way. And yet he's still refusing
*  to say he will stop arms. So the way of looking at is Kirstam is refusing to say he will end
*  arms sales to a state he thinks may plausibly be committing genocide or he's not ruling out the
*  fact that committing genocide. Do you see what I mean? Yeah. And even then it's the language is
*  that typical robotic approach that he has with especially on Palestine. Like I said, it's all
*  about you know, he was asked by Nick Ferrari or a caller was asked on LBC asked put the question to
*  him would you suspend arms sales? And he said, Well, we have to review we have to look into
*  review of that. Now Israel is committing a genocide. Okay, he doesn't like the word genocide. Let's use
*  systematic mass slaughter, systematic ethnic cleansing oppression, the annihilation of Gaza.
*  And he has to review he has to look into the potential of Britain not assisting them not
*  providing them with arms not providing with material with military material to to allow
*  them to carry out this mass slaughter of Palestinians. Again, he can't commit to anything
*  even something so simple. What's what's striking is that even Nick Ferrari, Nick Ferrari, who is
*  the staunch supporter of Israel, even he was getting frustrated. He said, What would you mean
*  you're going to review like you can't even commit to to, you know, openly saying, Okay, look, we're
*  going to suspend arms sales Israel and sticking to I mean, on that is quite striking that.
*  Earlier this year, Alicia Kearns, the conservative chair of the conservative. I say, she's the chair
*  of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee. She's a conservative. I actually would say he's done a lot
*  much better job at scrutinizing the government over Gaza than Kirsten Amah has the bar is on the
*  floor. Let's bear that in mind. But there was a leaked recording of her saying that the government
*  had been told they'd been given legal advice that Israel was in violation of international humanitarian
*  law, which means the government has to end arms sales and end intelligence cooperation with Israel.
*  But all labor could do is say release the legal advice, but they're not saying they're not they're
*  not saying as a bare minimum end arms sales. And it's quite striking that context, because
*  when actually asked about what they do when they come to government, they're not even saying they'll
*  release the legal advice. They said that they will look at the legal advice or commission their own.
*  But they're not at any point saying they will end arms sales, which is the legal obligation in that
*  context. It's the bare minimum. Yeah, and it's just a word salad devoid of any tangible thought
*  or practical ways to move forward. He's kicking the can down the road. And that is what Kirsten Amah
*  does. And I think I think it's worth, you know, almost diving into what he has done in terms of
*  on Palestine since he was elected, because it's very easy now, for example, he's got
*  he's in the manifesto, they've committed to a Palestinian state again, another media mouth
*  commitment. And again, I make the point of Palestine, the state doesn't just mushroom from
*  the ground, in order for you to have a legitimate process or, you know, unraveling or unpacking,
*  or dismantling the structures that allow Israel to continue its ethnic cleansing, apartheid and
*  oppression of the Palestinians, you need to apply some level of pressure with that economic
*  isolation with BDS, he opposes that least Nandi opposes that she was on the airwaves the other
*  day, saying nobody supports Palestinian like her, she's been committed. And you know, she's been
*  had a history of it. That's not the case. Obviously, they oppose BDS, they oppose
*  the categorization of Israel as an apartheid state or practicing the crime of apartheid.
*  They refuse to suspend arms sales. So you know, placing that political pressure potentially
*  generating momentum from the ground up so that you know, potentially other states in Germany,
*  actors can place pressure on the government look written suspended arms sales, why don't we do the
*  same, etc. That's how you generate momentum. That's how you apply economic, diplomatic political
*  pressure on Israel. That's how you begin the process of okay, we can now start centering
*  Palestinian rights, Palestinian aspirations, Palestinian ambitions, etc. But he's not interested
*  in it. He's just going to look into review of arms sales, and he's going to commit to a Palestinian
*  state, how are we going to commit to Palestinian state? Nobody knows. So as I said, it's just,
*  it's just commitment. It's just hot air and the practical impact of that can't be understated
*  because it offers a smoke screen for ethnic cleansing. Nobody can now, in Keis Tharmer's
*  eyes, he sees it as nobody can accuse him of not centering the Palestinian rights,
*  because he's committed to a state. But on the ground that Palestinian state, what does it look
*  like? Well, Gaza has been annihilated, there are buffers on it's been carved into pieces.
*  The West Bank has continued land grab going on to continue ethnic cleansing.
*  Palestinian communities continue to be to be forcefully evicted. The Palestinian
*  occupation continue to have their rights stripped. There's a high level of torture in prisons,
*  more imprisonment, more arrests. So that's the reality on the ground. And so by just giving
*  these robotic recitations about two state solutions without offering tangible practical solutions,
*  it provides a smoke screen for ethnic cleansing. So it's actually worse than,
*  it's arguably worse than not saying anything. Because on that, just in line how medium out
*  there is, Ireland, Spain, and Norway came out and recognised the Palestinian state, which I
*  would emphasise most countries on earth have actually done. I mean, that is actually the
*  mainstream of what countries have done around the world. And they got hysterical attacks from the
*  Israeli state, particularly going for the Spanish government, I would note, but also Ireland.
*  And Labour's not committing to do that. I think it's very important people realise that. They're
*  not saying we will recognise a Palestinian state in the way they've all done. They're making it
*  clear. They're saying it's some undefined point that will happen. And actually point, given the
*  Israeli state is viciously aggressively publicly opposed to any form of Palestinian state, it is
*  obviously waging war against the Palestinian people occupying and colonising their land,
*  you would have to take exceptionally firm action against the Israeli state in order for that to
*  ever be a reality. So it is, it doesn't mean anything. It just, it means less than nothing,
*  because it is literally just a platitudinous aspiration, which doesn't have any underpinning.
*  And if you actually, if you actually compare to, so he's obviously, it's just an empty word,
*  Salah, it's just hot air when it comes to the Palestinians. But if you compare that to the kind
*  of the categorical way in which he makes sure there's no real condemnation of Israel, there is
*  a stark difference. So this is a choice. He can apply that same level of, you know, that same robust
*  commitment to protecting or safeguarding Israel. I mean, if you go back to 2020, I think it was
*  Stephen Kinnock, not the most progressive person. He mentioned that Israel is profiting
*  from the proceeds of crime effectively, when you mentioned the expansion of illegal settlements,
*  and Kehstar Ma gave him a dressing down effectively. So anytime there's any kind of
*  movement, any kind of momentum he generated when it comes to Palestinian state, he doesn't,
*  or just Palestinian solidarity, Palestinian, you know, supporting the Palestinian cause,
*  he's quick to shut that down. He hasn't supported student encampments. He hasn't really said anything
*  on the, on the ICJ case. He's a human rights lawyer. He hasn't mentioned the arrest warrants
*  or the application for the arrest warrants. So these are the avenues in which a Palestinian,
*  I know it's obviously we're some way off that at the moment, but in terms of applying pressure on
*  Israel, isolating, as I mentioned, political, diplomatic, economic pressure, that it's through
*  those avenues, these multi-point avenues, and it could start with a condemnation with a suspension
*  of arms sales. But when it comes to Israel and reiterating Israel has the right to defend itself,
*  which is actually what he said when he was asked about the genocide. When it comes to, even with
*  a Palestinian state, he goes ensuring it's next to a safe and secure Israel, et cetera, et cetera.
*  Again, on Israel's terms, on is that a settler colonial state, but it's on their terms.
*  So again, it's, it's infuriating because it's just empty words, empty gestures,
*  and empty gestures are what have allowed Israel for 30 years since the two state solution, the
*  so-called peace process, you know, gave birth to the two state solution. All we've heard is
*  empty gestures and virtually seeking and the KSRM has continued down that path. And it impacts
*  Palestinians because the land grab continues, the land theft continues, ethnic cleansing,
*  you know, the systematic violence and oppression of Palestinians because politicians just offer
*  empty gestures. Now, just in terms of the general hypocrisy of KSRM on this, let's just listen to
*  these two clips side by side. As to whether each and every act is in accordance with the law,
*  well, that will have to be adjudicated in due course. I think it's unwise for politicians to
*  stand on stages like this or to sit in television studios and pronounce day by day, which acts may
*  or may not be in accordance with international law. I think it's not the role of politicians.
*  Is Vladimir Putin a war criminal? Yes. Yes. What I've seen already amounts to war crimes,
*  particularly the awful attacks on civilians. So what he says in those clips were firstly about
*  Israel. I think it's unwise for politicians to sit in TV studios and pronounce which acts may or may
*  not be in accordance with international law. And then in the second clip, when asked about Russia,
*  he said, what I've seen amounts to war crimes. What do you do with that then? Exactly. I mean,
*  that gives you an insight. Some lives are worth more than others. It's a high rock of human life.
*  And the worst thing about it is that this is a former human rights lawyer. And with human rights,
*  it shouldn't be, it should be a clear distinction. One thing's right, one thing's wrong, but he can't
*  commit to that. And it goes back to how can we expect or even by all these so-called pledges
*  and these commitments when we know full well he's going to first he's going to backtrack. So we don't
*  even know if a Palestinian state, if he's even going to commit to that. And if he can't even
*  bring himself to condemn it, how can we expect him as British Prime Minister to then place
*  pressure on Israel or to actually have, you know, there's no good negotiations and discussions that
*  he would inevitably have with Israel when he can't even call it a spade a spade effectively.
*  I mean, on that as well, I mean, we know it's been obviously widely discussed, but it should
*  always be raised that at the very start of this, he said that Israel had the cut, sorry, he answered
*  to Nick Fries on LBC. We just heard them, it was on that same show, asked whether or not Israel had
*  the right to impose a siege to cut off water and energy. And he said, I think that Israel does have
*  that right. And then sent various shadow cabinet ministers on TV, including my local MP, Emily
*  Thornberry, to defend that particular point. And then two weeks later, gaslit people were saying,
*  never believed Israel had the right to do any such thing. It's just underlies what a pathological
*  lie that guy is. But at the same time, I mean, this is the point, I mean, you kind of alluded to,
*  he's monstered and gone for anyone within the Labour Party, he's actually taken a strong line.
*  Anti-McDonald to Labour MP was suspended from the Labour Party when he called for essentially,
*  he used the phraseology of talking about from the river to the sea, Israelis and Palestinians
*  will live in perfect harmony. So nobody could accuse, you know, even the smear against that
*  particular, the phraseology from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free. He was making
*  clear that ambiguity couldn't, that claimed ambiguity couldn't exist because it just meant
*  peaceful coexistence. And whilst Kate Ozzamore was suspended from the parliamentary Labour Party
*  because she said that Gaza was a genocide on Holocaust Memorial Day, bearing in mind that
*  Holocaust Memorial Day exists to remember all genocides committed since the Holocaust. So
*  therefore you would have to include Gaza if you think it's a genocide. So that's the point,
*  isn't it? I mean, it's just in practice, he opposed a ceasefire when, you know, back in November,
*  he went for the critics of it and he supported the right of Israel to commit war crimes. It's
*  not adding up to a great picture, is all I'm saying. Yeah, and he thinks people have short memories.
*  And it's interesting, you mentioned about where his red lines are. So he has no issue standing at
*  a Labour Friends of Israel, a Labour Friends of Israel lunch, I think they have the annual lunch,
*  and sharing a platform with Zippy Hotevili, for example, the Israeli ambassador to the UK,
*  who has made several genocidal statements even before and after October 7th. I think she was
*  even, she's also denied that Gaza was under siege or was occupied numerous times, I think that was
*  Channel 4. And obviously, she was on the Ian Dale show, and basically saying, well, what option do
*  we have except to destroy buildings, etc, etc. So again, it's a genocide of intent. Yeah.
*  So that's no problem. He can share a platform with her. And when she was protested, when protestors,
*  when she was speaking at the London School of Economics, I think two years ago, again,
*  Keir Starmer, when people protested, he said, oh, this is anti-Semitic, we're allowing people to
*  whip up anti-Semitic hatred by protesting this, etc, etc. His red lines are very different when
*  it comes to anything associated to the Palestinians. When it comes to not sharing platforms,
*  not saying certain things, he's categorical. Israel is not an apartheid state. There's no
*  genocide being committed, be this anti-Semitic, those are red lines. But then when it comes to
*  calling out certain things, calling out other things, he's happy to make it, to play, you know,
*  to keep it loose and to keep it effectively, like I said, hot air and just a word salad of emptiness.
*  I mean, in terms of this whole election, I think it is striking how little Gaza has been discussed
*  at all, bearing in mind the International Criminal Court, she prosecutes her, has issued requests
*  for arrest warrants against Benjamin Netanyahu and his defence minister for alleged war crimes
*  and crimes against humanity in a onslaught which has been directly supported by the British
*  government and openly supported by the opposition. You might think that might be, if we had a
*  functioning political system, that might be quite an important thing for us to discuss.
*  And not least, given it is obviously a priority for lots of people that we've seen the consequences
*  for that in terms of voters who've been disillusioned with the Labour Party. We saw that
*  in terms of what happened in Rochdale earlier this year. We know that there are several independent
*  candidates and who are standing on this basis and attracting a lot of support. But both our
*  political elites and our media, much of our media is just simply not engaging with it. They're
*  treating it as though it's irrelevant in this election. Yeah, and it goes back to something
*  that's been discussed often, which is how the media frames things. So they know how they can
*  frame a certain debate and get attention. As we've seen, for example, Nigel Farage, suddenly he's
*  getting the most platforms, suddenly he's been allowed to amplify and continue using his,
*  obviously, his vitriol. But something as huge as that, I mean, that's significant. But when we do
*  hear of it, we just hear, oh, but it's just an application for under arrest for it. It doesn't
*  matter that, you know, this is from the International Criminal Court, it doesn't matter that it was on
*  trial for genocide at the ICJ. None of these things seem to matter. They make them insignificant.
*  They don't put it to the political elite. And the political elite themselves, as I said, by not
*  saying anything, you're saying something. So Keir Starmer can easily take a stand and say, actually,
*  the fact that Benjamin Netanyahu and Jörg Gallant, there are arrest warrants out for them or their
*  application for arrest warrants. That's something for him to go with. That's something where he can
*  apply a bit of pressure on him. He can say, I'm not going to, if I'm elected, I'm not going to speak
*  to Netanyahu until this is clear. Or something along those lines, I'm not diplomat, I don't know
*  what route that can take. But I'm sure there are avenues which can be adopted. There are mechanisms
*  that can be used where Israel uses, where, sorry, Keir Starmer uses this key moment in which, you
*  know, finally Israel, an element of Israel being held to account. And he could use that to build
*  a case or send to Palestinian rights, but instead it's just ignored because, as I said, it's
*  characteristic to his approach when it comes to treating Palestinians and their cause with indifference.
*  And on that too, in terms of who's tolerated and who's accepted and who's not,
*  Faisal Shaheen, who was the local Muslim woman of colour, working-class woman, defied the odds,
*  became a successful academic, standing in her home constituency of Chingford and Woodford Green
*  back in 2019 when obviously very difficult for Labour. It was one of the only places where there
*  was a swing in favour of Labour. She was deselected by the party arbitrarily, attempted to publicly
*  humiliate her with evidence amassed, including, for example, that she had, I think, liked to tweet
*  or tweeted in support of the idea that Israel was in a apartheid state, which is, as Amnesty
*  International, Human Rights Watch and Israeli human rights organisation, Betsalem, define Israel.
*  And where's Lou Gaikost, who is on the National Executive Committee, who then just carved up a
*  load of seats to parachute themselves into, into Durham, a seat he has nothing to do with whatsoever.
*  He's a southerner. I knew him in Hackney. He was a Hackney councillor. Then you meet to Oxford.
*  Nothing to do with Durham. Parachutes himself in. He's someone who works for, we believe,
*  he's director of We Believe in Israel, a pro-Israel lobbying group, the Israel Lobby. That's what that
*  is. It exists. It's a fact. Has treated the various, the United Nations as anti-Semitic,
*  oppose all calls for ceasefire and repeatedly claimed Israel does not commit any war crimes
*  or violations at all on the basis that it has lawyers checking everything it does, which,
*  when you read what those lawyers have said publicly, including the former chief military
*  attorney in Israel saying that you have to destroy every building in Gaza because Hamas is everywhere.
*  I think we can see what those legal experts are saying to the Israeli army. But I mean, you see,
*  who's acceptable and who's not. And that sums it up really, doesn't it?
*  Yeah. And like I said, you can parachute a staunch pro-Israel lobbyist who unconditionally
*  supports Israel into a safe seat, making him part of the labour furniture, or you can hold Israel
*  to account and champion Palestinian rights. You can't do both. But Keir Starmer's trying to,
*  you know, we know what his intentions are. We know where the party's going. And on the point,
*  it's interesting because one of the tweets he liked was on the Israel lobby. And this guy,
*  ironically, you know, his history suggests and illustrates that there is, well, included
*  Israel lobby, a pro-Israel lobby that works and operates. And on the topic, I mean, several of
*  Keir Starmer's shadow cabinet have had trips to Israel funded. David Lammy himself has had
*  trips, funded trips to Israel. So she liked to tweet and, you know, obviously they dealt with
*  it the way that they did. And then to show, oh, look, actually, it's outrageous that you could
*  even reference an Israel lobbyist. Oh, by the way, here the pro-Israel lobbyist who's going to be
*  parachuted into a safe seat. It's ludicrous. Finally, then, I mean, in terms of labour and
*  government. Well, I mean, a lot of people might just feel a bit depressed listening to this,
*  just because, I mean, you know, the Tories are very justified, they're going to get absolutely
*  obliterated, they have wrecked the country. And obviously, they've supported this genocidal
*  onslaught. They're going to be what remains of them, the opposition, unless the form,
*  I mean, Nigel Farage takes over. But again, I mean, he's obviously got a terrible reactionary
*  position on all this as well. And Labour will have a massive majority full of lots of MPs who
*  have a terrible position. So even though public opinion overwhelmingly, according to polls,
*  think Israel has committed war crimes, that arms sales to Israel must immediately end.
*  And they oppose overwhelmingly the military onslaught Israel has, which is genocidal nature,
*  has perpetrated. Yeah, that's not going to get very much representation in Parliament at all.
*  So kind of what do we do? We have to hope that the independents can shatter into some of that
*  majority. We have to apply that pressure. But in terms of what it means in practice, like you said,
*  this is not going to be a party that or a leader or prime minister that actually sent his Palestinian
*  rights. It's going to I think if you look at in terms of what you say when the US sneezes,
*  the world catches a cold. So Joe Biden, four years of pathetic policies, four years of,
*  you know, championing Israel at the worst possible time and kind of not really offering anything.
*  And then within four, you know, nothing of significance. And so immediately the right wing
*  comes back in. I think there's there's a lesson there. But in practice, what it means for the
*  Palestinians, this case time is rhetoric so far. And as I said, if you look at history and the
*  history of what he's under tendencies or senior ministers within the party, he'll just continue as
*  labor has historically operated, which is to basically provide a smoke screen for ethnic
*  cleansing, because as I said, Israel continues to consolidate apartheid rule, it systematically
*  displaces and kills Palestinians, it maintains Jewish supremacy from the river to the sea.
*  And the kind of the thing that allows that or the process that allows that is empty gestures and
*  kind of veneer of compassion instead of actually saying we're going to take a stance, we're going
*  to take a stand, and we're going to actually apply some pressure on Israel. So we're going to hear
*  numerous robotic recitation from Kirstam about Palestinians and more artificially balanced
*  statements. But in the end, it's going to amount to nothing. And in that time, more Palestinians
*  will be killed, more be evicted. Gaza will remain under Israeli control, the West Bank's occupation
*  will become entrenched, Israel's apartheid will be consolidated, or whilst our human rights lawyer
*  or the prime minister looks on. Bleak, but it does show, yeah, absolutely right. This is why
*  given labor going to win by a landslide, people should vote for either independence or green
*  party candidates, candidates who clearly are going to take a stand, put pressure on labor as well,
*  that they feel they have to compete with parties which oppose genocide and candidates which oppose
*  genocide and that puts pressure on them as well. It just shows that people need to keep organizing,
*  building up pressure, not least because we do have public opinion on our side, that's not actually
*  the issue at this point. The issue is how we translate that into direct political pressure to
*  stop Britain's direct complicity in one of the greatest crimes of our age. It's such an honor.
*  Please, those watching, listening, press like, subscribe, leave your comments, always great,
*  engagement, read all your comments, it includes more people to watch and that's what we want.
*  We want to get the message out. Do listen to the podcast, but Hamza, honestly, such an honest PT.
*  Thanks for the brilliant insights as ever. Pleasure.
