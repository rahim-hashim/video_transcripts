Video Description: Around 3,000 Israelis and counting have signed a letter demanding sanctions against Israel and condemning its war crimes.

It's an act of real moral courage - and I'm honoured to interview one of the signatories, the Israeli academic Anat Matar about what it means. This is sobering stuff.

Here's the letter: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/24/israel-immediate-ceasefire-open-letter

# Israeli Activists Demand SANCTIONS On Israel: "Save Us From Ourselves" They Plead - w/ Anat Matar
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs)
*  Now in the past, there was something of a peace movement, at least in theory, in Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=0.0s)]
*  For example, during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, after the Sabra and Shatiyah [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=4.76s)]
*  massacres, significant numbers took to the streets. That has, I'm afraid, not been [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=10.16s)]
*  the case this time. There are courageous Israelis, and I've done everything I can since this [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=14.4s)]
*  particular horror began on 7th October to platform them on this channel. We'll continue [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=19.3s)]
*  to do so as we do today. They are courageous because they are so isolated in Israeli society, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=23.92s)]
*  at least in the here and now, with disturbingly high levels of support for the onslaught against [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=29.4s)]
*  Gaza and beyond. But a really important new letter has been signed and published by around [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=34.28s)]
*  3,000 Israelis so far and counting, which demands external pressure on Israel, including [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  sanctions. Please do read the letter in full yourself. We have a link included in the video [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=45.0s)]
*  description. But it starts by saying, we Israeli citizens residing in Israel and abroad call [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=51.64s)]
*  on the international community, the UN and its institutions, the United States, the European [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=55.6s)]
*  Union, the League of Arab States and all states around the world to intervene immediately [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=60.28s)]
*  and implement every possible sanction towards achieving an immediate ceasefire between Israel [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=64.44s)]
*  and its neighbours for the future of both peoples in Israel and Palestine and the peoples [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=68.92s)]
*  of the region and for their rights to security and life. It condemns what it calls the countless [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=73.6s)]
*  war crimes that Israel is committing and states that unfortunately the majority of Israelis [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=78.06s)]
*  support the continuation of the war and massacres and a change from within is not currently [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=83.28s)]
*  feasible, adding Israel is on a suicide path and is sowing destruction and devastation [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=87.72s)]
*  each day. It states that Israel has abandoned the hostages and do bear in mind the only [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=92.44s)]
*  significant release of Israeli hostages came last December because of a prison exchange [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  deal with the Israeli military killing more hostages than it has released by military [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=101.84s)]
*  means. The letter states Israel's Palestinian citizens, that is the 20% of Israel who are [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=107.08s)]
*  Palestinian, are persecuted and silenced by state authorities and by the wider public. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=113.16s)]
*  With each day, says the letter, the prospect of a regional agreement and reconciliation where [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=117.75999999999999s)]
*  Jewish Israelis can live with security in this place gets eerily more distant. Indeed, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=122.0s)]
*  it emphasises achieving these will require lengthy processes but the constant massacres and destruction [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=127.92s)]
*  must be stopped immediately. Crucially, it decries the lack of true international pressure, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=133.2s)]
*  not least the continuation of arms to Israel as well as continued economic and security [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=138.08s)]
*  partnerships and scientific and cultural collaborations, leading it says Israelis to [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=142.48s)]
*  conclude these horrors have international support. They end the letter by saying please for our [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=147.04s)]
*  futures and the futures of all the residents of Israel and the region, save us from ourselves [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=151.84s)]
*  and use real pressure on Israel for an immediate ceasefire. Now, obviously Israeli citizens [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=157.68s)]
*  calling for international sanctions against their state in the current climate, given where public [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=162.4s)]
*  opinion is, in Israel that is, that's quite the move. But it's very courageous, it's important [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=167.6s)]
*  and we can hear there the moral clarity in some of the best traditions of course of the Jewish left, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=173.44s)]
*  which lives on, certainly in the United States, in Britain and elsewhere, but we can hear that [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=180.95999999999998s)]
*  tradition within Israel here in this letter. I'm really delighted to speak today to Anna Mata, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=187.84s)]
*  who is an Israeli academic, who is one of the signatories. She's a veteran Israeli [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=192.72s)]
*  peace activist. She's a supporter of the BDS movement as boycott, divestment, and sanctions. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=197.2s)]
*  She's been involved in the Israeli committee for Palestinian prisoners that is fighting for the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=201.92s)]
*  rights of the countless Palestinians who've been incarcerated as well as academia for justice. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  I start by asking you how this letter came about and why now? Okay, this is something we've been [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=211.83999999999997s)]
*  thinking about for many, many months now, but the present one came about with my friend Yael Ere, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=217.76s)]
*  who resides in France, and she saw a Twitter attack on someone, on another friend, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=225.84s)]
*  who just suggested the idea of sanctions and she drew a lot of fire. So Yael decided to write this [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=232.88s)]
*  draft of this letter and she shared it with some friends. We edited it a little bit together and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=242.4s)]
*  this is how we started distributing it. I think at the moment we have more than 2,900, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=248.8s)]
*  almost 3,000 signatures. They're all Israeli citizens and the vast majority of them are Jewish. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=258.16s)]
*  Palestinians, as you actually mentioned, are quite hesitating before they sign something like that [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=266.72s)]
*  because the sanctions against them and the dangers that hovers around them [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=273.36s)]
*  is much, much, much greater than on us. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=278.64s)]
*  We've seen arrests, haven't we? Well, I've got it on this channel of Palestinian citizens of Israel [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=282.24s)]
*  for having spoken out. In terms of the kind of asking for external pressure, I referred back to [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=288.56s)]
*  the fact that in the past you did get very substantial numbers involved in, for example, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=298.88s)]
*  1982. Can I correct a little bit? Please do. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=303.2s)]
*  Okay, because it's indicative to this moment, otherwise it wouldn't have done so. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=309.2s)]
*  But in 6th June, 1982, there was a small radical group which started protesting against the moment [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=315.52s)]
*  it started. And then it took the Zionist left a few days to realize and even several weeks after [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=327.44s)]
*  to realize that this is a wrong war. I mean, that this shouldn't have been happening. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=336.16s)]
*  But this first kernel, the first kernel of the radical protest is the one we're having now. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=343.84s)]
*  So actually we are still waiting for that Zionist left to sometime, although we're over a year now, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=352.08s)]
*  to sometime join us, to sometime understand that they should instead of going to the war [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=361.52s)]
*  and serving in Netanyahu's army and in this onslaught, to just quit that, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=368.0s)]
*  refuse to go and join the protest. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=377.2s)]
*  And it hasn't really happened until now. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=380.32s)]
*  I mean, the call for external sanctions to be, sorry, let me start again. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=384.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=389.76s)]
*  Yeah. The call for sanctions to be imposed on Israel from without, I mean, is that itself [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=390.26s)]
*  a kind of sign that within Israeli society there isn't going to be the successful blocking, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=396.32s)]
*  the stopping of what's happening. That is just impossible within the Israeli context [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=405.76s)]
*  in the here and now for that to happen. So therefore it has to happen from those people [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=410.56s)]
*  in those states, which arm and support Israel and facilitate what Israel is doing without which [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=416.32s)]
*  Israel wouldn't be able to do what it's doing, that they have to put pressure on their governments [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=421.12s)]
*  because it's not going to happen at the moment within Israel. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=425.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. I'm sad to say that I agree with this analysis. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=427.92s)]
*  I'm not happy to give up on the Israeli society. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=432.47999999999996s)]
*  As I just said, I mean, from the Zionist left, I'm still expecting for them to join us and to [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=438.71999999999997s)]
*  understand and to lay down their arms and not go and rather than go to Gaza to fight to join us [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=444.64s)]
*  in protest. But this doesn't really happen. I mean, or indeed it happens, but in very, very small [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=452.15999999999997s)]
*  numbers. So at the moment, there are 130 refusers from the reserve service. And I think that's nice. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=459.52000000000004s)]
*  I mean, it's not something that I would just, you know, wave off. I find it important, but still [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=468.40000000000003s)]
*  these are very, very small numbers, but the vast, vast majority of the Israeli public is being way [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=476.64000000000004s)]
*  behind and we cannot really reach them. And I'm trying and my friends, my comrades are trying [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=482.8s)]
*  as much as they can to convince, but we know that our words are falling on deaf ears. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=493.2s)]
*  So we think something has to stop this onslaught. And this something is, I think, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=499.36s)]
*  independently of the problems of the Israeli population, it is the responsibility of the [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=507.28s)]
*  international community. I mean, they're seeing these things happening. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=515.4399999999999s)]
*  You mentioned the refusers. I interviewed a very courageous young 18 year old Israeli [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=522.0s)]
*  refuse Nick a few months ago, but as you say, very, very small numbers in the grand scheme of things. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=525.8399999999999s)]
*  But that said, we should obviously commend even more the courage of those who've refused, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=531.1999999999999s)]
*  obviously, to follow those orders. And it's striking, isn't it? The former head of the [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=536.72s)]
*  National Security Council of Israel a few days ago has publicly said that Israeli soldiers should [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=541.84s)]
*  refuse to follow the orders they have on the grounds that the so-called generals plan is [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=547.6s)]
*  being implemented in northern Israel, which is an ethically-trained. What do you think about the [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=553.52s)]
*  significance of that, by the way, just, I mean, in terms of how that feeds in? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=560.88s)]
*  I don't have a lot of sympathy. I don't have a lot of sympathy to those generals who, after, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=564.72s)]
*  you know, killing so many for so many years, so many Palestinians now wake up in [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=569.28s)]
*  in in real. On the other hand, I think it's important because if you do want to reach [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=575.84s)]
*  the Israeli population that maybe contribute to that, because they probably listen much more to [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=580.72s)]
*  such a general or ex-general than to me that I'm already marked for, and I haven't been so for many [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=587.84s)]
*  years. But I don't see even that this changes their view. This is what's amazing. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=594.72s)]
*  Well, on that, I guess this is what I think disturbs a lot of us, basically, when we look at [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=602.0s)]
*  the, if you look at the polling of Israeli society, let's look at that. So if we take out the [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=607.4399999999999s)]
*  Palestinian population of Israel, which is about 20 percent, of the Jewish population, polling [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=610.4s)]
*  suggests that 60 percent consistently oppose all humanitarian aid getting into Gaza, which in [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=616.72s)]
*  practice means that everybody dying. And surely you would expect anyone who answers that question [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=621.84s)]
*  in the negative should understand that. And then a division between, there's two percent who think [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=626.88s)]
*  the bombing has gone too far. I mean, this was a few months ago, but it was already apocalyptic. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=633.44s)]
*  And then the rest were divided by saying, divided into two main camps, those who said [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=638.24s)]
*  that the bombing was the right amount and those who said it hadn't gone far enough. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=643.76s)]
*  And there was almost a 50-50 split. I'm almost looking at that and think, what is actually, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=648.16s)]
*  I mean, that comes across as genocide or mania, you know, which I think will be exact. I mean, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=653.52s)]
*  again, it's when you see a post by an Israeli peace activist and they'll post about horror, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=658.4799999999999s)]
*  and then they'll be bombarded with responses by fellow Israeli citizens in Hebrew. And we click [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=663.68s)]
*  the translate tweet buttons. It's some of that, you know, it's like they're responding to pictures [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=669.04s)]
*  of children have been blown apart. How would you understand what's happening? That kind of collective. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=673.28s)]
*  I suppose the seventh of the horrors of the seventh of October do affect people, but it cannot explain [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=681.92s)]
*  this much of hostility or inhumanity actually, because I think it's ingrained in those people's [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=690.0s)]
*  minds for many, many years, you know, the idea of Jewish superiority, not treating Palestinians like [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=696.8s)]
*  real humans. And this is what enables them to see. I just read before we entered this interview with [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=704.64s)]
*  someone commemorating his brother was killed in Lebanon a few days ago. And he's a settler. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=711.68s)]
*  And he said about this brother, he said, Oh, you went to Gaza to fight in Gaza and you said, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=720.64s)]
*  this is going to be, we are going to onslaught every child and every woman. And now it's you who [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=727.3599999999999s)]
*  are dead. And this is what he said on his grave. I saw it. I saw it. It's hideous. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=734.7199999999999s)]
*  Hideous. Yeah. Yeah. So there are things I really don't know how to explain. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=741.76s)]
*  I mean, what I think in terms of, I'm interested in what your thoughts about this in terms of, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=746.72s)]
*  because this is an appeal for international action, is what I would consider a very striking [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=751.6800000000001s)]
*  divergence taking place between the two major Jewish populations on earth, which is Israel, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=757.36s)]
*  the United States, because in the United States, the attitudes are moving away from uncritical [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=762.24s)]
*  support for Israel. And polling earlier this year found 30% of American Jews thought Israel's [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=770.24s)]
*  committing genocide. And for those under the age of 45, it rose to 40%. So that is a dramatic [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=774.96s)]
*  divergence. I'm interested in your thoughts on that massive divergence, because in America, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=782.0s)]
*  you've got some of the protests against what Israel is doing are led by younger Jewish Americans. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=786.4000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. This is again, a very difficult question, which I'm not sure I can answer. And I'm not sure [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=792.24s)]
*  anyone can answer actually, because I don't think it's just the Jewish lobby. I don't believe it is [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=800.08s)]
*  just, it's against something that's, and I don't even think, although it's more plausible, I don't [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=806.0s)]
*  even think that it is their arms industry. Of course, both elements are there, both the Jewish [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=813.0400000000001s)]
*  lobby and the arms industry, and they're pushing to continue the war and to stand by Israel, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=818.64s)]
*  and what's called our friend Israel. But I suppose Kamala Harris reads the polls and she knows she's [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=825.28s)]
*  paying. She may lose the presidency because of this policy. So at this moment, I find it inexplicable. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=835.36s)]
*  And I'm turning from the inexplicable to, again, like I said about the Israeli population, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=848.88s)]
*  it's something that is so deeply ingrained, this defense of Israel, whatever it does. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=854.08s)]
*  There's something deep in the interests, the shared interests of the state and Israel. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=859.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I suppose. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=868.8000000000001s)]
*  They are colonialists, they are capitalists, they are everything that you know, those isms. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=869.6s)]
*  Yeah, I suppose what I'm saying is actually in the United States, Jewish voters are actually [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=876.0s)]
*  more progressive there, but they've got better positions on Israel. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=879.28s)]
*  So that here, I mean, here in London, I mean, when the same young generation, you've been covering [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=885.52s)]
*  this for years, we're so supportive of Corbyn and what happened? And I forgot to mention, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=893.12s)]
*  in this respect, it's relevant, but I forgot to mention the role of the media here. So [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=900.72s)]
*  that's relevant both in the States, both, and especially regarding Corbyn, but also in Israel. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=904.64s)]
*  I don't know whether you know this, but the Israeli media doesn't cover anything of what's [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=911.12s)]
*  happening in Gaza, anything, nothing. I mean, you're a regular person in Israel, simply doesn't know, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=916.24s)]
*  he could know because it could open some other media outlets. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=923.04s)]
*  But if it just- [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=928.08s)]
*  Well, there's the internet, isn't there? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=929.04s)]
*  Yeah, but well, internet, you know, you're exposed to whatever you wish to be exposed to. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=931.76s)]
*  But if you open the television and the main channels, not only the right-wing, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=939.2s)]
*  you know, lunatic channel, but the main substantial channels, they don't cover anything. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=944.4s)]
*  And then there is this law outlawing Al Jazeera, they shut their offices down. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=952.88s)]
*  So Al Jazeera is forbidden anyway. You cannot, when you're in Israel, you really cannot watch that. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=960.24s)]
*  I mean, you just have to have some ingenuity in how to overcome that. But if you don't want, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=965.52s)]
*  and you don't know how to do this, even this channel is blocked from, how would they know? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=972.64s)]
*  It's a case study of dehumanization, isn't it? I mean, because in any society, the number of [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=980.3199999999999s)]
*  people who are sociopathic is very low, it's like 2%. What actually, do you think this, you know, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=984.56s)]
*  if we look at all the atrocities in human history, they're often, and this is uncomfortable to accept, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=989.5999999999999s)]
*  they're often perpetrated and supported by people who in other contexts are kind, generous, warm, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=994.0799999999999s)]
*  they cry over sad things, they want to help people around them. But they stop thinking of certain [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=999.1999999999999s)]
*  people as human beings. And as soon as you get to that point, then you can support any level of [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1004.4799999999999s)]
*  violence and barbarity. I mean, that's what's happening, isn't it? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1008.4799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well, this is something I actually wrote about at length in my philosophical capacity, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1012.72s)]
*  so I can speak about that. What I'm thinking, and this is indeed a philosophical argument, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1019.12s)]
*  I'm thinking that the whole way we're thinking about morality and politics is misguided. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1026.56s)]
*  Because people, even on the left, they think that morality somehow is laid at the background or [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1031.3600000000001s)]
*  is a basis. And it's abstract and it's pure. And politics is something dirty that, you know, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1038.32s)]
*  comes after. Whereas I think it's the other way around. I think it's the left politics that are [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1044.24s)]
*  the basic. And then morality and ethics just follow them and follow the history of lefty struggles. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1050.88s)]
*  And this is how morality is shaped and should be shaped. But if you don't think in this way, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1058.4s)]
*  then one can understand how the emptiness, the shallowness, the [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1065.76s)]
*  poverty of ethics, as I called it, the poverty of ethics doesn't lead anywhere. I mean, you can do [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1076.32s)]
*  anything you wish with general principles or sympathy. Sympathy to whom, when, what's the [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1082.0800000000002s)]
*  context. Just a couple of final things on this. I mean, what hope do you have partly of this [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1089.68s)]
*  working? I mean, if we look in Britain, for example, if you look at the polling, to be honest, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1096.96s)]
*  public opinion is actually on the side. I mean, the polling shows 70% of the population think [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1100.48s)]
*  Israel has committed war crimes. The vast majority support a total arms embargo. And 55%, according [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1105.6000000000001s)]
*  to YouGov, support the arrest of Benjamin Netanyahu for war crimes and crimes against humanity. And [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1112.4s)]
*  yet the government, I mean, we could say, look, I mean, they've restored funding to UNRWA, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1118.8s)]
*  they stopped the vexatious case against the International Criminal Court's case, and they [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1123.36s)]
*  stopped 8% of arms sales and then apologized for it. But do you see, I mean, it's still, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1131.76s)]
*  we're nowhere near imposing sanctions. I mean, I just cannot imagine this government doing that. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1136.72s)]
*  So what do you think? How much do you think this letter could help galvanize and shift that? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1142.08s)]
*  Our idea was, and this is why we translated it to many languages, that it will somehow drive people [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1147.2s)]
*  in several states to push, you know, to do our work. And some of that is our own work. I mean, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1155.6s)]
*  I wish I'd find a way to go and speak to people, you know, influencing policy, maybe David Lammy, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1162.0s)]
*  I don't know, maybe who would be ready to meet me, but maybe Stammer, I don't know. But maybe [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1170.8s)]
*  something can be moved. I mean, sitting back and not doing anything because we are impotent is not [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1184.72s)]
*  a good idea. So we're trying. And I don't know, maybe in some other places, I just spoke this [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1190.8s)]
*  morning with the radio in Ireland and maybe Ireland is more open to such sanctions and then [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1198.4s)]
*  England will follow through. So, you know, or maybe in Norway, which is another I'm talking about, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1204.16s)]
*  about states which already expressed some sympathy, you know, more than a vocal commiserations. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1211.68s)]
*  So maybe this will be the procedure. We really don't know. So I'm not hopeful. I'm not hopeful [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1219.3600000000001s)]
*  at all. I mean, I actually lost my political imagination during this last year I was. But [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1226.08s)]
*  now I don't see any future. I don't know what will happen when this stops. But at least we have to [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1234.24s)]
*  stop that. Well, on that, I mean, yeah, just so I don't end on a totally hopeless note, obviously, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1239.4399999999998s)]
*  I mean, just it's interesting you mentioned Ireland and Ireland is has this position, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1244.96s)]
*  partly thanks to us, it's because they obviously have the experience of being occupied against [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1248.96s)]
*  their will and starved and suffering terrible horrors, which is engendered a certain empathy [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1252.88s)]
*  and solidarity. Just on that, though, when I interviewed, I've interviewed Gideon Levy, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1258.8000000000002s)]
*  the Israeli journalist many times, he suggested hope would actually come from the United States [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1262.8000000000002s)]
*  in that public opinion there is shifting. But he felt it was a pretty big time frame. He said 10 [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1267.92s)]
*  to 15 years. But do you think that's basically how this ends? It's the US hegemon, although will it [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1273.5200000000002s)]
*  remain the world's hegemon? Open question there. But nonetheless, you know, it will be forced to [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1281.28s)]
*  shift its position. I mean, actually, it's interesting, the most pro-Israel part of America, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1288.0s)]
*  of course, are white evangelical Christians, far more so than the Jewish population in the United [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1292.24s)]
*  States. What do you think? I mean, do you think it's the US? Do you see that in the US that actually [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1297.52s)]
*  that? No, I think I disagree with Gideon there. I hope. I mean, again, we should sow the seeds [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1301.92s)]
*  wherever, wherever and then see what what comes out of that. But I don't see this because, as I [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1310.64s)]
*  said, I mean, there's something in the American mentality that wouldn't wouldn't go far enough from [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1317.8400000000001s)]
*  the Israeli, the Israeli policy. And we see this now. I don't believe that Biden really wanted this [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1324.4s)]
*  war to stop because if he really wanted this war to stop, it would have stopped. Yeah, he could have [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1333.3600000000001s)]
*  done that. It's not enough to that. This is actually what was part of the thing that drove us [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1339.6s)]
*  to write this letter, because, you know, enough with these words. And we wrote about we wrote [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1347.04s)]
*  exactly that in this petition. Enough with the words. Don't say you're sorry. Do something. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1354.7199999999998s)]
*  Well, very finally, because I do want some sort of hopeful note. And it's hard in the circumstances. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1360.32s)]
*  How about this? Let's do this final angle. Accountability. It's so important with a crime [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1364.56s)]
*  of this scale and gravity that people cannot say, I did not know. And what your letter does [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1370.0s)]
*  is help on the record that there were there were substantial numbers of people within Israel itself [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1377.1200000000001s)]
*  who knew what was going on. And they spoke out and they use their voices collectively in difficult [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1382.96s)]
*  circumstances. And they said, we know what is happening and action must be taken immediately. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1388.0s)]
*  So then it can't be an excuse, whatever the failings of Israeli media for others, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1394.72s)]
*  particularly empowered to go, we didn't know what was going on. Do you think accountability, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1399.84s)]
*  this is this letter helps? Maybe, maybe it will. I think I would expect accountability to come, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1403.52s)]
*  first of all, from Al Jazeera's report, because I suppose, you know, they had this [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1410.16s)]
*  investigative report about the war crimes committed by the soldiers, according to their [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1416.8s)]
*  own testimonies. And what they showed is a set of clips. Those soldiers, they filmed themselves [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1421.9199999999998s)]
*  happy, rejoicing when they demolished houses. So if this is not, if this cannot account for [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1432.96s)]
*  accountability or dry accountability, I don't know what would. But yeah, perhaps this letter [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1442.64s)]
*  will help in this. I think so. Look, it was very morally courageous. It's obviously the right thing [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1449.3600000000001s)]
*  to do. And, you know, history will vindicate those such as yourself who did take a stand during a [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1456.0s)]
*  terrible, terrible crime. And we have to live in hope to believe that one day there will be [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstZREKPkHs&t=1462.5600000000002s)]
