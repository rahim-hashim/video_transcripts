Video Description: Violent deaths caused by Israeli weapons are now thought to be well over 30,000 once you include those buried under the rubble. That's horrific on its own terms - but the deadliest threat doesn't come from bombs and bullets.

I'm joined by UN Special Rapporteur Pedro Arrojo-Agudo to discuss the big threat too few are talking about.

# How Water Became Israel's Most Genocidal Potential Weapon
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_9oUFqPs-4)
*  Hello, now we are well over 100 days into the current horror in Gaza.
*  Now, many of us of course are aware of the hideous death toll caused directly from violence.
*  That's of course Israeli missiles, bullets.
*  The truly grotesque truth is that generally speaking in war,
*  the vast majority of the final death toll is not made up of those who died directly because of the
*  violence but because of other factors. That being including for example the collapse of the healthcare
*  system, the lack of availability of food and of course fresh water. Now with that in mind I'm
*  really delighted to be joined by Pedro Arruca, how do I say that, Pedro Arroco Agudo, thank you
*  very much, Arroco Agudo, who is the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the human rights to safe
*  drinking water and sanitation. Pedro, it's a big honor to speak to you, how you doing?
*  Thank you, it's a pleasure to be with you.
*  I just want to start with the question of water. Obviously as people know, one of the basic building
*  blocks of life, without access to fresh water humans die very quickly. Now in terms of Gaza,
*  before the war began, can you tell me what the situation was regarding the access of
*  2.2 million or so Palestinians living in Gaza before the war, obviously the longest
*  siege in modern history that they've been exposed to, what was the situation in terms of access to
*  water? Can you explain what that means because a lot of people just think drinking water but of
*  course we need water for lots of things. Well you have to take into account that the people living
*  in Gaza is as you said 2.3 million people around, but the majority of these people,
*  mostly around 60% of these people are not living there because they want to live there.
*  They are refugees displaced forcefully by the Israeli arm, the Israel in the last time,
*  and forced to live in refugee camps in the Gaza Strip. First this question,
*  you know it's a so crowded space, a small piece of territory. So the other question is all these
*  people, as the only source of fresh water is the coastal aquifer that is shared in fact also with
*  Israel, but for the people in the Palestinian people in Gaza is the only source of fresh water.
*  This aquifer has the replenishment, natural replenishment of the aquifer is more or less
*  60 cubic hectometers per year and less and less with the climate change. During the last
*  16 years with the blockade they were obliged to pump three times more than three times more water
*  than the water is replenishing in a natural way. So this has provoked the salination,
*  intense salination by seawater intrusion during this time. On the other hand, the sanitation
*  is very difficult because the most of the materials needed for making drinkable the water and for
*  for for for depuring for treating the wastewater is considered by Israel as double use materials
*  and is blocked, it's not allowed. So the sanitation is there is a lack of sanitation during this time,
*  there is this 15, 16 years, no? The result is intense and progressive
*  contamination with fecal contamination of the aquifer. So in fact during this time
*  the population had no the possibility of employing the aquifer as drinking water. Well,
*  they employed because they were forced but it was not drinking water properly. The only source of
*  drinking water were the water provided by the two big plants, the desalination plants built by
*  the European Union and UNICEF. But with this water it was just possible to provide to supply
*  40 percent of the population. So this was the situation before the war. Once the war began
*  the situation were more aggravated of course. So let's talk about that because clearly then
*  Gaza's population was already very vulnerable for lots of reasons because of the siege but
*  including of course water. Now we've had the mass displacement of the population of Gaza, obviously
*  the vast majority of over 85 percent have been displaced forcibly from their homes into an ever
*  smaller corner in southern Gaza. What's happened now in terms of access, people's access to water
*  in the here and now? What's the kind of situation in terms of what water people can actually
*  access that's clean and safe and what are the health impacts for that? For different people as
*  well because I mean for example pregnant women, about 20,000 women have given birth or so since
*  the war began. So tell me about that. Well you have to take into account that Gaza is a very flat
*  territory so in order to make working, to work with the supply network
*  is not possible by gravity. You need to pump the water so from the moment that the energy is
*  collapsed and they have no more energy the network collapsed also. So people had known these 2.3
*  million people didn't have water in the top at home or close to the house from the moment of the
*  war began nearly. So that means that the people mainly women and children has to go to the streets
*  looking for water in the middle of the bombing. This is the situation. At the end they can get
*  some amount of water. I suppose they had some reserves of water. In a moment one of the plants
*  was able to work at 5% of the intensity they can and they have some little water but
*  mixed or directly from the aquifer. The aquifer is absolutely contaminated with fecal contamination
*  because of course also the plants for treatment that exist are also stopped because of the
*  collapse of energy. So at present the water they have is contaminated water and salty water.
*  UNICEF gave me some days ago the data of more than 70,000 children with diarrhea per week. That means
*  situation in which without medical help you have dehydration processes that will be accelerated
*  if the only water you have is very salty water. So I'm sure but I have no the data. That means
*  thousands of victims but silent victims. You know is like I used to say is this lack of drinking
*  water not just the amount of water but the quality of water is like a silent bomb but is
*  level the same that the bombs they are employing. And it is important to say that
*  the combination of lack of food, lack of drinking water, contamination and lack of medicines
*  and medical help. I mean at the moment we already have an official death toll which is absolutely
*  hideous which is over 25,000 who've been killed and many of them children. But that's an
*  underestimate because it excludes those buried under the rubble. So it's well over 30,000 and
*  many of those have to be said so we won't go into graphic detail but maybe never identified
*  because of decomposition. The hungry dogs of Gaza. I mean I don't again want to go into too much
*  detail but it's a horrific situation. But the point is that isn't it the case that in war
*  generally speaking it isn't actually the violence that kills generally speaking most people. It's
*  as I've said before it's the collapse of things like as you mentioned lack of medicine but also
*  things like water. So are we already seeing Gazans dying because of a lack of availability of water
*  and is that not included in the official death toll? Is there basically an extra
*  number of people currently dying because of access to water that
*  were not even including in what is already an underestimate of those who were killed?
*  Of course I'm sure. I have asked about this but there is no data. I have no
*  data on this but you can imagine more than 70,000 children with diaries. What is the proportion of
*  people that can die in this situation? And it begins to have the risk of that of disentry
*  and other epidemics in a so crowded territory without any kind of hygiene possibilities.
*  So that could be really a bomb of an arm of massive destruction but silent bomb, silent
*  weapon. And we are not, you can imagine yourself, your family without water in these conditions
*  because if you don't eat too much for one month it's possible to continue to live
*  bad but it's possible but water is necessary every day for everything and every day so
*  the situation is terrible. I mean we've heard reports that the Israeli army may flood the
*  tunnels, they say the tunnel network which belongs to Hamas and what could that mean in terms of the
*  aquifer which you mentioned and what can that mean in terms of the conditions that sustain life? If
*  those tunnels are flooded with seawater could that mean the aquifer then is completely
*  undrinkable and what does that mean in practice? Yeah of course with this measure is evident
*  that the social impact for the future will be a disaster because as I said the only
*  source of fresh water for the people living in Gaza is of course the aquifer. I said to you before
*  it reminds me of that terrible measure in ancient times which consisted of sowing
*  lands with salt, the lands of the enemy. Yeah the expression salting the earth.
*  Salting the earth okay excuse me thank you very much. Once the enemy was defeated in order to make
*  to make life in those territories impossible for the future now. Looking to the future this is the
*  question. We should imagine a future of peace but for this water in the aquifer is necessary.
*  So we need precisely restoring this coastal aquifer as the base for the future, as the base
*  for the people who need to live to have the life in this territory. If this is if the aquifer is
*  definitely salinated we can need decades for recovering this source of life. So in this sense
*  is in tune, is in line with this the denunciation of genocide that we are going from the
*  from the United Nations rapporteur, the majority almost all the United Nations rapporteur and
*  experts is in line with this perspective of making impossible the life for the future,
*  for the future generations. I mean just just lastly on that so in terms of as you know UN special
*  rapporteurs I've interviewed one of your colleagues Francesca Albanese who is for those who don't know
*  do check out the interview I did with her but she's the UN special rapporteur on human rights
*  in the occupied territories of Palestine but along many of you and this was back even mid-October
*  you issued a warning of the risk of genocide in Gaza. Is it true then that because again there's
*  been so much focus clearly on bombs and that's actually part of it because you destroy the
*  infrastructure and you know I mean there's lots of elements to this as well it's agriculture being
*  destroyed obviously there's a huge number of pillars to this but could this prove to be one
*  of the biggest if not maybe the biggest risk of genocide which is if you which is Israel denying
*  a civilian population who is already has you know lack of access to medical care, lack of access to
*  food, injured, pregnant, you know a whole range of people with underlying health conditions.
*  Could this prove the absolutely the most important pillar potentially of genocide and of
*  a repeated threat by many Israeli ministers which is to ethnically cleanse Gaza to make
*  Gaza inhospitable so you force people out and those who remain die?
*  Yes we are denouncing this situation with with respect to the specific question in which I have
*  my work is water and sanitation. I invite you to read just the article seven of the statute of Rome
*  with respect to crime against humanity and this article seven explicitly
*  characterizes as a crime against humanity in the way of extermination. One food,
*  medicines, and basic issues for life such as water are blocked so this crime of extermination
*  is in the way of course together with all the other questions you have mentioned
*  and it's not just a puntual question or an attack. It's something that is has an approach
*  and the approach when authorities of the army and ministers are talking about even
*  about children as sons and daughters of the darkness. This kind of expressions and no one
*  say anything against this from the government is inviting to the genocide so we cannot remain
*  passive before this. It's very important and it's very important the Israeli opinion the people
*  are from Israel are also even if it is a minority denouncing this situation now
*  is not acceptable for the whole world and democratic world particularly.
*  So I'm just very finally on that for clarity. Is it your view that Israel is knowingly committing
*  a crime against humanity on the question of access to water? Yes absolutely. I think before
*  there were also crimes against the human rights to water and sanitation before the war as I explained
*  in my last thematic report before the General Assembly of the UN in New York before the beginning
*  of the war I was talking about Gaza in a moment in a just paragraph you know talking about Gaza as a
*  concentration camp without precedent in the world because the people had no the possibility of having
*  a chance to get in for guarantee that the children came to water and sanitation but now the situation
*  is of course terrible much worse and yes I think we are in front of a genocide process if we are
*  not able to stop the war. Pedro Grimsdorf many of the interviews we're currently doing obviously are
*  pretty shocking and I think this is I think needs spelling out because as I've said I think
*  understandably there's been so much focus on the specific deaths from violence but this could
*  potentially be a source of far more death and also part of a you know it's not conspiratorial to talk
*  about the open strategy of many Israeli politicians to make Gaza inhospitable for the Palestinian
*  population to drive them out so it's really important that we talk about this and spell this out.
*  For those watching listening whatever do share this press like and subscribe we're going to get
*  the message out the danger which Pedro spells out but Pedro I really really appreciate it thank you
*  so much. Thank you to you.
