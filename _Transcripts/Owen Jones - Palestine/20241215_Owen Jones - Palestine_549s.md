# Israel's BIGGEST Lie Destroyed By Horrifying New Report
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [December 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrhGKDpH0vA)
*  This new devastating report into Israel's bombing campaign against the people of Gaza
*  exposes the genocidal mayhem unleashed by the Israeli state. It leaves no place to hide,
*  non-zero for defenders of the Israeli state and its murderous behaviour in Gaza.
*  All of their arguments, all of their defences destroyed, buried in the rubble indeed of Gaza.
*  For those of us who live in states which have armed and facilitated this genocide,
*  we have a responsibility to know what this report says. That's what we're going to talk about.
*  After all, the human catastrophe which has enveloped the Palestinian people was made possible
*  because of the weaponry handed to Israel by western states, principally by the United States,
*  but the British government as an example still gives Israel the crucial components needed for
*  the F-35 jets which have reduced much of Gaza to an apocalyptic wasteland.
*  This new report is produced by Air Wars. It's a UK-based organisation founded one decade ago or so,
*  which came to prominence by tracking and archiving the aerial bombardment of so-called Islamic State,
*  ISIS and other such jihadi groups in Iraq and Syria in particular. They're run by a team of
*  experts and their impact goals, as described on their website, include to pressure governments
*  and military actors to acknowledge and take responsibility for the fall human toll of their
*  actions, ensure measures to prevent human suffering particularly amongst civilian
*  populations are centred in military policy and practice. This report focuses on the first 25
*  days of the onslaught against Gaza after Israeli President Isaac Herzog declared there were no
*  uninvolved civilians in Gaza, when the defence minister and an Israeli general charged with
*  civilian affairs had described those civilians as human animals and human beasts who, as the
*  latter put it, would only get damaged in hell. It's important to just put that here when I'm
*  talking about this report because always remember they didn't hide what they were going to do,
*  they made it clear and we can link the overwhelming evidence produced by Air Wars to the stated intent
*  of the Israeli state. Now according to Air Wars, at least 5,139 civilians were killed in October
*  2023 in Gaza, bear in mind its pre-war population was about 2.2 million. Of those at least 1,900
*  children were killed. And bear in mind the vast majority of this was before the ground invasion.
*  Air Wars say it is by far the most intense, destructive and fatal conflict for civilians
*  that Air Wars has ever documented. The statistics speak for themselves and leave any suggestion that
*  the Israeli state has sought to prevent civilian harm exposed for what it is, the unforgivable sin
*  of atrocity denial. Just listen to this, Air Wars looked at 606 incidents of civilian harm in this
*  25 day period. In those 606 incidents in which at least 5,139 civilians were killed,
*  guess how many militants they established had been killed? Between 30 and 58. An academic who
*  goes under History Speaks on Twitter who I recommend has done a pie chart graph which
*  exposes the murderous absurdity of this crime. As the graph shows, 99.4% of these incidents killed
*  civilians with 0.6% killing militants. The most moral army in the world.
*  Indeed, what these statistics expose is a naked war of extermination. They find that when a named
*  individual is killed, an average of 14 members of his or her family were also killed. Indeed,
*  in the first year, over 900 entire Palestinian bloodlines in Gaza, that is entire extended
*  families, from little babies to great grandparents, have been wiped from the face of the earth.
*  I've said this before, but it's worth stating, if just one extended family in Britain,
*  with a population over 30 times bigger than Gaza's pre-war population, if just one extended family
*  were all violently wiped out here, that would be a national tragedy remembered as such long
*  after the horror happened. 900 entire bloodlines. Let me read this particular paragraph from the
*  Air Wars report. Families were killed together in unprecedented numbers and in their homes.
*  More than 9 out of 10 women and children were killed in residential buildings. In more than
*  95% of all cases where a woman was killed, at least one child was also killed.
*  Air Wars looked at where Palestinian civilians were being killed, and overwhelmingly they were
*  being killed in their own homes, often in their own beds. Over 90% of female or child fatalities
*  took place in residential buildings. A little note here, obviously it's the case that so many
*  Palestinian men are not quote unquote legitimate targets either. In this context, women and children
*  are referred to because we are automatically able to conclude without further discussion that they
*  are civilians. That doesn't mean we should disregard how many men have been butchered,
*  for example, the first responders on the scene who were often victims of double tap attacks by
*  the Israeli state. Now Israel's defenders have repeatedly claimed this mass slaughter is caused
*  by the use of so-called human shields in Gaza. Even on its own terms, this is a nonsense,
*  under international law, potential harm to civilians can only be justified proportionate
*  to a military advantage, and where necessary precautions are thereby taken. But in any case,
*  the evidence for human shields is simply not there. The justifications go along the lines of
*  oh there's a big block of flats, in those flats there's someone we've decided, or an artificial
*  intelligence system has decided, a comment to that, is a legitimate military target. We're going to
*  blow up that block of flats and kill a load of civilians and then we'll behave as though all the
*  people in that block are all human shields. As it is, Gaza is one of the most densely populated
*  communities on earth. And it should be said that when Iranian missile strikes targeted Israel,
*  there was chatter about how a potential strike on the headquarters of Mossad, the Israeli
*  intelligence services, could impair all civilian lives because it's surrounded by civilian
*  infrastructure, as is the IDF headquarters surrounded by civilian flats, shopping malls,
*  therefore is the IDF and Mossad using human shields? Also there's overwhelming evidence,
*  even covered by the likes of the New York Times and CNN, that it is in fact Israel which keeps
*  using Palestinian civilians as human shields because every accusation is a confession.
*  And we know from Plus 975 magazine that, as I indicated there, artificial intelligence
*  systems are used to identify targets without any human input, including one called, I wish I
*  would say, I kid you, no, this is a joke, a dark joke, a really messed up joke. It's called Where's
*  Daddy? That's the program the Israeli state uses, where literally what happens is a man who is deemed
*  a target, however low lying, and in many cases the AI has just selected someone who isn't in
*  any way a legitimate target of any description, they get home and then they are blown up along
*  with their children, their family, their neighbours. As Air Wars find, when civilians were killed
*  alongside family members, at least 15 other members were killed. They note this is higher
*  than any other conflict documented by Air Wars. Indeed, they show a graph comparing how many
*  Palestinian civilians were killed in October 2023 with the most lethal month recorded in Iraq
*  in the battle against ISIS during the Battle of Mosul in March 2017, where they find 1,470
*  civilians were killed by the US led coalition compared to over 5,000 in Gaza. They look at
*  the offensives against ISIS, which have often been used by apologists for Israel's genocide to
*  suggest, well, lots of civilians were killed there, so this is okay. They find that in the
*  Battle of Raqqa, and this is our specialty by the way, in the Battle of Raqqa in Iraq against ISIS
*  in that whole four month period, there were less than half the civilian fatalities as in Gaza in
*  that first 25 days. This isn't a war, it's genocide. This is what extermination looks like.
*  There's no attempt to protect civilians from harm here. You can see that. Here's a key point. The
*  vast majority of civilians are not going to be killed by the violence. We know that from precedent.
*  I'm afraid in military onslaughts, which are far less destructive, even still they're very
*  destructive, but it's not the bombs or the bullets, it's other causes. The destruction of
*  the fundamentals of society like healthcare, housing, access to water, food, that's what's
*  going to kill the biggest number of Palestinians. I hate to say it, it's the truth. Air Force have
*  done an incredibly important report here and they detail one element, one element of the
*  extermination that the Palestinian people are suffering. It's one element and it's hideous
*  enough, but it's only going to be a minority. They were looking only at the first few weeks,
*  obviously every single day. Every single day Palestinians are just wiped out with no headlines,
*  wiped out, normalized. We'll never recover from this. We'll never be forgiven. The consequences
*  will be catastrophic. I can assure you there's no point pretending. This is one of the worst
*  atrocities of our age and it is up to us to keep screaming about it, screaming about it as loudly
*  as we can. Please like and subscribe, leave your thoughts, your comments, help us take on the
*  progenocide media page at www.patreon.com. Next week I have one of the most important pieces of
*  work I've ever worked on, which has taken me months, which exposes the BBC's coverage of the
*  genocide based on interviews with multiple BBC journalists. So I very much look forward to finally
*  publishing that. That'll be next week, hopefully middle of next week. Press like, subscribe and
*  I'll speak to you soon.
