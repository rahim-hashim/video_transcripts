# He DESTROYS Israelâ€™s Iran LIES - w/. Trita Parsi
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk)
*  He destroys the propaganda in support of Israel's illegal and unprovoked assault on Iran. I spoke [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=0.0s)]
*  to Trita Parsi. He's an Iranian-Swedish right-wing analyst. He was the former president of the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=5.36s)]
*  National Iranian American Council and the co-founder of the Quincy Institute for Responsible [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=9.76s)]
*  Statecraft. I start by asking him about his assessment of where things currently stand [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=14.64s)]
*  with Israel's assault. Well, I think we are in a situation in which within 24, 48 hours, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=19.04s)]
*  Israelis came back to the US and said, you know what, we promised you that all you needed to do [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  is to give us a green light to do this. And we didn't need your help. But actually, we want you [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=28.88s)]
*  to come in and take over the operations and finish the job because at the end of the day, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=33.36s)]
*  the Israelis started something they knew they could not finish. And I don't think that was a [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=38.48s)]
*  coincidence. I just didn't think it was going to happen within 24 hours. The Israelis have been [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=43.84s)]
*  hit hard back by the Iranians. Clearly, Iran is not a match for Israel technologically. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  Israeli control over Tehran and much of Iran right now, which is devastating for the Iranians. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=54.48s)]
*  But this is not the same war in which the Israelis are bombing refugees in camps. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  This is a war in which they're actually being struck back. And we saw that a very large number [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=66.64s)]
*  of Iranian missiles are penetrating Israel's air defenses. They have been testing new missiles. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=70.72s)]
*  They've been exploring holes in the air defense systems of Israel. And yesterday, apparently, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=76.96s)]
*  they only shot one missile and that one got through. So I think the Iranians are pacing [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=82.0s)]
*  themselves preparing for a long war. And in that process are increasingly wearing down Israel's [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=86.32s)]
*  air defense systems. So this is going to be a very costly thing. And the Israelis are going to use [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=93.44s)]
*  that in order to try to push the US into that war. Now, whether Trump actually is moving towards [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=98.48s)]
*  diplomacy, or whether this two week talk is just an effort to lull the Iranians into a false sense [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=103.68s)]
*  of security and then strike them in the midst of that remains to be seen. But I suspect that [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=110.56s)]
*  the Iranians are very, very suspicious. What do you make of Israeli ministers saying after [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=114.72s)]
*  the attack, the strike on an Israeli hospital in the south, that this was a despicable war crime, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=121.28s)]
*  which shows that the Supreme Leader of Iran needs to be taken out? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=127.84s)]
*  Well, the Israelis are pushing for the Supreme Leader to be taken out because they know that [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  that will cause all out war that will force the US into the war. So whatever yet happens, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=136.48s)]
*  they're going to constantly go back to that. In regards to the hit that apparently came close [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=141.04s)]
*  to the hospital, obviously, hospitals are off limits. Now, it happens to be, which has been [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  revealed that the Israelis are putting all of their intelligence and military sites very close [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  to hospitals, and in midst of civilian populations, etc. All the things that they accuse Hamas of [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  doing, they're doing themselves. And Israelis are actually pointing that out on Western media. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=162.0s)]
*  But I think the bigger picture here is that for the last year and a half, and even before that, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=167.36s)]
*  but particularly in the last year and a half, the Israelis have waged a war against international [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=172.8s)]
*  law. They have deliberately tried to erase all norms around the use of force. And to a large [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=178.32s)]
*  extent, they succeeded because the Europeans now are endorsing and legitimizing what the Israelis [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=184.24s)]
*  are doing, not just turning a blind eye by actually explicitly endorsing it. But that is [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=189.36s)]
*  now coming to back and haunt Israel because they're no longer fighting a power that they're not just [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=195.44000000000003s)]
*  bombing refugees in camps any longer. So there's a bite back now. And we see that ultimately, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=201.28s)]
*  the establishment of these norms and these laws are actually for the better good of everyone, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  because you can always end up being on the receiving end of these things. And now when [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=212.24s)]
*  you have destroyed these norms, you're paying the price for it. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=215.92s)]
*  A lot of the commentary, I mean, it's coming from the Israeli government, but a lot of Western media [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=219.83999999999997s)]
*  outlets suggest the Islamic Republic is basically just a house of cards waiting to totter. And that [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  Israeli strikes could just, you know, the whole thing could come falling over regime changes on [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  the cards. This is all very weak. What do you think of that? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=234.32s)]
*  Look, this regime in Iran is very unpopular and one day it will fall. I don't think it's [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=238.23999999999998s)]
*  going to happen anytime soon, however. And I think you've seen a significant rallying around [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=241.92s)]
*  the flag phenomena in Iran and the population not rallying around the government, not just [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=245.76s)]
*  they're rallying around the country, which also was quite predictable. But I think there's something [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=252.79999999999998s)]
*  else going on here, which is a deliberate attempt to manufacture consent to think that the Iranians [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=257.52s)]
*  are extremely weak and that all that is needed is a little bit of a push and they will fall. And this [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=264.24s)]
*  is going to be a remarkable success for the Israelis. The utility of that narrative, which [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=269.84s)]
*  I find highly questionable, is that it reduces the likelihood of Trump shifting towards diplomacy, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=274.96s)]
*  because why should he have diplomacy if he can just get the Iranians to surrender? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=281.28s)]
*  And it increases the likelihood of Trump getting into the war because if it's so easy, then why not [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=284.96s)]
*  do it and take credit for the final win? But in reality, the picture is much, much different, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=291.52s)]
*  I would say. So for instance, take a look at how there was a bit of a lull in the number of missiles [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=297.67999999999995s)]
*  the Iranians launched at Israel for about 48 hours. There were several different explanations [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=302.4s)]
*  for this. One, yes, the Israelis have successfully targeted a lot of the Iranian launchers, which [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=307.76s)]
*  makes it more difficult for them to send large number of missiles. But there were also other [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=312.47999999999996s)]
*  factors at play. A, the Iranians were testing new missiles. B, they were testing the air defense [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=316.79999999999995s)]
*  systems to try to find better holes in it in order to increase the accuracy of their missiles. Three, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=321.59999999999997s)]
*  they were holding off because they were playing a long game instead of throwing everything at [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=327.59999999999997s)]
*  once. All of those factors were part of the answer. The only factor you heard on mainstream [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=332.16s)]
*  media was the first one. The Israelis have been successful in taking out their air defense system. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=337.92s)]
*  And this is part of the reason why I think all viewers have to be really clear. In a war, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=342.56s)]
*  the first thing that dies is true. And the amount of misinformation, disinformation, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=347.44000000000005s)]
*  distraction that is now currently being aired on mainstream media is stunning, not just on American, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=353.36s)]
*  on Israeli and on Iranian. You have to be suspicious of all of that because these are [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=358.16s)]
*  attempts to manufacture consent towards a specific policy option. And in this case, it is the policy [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=363.04s)]
*  option of more war. I mean, on that in terms of misinformation, I mean, obviously Israel is nuclear [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=369.28000000000003s)]
*  armed. Iran isn't. No one actually is claiming Iran is nuclear armed. But Netanyahu, who has for the [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=374.8s)]
*  last 30 years claimed Iran is immediately going to get a nuclear weapon. And we know Tulsi Gabbard, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=380.88s)]
*  the US director of national intelligence appointed by Trump said three months ago that the [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=386.32s)]
*  consensus of the intelligence community in the US is that it wasn't. What do you make of all this? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=390.96s)]
*  What do you make of the whole pretext? No, I think the pretext is laughable. It's weaker than it was [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=394.64s)]
*  during the invasion of Iraq. And also another thing that I think is very disturbing in all of [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=401.68s)]
*  this is the European reaction. European reaction after October 7th was that Israel has a right to [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=408.71999999999997s)]
*  defend itself. And then that just became bigger and bigger. It didn't matter what kind of war [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=414.32s)]
*  crimes or aggression Israel was pursuing. The Europeans kept on saying Israel has a right to [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=418.08s)]
*  defend itself, pointing back to October 7th, which was an attack on Israel. So on the surface of it, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=423.04s)]
*  you can say, well, this is a reaction to October 7th. What are they pointing to now? When they're [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=430.71999999999997s)]
*  starting all of their statements saying Israel has a right to defend itself? What was the Iranian [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=436.0s)]
*  attack that they were defending themselves against? There's neither an Iranian attack or [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=440.16s)]
*  an imminent Iranian attack that were about to occur. So what you're seeing is that the [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=444.24s)]
*  Europeans are debasing themselves. They're destroying the very norms and international [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=449.04s)]
*  law that has been at the bedrock of European security for the last couple of decades. And [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=454.16s)]
*  they're doing it for a war criminal in Tel Aviv who was wanted by the international court of the ICC. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=458.72s)]
*  To me, this is stunning. I mean, someone who's grown up in Europe to see how Europe has shifted [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=466.08000000000004s)]
*  from being in the last couple of decades of force that actually did everything it could to stand up [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=471.04s)]
*  against the Iraq war to one that is now actually adding fuel to the fire and has become a [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=475.6s)]
*  destabilizing force in the world, at least key parts of Europe. There's still countries like [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=480.24s)]
*  Spain that are going in the opposite in the right direction. But what I'm seeing coming out of the [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=485.36s)]
*  UK, out of France, out of Germany, is devastating for Europe itself. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=490.08s)]
*  I mean, it has succeeded though in deflecting the limited but growing pressure on Israel over Gaza. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=494.8s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. I don't think that's the reason why the Israelis did it [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=501.84s)]
*  necessarily. But it definitely has shifted the narrative. We were starting to see that [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=505.52s)]
*  the Europeans started to become a little bit better on these issues, pushing back a little [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=510.64s)]
*  bit after seeing after the European publics were seeing that the Israelis were using [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=514.96s)]
*  starvation of children as a weapon of war. But nevertheless, that has shifted. But the larger [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=520.08s)]
*  picture is Europe has by and large lost its entire independence. It's becoming an appendix to the [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=526.0s)]
*  United States. And in this specific case, the United States is following Israel's lead. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=533.5200000000001s)]
*  Europeans have to ask themselves the same thing, that an increasing number of Americans, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=538.5600000000001s)]
*  particularly on the right, and this is a very interesting phenomenon, are asking themselves, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=544.0s)]
*  how is this good for America? I'm stunned to see that there's so little conversation in Europe [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=548.24s)]
*  about how is this good for Europe? What do you think the prospects of Trump entering the war? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=553.6s)]
*  I mean, because at the moment, it's, you know, he's kind of teasing everyone. What do you think of [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=560.32s)]
*  the genuine prospects of US direct involvement? I think the risk of that is still very high. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=564.72s)]
*  Even the talk about potential moving towards diplomacy could be a ruse. It could be something [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=571.92s)]
*  that he's doing to lull the Iranians into a false sense of security. That's exactly what happened [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=578.16s)]
*  last week. He kept on talking about diplomacy. Talks were scheduled for Sunday. Everyone's guards [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=582.3199999999999s)]
*  was down. Every European diplomat I spoke to only talked about, do you think Israel will strike [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=587.6s)]
*  after Sunday? Instead, the Israelis struck on Friday and took everyone by surprise. None more [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=593.1999999999999s)]
*  than the Iranians themselves, in which, frankly, criminal neglect by the Iranian military, in which [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=598.9599999999999s)]
*  their heads were actually sleeping in their apartments in Tehran with zero security measures. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=603.92s)]
*  After that, I think it's very difficult for the Iranians to trust this, but nevertheless, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=608.4799999999999s)]
*  they would be foolish not to explore diplomacy. I suspect that they will. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=612.7199999999999s)]
*  I think as part of all of this, we have to keep in mind that if you compare this to Iraq, in 2003, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=617.5999999999999s)]
*  71% of the American public favored the invasion of Iraq prior to the invasion. 91% of Republicans [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=625.5999999999999s)]
*  did. Now, you have a situation in which 16% of Republicans are in favor of this, 20% or so percent [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLbpOvhveDk&t=633.6s)]
