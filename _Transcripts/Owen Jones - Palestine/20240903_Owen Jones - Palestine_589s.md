# Israel Is COLLAPSING Israeli General
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [September 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBRlq7Hadno)
*  The headline says it all. It is not Hamas that is collapsing, but Israel. This is a headline in the
*  Israeli newspaper Haaretz and the author is Yitzhak Brick, who is a former general in the
*  IDF, the so-called Israel Defense Force, the Israeli military, who is slightly older himself
*  than the state of Israel and who was decorated with the medal of courage in the 1973 Yom Kippur war.
*  Now it begins as follows. Most of the pretentious declarations made by Defense Minister Jov Galant
*  throughout the war in Gaza have proven to be groundless. After the occupation of Gaza City,
*  he said that Israel was in total control of the city and its tunnels and within a short
*  time Hamas would surrender. After the occupation of Khan Yunis, he claimed that Hamas leader
*  Yahya Sinwar was running in the tunnels by himself and had lost control of his men and within a few
*  days he would be caught. But he then says that Galant along with the IDF chief of staff and of
*  course the prime minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu himself has been throwing dust in the
*  eyes of the Israeli public. So he's saying all these claims, these grand claims by the likes of
*  Jov Galant proved to be beyond nonsense, risable nonsense. He then mocks these repeated triumphal
*  statements noting that it appears Galant has begun to sober up having told the foreign
*  affairs and defense committees of the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, that the idea of total
*  victory in Gaza is nonsense. So he then states that he's begun to realise that without a hostage deal
*  with Hamas this could lead to regional war which would place Israel in serious danger.
*  Now this article really is a fascinating corrective to Israeli propaganda. He states Israel is sinking
*  deeper into the Gaza mud, losing more and more soldiers as they get killed or wounded
*  without any chance of achieving the war's main goal, bringing down Hamas. He says the country
*  really is galloping towards the edge of an abyss. If the war of attrition against Hamas and Hezbollah
*  continues, Israel will collapse within no more than a year, he says. He notes the reservist army
*  is rating with its feet by refusing to mobilise while the economy is crashing and that Israel
*  has become a pariah state with economic boycotts and embargoes on arms shipments.
*  Now he goes on about assassinations which threaten to detonate the whole Middle East,
*  that a war of attrition suits Hamas, that Netanyahu toughening the negotiating team's positions to
*  prevent a deal comes after a hostage deal could previously have been achieved, with the deal being
*  torpedoed by insistence on what is in effect the indefinite occupation and in practice annexation
*  of Gaza. He concludes that Israel must agree to a deal to release the hostages and stop the war
*  in Gaza which could then lead, he hopes, as an alternative to the winding down of fighting with
*  Hezbollah and therefore less of a chance of regional war on multiple fronts which he says
*  Israel is entirely unprepared. Pretty shocking stuff coming from an Israeli general and I think
*  it is worth stating the underlying truth there that Israel has been defeated strategically.
*  It has failed in the key missions, if you like, its official missions which is to bring back
*  the hostages and clearly that has in no sense been the priority of the Israeli state, not even close.
*  The safety of the Israeli hostages, getting them back to their loved ones,
*  if they wanted to achieve that then they couldn't have gone about it a worse possible way. They have
*  killed more Israeli hostages with Israeli fire than they have rescued by military means. The
*  large numbers of Israeli hostages who were released were done so as part of a ceasefire
*  agreement and of course a prisoner exchange with Palestinian hostages, those huge numbers of
*  Palestinians who are detained without charge and face torture and indeed rape and who have been
*  tortured to death in some cases. That's the way that those Israeli hostages previously have been
*  released in practice. Hamas has not been defeated and Hamas can't be defeated. No serious security
*  analyst thinks this. It is an idea, even if you killed all its leaders they would just have
*  different leaders. You kill some of its militants and then you just get more young Palestinian men,
*  particularly those whose loved ones have been brutally slaughtered by the Israeli military,
*  they just join up and they carry on fighting. There has been no defeat suffered by Hamas and
*  there never will be by the Israeli state militarily. They just keep giving them more recruits by their
*  war of extermination. Anyway, this is all wisdom which is why I'll be ignored. Benjamin Netanyahu
*  and his allies have no interest of course in the deal and it must be said that there is not much
*  meaningful appetite for one in Israeli society despite courageous examples who will in time be
*  vindicated. As the Palestinian writer and co-director of al-Shabaka, the Palestinian policy
*  network, Dr Yara Hawari wrote about the huge protests recently of course in Tel Aviv. Let's
*  be clear about something, the hundreds of thousands marching in Tel Aviv right now demanding a ceasefire
*  deal and the resignation of Netanyahu are not doing so in protest of the genocide, they are doing
*  so in protest of how the genocide has been carried out, no military victory and hostages still at
*  home. The tens of thousands of murdered Palestinian children don't even register on their radar.
*  This was backed up by Meirav Zonshine, an Israeli analyst at Crisis Group who wrote,
*  This is what I'm afraid dehumanisation does, which is the precondition for all genocides.
*  We can see this in the opinion poll in which when you take out the 20% of Israeli society
*  were Palestinians, shows the population is almost evenly divided between those who think
*  too little firepower has been expended on Gaza. Can you even imagine what more firepower looks like
*  than those who think it's just the right amount, with a tiny number who think too much firepower
*  has been used. But yes, this is being facilitated by the world's only remaining superpower and yes,
*  it makes the Israeli elite feel invincible. You can see that as Benjamin Netanyahu poses with a map
*  which shows the West Bank annexed into Israel and Gaza in the words of the Israeli human rights
*  lawyer Itai Epstein awaiting such a fate. He's clearly there showcasing Israeli rule from the
*  river to the sea with the Palestinian population subjected to a mixture of apartheid, ethnic
*  cleansing and genocide, striking isn't it, the howls of outrage and disgust. When some protesters
*  chant from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free when they're calling for equality between
*  Palestinians and Israelis. And then you get the actual Israeli prime minister who's committing
*  genocide and exterminating tens of thousands of Palestinians and clearly advocating apartheid
*  for those remaining Palestinians under Israeli rule, not least in the West Bank.
*  That's fine, where's the howls of outrage then? Where are all the newspaper columns?
*  Oh, it's all gone silent. Interesting. But look, this is all not sustainable. It is clear that,
*  as I've said, the Israeli government never had any meaningful interest in the rescue of the
*  hostages who it's condemned to death. But this is a society bowling over with genocidal rage and
*  attempt on multiple fronts. Yeah, however sustained it is by foreign military aid, that can't last.
*  Within the Western world, Israel is becoming a pariah state because public opinion in the West
*  is dramatically shifting against it. And that's true in the United States where criticizing Israel
*  was verboten until not that long ago. But that has changed. The British government suspending
*  just 8% of arms sales to Israel is pathetic on one level, but indicative of the direction the tide
*  is turning in favor of. Now it's clear Netanyahu and his allies want to realize their dream of a
*  greater Israel to take their genocide rampage in Gaza to its logical conclusion to, in practice,
*  annex the West Bank when, I mean, it's already essentially being annexed, isn't it? But I agree
*  with this Israeli general. I think this will become an existential question for Israel. And
*  that is something which, you know, I suppose the Israeli elite, drunk as they are on their
*  genocidal triumphalism and rage, they're not really thinking through as a strategy,
*  are they? They're thinking in the short term. They're not thinking ahead. What we should be
*  striving for, of course, is equality for Jewish and Palestinian citizens, however distant a prospect
*  that might seem, based on their innate equal worth, the innate equal worth of Jews and Palestinians
*  with equal rights and freedoms between the river and the sea. And that must be how this eventually
*  ends. Until then, well, of course, only murder and destruction beckons. And that is, of course,
*  the present. Please like and subscribe, leave your thoughts in your comments. We'd love to hear them
*  as ever. Keep the show on the very page at column four slash mjz4. A very big, exciting project,
*  which I've been talking about for a long time, which has taken up a huge amount of effort
*  and resources and money. You'll see. I'm waiting till we can publish it. You'll see what you'll see
*  why that hopefully, hopefully we can publish it imminently. It's a big project. You'll see what I
*  mean. Press like subscribe. I think I've already said that speech is easy.
