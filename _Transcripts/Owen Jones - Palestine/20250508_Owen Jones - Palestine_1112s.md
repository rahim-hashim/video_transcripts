# The Palestinian Band You'll Wish You'd Heard Earlier - 47Soul's El Far3i
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg)
*  They're an absolutely incredible Palestinian music group. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=0.0s)]
*  And in the age of Israel's genocide, their music is more important than ever. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=2.92s)]
*  They're called 47 Sol and they're pioneers of Shamstepp, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=6.28s)]
*  which is an electronic music dance movement in the Arab world. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=9.6s)]
*  Their name refers to 1947, the year before the Nakba or catastrophe, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=13.16s)]
*  which, of course, enveloped the Palestinian people with the foundation [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=17.2s)]
*  of the state of Israel. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=19.8s)]
*  And their music really is quite something. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  I'd like to join by Tarek Abu-Kwaiq, or better known as El Fari. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=30.0s)]
*  And I start by asking him about the band and how the music came together. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=48.68s)]
*  Well, yeah, the band started as a collective from artists [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=53.24s)]
*  that were established in our region to a certain extent. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=57.44s)]
*  And since the very beginning, it was focused on bilingual [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=60.239999999999995s)]
*  and diaspora and the homeland bridging, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=65.56s)]
*  because it felt like we almost felt that this is going to become bigger [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=70.0s)]
*  on the global scale, as in our cause, the Palestinian cause, because it hasn't ended. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=77.28s)]
*  And so musically, it was about bringing our sounds from our culture [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=82.6s)]
*  and almost like trying to translate how we hear those sounds [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=90.88s)]
*  in the context of other modern productions from, you name it, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=96.11999999999999s)]
*  from dub to hip hop to rock and kind of like highlight, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  like, you know, like, hear this, this sounds like this other genre. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=105.47999999999999s)]
*  And why is that part of our culture? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=109.76s)]
*  So that's musically, message wise, it's definitely related to [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=112.36s)]
*  the relationship between the diaspora and the land. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=117.4s)]
*  I think that this is like it's very important for for our cause, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=121.64s)]
*  because the the it's almost like we have another narrative of history [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=127.16000000000001s)]
*  between us and the West. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=132.68s)]
*  So it's kind of like, let's get on it on that. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=133.76s)]
*  An amazing question we were asked by a journalist when we first started was, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=138.72s)]
*  are you guys an emergency band? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  And we all went like, you know, I mean, like that's yeah, it almost yes. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=144.64s)]
*  Like we felt there is a need to be out there in those spaces internationally. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=149.83999999999997s)]
*  Let's hear a little clip from Power, which is out today. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=156.11999999999998s)]
*  Now, with Israel's genocide taking place, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=167.92s)]
*  that's a huge amount of emotional labor for Palestinians [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=171.04s)]
*  with a platform like yourselves. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=173.76s)]
*  How do you see your role? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=175.56s)]
*  To be fair, it's a complicated one, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=177.27999999999997s)]
*  because in our heads, since we started, it was like our role is to get attention [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=181.32s)]
*  on what on the ground. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=188.0s)]
*  And so we have to be very careful about that. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=190.64s)]
*  Is to get attention on what on the continuous ethnic cleansing and, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=193.4s)]
*  you know, the what's happening in Palestine and focusing on the fact that it's, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=200.2s)]
*  you know, such a such a colonialism with with with its [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  2000, 2000s, you know, Virgin. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=210.88s)]
*  Even censorship like we have with the kind of band that been asked by venues like. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=215.72s)]
*  Does the band, you know, like recognize, you know, as well as to exist, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=220.96s)]
*  like, or would the band say that, like, there's always been this thing [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=227.72s)]
*  that we struggle with and and we would have to answer, you know, how we do our show. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  But what there's the there's the grieving and then there is the let's get back on it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=240.4s)]
*  Let's get back on it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=247.64s)]
*  So when the genocide started, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=248.6s)]
*  the matter was like, it doesn't matter what we do. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=252.92s)]
*  Will our people view it as we're being not sensible, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=255.92s)]
*  you know, or even offensive by getting on stages and performing? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=261.15999999999997s)]
*  But then that shifted to, well, OK, unfortunately, like any like most things [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=267.8s)]
*  that started on our people, it hasn't ended yet. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=273.56s)]
*  So the question of like, well, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=276.76s)]
*  if people aren't able to eat and move and outside of Palestine [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=280.2s)]
*  and Arab countries, there's a new level of silencing now that's coming in [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=286.56s)]
*  and it's way exaggerated. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=291.64s)]
*  And it's really [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=293.64s)]
*  disappointing is a horrible world to use here. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=298.28000000000003s)]
*  I can't use a better one. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=300.2s)]
*  It's it's really bad. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=301.48s)]
*  So you think, well, now the responsibility is on us [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=303.71999999999997s)]
*  to even go harder in spreading the message. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=307.68s)]
*  So there's always those this kind of a dialect between [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=310.4s)]
*  does that, you know, because you would think you've been doing this for a decade. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=313.88s)]
*  What's different now? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=318.03999999999996s)]
*  You haven't changed anything. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=319.4s)]
*  Like you just basically doing what you've been doing. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=320.71999999999997s)]
*  On the other hand, some people come and tell us like, you're lucky. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=323.96s)]
*  You said your type of job allows you to talk about it and spread the word. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=327.71999999999997s)]
*  You know, like you'd have friends in corporate, for example, or like, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=332.2s)]
*  it's really difficult to walk in and answer questions like, how are you doing [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=335.2s)]
*  when like half of their family been like moved from the record in Gaza, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=340.12s)]
*  literally, as in the whole family was murdered. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=345.71999999999997s)]
*  So, yeah, it's it's [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=350.84s)]
*  it's not very also different than other moments in history we've had. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=353.32s)]
*  You know, I mean, I've had moments where I'm on stage and out of the blue. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=356.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, out of the blue ish, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=361.15999999999997s)]
*  a whole attack on Janine happens, and that's where my family is. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=363.84s)]
*  So I'm like, wondering, do I get on stage tonight? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=367.47999999999996s)]
*  Or I make a statement that I'm not getting on stage. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=370.35999999999996s)]
*  So, you know, it's this is something we faced since the very beginning. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=373.96s)]
*  We've always been facing even in the Arab Spring. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=377.28s)]
*  I've had shows like back in the day where like people would be like, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=380.71999999999997s)]
*  people are actually on the streets and you guys are singing. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=384.2s)]
*  We're like, well, we're thinking about this. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=387.12s)]
*  This never ends. It's part of our part of what we do. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=388.84000000000003s)]
*  Anti-Palestinian racism is just so rampant and respectable in Western society. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=392.44s)]
*  And that must be a huge amount of pressure on you as Palestinians with the platform. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=396.44s)]
*  Well, to be fair, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=400.76s)]
*  maybe because we grew up Palestinian and we had those kind of thoughts [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=403.04s)]
*  and discussions throughout our life, we've jumped into a different realm [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=406.76s)]
*  as a Palestinian youth, like we're we're more on to the [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=410.32s)]
*  almost like the philosophical existential type of questions around it [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=414.8s)]
*  rather than the political, you know, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=418.32s)]
*  arguments like this is settler colonialism or, you know, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=421.84s)]
*  this is economical or this is about power dynamics. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=425.71999999999997s)]
*  Don't know. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=430.71999999999997s)]
*  Not only they sound repetitive to us, they're true, you know, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=433.15999999999997s)]
*  and they're very important. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=438.2s)]
*  But we're trying to answer questions like, how come this is happening to us? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=440.12s)]
*  I mean, let's look deeper into this. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=444.96s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=446.88s)]
*  What are those cultural symbols in our houses growing up? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=448.03999999999996s)]
*  You know, did we choose that map in the first place? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=451.03999999999996s)]
*  Questions that would like really scrambled the whole conversation. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=455.35999999999996s)]
*  So, I mean, to be fair, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=459.64s)]
*  sometimes you would fear falling into the. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=463.47999999999996s)]
*  Token space when you're doing it, because, you know, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=467.96s)]
*  we came to London actually as a band we formed in in Jordan and Palestine. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=473.88s)]
*  And then we moved to London thinking that, you know, London is a pro-Palestine city. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=479.08s)]
*  Right. I mean, you know, from one from a from a certain angle, that that's true. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=484.96s)]
*  And to be fair, like even in the last year and a half, like I have friends [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=490.96s)]
*  in Arab countries are like, you're lucky you live in London. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=495.52s)]
*  We see those demonstrations. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=498.16s)]
*  And I can only say like. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=500.96s)]
*  Thank you to London. In fact, our song Ghost Town in video was about that. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=504.03999999999996s)]
*  So it's like a shout out to city of London. That's amazing. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=508.2s)]
*  But I would love to up the conversation. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=511.88s)]
*  The appetite for it right now is difficult because, you know, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=514.96s)]
*  if I'm going to look at the news and find, you know, our people, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=518.72s)]
*  children, you know, burning alive to jump into the philosophical space of it. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=523.48s)]
*  Right now, it's almost like it's not the appetite. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=528.36s)]
*  But but we do believe it's the important one. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=530.4s)]
*  You know, our third album is called Semitic, you know, we're on to like, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=533.1999999999999s)]
*  let's just because it's a it's an endless loop. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=538.8s)]
*  The different arguments, you know, the if you want to take it as a [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=543.12s)]
*  fanatic or like a extreme religious argument, it's repetitive. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=547.8s)]
*  If you want to take it from a completely economic, let's say, maybe [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=552.68s)]
*  Marxist point of view, it's also repetitive. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=556.72s)]
*  Like the question is, OK, let's take this to the next level. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=559.84s)]
*  You know, I mean, we've been accused of being the kind of wealth, not accused, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=564.2s)]
*  but we would be the kind of band who would suggested a conversation [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=569.0s)]
*  around something like the Abraham Accords before it existed. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=573.12s)]
*  If you know what I mean, we want to go to that level. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=576.64s)]
*  Like, what is that land really? What's the history of it? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=578.88s)]
*  Is the history we're reading even true? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=581.2s)]
*  Because we really want a solution and we know that [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=583.72s)]
*  what's been on the table for such a long time, it's just not doing it. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=588.4s)]
*  You know, so your album released in 2018, Balfour and Promise referred [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=591.84s)]
*  to both Balfour House, where you were living in Tower Hamlets [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=595.5600000000001s)]
*  and the Balfour Declaration, where the British Empire [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=597.6s)]
*  promised the land of Palestine to the Zionist movement. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=600.52s)]
*  How does music engage people politically in a way formal politics doesn't? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=603.08s)]
*  You know, sometimes we're like a bit careful about, you know, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=608.96s)]
*  upping that narrative that, you know, music is a solution. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=612.36s)]
*  I don't know if that's a very Arab way of thinking about things, but [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=617.32s)]
*  I mean, with that one, honestly, it's thought as a joke, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=620.88s)]
*  but it turned into a serious conversation. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=623.36s)]
*  We were literally walking to the tower and it was like, are we back to Balfour? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=625.0s)]
*  Balfour was like, no, we're back to Balfour. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=628.32s)]
*  Ha ha ha. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=630.28s)]
*  Then the conversation was like, well, if you think about it, gentrification, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=631.32s)]
*  occupation, separate colonialism, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=635.84s)]
*  they kind of stem from the same kind of idea, right? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=638.52s)]
*  You know, someone wants to expand [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=642.88s)]
*  and you have to replace people to do that. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=646.44s)]
*  I cannot deny that bands with [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=650.72s)]
*  with like, you know, political or human messages haven't influenced me. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=655.16s)]
*  That's for sure. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=658.96s)]
*  It's always nice to know that an artist is on your side. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=660.48s)]
*  You know what I mean? Or that is the side of humanity. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=664.6s)]
*  But, you know, with Palestine, it's like we [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=669.4s)]
*  this is [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=672.36s)]
*  there's two narratives of history, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=674.96s)]
*  you know, against each other. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=677.6s)]
*  So when you really zoom out and think about it, like, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=678.8000000000001s)]
*  do you want to blame someone who's grown up [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=681.4s)]
*  with massive propaganda and I don't even call it brainwashing because the person [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=684.32s)]
*  brainwashing them is brainwashed. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=690.24s)]
*  So that's that's kind of genuine teaching. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=692.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? I'm just teaching you what I know. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=693.88s)]
*  That's what I would like to get on with the music. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=696.6s)]
*  But I must say it got more challenging [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=699.2s)]
*  as we go and became the kind of thing where like, OK, no, these are books. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=702.92s)]
*  They can't be songs because songs need to be something [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=707.84s)]
*  that people can repeat after you. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=712.24s)]
*  You know, you can go deeper in a song. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=714.16s)]
*  You can go deeper, maybe in a longer rap verse or something. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=716.08s)]
*  But there is a limitation, is what I'm trying to say. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=719.08s)]
*  But as far as people gathering around their voice, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=722.8s)]
*  people gathering around a position an artist took, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=726.4s)]
*  this is definitely important simply because music reaches the youth [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=730.36s)]
*  and the younger ones more than the news. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=734.08s)]
*  So yes, is the answer. Sorry for the long one. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=736.28s)]
*  You know, not at all. Tell me what Shamstep is. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=739.28s)]
*  So Shamstep is basically taking the traditional [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=742.48s)]
*  and, you know, the existing sounds of the Levant, Syrian Levant, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=747.16s)]
*  Palestinian sound, you know, Syria and playing it with [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=753.9200000000001s)]
*  different production techniques that are modern. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=759.76s)]
*  Generally speaking, it isn't so, for example, like in Arab hip hop, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=765.32s)]
*  you would sample an old record and put it on like a boom bap or trap beat, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=769.96s)]
*  you know, with Shamstep, we're more like we use the [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=774.84s)]
*  the electronic and programmable drum kits [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=778.9200000000001s)]
*  to write Arabic drum grooves or Arab drum grooves. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=782.1199999999999s)]
*  And we play our melodies that we write on top of it. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=786.5999999999999s)]
*  So I would say like Shamstep is Arabic drums with [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=790.64s)]
*  Bayati, which is like a scale that's very popular, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=796.04s)]
*  that has the quarter tone, you know, the Arabic quarter tone. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=799.0799999999999s)]
*  And the singing styles are [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=803.4799999999999s)]
*  vocal styles from Palestine, like Haday and, you know, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=807.8399999999999s)]
*  those kind of vocal styles are kind of like [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=811.08s)]
*  it's kind of similar to like toasting in Jamaican culture. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=815.88s)]
*  You know, they come from the celebration and giving [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=818.6800000000001s)]
*  shout outs to the people in the room. It's very engaging in life. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=821.5200000000001s)]
*  Then you have, you know, the mawwal and tarab, more like longer notes, styles [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=825.2s)]
*  mixed with rapping and just different kind of alternative styles of singing [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=830.6s)]
*  or just, you know, more global, I want to say. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=836.0s)]
*  I'm usually careful with the Western Eastern here in the [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=839.96s)]
*  in this conversation because I guess we come from the region where [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=843.48s)]
*  this is where all those things got mixed. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=847.6s)]
*  I know when I say Arab drums, I mean drums in that region [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=849.56s)]
*  that got influenced by Arab trade throughout history. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=853.0s)]
*  And therefore you hear like the African influence, the Indian influence. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=857.28s)]
*  And, you know, and then so Shamstep is dance music. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=860.84s)]
*  It has hip hop in it. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=866.24s)]
*  It has some rock elements, has some dub elements, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=868.4s)]
*  but it's based off Deppke music. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=871.64s)]
*  So the easiest way to say it's a modern subgenre of Deppke, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=874.04s)]
*  which is originally a Palestinian dance, but people call music associated [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=879.04s)]
*  with it Deppkat. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=883.88s)]
*  What do you say to people who are creative and musically inclined [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=885.88s)]
*  and want to get a message across? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=888.48s)]
*  Read. I mean, it sounds about like really, it's, you know, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=890.9599999999999s)]
*  they tell you no politics, no religion. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=895.1999999999999s)]
*  There's a reason why they tell you that, you know, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=898.0s)]
*  politics and religion. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=900.64s)]
*  And also, I don't like the narrative of, you know, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=901.92s)]
*  this is some like old ancient religious beef. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=906.24s)]
*  That's all a distraction. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=909.12s)]
*  It was like if there's anything you need to be reading is the relationship [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=910.44s)]
*  of religious texts to this whole conversation. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=913.52s)]
*  And of course, use the great Marxist narrative we have from the past, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=917.0s)]
*  you know, essentially whatever. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=922.4s)]
*  But, you know, we need to jump onto that. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=923.32s)]
*  There's a lot of changes happening today in the world in the realm of Islam [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=927.08s)]
*  and Islamic understanding, you know, Arab youth are asking questions of like, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=931.64s)]
*  am I Arab? Like all of those identity questions. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=935.8000000000001s)]
*  So I encourage everyone to read about the region from that perspective, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=938.6800000000001s)]
*  because if we keep seeing it as like that's just an occupation, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=943.44s)]
*  you'll always be faced by the answer. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=947.36s)]
*  Well, isn't everything isn't isn't that just human nature? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=949.28s)]
*  And the answer cannot just be simply no. Right. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=953.48s)]
*  So I think that reading is very important. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=956.4399999999999s)]
*  We're just entering the phase where like we would try to maybe not separate, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=959.76s)]
*  but like, you know, improve your reading on one side, have your understanding [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=965.72s)]
*  and trust that this will allow you to make music that is inspiring [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=969.4399999999999s)]
*  and less preachy. You know what I mean? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=973.8s)]
*  Because then you lose you lose on both sides. Right. Yeah. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=976.24s)]
*  So I say this advice to myself first, you know, and then and to our group, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=980.04s)]
*  of course, and to the rest, do not separate the two subjects from each other. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=985.2s)]
*  But you know, I mean, you because because I don't like this idea [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=990.9200000000001s)]
*  that let's put this on the side, you know, I mean, let's go have this. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=994.32s)]
*  But no politics, religion, let's do music. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=997.2800000000001s)]
*  Let's put that on the side. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=999.44s)]
*  And I understand some people are maybe like amazing activists who want to have, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=1000.5600000000001s)]
*  you know, songs about just different subjects. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=1005.8000000000001s)]
*  That's fine, because they're doing it elsewhere. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=1008.08s)]
*  That'll be that'll be the advice. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=1011.6400000000001s)]
*  I mean, on the on this, I mean, we're a bit privileged [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=1013.56s)]
*  because like we're already censored, you know, I mean, like we're Palestinians. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=1016.88s)]
*  So it's like we're already in that space. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=1020.0799999999999s)]
*  So for others, it's more difficult. Right. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=1023.4399999999999s)]
*  Like if Palestine was free, would I bring up [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=1025.8s)]
*  I ask myself that question, if that was free right now and shallow, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSSO9Qvfivg&t=1029.9199999999998s)]
