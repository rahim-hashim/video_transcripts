# Ex-Obama Aide ARRESTED For RACIST Rant
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [November 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqLTovwPRCk)
*  If we killed 4,000 Palestinian children you know what it wasn't enough. Now these
*  are the horrendous words uttered by Stuart Seldevitz screaming at a 24 year
*  old New York City halal food truck worker Mohammed Hussein. That wasn't all
*  he said, far from it. He repeatedly harassed and racially abused Hussein who
*  filmed it. Now Seldevitz is not simply some random bigot. He's just stalking the
*  sidewalks of New York City screaming buy-on. He worked as the deputy director
*  and senior political officer at the US Department of State's Office of Israel
*  and Palestinian Affairs from 1999 to 2003 and then at the National Security
*  Council under Barack Obama. Now this episode is deeply revealing for many
*  reasons but let's just listen to this what words he used to describe him.
*  Abhorrent man.
*  Now?
*  Yeah go.
*  In Egypt we'll get your parents.
*  Go go go.
*  Does your father like his fingernails? They'll take them out one by one.
*  Why should I go? Why should I go? Tell me why I should go. I'm standing here. I'm an
*  American. I have free, it's a free country. It's not like Egypt.
*  Smile for me.
*  Did you rape your daughter like Mohammed did? Did you rape your daughter like Mohammed?
*  I don't speak English.
*  You only speak English?
*  No, no English.
*  You don't speak English?
*  Yes.
*  Alright. See that just shows how ignorant you are. Because Mohammed was a rapist. It
*  says in the hadith, in your holy book.
*  Oh Mohammed.
*  What?
*  Oh Mohammed.
*  Mohammed your prophet. You know him.
*  My prophet?
*  Yeah. He was a rapist. He raped Daisha. Does it say that in the hadith or not? You know
*  that?
*  I don't speak English.
*  What?
*  No English.
*  You don't speak English? What do you speak? What do you speak? You speak Arabic, the language
*  of the Quran, the holy Quran that some people use as a toilet. What do you think of that?
*  People who use the Quran as a toilet. Does it bother you? Does it bother you? Tell me
*  the truth.
*  I don't speak English.
*  You don't speak English? Ah, that's too bad. That's why you're selling food in a food
*  store. Because you're ignorant. But you should learn English and it'll help you. When they
*  deport you back to Egypt and the muhabarat wants to interview you.
*  So he started there by boasting about how Mohammed Hussein's parents will be tortured
*  by the Egyptian secret services, refuses to leave when asked by the vendor, quite rightly,
*  the vendor he's racially harassing, boasted that he's entitled to keep harassing him because
*  he's American and it's a free country, takes a picture of him while harassing him. That
*  itself is a form of harassment. Goes on to ask the vendor if he raped his daughter like
*  the Prophet Mohammed, taunts him about people using the Quran as toilet paper, all the while
*  this hideous grin on his face, this hideous laugh, calls him ignorant and that's therefore
*  why he's working as a vendor and so on. Now he just will not leave him alone.
*  There's nobody here. I'm going to put big signs here that say this guy believes in Hamas.
*  Do you want to buy something? No, I don't.
*  So he goes on to say he's supporting terrorism, that if we killed 4,000 Palestinian kids it
*  wasn't enough. But you're a terrorist. You support terrorism.
*  Listen, go. I'm not supporting something. You do? You support terrorism.
*  I'm not some... Go. I'm just working here. You support killing one of the children.
*  You're a terrible person. You kill children, not me.
*  What? Go. My kids? What about my kids?
*  You kill children, not me. Go. I didn't kill children.
*  Okay, why see here? You know why? If we killed 4,000 Palestinian kids,
*  you know why? It wasn't enough. It wasn't enough.
*  Go. Now, he was identified because of these clips being shared on social media and he's
*  now being arrested for hate crime and stalking, second degree aggravated harassment,
*  stalking causing fear and stalking at employment.
*  Meanwhile, New York is showing their solidarity with this abused vendor by queuing up to buy
*  chicken over rice, which is heartening to see.
*  A white table was brought along for everyone to sit at and eat by a Jewish New Yorker.
*  But let's just talk about Seldvits and what he represents because this goes far beyond this hideous individual.
*  A man with clear racist, anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian views had a significant influential role
*  on official US policy towards Israel and Palestine under both Democratic and Republican presidents.
*  His contempt for the lives of Palestinians is, yes, crude vulgar, vile even,
*  but it simply vocalizes the true essence of US policy, which has never treated Palestinians as anything like equal human beings.
*  Their rights disregarded while Israeli brutality, the longest belligerent occupation of modern times,
*  as for Gaza itself, the longest siege of modern times, the colonization, land theft through illegal settlements,
*  the ethnic cleansing, the incarceration and the torture and the brutality that comes along with it,
*  the apartheid as described by multiple human rights organizations, the slaughter of innocent civilians,
*  all of that not only disregarded by the US and the successive administrations,
*  but sustained through vast supplies of weaponry, foreign aid and diplomatic support.
*  Now, when he boasts about the Egyptian dictatorship torturing its opponents,
*  this dictatorship, it must be noted, is a key ally of the United States.
*  The US gives billions of pounds worth of arms to General El-Sisi's human rights abusing regime,
*  as well as diplomatic support and all the other blessings of being a client dictatorship
*  of the last remaining superpower on earth, a relationship designed and nurtured by officials like Seldaritz.
*  Now, there is a point here about what we can describe and should describe as imperialism,
*  how states projects their power beyond their borders for their own selfish reasons
*  and how that's always been underpinned by racism.
*  Racism is used to justify and rationalize that power.
*  When the European colonial states carved up Africa amongst themselves,
*  pseudoscientists and anthropologists were used to justify the idea of black people being inferior
*  and thus deserving of subjugation, spearing on racism that lives on very much today
*  and indeed defines so much of our society.
*  The same goes with Islamophobia and indeed specifically anti-Palestinian racism.
*  Now, what Seldaritz underlines is the continuity of US power,
*  the machinery of its state apparatus in terms of both domestic and foreign policy,
*  whoever happens to be occupying the White House at any given time.
*  Now, over a decade ago, I wrote a piece for my former employer, The Independent, a column entitled
*  Getting Rid of George W. Bush Wasn't Enough, the US Remains a Bully.
*  Now, this then became slightly surreal because it turned out I ended up being denounced on Fox News because of it.
*  And this itself is extremely relevant. Take a listen and I'll explain why.
*  So in the British paper, The Independent, writer Owen Jones has a piece titled
*  Getting Rid of George W. Bush Wasn't Enough, the US Remains a Bully.
*  You can smell the patchouli wafting from the pages.
*  To Jones, it doesn't matter who's president, the issue is US power.
*  And he rejoices that, quote,
*  With the last remaining superpower at its weakest since World War II,
*  there is an unmissable opening to argue for a more equal and just world order,
*  restricting the ability of great powers to throw their weight around.
*  In teachers' lounge speak, that's death to America.
*  So the lesson in a world where creeps hate our achievement, appeasement makes them hate you more.
*  And this is where anti-exceptionalism leads us to braying jackals like Jones,
*  who really just reflects the same anti-Americanism found here among the typical occupier or the clowns at Soros-funded blogs.
*  That's the scary part. You get the feeling Jones could have written an Obama stump speech back in 2007.
*  But sensible folks must realize that a powerful America will always be the enemy of the left.
*  And the only way for America to remain awesome is to assume our awesomeness and stop apologizing.
*  Because America will only be embraced when it's defeated.
*  And that embrace will not be warm.
*  The last thing we can expect is to be shown the mercy or appreciation that the left insists we show our enemies.
*  For Libs, that's the true American exceptionalism.
*  We are and always will be the best at being bad.
*  I have to say I was kind of flattered at the time by being called a braying jackal.
*  Though I googled it and it turns out jackals don't bray.
*  Not the only factual inaccuracy you'll find being churned out by Fox News.
*  Anyway, a member of this panel accidentally goes on to make a good point.
*  You know what's funny about this?
*  That the occupier in chief, aka the Nobel Peace Prize winner, is the guy who uses the most drones, has a kill list.
*  It must just drive people like this crazy.
*  They don't know where to go with it.
*  That's what he said. That was the argument in the piece.
*  I understand that.
*  I like the way that another member of the panel had to go, duh, that's what he's saying.
*  Not the brightest of the lot on Fox News.
*  But you see, Obama did escalate the use of drones compared to George W. Bush.
*  Killing we don't know how many innocent civilians in countries like Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen.
*  I should say that Trump went on to further escalate it himself.
*  Which I think very much goes against the narrative that many of his supporters have that he somehow stood against the forever wars.
*  Now they use these drones because they wanted to protect their own soldiers and stop Americans from dying.
*  American soldiers.
*  And that meant instead allowing civilians in other countries to die instead.
*  Obama is said to have bragged to AIDS.
*  Turns out I'm really good at killing people.
*  Now Obama once joked about using drones to kill the Jonas Brothers if they went anywhere near his daughters.
*  Listen to this.
*  The Jonas Brothers are here.
*  They're out there somewhere.
*  Sasha and Malia are huge fans.
*  But boys don't get any ideas.
*  I have two words for you.
*  Predator drones.
*  You will never see it coming.
*  You think I'm joking?
*  Gross.
*  I mean he must have known that drones killed innocent people.
*  He might have found it regrettable.
*  But he certainly knew it happened.
*  How much content does it show for innocent Muslim lives taken in Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen to joke like that?
*  So you see this is the point.
*  The clincher I think.
*  Salavit says yes a disgusting little man.
*  Listen to him.
*  No question.
*  But he's representative of something far greater than simply his odious little self.
*  And it's about the dehumanization, the racism which underpins the US as it has always underpinned great imperialist powers.
*  And in this context that means the racist content towards pan-American people.
*  And in this context that means the racist content towards Palestinians.
*  There isn't even the pretense that their lives matter as they suffer one of the great crimes of our time.
*  All the blessings of the US and British government and of course so much of the Western media.
*  What Salavit did is express in crude and vulgar terms the essence of what underpins Western foreign policy as Palestinians as we speak are being killed by the thousand.
