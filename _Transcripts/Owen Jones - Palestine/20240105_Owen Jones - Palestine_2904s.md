Video Description: It's rare that I end an interview on the brink of tears, but this was such a powerful interview with former ANC MP Andrew Feinstein. He tells me his family history of surviving the Holocaust - unlike so many of his relatives - and how this informed his struggle against Apartheid.

But he tells me why Israel's oppression of the Palestinians is worse than Apartheid, why the anti-apartheid movement is an example to now follow, the silencing of pro-Palestinian voices, South Africa's case against Israel alleging genocide - and why history shows we have a responsibility to speak out.

# Israel 'Worse Than Apartheid' South African Jewish Former ANC Politician Andrew Feinstein
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT_4_0ToGsM)
*  Hello, we've got a great guest today who I'm really proud to have on. It's Andrew Feinstein,
*  who is the former MP for the African National Congress, obviously in South Africa. He was
*  very active in the struggle against the great evil of apartheid, which fell in 1994,
*  because of struggle both in South Africa but also internationally. That's a very important point,
*  which we're going to return to. Anyway, hello, Andrew. Good to see you. How you doing?
*  Hi, good. Thank you. Great to be with you.
*  First, I just want to talk about you yourself, because I think this is relevant and always
*  interesting. You were born in Cape Town in a Jewish family, and that you have, I think,
*  it's fair to say, that's had a big impact on your politics. Huge trauma, like so many Jewish people
*  across the world, in terms of the horrors endured by those who came before you. So I just want you,
*  if you could tell us a bit about your family and that context.
*  Yeah, absolutely. So my dad was South African. His family had fled pogroms in Tsarist Russia,
*  landed up in South Africa unexpectedly, thought they were being taken to New York.
*  My mom was actually Austrian. She survived the Second World War in Vienna itself, one of
*  very few Jews to do that. She was hidden in a coal cellar for three and a half years.
*  And whenever the Gestapo or the SS were in the area, she would be rolled up into a carpet,
*  and that would be pushed up against the wall in case they managed to break in
*  to where they were hiding. And she lost dozens of her family, mainly at Auschwitz, some Theresienstadt
*  as well. So that history certainly loomed large as my siblings and I were growing up.
*  But it also, my mom was very active in something called the Black Sash in South Africa, which white
*  women opposing apartheid. And she would often say to us, you know, she would explain to us about
*  the family history, about the notion of never again, and why South Africa was not a normal country.
*  And I suppose we were fortunate in the sense that we moved constantly between South Africa and
*  Austria. My dad would decide he couldn't live under apartheid anymore. And off we'd go, my sister and
*  I coined the phrase semigrade to describe what happened. But within months, my dad wouldn't have
*  learned a word of German and we'd be back in Cape Town. So I grew up very conscious of racism in all
*  its forms. And it's probably the reason why I first of all became involved in the struggle against
*  apartheid at a very young age in my late teens. But also, I suppose, why my life has been dominated
*  by anti-racist struggles.
*  Now, apartheid is something which, for people like myself, I'm a geriatric millennial,
*  I was born in 1984. But, you know, it was something, a specific horror, which people like myself grew up
*  learning about. You know, when apartheid fell, Nelson Mandela, one of the few figures, I suppose,
*  in my lifetime who achieved kind of near-sainthood. Now, you've actually suggested that what exists
*  as regards the oppression of the Palestinian people is worse than the apartheid you fought so
*  courageously against in your yogi years. So can you just explain, what do you mean by that?
*  Sure. First of all, you know, that doesn't mean to in any way diminish the awfulness and the brutality
*  of South African apartheid. It was the most horrendous system. I mean, I had countless
*  friends who were murdered directly or indirectly by the apartheid state. My wife, who is of
*  Bangladeshi origin, you know, not only wouldn't we have been able to marry in South Africa, to live
*  in the same racial group area together, we wouldn't even have been allowed to travel in a car alone
*  together. Such was the absurdity of the racist apartheid system. But I think what has happened
*  in Israel has taken it to a sort of a more efficient, more brutal level than was ever
*  the case in South Africa. So in South Africa, we have the system of Bantu Stans, these 13 little
*  places that were supposedly independent states. No Black South Africans regarded them as independent
*  states. They ignored them effectively. Not dissimilar to the occupied territories, although,
*  of course, there are differences. But the one thing that has always struck me is the extent of the
*  brutality of Israeli apartheid goes many levels beyond what happened in South Africa. Yes, there
*  were appalling massacres. You know, Sharpeville in 1960, Soweto in 1976, Boit Petong in 1989,
*  where I actually tried to act as a facilitator of a reconciliation process after a terrible massacre
*  of ANC supporters by state-sponsored militias. But nothing like we've seen in the occupied
*  territories in both Gaza and the West Bank. And, you know, I had this view even before
*  the awful events, first of all, in Israel on 7th of October, and then the Israeli response to them.
*  I'm talking even about the period before that, where you would see what was effectively
*  high-level warfare against the Palestinian people in already appalling and restrictive
*  conditions that they lived in in the occupied territories. And this, for me, takes Israeli
*  apartheid to a level of brutality that we never experienced in South Africa. Of course, another
*  fundamental difference that I think is incredibly important is that South Africa, and, you know,
*  growing up even as a privileged white South African, you knew South Africa was a pariah state.
*  Israel, certainly in the so-called Western countries, doesn't have that status. And I
*  think that has given various governments of the state of Israel a sense of impunity, a sense of
*  being above the law. And that has enabled them to do things that even the South African apartheid
*  state would not have considered doing. The other very important difference that I think
*  also plays into this different intensity of the physical brutality is that the South African
*  apartheid state was very dependent on the Black African workforce for the economy to function.
*  Mine workers, all of South Africa, of course, being very rich in natural resources was very
*  dependent on that form of dangerous manual labor. And here was this almost indentured, enslaved
*  workforce. And so it was incredibly important for the South Africans that that workforce
*  was at least of sound body, even though they characterized Black Africans as
*  drawers of water and hewers of wood. So they saw them as being beneath them, as somehow lesser
*  human beings, which I think unfortunately has played into the Israeli-Palestinian narrative.
*  But they had to ensure that they were a productive and effective workforce. Israel does not have
*  anything like that same economic reliance on the Palestinian population. And I think, again, there,
*  that gives a license to perhaps behave more brutally in the extent of murder, of bombing,
*  of the day-to-day treatment of the population. Anybody who has witnessed
*  the crossing points into and out of Gaza or the West Bank will just be shocked at the extent of
*  dehumanization and humiliation of Palestinians by young Israeli soldiers.
*  And the Bantustans you could drive into and out of, you could walk into and out of in South Africa.
*  So I think we are seeing a security state apparatus at a level that went way beyond
*  the apartheid state in South Africa. In terms of similarities and differences,
*  historically oppressors have often dressed themselves in the garbs of victimhood, but also
*  equally they can historically be victims. South Africa, the Boas were locked up by the British
*  Empire in concentration camps. I think that was when concentration camp was first coined. And they
*  used that often, that history of victimhood to justify their own oppression and so on.
*  But obviously, and I don't need to tell you about it, it's your history, your family history.
*  The Jewish people suffered 2,000 years of horrendous persecution, culminating in the attempt
*  to physically exterminate all Jews. You were the first South African politician to introduce a bill
*  remembering the Holocaust back when you were an MP. But you'll see, but in this context, you'll get
*  the argument, well, look, we need a land of our own and that's what the state of Israel is about.
*  To make sure never again means now, as it keeps being said. So what's your response to that in
*  terms of the way Israel uses that history, which is a real history, which obviously exists in terms
*  of what the Jewish people suffered. But also now, for example, often you'll get the Hamas not only
*  compared to the Nazis, but they'll say worse than the Nazis. And that memory used in that sense to
*  justify what's happening in Gaza. So I'm just wondering what's your general response to that?
*  It's an incredibly good point. There was a sense of victimhood in South Africa, and there was the
*  same sense of the rest of the world is against us. The UN is this corrupted, awful organization
*  that doesn't understand. And in the South African context, it was also around we are true Christians
*  and we are fighting for Christianity and civilization. And the suffering of
*  Afrikaner South Africans was very real. The irony being that those concentration camps were
*  inhabited not only by people who were neo-Nazis, because many of our politicians in the post-World
*  War II period had actually been involved in neo-Nazi supporting militias during the Second World War.
*  But astonishingly, communists were put in the same concentration camps because they were seen as
*  dangerous, that they would have some sort of allegiance to Russia or to the Soviet Union,
*  and they had to sort of coexist in very uncomfortable ways. The Holocaust is probably
*  the framing moment of my entire family's life and history. I've lectured at Auschwitz on genocide
*  prevention for the Auschwitz Institute, which was one of the most extraordinary and emotionally
*  exhausting experiences I've ever had. And of course, many members of my extended family made
*  their way to Palestine in the aftermath of World War II, sometimes discovering other family
*  ministers, other family members who they thought were deceased had been killed in the camps.
*  So that is all a very vital part of my own personal history and of my politics, I suppose.
*  The issue becomes when that victimhood is utilized to oppress others, and that is what we saw in
*  apartheid South Africa, and that is what we have seen in the state of Israel. We often forget,
*  and it's sometimes very difficult for Jews, and I understand this difficulty,
*  we often forget that when many Jews, not all Jews, but many Jews, because it's also important to
*  bear in mind that anti-Zionism has been a very important strand of Jewish thought as long as
*  Zionism has existed. So it's not as though all Jews are necessarily Zionist or are necessarily committed
*  to the state of Israel or identify with the state. Interestingly, my parents happened to identify
*  very closely with the state of Israel, and we regularly visited Israel, we visited Yad Vashem,
*  the Holocaust Memorial on numerous occasions. But being the victim is what resulted in
*  a small number of Jewish South Africans being centrally involved in the struggle against apartheid
*  because they believed that never again didn't only apply to Jews, it applied to everybody.
*  And when they found themselves in an apartheid state like South Africa, they immediately sided
*  with the oppressed, not the oppressor, because they themselves and their families had been oppressed
*  through 2,000 years of history, as you say. The same applies in Israel when, you know,
*  the formation of the state in 48 coincided, obviously, because they were related events
*  with the Nakba against the Palestinian people, where tens and tens, if not hundreds of thousands
*  of Palestinians were pushed out of their homes. And Palestinian life since 48 has been a series
*  of devastating traumas, culminating in the current situation that is perhaps the worst I have certainly
*  ever seen in my lifetime. And I believe that victimhood should make Jews at the forefront
*  of social justice and struggle against any injustice that we find anywhere in the world.
*  And if that injustice is perpetrated by other Jews, we as Jews still have a responsibility to
*  call that out. And it's really because of my Jewish background and my Jewish heritage that I got involved
*  in the struggle against apartheid as early as I did. And it's because of my Judaism, it's because
*  of the place that Israel has in my family, in my extended family's personal and political history,
*  that I believe it is so important to speak out against the way in which Israel conducts itself
*  in relation to the Palestinians. And it's why, you know, Nelson Mandela, who I was unbelievably
*  privileged to work with, and believe me, working with him over many years and seeing him at least
*  weekly, the mythical nature of the man doesn't diminish at all. The most extraordinary human
*  being I've ever come into contact with. And we can spend hours just talking about that and his
*  views on Israel and Palestine. But you know, he spoke about apartheid in South Africa and Palestine
*  as the key moral issues of our time. And then when he came out of jail declaring our freedom
*  is incomplete without the freedom of the Palestinian people, he continued to say, now it is the issue
*  of Palestine that is the most important moral issue of our time. And it's really that that has
*  motivated me. Oof, goosebumps. In terms of parallels, the struggle against apartheid. So you had
*  obviously the struggle of the ANC, which of course you were very proudly part of, and you had an
*  international struggle as well. The anti-apartheid movement, my dad was involved in that as well
*  back in the day. And I suppose in terms of, again, well, I suppose this is where the similarities
*  and differences, because, you know, as you say, South Africa was treated as some sort of pariah
*  estate, even though Western governments were complicit often in the crimes of apartheid and
*  sort of as a kind of bulwark against communism and all the rest of it, and treated the ANC as terrorists.
*  But you had broad support for the anti-apartheid movement. That was a respectable
*  movement to be part of. And I'm just wondering in terms of, you know, the role that played
*  in why it was important. Because I suppose one of the things I find grim and depressing is while
*  there were courageous white South Africans who fought apartheid, I think it's fair to say that
*  most white South Africans bought into it and had to reluctantly be forced to realise apartheid had
*  to end. And that was against their interests as they saw it. But they didn't feel they had a
*  choice. And again, they were extremely courageous Israeli peace activists who I keep interviewing.
*  They are very marginalised. And if you look at public opinion in Israel, well, the polling suggests,
*  for example, that most Israelis don't think enough firepower is being used in Gaza and most support
*  the ethnic cleansing of Gaza. It is grim, grim reading. But the difference is there's no
*  there's no incentive for them to change in the way there was with the South Africans because
*  white South Africans realised the ghost is up. They don't think that. They think we can go with
*  anything. Nothing's going to stop us. The West aren't going to change their views. The role of
*  that anti-apartheid movement and whether you can see boycott divestment sanctions, the role of that,
*  and if we can ever do the same thing. So the anti-apartheid movement was an extraordinary
*  phenomenon. It was led by South Africans and it had its roots domestically in South Africa.
*  So what led to the end of apartheid ultimately, and this was an incredibly long struggle we
*  shouldn't forget, was a combination of black South Africans on the on the ground showing the most
*  unbelievable courage and fortitude, making the country effectively ungovernable.
*  But I think that would have been to some extent ineffective in bringing an end to the system
*  without this extraordinary mobilisation globally, where you speak to people of my generation.
*  I was born in 64. There are very few of them who are of a political bent, who don't recall
*  their involvement in some way or another in the anti-apartheid struggle, even if it was just
*  driving past a Shell garage when they needed to fill up their car because Shell was being boycotted
*  as part of the global anti-apartheid movement. Even if it was not buying South African origins,
*  oranges in the supermarket. It's very important to note that at the moment our governments and
*  many governments in the so-called Western world are trying to make illegal any sort of boycotts
*  of Israel. But that global anti-apartheid movement was absolutely essential in bringing about an end
*  to apartheid in South Africa because it had a massive impact on the South African economy.
*  So the daily quality of life of privileged white South Africans started to decline
*  when the banks who had been boycotted by students who refused to take loans out from them,
*  Barclays and Chase Manhattan as it was then called at the time, in the UK and US respectively,
*  when they decided not to roll over South Africa's debt, everything suddenly became much more
*  expensive for the apartheid state. Oil, food, everything that we needed. And that was the
*  point at which F.W. de Klerk, who was our last apartheid president, who was on the right wing
*  of an already far right-wing political party, decided the game was up and he had to negotiate.
*  And that's why I think BDS is such a crucial, peaceful tool of struggle against Israel's
*  oppression of the Palestinian people. It is the only thing that is going to bring the majority of
*  Israeli citizens to their senses because it affects their day-to-day lives. And when you are paying
*  for the role your country plays in the oppression of another people in that way, then I think
*  suddenly the calculus changes. And it's important to bear in mind. So as I said, I believe the
*  economic dimension was the most important, but the cultural and sporting dimensions,
*  the academic dimensions, these were all very important as well. White South Africans used
*  to pride themselves that they were the rugby world champions because they hadn't played anybody else
*  for decades and decades because they were banned from international sport. And that had a huge
*  psychological impact on the country. And I think what is also relevant to today's struggle
*  is that you're quite right in saying, you know, Thatcher and Reagan describe Mandela in the ANC
*  as terrorists. There is also strong information to suggest that Thatcher called on the apartheid
*  state privately to execute Mandela as it was too dangerous to keep him alive in prison.
*  And Mandela reminded her of this fact the first time they met after he'd been released. He came
*  to South Africa and gave a talk at Westminster and she was obviously retired by then, but she sort of
*  hobbled into the talk and as she was hobbling to her seat, he went up to her like he always does,
*  very magnanimously and said, you must be surprised to see me. And then explained that he was very
*  well aware that she had suggested that they kill him off. I don't know what her response was. I'd
*  love to know. So would I. Yeah, exactly. But you know, the reality is that Thatcher and Reagan
*  actually propped up the apartheid regime. Thatcher's husband Dennis actually did huge amounts of
*  business, a lot of it against embargoes with apartheid South Africa. The Reagan administration
*  was involved in fighting in Namibia and Angola that was basically with the South African apartheid
*  forces against the MPLA government in Angola. But at the end of the day, they could not publicly and
*  openly support apartheid South Africa in the way our political leaders do Israel at the moment.
*  And I think that's a fundamental change that we need to understand as to where that is coming from
*  and why is that the case today? I mean, linked to that, you know, oppressors will often accuse those
*  scrutinizing or attacking or fighting their war crimes, their oppression as being prejudiced
*  against them. I mean, you can see that with Putin's allies, they constantly attack those who oppose
*  the invasion of Ukraine is being driven by Russophobia. And I suppose the question here is,
*  you know, anti-Semitism is real. It's actually very ingrained in European culture. It does exist
*  and within living memory caused the great horror of extermination of the Jewish people. So we have
*  to take anti-Semitism seriously. And at the same time, those who are apologists for what is a
*  horrific mass slaughter, I'll ask after this about the question genocide in South Africa's case,
*  has been driven by anti-Semitism. That's used to shut down those voices. In fact,
*  before I spoke to you earlier today, a German Jewish activist who's been involved in the
*  solidarity movement with Palestinians who I interviewed a while ago got in touch with me to
*  say that the Ministry of Culture in Germany has decided to make artists sign to say if they agree
*  with the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism in order to receive any state funds, artists in
*  Germany are very dependent on state funds. The IHRA definition is that what frames criticism of
*  Israel as anti-Semitism. So just interesting that, I mean, it's interesting with Germany,
*  because almost they're using the guilt which the German state had. And I'm going to say it,
*  a lot of the German people, I'm not saying that in a collective guilt way, but it is true,
*  a large section of the German people did buy into and knew the Holocaust was happening at the time.
*  They're using that guilt and making others, Palestinians pay for it. But I'm just interested
*  what you think about that. We take anti-Semitism seriously and the question of anti-Semitism,
*  false claims of anti-Semitism, is being shut down solidarity with the Palestinians.
*  You know Owen, I think for most people on the planet, unfortunately, racism and discrimination
*  is a reality. You've experienced it yourself. In my own case. Homophobia, I suppose, yeah, sorry.
*  Yeah. You know, in my own case, from the age of, I don't know, I was eight or nine.
*  And my mom had drove a little mini. The original ones were much smaller than the modern ones.
*  And we were trying to get six of my school friends into the car to take us to football
*  practice. And one of the boys said, how do you get a dozen Jews into a mini? You throw a half
*  cent piece on the back seat. And my mom told this boy to get lost. She never wanted to see him again.
*  And he'd be walking to football practice from then on. And I sort of said to afterwards, mom,
*  why were you so cross with Gavin? What, you know, and she explained anti-Semitism to me and why he
*  was saying that. And so it's been a very, very real factor in my life. I've experienced my maiden
*  speech in parliament, two national party members. So, you know, members of the apartheid party
*  were thrown out of the assembly because they were calling me a communist. I'd never belonged to the
*  South African communist party, but they were calling me a communist as I was speaking.
*  And eventually I stopped and said, why do you think I'm a communist? And they said, well,
*  you're a Jew and you're a member of the ANC. Of course you're a communist. And, you know, so it's
*  been a very real factor in my life. I've been very fortunate that even, you know, the experience of
*  homophobia, you sadly had to experience had physical consequences for you. I've never
*  experienced anything like that. And I'm extraordinarily grateful for that. So racism of which anti-Semitism
*  is a part has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. And it's made me so determined
*  to oppose every single form of racism and discrimination that I come across, be it anti-Semitism,
*  which obviously was top of the pile for me because I happened to be Jewish, Islamophobia, which,
*  especially moving to the UK, I realized remains such a central problem and obviously became a
*  different type of problem after the tragedy of 9-11. And even anti-black racism, which I've been
*  astonished at the extent of in Western Europe and parts of Eastern Europe since I've lived here.
*  So my difficulty is when those sorts of campaigns against racism are utilized to try and silence
*  people speaking out on behalf of other oppressed people. So I do believe quite honestly, and I
*  think there is enormous evidence for this, that the Israeli state quite a few years ago, as the
*  BDS movement was gaining momentum, the Israeli state did take a very conscious decision
*  to label all criticism of Israel and its policies as anti-Semitism because it believed that would
*  make it far more difficult for campaigns like the BDS movement to gain meaningful traction
*  because they realize, you know, Israel and South Africa are incredibly close allies.
*  And the Israeli government is plenty smart enough to understand how important BDS was
*  to ending apartheid in South Africa. And I think the problem we have is that through things like
*  the IHRA definition, through this very foolish labeling of any criticism of Israel as anti-Semitic,
*  through identifying people who have different politics to yourself as anti-Semitical,
*  in my case self-heating too is the thing that I'm constantly told, I think is not
*  incredibly disingenuous, remarkably bereft of any sort of personal integrity or values,
*  but it profoundly and fundamentally undermines the incredibly important and very real struggles
*  against anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and all forms of racism and discrimination.
*  And I do think, Owen, that this is one of the reasons why our political leaders
*  are so uncritical in their support of Israel and have just decided that the alternative,
*  the nuance, which is quite difficult, is so dangerous because of being labeled anti-Semitic
*  that we'll just steer clear of it. And, you know, Germany, which you raise is an extraordinary
*  example at the moment. Germany is tying itself in the most extraordinary intellectual and
*  psychological and political knots dealing with Israel at the moment. It's almost as though
*  as a nation they're trying to espouse the view that we committed a genocide and therefore the
*  victims of that genocide can do what the hell they like, which to me is the opposite of the message
*  that they should be the bearers of, which is we committed genocide and we have to oppose genocide
*  wherever it occurs and by whomsoever it is perpetrated.
*  Just before I ask my final question, I want to ask you about South Africa taking
*  Israel to the International Court of Justice, which is the highest court of the United Nations,
*  and this is over what it claims is Israel has violated the Genocide Convention of 1948,
*  to which it is a signatory, as well as countries like Britain and obviously the vast majority
*  of countries on earth. I've been covering this extensively on this channel, I've gone through
*  this document, it is an extremely serious document to say the least for those who haven't read
*  through it. I mean it really is extraordinary, incredibly evidenced, they've gone into a huge
*  amount of depth, even if you're aware or spent a lot of time trying to, I suppose, follow the
*  war crimes being committed and the rhetoric of Israeli leaders and officials, you'll still be
*  shocked by it, partly because of stuff you weren't aware of, but partly just because it's all in one
*  place. And what they deal with is two questions, for those who don't know, it's conduct, genocide
*  or conduct, and intent, which is genocidal statements which are illegal, it's illegal under
*  the Genocide Convention to incite genocide, and Israel actually has a legal responsibility
*  to take action against anyone who uses genocidal intent, so they're already just bang to rights
*  on that point because the Prime Minister, President, Minister of Defence, most of the Cabinet at this
*  point, members of the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament, Israeli army leaders, soldiers on the
*  ground, engaging in rampant throwing genocide or rhetoric around like confetti. But I'm interested,
*  why do you think the significance of South Africa, I suppose, taking this action, and I'm
*  interested again because you said this is worse than apartheid, the genocidal language that is
*  being used. You know, I interviewed Raz Segal, I keep going back to this interview, he's an Israeli
*  American associate professor of genocide and Holocaust studies, and he said it's actually
*  very rare for intent to be so clearly stated. Normally what happens is the offending state just
*  dresses up its language in humanitarianism, denialism, no, no, no, we're not doing this,
*  that or the other, but it's just, you know, they're human animals, do amelek in the Bible,
*  which is where God orders the Israelites to kill all men, women, children and livestock,
*  is not subtle. So I'm just wondering, the significance of that case and also
*  that question of genocidal intent, it's so vocal. Yeah. Oh, and my day job is to
*  write books and make films about conflict and the global arms trade.
*  As I say, I've lectured and written on genocide prevention for the Auschwitz Institute. I have
*  never seen a document alleging genocide as thorough, as well argued, and frankly as
*  overwhelming as the South African document, which doesn't surprise me when you look at the lawyers
*  involved, the legal team is led by a gentleman by the name of John Dugard, who is probably one of
*  the finest, if not the finest international lawyer on the planet, who has worked on international law,
*  on war crimes, on genocide, his entire career. The fact that he's South African is not coincidental.
*  And this is why I think it is so significant and symbolic that South Africa have brought this case
*  to the ICJ. As I mentioned, the party South Africa and Israel had a very long and a very,
*  very close relationship. The two in an extraordinary moment of history, where our neo-Nazi prime
*  minister, a chap called BJ Forster, who was a brutal minister of justice, who had someone I
*  knew very vaguely thrown out of a 10th floor window because he was an anti-apartheid activist,
*  became prime minister. And I remember seeing on television, which had only very recently come to
*  South Africa, seeing him traveling to Israel. And his first stop was at Yad Vashem, which, as I
*  mentioned, I had visited quite often as a child with my parents, and which has had an enormous
*  impact on me, obviously. And my mom was seething and I said to her, what's the matter? And she
*  said, how can this man, be at Yad Vashem, paying his respects to the dozens of my family who died
*  in the Holocaust? And I said, what do you mean, mom? And she said, the man was and is a Nazi.
*  On that visit, Forster, and I think the Israeli prime minister at the time was Shimon Peres,
*  signed an agreement that effectively enabled both Israel and South Africa to become nuclear states.
*  And that for me is incredibly symbolic of the extent of the cooperation between the two countries.
*  So Mandela, before he was even president in South Africa, was asked by 10 of his friends,
*  Mandela, before he was even president in South Africa, was asked by Ted Koppel, a very then very
*  famous US newscaster, you know, why he was so wedded to the Palestinian struggle. And his brilliant
*  response was, well, because South Africa's struggle and the Palestinian struggle are one in the same
*  struggle. America's enemies are not South Africa's enemies. And the ANC and what was then the
*  Palestine Liberation Organization under Yasser Arafat had incredibly close relationships
*  and what were described in political discourse of the time as fraternal relations.
*  And Arafat was actually one of the first foreign leaders to address the democratic South African
*  parliament. Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who with Nelson Mandela, excuse me,
*  is probably the biggest influence on my life. And a friend and a mentor in many ways who has
*  been very supportive of my work. Archbishop Tutu went even further than Mandela. He said,
*  why would I not be incredibly critical of a state that practices apartheid like we experienced here,
*  but even more importantly, that was on the side of my oppressor to ensure that my oppression
*  continued. And he then cites the example of the fact that nuclear weapons were developed jointly
*  by the two countries. And so I think the fact that South Africa, which is, you know, in many
*  people's consciousness, an extraordinary example, despite the very many challenges of the post
*  apartheid period, is the standout example of a country that has won its liberation
*  from racist and what some describe as colonial settler oppression. So the fact that it is South
*  Africa bringing this case against Israel to the ICJ, I think has all of that history embedded in
*  it. And South African politics to this day remains very in touch with the Palestinian struggle.
*  When I was in South Africa a few months ago, for a couple of months,
*  and ordinary South Africans, and it's a highly politicized country and obviously a very race
*  conscious society. This was even before the seventh of October. Talk incessantly about the
*  situation in Israel and Palestine. It's of great concern to the majority of South Africans. So when
*  the chief rabbi of South Africa said that by bringing this case to the ICJ, South Africa
*  has humiliated itself internationally. In fact, I think exactly the opposite has happened.
*  I think South Africa is taking on that mantle that Mandela took on so well and so easily after 1994
*  of trying to be the world's conscience when it comes to racial oppression, when it comes to issues
*  like genocide. And to me it adds significant weight to the case that is being brought,
*  that it is South Africa doing it.
*  Just finally, people often look back at horrors and injustices in the past, and
*  they kind of elect themselves as if I was back there I would have stood up and I would have
*  been on that side. I would have spoken out and fought against apartheid, or maybe for example
*  gay rights, for example, or maybe the rights of women to vote, for example, going to the
*  back, or great injustices in the past suffered by people who were oppressed, discriminated against,
*  suffered huge bigotry. The truth is many people do not speak out at the time. They don't. They
*  speak out after. It's easy afterwards to say you're on the right side of an issue when
*  it's actually often took, often people had to pay a cost, didn't they? They had to sacrifice
*  and pay a cost. I'm just wondering about that finally in the context of now, because I think,
*  you know, I've worked in the British media now for 12 years. I'm not naive about the British media,
*  and I'm not surprised, I would say, by the response of much of the other British media
*  to what's happening, but I am still shocked, shocked to my core. I keep saying that.
*  I was clear about the racism that infests the British media, and I was clear about the
*  racism that infests the British media, and yet to see Palestinian life so wantonly treated as having
*  no meaning and no value whatsoever in the least subtle way possible, it is shocking to watch as
*  you see Palestinians, men, women, children, babies being slaughtered, often with, well, with western
*  bombs. It's a shocking experience. But the fact that so few people with a platform are speaking
*  out is grim. It is pretty grim, to say the least. So I'm just wondering in terms of, you know,
*  there's a cliche, the cliche, wait, we've got a cliche, George Orwell, to tell the truth in the
*  time of deceit as a revolutionary act. I know you have another quote actually by Edward Said,
*  but just in terms of people's responsibility to speak out when it's hard, particularly when
*  people are being gaslit, when the, when oppressors use deceits to muddy the waters, to
*  turn reality up on its head. So I suppose it's about, you know, speaking the truth,
*  standing up against injustice, given your own, I'd say, incredible experience and heritage in the
*  current context, when there is actually an attempt to silence and vilify and marginalise anyone who
*  speaks out and how few are speaking out. What's your just thoughts on all that?
*  Sure. That's, you know, the first thing I want to say on that, Owen, is, I mean, I have enormous
*  respect for the way in which you have addressed this issue. Don't compliment me. I hate being
*  complimented. No, no, no, it's actually really serious, because even people who, you know,
*  are fairly obviously personally of the left, if you will, although there's those labels are problematic,
*  but many people have not spoken out. So I think it is incredibly important to note when people like
*  yourself and others have. Well, I'd never forgive myself. So I mean, I wouldn't be able to look at
*  myself in the mirror. I think that's one of the things. It's where I started in South Africa.
*  How do you live with yourself when you know you are living the very comfortable life you're living,
*  because 83% of the population has nothing and live in the most extraordinarily bad circumstances?
*  You know, to find a white South African today who was supportive of apartheid is impossible.
*  But it's amazing how the vast, vast majority of them every, every election
*  voted for the party of apartheid or worse. And, you know, my involvement in the South African
*  struggle and my involvement in anti-racist struggles generally have been a source of
*  nothing but privilege for me to have said that I worked with someone like Mandela,
*  that I knew someone like Tutu, that they would even give me the time of day.
*  So that the sort of the nonsense that comes with it, and it came even from within my own family,
*  I was once very publicly, I led a relief operation for a squatter settlement that had been burned to
*  the ground by the apartheid security forces, 70,000 shacks just burned to the ground in the
*  space of a few hours. And I illegally went into this community with 20 students in the organization
*  I ran. And then they wouldn't let us out because they didn't want white South Africa or the world
*  to know what they were doing. And it took a remarkable Jewish MP called Helen Sussman,
*  who was the only opposition member of parliament at the time, to stand up and say, you're keeping
*  these 21 students against their will, let them out. And that's how we got released. I arrived home
*  and an uncle of mine happened to be at the house and he said to me,
*  what's the matter with you? Are you on drugs? What were you doing there? And I said to him,
*  what do you mean? And he said to me, just be grateful that it's the Schwartz's and not us
*  this time. I never spoke to him again in my life. So, you know, the fact that I was called all sorts
*  of things that were really disgusting and racist, the fact that people now, because I'm not
*  uncritical about Israel and about what is going on in the Palestinian territories, describe me as
*  a self-hating Jew. My children would argue exactly the opposite is the problem. Or, you know, that
*  I'm an anti-Semite somehow. My first degrees were in clinical psychology and I find some of these
*  contortions just extraordinarily embarrassing. The sort of use of facile pop psychology because
*  someone has different political views to you is really such a reflection of the people who use
*  that sort of language. But to have to suffer that isn't pleasant. But by comparison to what the people
*  who you are trying to sympathize, empathize with and to seek solidarity with, what they are suffering,
*  you know, what Palestinians in Gaza have suffered over the past months, we actually can't conceive
*  because if we could, we wouldn't be able to go about our daily lives. It is too horrific to be
*  able to conceive. So our responsibility as privileged people is, as you say, to speak truth to
*  power. And it has never been more important than it is today because, as you say, Edward Said,
*  the brilliant Palestinian intellectual described this phenomenon of power repeating untruths
*  until it has the force of truth. And that's what apartheid South Africa was based on.
*  It was this total lie. You know, when I was 15 years old and these recruiters came to school to
*  sign us up for our compulsory military service, they said to us, people say there's a communist
*  behind every bush on the border. That's the border with black Africa, with the frontline states.
*  That's not true, he said. They're not enough bushes. And there were these sort of these
*  appalling lies that were engendered and that people came to internalize and believe.
*  And a lot of them had to do with our own superiority, as I very sadly see amongst many Israelis.
*  Because I think the dehumanization of the other unfortunately dehumanizes the oppressor as well,
*  and Gaza has shown us that in the most appalling ways. But I think we have to ensure
*  that as much of the unvarnished truth gets out into the world as possible.
*  And if that makes people dislike us or hate us or resent us or call us ridiculous names,
*  so be it. Far rather to live a life in truth in that way, in pursuit of justice, of equality,
*  of justice, of equality, than to pursue a life of comfort,
*  ignoring the injustices that are often being done in your name. And often, as is the case with Israel
*  at the moment, given Britain's supply of weapons to Israel, is also being done with our tax pounds.
*  I think if we all took the time to think about it, we would all come to the same conclusion,
*  and we would all agree with Nelson Mandela, that Palestine is the most important moral issue of our time.
*  Wow, one of the most powerful interviews I've ever done. It's rare that I end an interview
*  on the brink of tears. That was incredibly, incredibly powerful stuff, though. And I think
*  everyone who watches this or listens to this will be incredibly touched and moved. And just finally
*  on that, what really struck home to me there was whatever people in Western countries may face if
*  they speak out for Palestine, if they speak the truth, right now, almost every day, a Palestinian
*  journalist is being slaughtered by the Israeli states as they speak truth and bear witness
*  in unbelievable and indescribable horror, knowing every day could be their last, knowing every moment
*  could be their last, watching those they love be killed, slaughtered. Like the Palestinian journalist,
*  the Gaza correspondent of Al Jazeera, his entire family almost was wiped out, his wife, kids, and
*  the rest. And the next day he went to work. And then another time he was injured, and one of his
*  colleagues was killed. And the next day he went to work. And I think if they have that kind of
*  courage to speak the truth about what is happening to the Palestinian people in Gaza, the least we
*  can do in these comfortable environs, where we have this privilege and we don't suffer the constant
*  threat of unbelievable violence and misery and suffering, the least we can do is to speak out.
*  Andrew, that was just such an incredible, powerful interview. Do share this interview, make sure
*  everyone hears this. I think it will have a big impact on a lot of people. It's only had a big
*  impact on me. Like, subscribe. Andrew, thank you. It was a big, big privilege. Thank you so much.
