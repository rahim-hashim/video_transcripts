# Far Right Mob STORM Cenotaph - Government And Media To Blame
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [November 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg8-M8XZhqc)
*  What a disgrace. What an absolute disgrace.
*  Over the last few weeks we have had a campaign, a vicious campaign,
*  of bile, hatred and lies directed at those of us who oppose the mass indiscriminate
*  slaughter of thousands of innocent Palestinian civilians, an onslaught backed by our government
*  and by other Western governments, and I would note by much of the Western media as well.
*  We were betrayed and are betrayed as dangerous, terror-supporting
*  extremists as a menace and we were relentlessly denounced because there is today a national
*  protest as there is every Saturday. There were always national protests on Saturday for
*  very obvious logistical reasons and that has been the case since this current round of horror began
*  and this year Remembrance Day happened to fall on a Saturday. That sometimes happens. Now as we
*  remember on Remembrance Day when it falls on a Saturday we have a two-minute silence at 11am
*  and then life continues as it always does. Now media outlets and politicians,
*  conservative politicians amongst others, spread the lie that we were going to desecrate the
*  Cenotaph and disrupt the two-minute silence despite the fact there was never any evidence
*  for that whatsoever but also our protest was scheduled for two hours or so after the
*  two-minute silence began. The march is absolutely nowhere near the Cenotaph. It begins over at Hyde
*  Park and it ends at the US Embassy. Nowhere near. About a mile to two miles away from the
*  Cenotaph but we heard this all week. We've heard this all week. Hate marches, that's how Suheila
*  Bravman described us despite the fact that her entire career is simply bellowing hate on a daily
*  basis. This was always outrageous. I mean the likes of the Daily Mail pray they don't end up with a
*  riot at the Cenotaph constantly focusing on this menace that those of us who support and stand by
*  Palestinians in their darkest hour, the way we were demonised and attacked and defamed. Douglas Murray,
*  a commentator who isn't fringe, he's on TV, he writes for the Telegraph, Associate Editor at the
*  Spectator, UK HMAS supporters are now planning a million-man march on Remembrance Day. They plan
*  to defame our war dead and desecrate the Cenotaph itself. This is the tipping point. If such a march
*  goes ahead then the people of Britain must come out and stop these barbarians. He used lies to try
*  and encourage people and we can see the sorts of people who heeded these calls to come out onto the
*  streets to stop these barbarians. They collectively whipped up and legitimised a far-right mob who
*  support Israel's massacre, who see the likes of Suheila Bravman as a hero and despite the fact
*  you know that those of us who oppose the massacre of Palestinian children were always clear about
*  our peaceful intents and what our motives are, standing in solidarity with the Palestinian people.
*  We were constantly lied about by these media and politicians so that we were treated as fair game.
*  Those far-right protesters felt that we were all fair game, that everything they thought
*  about those standing with Palestinians in this darkest hour was confirmed and legitimised and
*  made completely respectable by politicians of the media. What happened then? What were the consequences?
*  Yeah
*  Yeah
*  Oh
*  Oh so we did get disorder on Remembrance Day after all.
*  We did have the Senataf being stormed by a bunch of thugs.
*  Not us.
*  Not us.
*  By the far right.
*  A far right mob whipped up by Soella Bravaman, by Rishi Sanak and by much of the media.
*  This is on them.
*  As the Guardian reports, a number of them explicitly stated they had come because of
*  Home Secretary Soella Bravaman's comments over pro-Palestinian hate marches and that
*  police treated them unfavourably compared to politically correct minority groups.
*  Now as Humza Yousaf, the First Minister of Scotland says, the far right has been emboldened
*  by the Home Secretary.
*  She spent her week fanning the flames of division.
*  They are now attacking the police on Armistice Day.
*  The Home Secretary's position is untenable and she must resign.
*  Yes, we'll start with the resignation I think.
*  Soella Bravaman as a bare minimum.
*  Listen to this.
*  Lizzie Durden, brilliant journalist at The Independent, she writes, the Metropolitan
*  Police used its power to ban pro-Palestinian marches but not Senataf defenders and far
*  right groups from Whitehall today.
*  So, Palestinian supporters who had no intention of going to the Senataf were banned.
*  Far right activists who did have heavy intention of going, and as we can see, absolutely did
*  turn up, they were not banned.
*  Whereas why the senior office in charge of the operation said he thought they would not
*  cause serious disorder by themselves.
*  The press conference, DAC Lawrence Taylor, did not use the term far right and called
*  the Senataf event a counter protest.
*  He said counter protests will be allowed in Whitehall because the sole purpose and intention
*  is to protect the sanctity of the Senataf from remembrance.
*  How fucking dare you?
*  How dare you?
*  DAC Taylor said, I don't anticipate there will be any disorder from that group.
*  The disorder from a pro-Palestinian group going to that area will come from a pro-Palestinian
*  group going to that area whilst they are there if they are there.
*  If a counter protest is within that Whitehall footprint, I will be allowing that.
*  Journalists asked DAC Taylor several times why only pro-Palestinian protesters were banned
*  from the area around the Senataf.
*  He said, I've got no issue with a group going to Whitehall in order to protect the Senataf.
*  They will not cause serious disorder by themselves.
*  What the hell?
*  What the hell is this police officer doing?
*  Just openly legitimising and making respectable this far-right mob who then stormed the Senataf.
*  We saw the scenes with our own eyes.
*  Mark Rowley, the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, he needs to resign.
*  Whoever this DAC Taylor guy is, you need to go quite clearly as well.
*  It's difficult to put into words the rage about what's happened here.
*  What this smear campaign was always about was trying to stop us talking about the mass
*  slaughter of Palestinians, thousands of Palestinians and the humanitarian catastrophe enveloping
*  the Gaza Strip because of an Israeli onslaught backed, facilitated by Western governments.
*  And it's trying to make us think that the real dangerous extremists are those who oppose
*  mass slaughter of children because those who support this onslaught know they're morally
*  exposed.
*  They know, according to the polling, the vast majority of Britons support an immediate ceasefire.
*  They stand against public opinion.
*  So what they're trying to do is trying to deflect from themselves, them, the ones facilitating
*  the horrors currently going on, and instead say, no, the ones you should be really angry
*  about are those standing with the Palestinian people.
*  These are the consequences.
*  And this is just how it's only begun.
*  Because the far-right have been encouraged and legitimised and to see this movement,
*  this mass movement of people, which reflects what most people in this country think, and
*  in terms of an immediate ceasefire, that, as I say, we are fair game.
*  This is one of the most disgraceful moments I've ever seen.
*  And these media outlets, as well as politicians, if anything happens to any of us who stand
*  with the Palestinians, then this is on you.
*  You did this.
*  You whipped them up.
*  You legitimised them.
*  And whatever you say in the coming days to try and wash your hands of this, you must
*  never be allowed to get away with this.
*  And this just is a classic example of how we should always remember who the real threat
*  is, which is a far-right being legitimised by the media and political establishment.
*  And they're always trying to turn the tables on movements which, for example, have the
*  temerity to oppose the mass slaughter of innocent civilians with the support of Western governments.
*  Don't let them get away with this.
