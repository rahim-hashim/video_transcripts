# Israeli Politician CITES HITLER As Inspiration Yes, This Is Horrifically Real
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [June 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fO7KxsYKG7s)
*  So we are now at the stage of Israeli politicians favourably citing Adolf Hitler in support of
*  Israel's genocidal rampage in Gaza. Moshe Feiglin is a former member of the Israeli Knesset,
*  that is parliament, and belonged to the good, that is Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister's
*  ruling party. He's gone on Israel's most popular news channel and positively invoked the sentiments
*  of the former Nazi dictator of Germany, Adolf Hitler, who exterminated of course two-thirds of
*  Europe's Jewish population amidst a litany of other genocidal and murderous crimes. Don't believe
*  me? Doesn't sound quite farfetched, does it? Let's just have a listen to this with a translation
*  done by a brilliant anti-Zionist Jewish activist in Israel who goes by the rather punchy anonymous
*  Twitter handle of I really hate you.
*  So he says to be clear, as Hitler, may his name be erased, once said, I cannot live in this world
*  if there is one Jew left in it. We should not live in this land if even one such Islamo-Nazi
*  remains in Gaza and not before we return to Gaza and turn it into Hebrew Gaza, alongside other such
*  choice quotes. As we all know, guests in our land, this whole land is ours. Now he may have said
*  Hitler's name should be erased, but he is there calling for the replication of Hitler's sentiment.
*  And he's making it very clear that he equates the Palestinian population as a whole with what he
*  calls Islamo-Nazis, given he says that Gaza will be turned into Hebrew Gaza. This is outright
*  genocidal incitement, openly platformed and legitimised by the mainstream Israeli media.
*  This kind of genocidal incitement is rampant in Israeli media, let alone of course the rhetoric
*  of Israeli leaders themselves. It is itself a crime. The 1948 Genocide Convention, which Israel
*  itself placed on its own stat sheet books in 1950, strictly prohibits the public incitement of
*  genocide. Indeed, the Israeli state, when it put it on its stat sheet books,
*  it carries the death penalty. In theory, that still remains the case. Now the International Court of
*  Justice has also ordered Israel to take action against this incitement of genocide. Israel has
*  continued to refuse to do so, and the airwaves are full of this incitement, including people going on
*  television and suggesting Palestinian children are killed on the basis they will turn into terrorists.
*  Now this incitement has consequences of course, whipping up the Israeli public to support
*  genocidal actions, not least the Israeli soldiers themselves who are inflicting this genocide.
*  Which brings me onto a tweet by Nathalie Bennett, former Israeli Prime Minister,
*  often portrayed somehow as a moderate alternative to Benjamin Netanyahu. In it he says,
*  I wish we could say that the Palestinians were hijacked by Hamas and the people themselves
*  actually seek peace and prosperity, but the facts show the opposite. He goes on to cite a poll showing
*  two thirds of Palestinians support the 7th October attack, that Hamas won a majority in the 2006
*  Palestinian elections, that Poll show Hamas would win again, and that he then claims on 7th October
*  thousands of random garzons joined the massacre, slaughtering families, burning adults and children,
*  raping women. He then justifies all of this by saying it's important, because the truth always
*  matters, that Palestinians are being brain poisoned to believe Jews are Satan and pigs, that no
*  diplomatic plan can skip this, and that it's not hardship driving these attitudes. He concludes
*  that for there to be progress, that means Israel has to denazify Gaza and many of the Palestinian
*  public, concluding, first we need to defeat Hamas. Now a few things here about what is and should be
*  considered a genocidal piece of text. Firstly, these people simply cannot understand why the
*  Palestinian people are so furious at the Israeli state. They pretend it's because they've just
*  been radicalised by hate mongers into anti-Semitism. Well let's just be clear here,
*  and let's just be clear because this is not said enough. If another group of people who were not
*  Jewish had forced the Palestinian people from their land, from their homes en masse, and stole
*  their land in 1948, slaughtering 15,000 of them in the process, subjected them to the longest
*  belligerent occupation in modern history, and also the longest siege in modern history, and
*  colonised their stolen land with huge numbers of illegal settlements, and subjected them to a
*  system of apartheid, and refused to allow them to have any state of their own, well guess what? The
*  outcome would have been exactly the same. None of this has anything to do with the fact that those
*  who settled and colonised Palestinian land and subjected them to apartheid happened to be Jewish.
*  If there had been any other group of people with a different faith, the results would have been
*  exactly the same. When he says, he talks about thousands of girls and civilians committing war
*  crimes, that's simply untrue by the way. There were some civilians who took part on the 7th of
*  October, but no one has presented any evidence or claimed to present any evidence, there was
*  thousands. If he's going down this path, Israeli settlers in the West Bank are classed as civilians
*  and have committed and are committing multiple war crimes, including and up to killing Palestinian
*  children. Which brings me on to a central point here, which is the logic here could easily be
*  deployed against the Israeli public. The war crimes committed by Israel are far more murderous,
*  objectively, cause far more destruction, and that continues every day. Far more Palestinian
*  civilians have been slaughtered. He mentions burning adults and children, given most of the
*  40,000 so Palestinians around 15,000 of them children who've been butchered by the Israeli
*  state have been burned to death. He might want to dial down that particular rhetoric.
*  The Israeli public have repeatedly overwhelmingly voted in politicians guilty of and supportive of
*  atrocious war crimes who use overtly genocide or rhetoric, e.g. and polls show that the Israeli
*  public would do that all over again. Polls show that Israeli Jewish public opinion, and I say
*  that because there is 20% of the population who are Palestinian and they don't have the same views,
*  but Israeli Jewish public opinion is almost evenly divided between those who think Israel hasn't used
*  enough firepower in Gaza, or that it's used the right amount with about one to two percent opting
*  for far, sorry, opting for too much firepower, not far too much, just too much firepower.
*  Two percent statistically negligible. I mean, in Britain, a higher proportion of people think the
*  earth's flat. Polls consistently show that a large majority of Jewish Israeli citizens oppose
*  all humanitarian aid being allowed into Gaza, which they cannot be stupid enough, naive enough
*  to not understand would mean killing every single Palestinian in Gaza. Polling also shows a large
*  majority of the Israeli Jewish public support removing the entire Palestinian population from
*  Gaza. That itself, of course, would be a grave war crime. So what now, Nathalie Bennett? What now?
*  Does that leave the Israeli public as a whole fair game? Well, you see, no, it doesn't actually,
*  does it? You say, I'm not like you. We're not like you. We are not the same. We live in a different
*  moral universe. We're not genocidal freaks like you. You should never give in to ideas of collective
*  guilt and punishment. That's always a precondition for mass murder and indeed genocide. The fact is,
*  what's treated as the radicalisation of the Palestinian people has been driven by lived
*  experience, not by being told things, but by living things, by being oppressed and subjugated
*  and occupied and slaughtered and tortured and incarcerated for generations. In Israeli society,
*  is, I'm afraid, a radicalisation against the indigenous population and driven by a sense,
*  in large part, of innate superiority, a belief that these are an inferior people and they deserve
*  what they get. None of this is specific in any way to Israel or to Israelis. It is a common thread
*  throughout the gruesome history of settler colonialism. But again, what we're really hearing
*  from Naphtali Bennett is genocidal implication. It drives the idea amongst the Israeli population
*  that the Palestinian population are rabid, murderous Nazis who are driven by a deranged
*  hatred of Jewish people and that encourages Israeli citizens into genocidal ideations.
*  He claims what he describes as denazification must happen only after Hamas is defeated. Now,
*  first of all, that's not going to happen. I mean, what that means in practice is a never-ending
*  genocidal war until all Palestinians are killed or driven from their homes, driven from Gaza.
*  Because what's happened over the last few months, as US intelligence officials have
*  priorly admitted, is firstly, most Hamas militants haven't been killed, but their ranks are
*  constantly replenished. Why is that? Not because they're being radicalised by listening to things,
*  but because the Israeli state has decided to wipe Gaza from the face of the earth and murder tens
*  of thousands of people and subject them to mass starvation. Weirdly, I know this is crazy,
*  some of those people who survived having, I don't know, picked up the remnants of their children and
*  put them in plastic bags. Some of them have gone, I'm not going to just resign myself to this,
*  I'm going to fight back. And a lot of those people fight to the death. They don't have anything to
*  lose, literally, in many of their cases, because their homes have been wiped out and much of their
*  families have been butchered. Anyone who is not completely deranged would understand that's
*  an inevitability. He refuses to engage with the obvious reality that Palestinian fury is driven
*  by subjugation, and it will never disappear until that subjugation ends. But what we are looking at
*  here is genocidal mania, the widespread legitimisation of genocidal sentiments in a
*  society which is inflicting a genocide against the Palestinian people with the support of our
*  governments. So you get to the point now, as a consequence, this is the stage we're at,
*  where Israeli politicians favourably cite Adolf Hitler quotes in support of that genocide. Well,
*  Israeli impunity allows us murderous fanaticism to boil away unchecked, but that impunity is
*  dissolving and the Israeli state won't get away with this. Please like and subscribe, do leave
