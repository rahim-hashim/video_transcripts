# BRUTAL Crackdown On Gaza Protests Exposes 'Free Speech' Hypocrites
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJn091N0TNU)
*  The utter horror unleashed by the Israeli state against Gaza has exposed a lot of people for who
*  they really are. And one example is this moral panic that we've had for many years. You know
*  the one I'm talking about. Cancel culture. The attack on free speech. The particular claim that
*  free speech on campuses is under attack. Another one is there is no right to be not offended. I
*  could go on. Have you noticed something? Have you noticed how that narrative just died to death
*  after 7th October? They're not even talking about it anymore are they? And why is that?
*  There's a very simple reason. Because the people who pushed the whole cancel culture narrative
*  now want to cancel people en masse if they dare to speak out against the mass slaughter
*  of the Palestinian people. And they want to suppress their right to free speech including
*  and indeed especially on campus. Let's just start shall we with the Republican governor of Texas,
*  Greg Abbott. Now let's just listen to him in June 2019. Some colleges are banning free speech
*  on college campuses. Well no more because I'm about to sign a law that protects free speech
*  on college campuses in Texas. Shouldn't have to do it. First amendment guarantees it.
*  Now it's law in Texas. Interesting stuff there from Greg Abbott. Let's just cut now to what
*  free speech looks like on a university campus in Texas right now.
*  What you're looking at here are scenes at the University of Texas in Austin where students
*  have gathered to demand that the university divest from companies doing business with Israel
*  given that minor detail of its genocide launch law against Gaza and chanting using the sacred
*  right to free speech on campus referred to of course by Greg Abbott to demand an end to the
*  occupation. And then the police stormed at them in the manner you can see. Now if that was a scene
*  at a university campus in Russia you would not hesitate any of us to call out that for what it
*  is. And to really hammer that point home it wasn't just students they were going for it was journalists
*  too. Let's just look at that gentleman dragged to the ground there by Texan state police.
*  So that's a photographer working for the Murdoch empire being dragged away and arrested just to
*  hammer home how self evidently indiscriminate this brutal crackdown is. Let's just see how the
*  right wing commentators have been dealing with all this. Graham Allen a right wing influencer in
*  Texas the host of Dear America on Rumble which sounds like a great watch. Now he's had a lot to
*  say about free speech over the years he certainly has. I did a little twitter search and it's one
*  of his favorite subjects in fact. He tweeted such things as free speech is back with three fire
*  emojis. He's called for a war for free speech. Really battling there isn't he? He's denounced AOC
*  saying she hates free speech. He's declared the left has completely destroyed free speech. Why is
*  he still talking then? He says bring back free speech. That's a classic sort of tweet of his.
*  What's this free speech warrior out there on the front lines for free speech? What does he have to
*  say about students in his state Texas exercising that glorious right of free speech that he's so
*  incensed about and then getting roughed up and arrested by police officers? Here's your time to
*  shine Graham. Show your principle. This is what he tweeted. Texas is not New York. That's him boasting
*  that Texas deals with these matters differently from New York. That they just go in and arrest
*  people in that the state essentially is willing to come just crashing down on their backs if they
*  dare to say the wrong thing. Now Greg Abbott that great warrior himself for free speech in Texas
*  treated out arrest being made right now and will continue until the crowd disperses. These protesters
*  belong in jail. Anti-Semitism will not be tolerated in Texas period. Students joining in hate-filled
*  anti-Semitic protests at any public college or university in Texas should be expelled. Well look
*  we can see that of course his determination we know this to conflate anti-Semitism that is a very
*  real evil. The hatred of bigotry and prejudice directed at Jewish people with opposing Israel
*  engaging in one of the most grotesque slaughters of our age. Anti-Semitism he says. Well given the
*  Republican figurehead is Donald Trump who has repeatedly used anti-Semitic rhetoric and has
*  associated with and indeed endorsed far-right extremists, ultra including neo-Nazis, probably
*  want to redirect that particular criticism buddy boy. Now clearly what he's doing here is cracking
*  now violently in a manner entirely reminiscent of brutal authoritarian dictatorships on the right
*  to free speech. It's really very straightforward actually. Well how's that actually panning out?
*  The Travis County attorney Dalia Garza said that her office was presented with 46 criminal trespass
*  arrests stemming from these protests. The court has declined, I'm just reading, all of those cases
*  for lack of probable cause and released the individuals from jail. Well nice try. Now here's
*  a video which was released for free speech week at this same university, University of Texas Austin,
*  where these grim scenes unfolded just six months ago. Why can members of the public come to
*  campus at any time and engage in demonstrations and speeches? So state law in Texas actually allows
*  members of the public just like our university community to come onto campus and use our common
*  outdoor areas for speech activity. I think that surprises a lot of students. They show up here
*  and they think who is this random stranger setting up a table talking about a thing I find upsetting
*  but it's protected by state law and- Well you'd have to have a heart of stone not to laugh at this
*  point. Now many are making the point that if you want to see a hands-off approach from the Texan
*  police then something as outrageous as young people protesting mass slaughter that's not going to make
*  the cut. A massacre of a school on the other hand is a different matter like the Ivald student
*  school massacre in which 19 students and two teachers were murdered while police just stood
*  back. Well that was a very different story wasn't it? Now at Columbia University they called in the
*  cops and arrested more than 100 students but faculty members at Columbia University walked
*  out in solidarity and in the same city New York University faculty their members also created a
*  ring around the Gaza solidarity encampment to protect their students after the school threatened
*  mass arrest. There were student encampments springing up across the United States like UCLA in Los
*  Angeles. At Emory University a huge police crackdown arrived that's Atlanta including one
*  student being tasered as they lay on the floor which I watched which was deeply unpleasant.
*  At Northwestern University in Illinois students formed a human chain to push back police trying
*  to break their encampments. Now I could go on but look the claims about free speech and cancel culture
*  were always a nonsense. What was really going on there was people who believed they had the right
*  to say overtly bigoted things about minorities but no one could say anything back and those
*  people acted like they were victims often in many cases because they got criticized on social media.
*  Now since 7th of October those same people have been at the forefront across the western world
*  of supporting actively and in fact making it happen getting people deplatformed, sacked, arrested,
*  vilified. If they speak out against one of the great crimes of our age you never had the left
*  trying to call in state police to run riot, arresting and beating people up because of their
*  views. These are people who ridiculed the idea that words meant violence and yet now are treating
*  anyone speaking out against genocide as committing violence simply by speaking. The monstrous raging
*  hypocrites. But look I will say this, what impact do the authorities really think this is going to
*  have? In the end. Really though. Do you think those students being arrested en masse and their fellow
*  students because they spoke out against a crime of historic proportions are just going to dust
*  it all off and never think of it again? Just move on with their lives? I can tell you something
*  that's not going to happen. This is a formative experience they will never ever ever forget the
*  monstrous injustices committed against them. It will define the way they look at the world
*  forever and not just then. Now in these circumstances protesters against various injustices
*  have often said the whole world is watching. Well that's never been more true because you see
*  before when that was said we had to rely on the world seeing what was happening through those
*  events being filtered through mainstream media outlets which frankly hid things lied about things
*  and twisted things. But now on social media notwithstanding the attempt by those who run
*  social media to clamp down on what's actually happening the world really is watching. And they're
*  watching two things. They're watching the obscenities being unleashed by the state of Israel
*  against Palestinians that grow test crimes being committed against innocent people on an
*  industrial scale. They're also watching searing injustices being inflicted against those who dare
*  to take a stand against these crimes. And on every single continent there are people lots of people
*  watching all of that and their worldview the way they look at the world that's changing forever.
*  They will never look at things in quite the same way ever again and that's going to have profound
*  consequences. Now it's up to us to harness those consequences to build movements which channel
*  the fury the righteous fury that so many people who have seen things they will never unsee.
*  But the apologists for this crime they've lost the battle for public opinion on both sides of
*  the Atlantic and that's only heading in one direction. And that's why they're trying to
*  suppress anyone who dares to speak out against this horror because they know what that means.
*  It means a demands and governments to take action against Israel and b it will mean a reckoning
*  with those who facilitated one of the great crimes of our age. That reckoning is going to happen
*  because the crime is simply too big and that's before the offensive against Rafa and I'm afraid
*  to say unspeakable crimes that are still to come. So you can clamp down on these protest guys but
*  this isn't a sign of strength it's a sign of weakness and those students aren't going to
*  give up because they know they're up against one of the great crimes of our age and they know
*  they'll never forgive themselves if they don't speak out and that's infectious. The more people
*  see the crimes committed against the people of Gaza and the injustices committed against those
*  speaking out the more people are going to be determined to take a stand and that is why we
*  are approaching an end game which will not I'm afraid be a particularly pleasant experience
*  for those who thought they could simply get away with using their platforms to support or stay
*  silent about a genocide. Please like and subscribe do leave your comments do share the video and
