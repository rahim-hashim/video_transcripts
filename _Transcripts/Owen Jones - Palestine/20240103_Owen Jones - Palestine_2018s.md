# How Israel Could Be Stopped By South Africa - Its Overwhelming Genocide Case Explained
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtXY_sQurcs)
*  This is one of the most important and terrifying documents published in our time.
*  It is the case submitted by South Africa in the International Court of Justice
*  and it accuses Israel of genocide.
*  Now what's so chilling about this document is that it reads as though you are somehow reading a great
*  crime from the past as it seems to explain how this monumental horror was made possible
*  to a public which is astounded that such an atrocity could ever have been tolerated at the time.
*  But this is happening now, right now, as I speak and as you listen.
*  Now this is an extremely important point to make.
*  In genocides in the past there is often a historical debate later on about how much people
*  knew at the time and therefore how complicit they were and whether this mass slaughter could
*  have been stopped sooner. It's therefore our responsibility to make sure everyone does know
*  about the mass extermination of Palestinians currently taking place in Gaza so there are no
*  excuses, no places to hide and so pressure can be brought on our governments to end their complicity.
*  That's because western governments continue to back and arm Israel making them directly complicit
*  and partly responsible for one of the great crimes of our age and the western media has largely sought
*  to hide the reality of this horror from the public. You either have media outlets which act
*  as avert cheerleaders for the Israeli military or other outlets which frame this ongoing crime as
*  Israel seeking to eliminate Hamas with a side debate or whether its so-called response is
*  proportionate where we can all agree to disagree that it's a subjective opinion one way or the other.
*  But this isn't about proportionality at all. This document squarely accuses Israel of genocide
*  noting both intent and conduct. Now I've read this 84 page document and to be clear
*  South Africa is not messing around here. This is an extremely serious piece of work
*  which hugely able legal experts have clearly spent a massive amount of time and resources on.
*  It is loyally, it is detailed, it is obsessively evidenced. Indeed there are 574 footnotes scattered
*  throughout. Now you may think like myself that you may have been closely following Israel's war crimes
*  since the atrocities committed against Israeli civilians during the attack by Hamas and other
*  armed groups on the 7th of October last year. You will still find this document absolutely shocking
*  if you have humanity. Partly because of the details you wouldn't have been familiar with,
*  partly just because finally everything has been put in one place or rather everything up to the
*  point this document was written. Every day brings new examples both in terms of conduct, that is
*  genocidal acts against the Palestinian people and in terms of intent, that is statements by Israeli
*  politicians, officials, journalists and others endorsing genocidal sentiments. Now the document
*  focuses in its words on acts threatened, doctored, condoned, taken and being taken by the government
*  and military of the state of Israel against the Palestinian people. A distinct national, racial
*  and ethnical group in the wake of the attacks in Israel on 7th of October 2023. It makes clear
*  South Africa's own condemnation of war crimes committed by Hamas and other Palestinian armed
*  groups that day. A critical point it makes is this, no armed group, no armed attack on a state's
*  territory, no matter how serious even an attack involving atrocity crimes can however provide any
*  possible justification for or defense to breaches of the 1948 convention on the prevention and
*  punishment of the crime of genocide. This couldn't be more important to state even if for example we
*  were to start the clock on October 7th and erase decades of mass ethnic cleansing by Israel,
*  occupation, land theft, illegal colonization, apartheid, the mass slaughter of innocent
*  Syrians, Palestinians including 240 alone this year in the West Bank before October 7th. Even if
*  we were to erase that context, which we must not do, there is never any justification for the crime
*  of genocide as the document puts it whether as a matter of law or morality. It further notes
*  the acts and omissions by Israel complained of by South Africa are genocidal in character because
*  they're intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national,
*  racial and ethnical group that being the part of the Palestinian group in the Gaza Strip,
*  that is the Palestinians of Gaza as they're referred to throughout. It makes clear Israel
*  is violating the genocide convention by failing to prevent genocide and committing genocide and
*  that includes failing to prevent or punish the direct and public incitement to genocide by senior
*  Israeli officials and others. This is the case the document seeks to prove. It also understands
*  genocide as a continuum which is how Raphael Lemkin, the Polish-Jewish lawyer who coined the
*  word genocide in 1944, wanted us to understand it. That means placing the current horror in a
*  broader context of a 75-year-long apartheid, a 56-year-long belligerent occupation of Palestinian
*  land and a 16-year-old blockade of Gaza, bearing in mind that Gaza before this was legally understood
*  to be under Israeli occupation because of Israel's total control over land, air, sea, of what got in
*  and what got out and all the crimes associated with all of those things. Now it notes numerous
*  warnings by UN officials and others for world leaders to take responsibility to prevent genocide
*  and that therefore South Africa and other signatories of the genocide convention have a
*  responsibility to act. Now genocidal intent comes from statements by Israeli state representatives
*  including those at the very top, the Israeli president, the prime minister, the ministry of
*  defense and others. Intent is also referred from the nature and conduct of Israel's military
*  operation in Gaza as it puts it, from its murderous armed assault on Gaza to depriving the population
*  of the necessities of life and humanitarian assistance including failure to provide or
*  ensure essential food, water, medicine, shelter and other humanitarian assistance to the destruction
*  of the health care system. It notes how before this horror began, Gaza was already left vulnerable
*  by Israel to humanitarian catastrophe because of the siege, describing it as the indefinite
*  warehousing of an unwanted population of two million Palestinians leading to de-development
*  and de-industrialization with a 40% unemployment rate, a 60% poverty rate and 80% dependent on some
*  form of international assistance with the coastal aquifer, the sole source of natural drinking water,
*  polluted and unfit for human consumption because of contamination by seawater and sewage and a
*  health care system that was already on its knees. It also notes numerous examples of the
*  mass killing of Palestinians in previous onslaughts including the mass killing and maiming of peaceful
*  protesters. Now in the here and now, the document discusses the key facts about Israel's military
*  campaign against Gaza by land, air and sea that by 29th of October alone, that's many weeks ago,
*  6,000 bombs per week had been dropped on a narrow strip of land approximately 365 square kilometers
*  big, one of the most densely populated place on earth, home to 2.3 million, nearly half of whom
*  are children, making it one of the heaviest conventional bombing campaigns in the history
*  of modern warfare. In just over two months, the attacks have caused more destruction than the
*  raising of Syria's Aleppo between 2012 and 2016 in much longer time frame, Ukraine's Maripol or
*  proportionately the allied bombing of Germany in World War II again over a much longer time frame.
*  The destruction had left Gaza with a different color and texture when looked at from space. It
*  notes the huge death toll which according to the NGO Euromed Human Rights Monitor, including those
*  buried under the rubble who aren't included in the official death toll, that means now more than
*  30,000 Palestinians have been killed, mostly women and children. Now Paragas 43 to 100 of
*  this document concern genocidal acts committed against the Palestinian people in Gaza.
*  It notes the challenges in establishing the facts on the ground because of Israel's imposed
*  telecommunications blackouts for example, the restriction of access by fact-finding bodies and
*  international media and the mass slaughter of Palestinian journalists who've been killed at a
*  rate significantly higher than in any conflict in the last 100 years with an average of one
*  journalist dying every day representing more than 73% of the total number of journalists and media
*  workers killed globally in 2023, bearing in mind that this horror began only in the last quarter
*  of that year. Nowhere is safe, Palestinians are killed, it notes, in homes, places they sought
*  shelter, in hospitals, in UN schools, in churches, in mosques as they seek food and water for their
*  families. They are killed if they fail to evacuate and in the places that they fled they are killed
*  too and while fleeing along what Israel declared as safe routes. There are growing reports of
*  Israeli soldiers summarily executing Palestinians including multiple members of the same family.
*  In one cited case in Gaza City at least 11 male members of the Annan family and their relatives,
*  boys and men were reportedly shot dead in front of their families before the women and children
*  were then attacked. There's also reports of unarmed people including Israeli hostages of course being
*  shot dead on site despite posing no threat including when they were waving white flags.
*  So-called dumb unguided bombs are reportedly dropped by Israel on Gaza in huge numbers as well
*  as heavy bombs weighing up to 2 000 pounds with a predicted lethal radius of up to 360 meters
*  but able to cause severe injury and damage up to 800 meters away from the point of impact.
*  Around one in every 100 Gazans are now believed to have been killed because of violent deaths
*  and nearly 1800 Palestinian families are estimated to have lost multiple, multiple family members.
*  Hundreds of multi-generational families have been killed in their entire bloodlines
*  wiped off the face of the earth with no remaining survivors at all.
*  Mothers, fathers, children, siblings, grandparents, aunts, cousins, all gone, entire families often
*  killed together. In the first month of this horror 312 families had lost over 10 members each. The
*  level of mortality is such that medics in Gaza have coined a new acronym WCNSF wounded child,
*  no surviving family. Over 115 Palestinian children are killed every day as well as doctors,
*  journalists, teachers, academics and other professionals being killed at wholly unprecedented
*  rates. Indeed it's estimated over 311 doctors, nurses and other health workers including doctors
*  and ambulance workers on duty have been killed. 40 civil defense workers those are those who dig
*  victims out of the rubble and then are killed themselves killed on duty. Over 209 teachers
*  and educational staff also killed. 144 UN employees have been killed the highest number of aid workers
*  in UN history in such a short time. As well as violent deaths caused by Israeli military,
*  Israeli weapons, Palestinians are at immediate risk of death by starvation, by dehydration and disease
*  as well as the ongoing siege, the insufficient aid allowed in and the extreme difficulties in
*  distributing that limited aid given the destruction of Gaza's infrastructure. Over 55,000 Palestinians
*  have been wounded mostly women and mostly children and that often means burns and amputations
*  with an estimated 1,000 children losing one or both legs. With only 13 out of 36 hospitals partly
*  functional and no fully functioning hospital left in north Gaza the healthcare system has all but
*  collapsed and injured people are reduced to waiting to die often dying slow and agonizing deaths.
*  Even before this onslaught Palestinians suffered severe trauma from prior attacks with 80% of
*  Palestinian children suffering high levels of emotional distress, 79% demonstrating bedwetting,
*  59% showing reactive mutism, 59% engaged in self-harm and 55% with suicidal thoughts.
*  The current horror will only have made that so much worse not least for the tens of thousands of
*  Palestinian children who've lost at least one parent. For me this following sentence
*  chilled me to the bone the report says this for the families who remain intact or partially intact
*  it's about doing everything you can so your child doesn't realise that you've lost control.
*  There's something particularly devastating I feel about reading that sentence.
*  Palestinians according to this report based on its evidenced readings of what's happening
*  Palestinians are subjected to cruel and human and degrading treatment with large numbers of
*  civilians including children reportedly arrested blindfolded forced to undress and remain outside
*  in cold water before being forced onto trucks and taken to unknown locations. 85% of the population
*  of the population it states have been expelled from their homes that is 1.9 million out of 2.3
*  million with nowhere safe to flee to. Repeated evacuation orders combined with the total siege
*  described by the Red Cross as incompatible with international humanitarian law. The World Health
*  Organization warning it could be tantamount to a death sentence for hospital patients and often
*  Palestinian children are ordered into areas where the ongoing airstrikes creating terror people flee
*  to areas supposedly that are safe which are then bombed. Growing population density as they are
*  forced into a ever shrinking corner of Gaza render these Israeli strikes ever more lethal.
*  The forced evacuation it notes is necessarily permanent for many Palestinians because 60% of
*  the entire housing stock in Gaza has been destroyed with the extent of the destruction in the north
*  in particular rendering it largely uninhabitable with destruction in the south approaching a similar
*  level. It says the forced displacements in Gaza are genocidal and that they are taking place
*  in circumstances calculated to bring about the physical destruction of Palestinians in Gaza.
*  Israel has now pushed the Palestinian population in Gaza to the brink of famine it quotes experts.
*  Most of the Palestinian people in Gaza are now starving where levels of starvation rising daily.
*  As the UN Secretary General notes four out of five of the hungriest people anywhere on earth
*  are in Gaza. The World Health Organization states an unprecedented 93% of the population is facing
*  crisis levels of hunger. Water is also severely depleted. Israel continues to cut off piped
*  water for the north of Gaza it says and the North Water Desalination Plan is non-functioning.
*  The World Food Program has reported there's only 1.5 to 1.8 litres of clean water available per
*  person but per day for all uses drinking, washing, food preparation, sanitation and hygiene. That is
*  far below the emergency threshold of 15 litres per day for war or famine like conditions. The lack
*  of water is severely impacting lactating women. Bear in mind the survival threshold is deemed to
*  be three litres a day. Those lactating women who need far more water to keep themselves and their
*  babies healthy. Young women forced to use contaminated water to prepare formula if it's available
*  risking disease in vulnerable babies. The context to all of that already is Israel has long hindered
*  creating or repairing these water installation desalination plants and 95% of water from the
*  sole aquifer was already unsuitable for consumption before the 7th of October.
*  The document warns that experts are now predicting that more Palestinians in Gaza may die from
*  starvation and disease than airstrikes. There's acute shortages of warm clothes, bedding, blankets,
*  soaring rates of infectious disease outbreaks, diarrhoea cases among children under five
*  are 25 times higher than before the conflict. Over 100,000 cases of diarrhoea in total reported
*  since mid-October. Sewage flows through the streets. The document notes that almost above
*  all else the assault on Gaza has been an attack on the medical healthcare system which is it says
*  indispensable to the life and survival of the Palestinians of Gaza. By the 7th of October the
*  relevant UN special rapporteur declared the healthcare infrastructure in the Gaza Strip
*  has been completely obliterated. Children's limbs, amputated and cesarean sections are happening
*  without anaesthesia or sterilised surgical tools. We did what we could, remember us. These are the
*  words of Dr Mahmoud Abu Nujileh who has since been killed in a hospital strike. He wrote those words
*  on a hospital whiteboard normally used for planning surgeries. Since early December last year Israeli
*  army attacks on hospitals have only increased depriving them of electricity and fuel crucial
*  to maintain their effective function obstructing them from getting medical supplies, food, water.
*  Hospitals are described by UN agencies as death zones scenes of bloodbath, death, devastation and
*  despair. Some of Gaza's most experienced and skilled doctors have been killed such as Dr Hamam
*  Aalon, a kidney specialist at Al-Shifa hospital who said before he was killed in an Israeli strike on
*  his home if I go he would treat my patients we're not animals we have the right to receive proper
*  healthcare. You think I went to medical school and for my postgraduate degrees for a total of 14
*  years so I think only about my own life and not about my patients. The document also notes that
*  the mass destruction of hospitals and the slaughter of doctors undermines any prospect of a future
*  Palestinian healthcare system in Gaza. Hundreds of Palestinians have now been killed in violent
*  attacks on those hospitals and healthcare centres. Others have died because of the cutting off of
*  electricity and fuel including premature babies including dozens of ICU and kidney patients.
*  Severely injured patients walk for miles desperately trying to find help. They cite the
*  case of a boy from the north his leg had been blown off in the violence. He spent three or
*  four days trying to reach the south delayed by checkpoints. Reportedly the smell of decomposition
*  was clear and that boy had shrapnel all over potentially he was blind and had burns to 50%
*  of his body. Experts are beginning to warn that the numbers dying of disease and hunger could
*  already be outstripping violent deaths caused by Israeli army assaults. Some estimate that the
*  death toll from disease and hunger could be multiples of that from fighting and from airstrikes.
*  In terms of the destruction of Palestinian life in Gaza not only have entire streets and
*  neighborhoods been razed. One suburb of Gaza city what's home to 110,000 Palestinians is now a vast
*  wasteland flattened as far as the eye can see. That means the destruction of all its shops, schools,
*  vibrant marketplace, family homes, doctors clinics, historic streets and its mosque.
*  Specifically this document charges Israel with destroying the infrastructure and foundations of
*  Palestinian life deliberately creating conditions of life calculated to bring about the physical
*  destruction of the Palestinian people from homes, neighborhoods, hospitals, water systems, agricultural
*  lands, bakeries, mills to the foundational civil system in Gaza like all courts, the central archive
*  building with thousands of historical documents and national records going back over 100 years.
*  The main public libraries and ruins along with bookshops publishing houses and other libraries
*  and educational facilities all of Gaza's four universities have been targeted. Leading Palestinian
*  academics have been wiped out award-winning physicists, software engineers, immunology and
*  virology academics, poets, cultural centers, museums, places of learning destroyed ancient
*  history sites destroyed Gaza's old city destroyed 318 Muslim and Christian religious sites damaged
*  or destroyed so as well as its people the civic and cultural life and indeed history of Gaza is
*  being erased too. The document examines measures intended to prevent Palestinian births noting 70%
*  of those killed are women and children and two mothers being killed estimated every hour in Gaza.
*  Pregnant women and children including newborn babies most impacted by this catastrophe an
*  estimated five and a half thousand of the total 52,000 estimated pregnant women in Gaza are giving
*  birth each month in unsafe conditions. Prematural births have surged serious conditions threatening
*  the lives of pregnant women and their children have surged the number of Palestinian babies dying
*  avoidable deaths has surged. Most of the rest of the document concerns genocidal intent against
*  the Palestinian people. As the document says evidence of Israeli state officials specific
*  intent to commit and persist in committing genocide lacks or to fail to prevent them has
*  been significant and overt since October 2023. Let's begin with Benjamin Netanyahu of course
*  the Prime Minister. There are many examples given but for example 16th of October 2023 in a formal
*  address to the Israeli Knesset he describes the situation as a struggle between the children of
*  light and the children of darkness between humanity and the law of the jungle that's a theme
*  he has continually returned to. On the 28th of October 2023 as Israeli forces prepared their
*  land invasion of Gaza the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu invoked the biblical story of the total
*  destruction of Amalek by the Israelites stating you must remember what Amalek has done to you
*  says our holy bible and we do remember he referred again to Amalek in a specific letter to
*  soldiers and army officers the passage in the bible reads as follows now go attack Amalek and
*  prescribe all that belongs to him spare no one but kill alike men and women infants and sucklings
*  oxen and sheep camels and asses. President Isaac Herzog of Israel made it clear that Israel did not
*  distinguish between militants and civilians declaring to foreign media in relation to
*  Palestinian civilians in Gaza over one million remember our children it's an entire nation out
*  there that's responsible it's not true this rhetoric about civilians not aware not involved
*  it's absolutely not true and we will fight until we break their backbone the defense minister Jove
*  Gallant declared on 9th of October that Israel was imposing a complete siege in Gaza no electricity
*  no food no water no fuel everything is closed we are fighting human animals and we are acting
*  accordingly he told troops on the Gaza border that he had released all the restraints Gaza won't
*  return to what it was before he said we will eliminate everything he further added that he'd
*  removed every restriction on Israeli forces Israeli minister for national security Itamar Ben-Ghivir
*  declared to be clear when we say that Hamas should be destroyed it also means those who celebrate
*  those who support and those who hand out candy they're all terrorists and they should also be
*  destroyed on the 13th of October the Israeli minister of energy and infrastructure declared
*  all the civilian population in Gaza is ordered to leave immediately we will win they will not
*  receive a drop of water or a single battery until they leave the world on 8th of October the Israeli
*  minister of finance Rezalel Smotrich declared in a meeting of the Israeli cabinet that we need to
*  seal a deal a blow that hasn't been seen in 50 years and take down Gaza on the 1st of November
*  the Israeli minister of heritage Amichel Elihu posted the north of the Gaza Strip more beautiful
*  than ever everything is blown up and flattened simply a pleasure for the eyes and argued against
*  humanitarian aid arguing we wouldn't hand the Nazis humanitarian aid there was no such thing
*  they added as uninvolved civilians in Gaza he also posited a nuclear attack on the Gaza Strip
*  on the 11th of November 2023 the Israeli minister of agriculture Abed Dicta recalled the Nakba of
*  1948 in which hundreds of thousands of Palestinians over 80 percent of the Palestinian population of
*  the new Israeli state at the time was forced from or fled their homes stating we are now actually
*  rolling out the Gaza Nakba on the 7th of October the deputy speaker of the Knesset
*  or parliament Nissen Vattery tweeted now we all have one common goal erasing the Gaza Strip from
*  the face of the earth those who are unable will be replaced then there's the Israeli army officials
*  like one major general who declared Hamas became Isis and the citizens of Gaza are celebrating
*  instead of being horrified human animals are dealt with accordingly Israel has imposed a total
*  blockade on Gaza no electricity no water just damage you wanted hell you'll get hell then there's
*  Gura Ireland the former head of the Israeli National Security Council who has made multiple
*  genocidal statements demanding the cutting off of energy water and fuel declaring the people should
*  be told that they have two choices to stay and starve or to leave if Egypt and the other countries
*  prefer these people will perish in Gaza this is their choice repeatedly declaring the benefits of
*  a humanitarian crisis he declared Israel has no interest in the Gaza Strip being rehabilitated and
*  this is an important point that needs to be made clear to the Americans he added Israel has no
*  choice to make Gaza a place that is temporarily or permanently impossible to live in but to make he
*  also declared Israel needs to create a humanitarian crisis in Gaza compelling tens of thousands or
*  even hundreds of thousands to seek refuge in Egypt or the gulf Gaza will become a place where no human
*  being can exist he makes clear there were no poor women in Gaza by which he means innocent women he
*  says they are all the mothers sisters or wives of Hamas murderers he goes on to argue in favour of
*  humanitarian disaster and severe epidemics in Gaza on the grounds that they would bring victory
*  closer or take the 95 year old army reservist Ezra Yakin a veteran of the day Yassin massacre
*  against innocent Palestinians during the 1948 Nakba he gave this so-called motivational speech
*  for soldiers declaring be triumphant and finish them off don't leave anyone behind
*  erase the memory of them erase them their families mothers and children these animals can no longer
*  live every G with a weapon should go and kill them if you have an Arab neighbor don't wait go to his
*  home and shoot him a key point here is that these statements whether they be by decision makers
*  military officials and so on indicate a clear and direct public incitement to genocide that has
*  gone unchecked and unpunished the clue conclusion the document then reaches from all of that is the
*  clear inference from the acts of the Israeli army on the ground including for the vast numbers of
*  civilians killed and injured and the scale of displacement destruction and devastation brought
*  in Gaza is that those genocidal statements and directives are being implemented against the
*  Palestinian people it backs up that conclusion with statements made on the ground like an Israeli
*  army colonel and deputy head of the unit dedicated to the occupied areas who appeared in an area of
*  Gaza particularly hit by destruction and he told Israeli television whoever returns here if they
*  return here after will find scorched earth no houses no agriculture no nothing they have no
*  future Israeli soldiers in uniform have been filmed dancing chanting and singing made their village
*  burn may Gaza be erased in another example they appeared dancing singing and laughing we know our
*  motto they said there are no uninvolved civilians and to wipe out what they called the seed of
*  amalek the document then lists statements by various members of the Israeli kinetic that is
*  parliament calling for Gaza variously to be wiped out flattened erased crushed on all its inhabitants
*  parliamentarians have deplored anyone feeling sorry for those in Gaza specifically asserting
*  there are no uninvolved or innocents in Gaza that the children of Gaza have brushed this on themselves
*  that there should be one sentence for everyone there death then there's the media which
*  can continually broadcast genocidal messages without sensual sanction that includes media reports
*  calling for Gaza to be erased turned into a slaughterhouse that Hamas should not be
*  eliminated but rather Gaza should be raised the repeated claim there are no innocence
*  there are 2.5 million terrorists one local official reportedly calls for Gaza to be desolate and
*  destroyed unlike the Auschwitz museum existing to demonstrate the madness of the people who live
*  there what's even more disturbing is that this list is already at a date every day seems to bring
*  ever-escalating examples of genocidal intent today alone a Likud parliamentarian Moshada declared
*  that everybody knows the right wing was right Gazan should be exterminated he said that on channel 14
*  a commercial television station another Likud parliamentarian Tali Gottlieb called for deliberate
*  starvation to be used as a weapon of war adding without hunger and thirst among the Gazan population
*  we will not be able to recruit collaborators we will not be able to recruit intelligence we will
*  not be able to bribe people with food drink medicine now in case you think she's just an extreme
*  outlier although having listened to all this I doubt you do what Israeli newspaper reports that
*  the IDF is demanding the already meager humanitarian aid entering Gaza should be reduced even as the
*  Israeli newspaper harret said yesterday that a severe famine is spreading in Gaza what we are
*  seeing in real time being played out before our eyes if we choose to see is the dynamic of genocide
*  it's not simply a case that the atrocities of 7th of October triggered a gruesome but
*  understandable wave of fury and vengeance which then subsides with time the opposite is happening
*  in climate science there is an apocalyptic scenario of unstoppable climate change it's
*  called hot house earth in which feedback loops trigger ever-escalating temperature increases
*  which spiral out of control well Israeli society has become a genocidal hot house
*  it is radicalizing it's trapped in a positive feedback loop of genocidal feeling all these
*  statements of intent are further whipping up Israeli society and the Israeli elite
*  they're normalizing genocidal sentiment giving others the courage to speak out and speak in
*  similar ways as such Israeli society is in the grip of genocidal mania this risks developing
*  an unstoppable momentum when even if an Israeli government for whatever reason
*  decided to take its foot off the pedal and scale back on genocidal activity an enraged Israeli
*  public would overthrow it and install a new government recommitting to genocidal action
*  now there are incredibly courageous Israeli peace activists and hope for the future must
*  rest with them as for now they're incredibly isolated one poll finds 57.6% of Israeli Jews
*  think not enough firepower is being used in Gaza what would more firepower even mean in practice
*  it would simply mean mass extermination so this is why South Africa's case is so important
*  a ruling by the court could take years but we don't have years so South Africa's asked for
*  something else as well for the court to order in the meantime for Israel to cease its operations
*  in Gaza desist from the forced displacement of Palestinians and allow Gazans to get access to
*  humanitarian aid that would mean foreign states who you then facilitate Israel's current action
*  would find themselves criminally liable we need external action and we need it desperately
*  I've said this many times during this horror but I'll say it again you may have looked at great
*  horrors and atrocities in the past when a clear evil was being committed when a mass water of
*  civilians was being unleashed and you may have asked yourself how was it possible how did many
*  people so many people who weren't sociopathic because the vast majority in any society are not
*  sociopaths become overwhelmed with bloodlust become complicit in mass murder often emotionally
*  invested in killing vast numbers of their fellow human beings well now you know now you know
*  time is running out in my next video I'll unpack this document with the esteemed lawyer
*  Daniel Machova but in the meantime we have to spread awareness make sure that the gravity of
*  this crime is understood so please share this video I will include a link to South Africa's
*  document in the title and we should commend South Africa of course a previous victim of the grave
*  crime of apartheid for what it's doing to stop this current horror as ever please like subscribe
*  you can keep the show the road and patreon.com full slash i'm jose four and we will speak shortly
