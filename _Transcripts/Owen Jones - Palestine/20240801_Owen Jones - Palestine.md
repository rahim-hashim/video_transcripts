# Israeli Analyst Assassination Of Hamas Leader Sign Of Israel's Weakness w. Ori Goldberg
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [August 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP8fKWyHPfU)
*  Now it's been a long week, although it's been a long week, week after week in the horror which
*  has unfolded, of course, since the 7th of October. What we know this week is there has been the
*  assassination of Ismael Hanyou. Now that's obviously the Israeli state, Mossad will have
*  done that, though they never claim responsibility. He was assassinated in Tehran. Israel has also
*  said that Mohammed Dave, who was killed in a strike, which killed huge numbers of Palestinian
*  civilians last month, that he was killed. We have an escalation ongoing, of course,
*  with Hezbollah, Lebanon, and we've had riots in Israel in support of the right to torture and
*  frankly rape Palestinian detainees. There's quite a lot that's happened and we've got a brilliant
*  guest to talk about this with. We spoke earlier this year with the Israeli analyst, Ori Goldberg.
*  You all loved what he had to say. You were all very educated, as was I. So I thought it made
*  sense to go and talk to Ori, not least because his specialism includes not just what's going on
*  with Israel and Gaza, but the broader Middle East. So Ori, great to speak to you again. How are you doing?
*  As well as might be expected, Owen, that's a loaded question to ask somebody in the Middle East at the
*  moment. Yeah, of course. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for having me. It's always a pleasure,
*  always an honor. Yes, as well as can be expected, I suppose probably is a better way of asking.
*  Let's just start with the assassination of Ismael Haniyeh, who is, of course, the political leader
*  of Hamas. This was in the context of negotiations over a hostage deal, potentially, as well as
*  a negotiations between the main Palestinian factions, obviously Fatah Hamas over unity
*  broken by China. Extremely embarrassing, I would say, for the Iranian states,
*  assassinated by a remote controlled bomb in Tehran whilst he was visiting after the
*  newly elected Iranian president. So I just wondered, what's your thoughts on what the hell,
*  what's your thoughts basically what happened with this assassination?
*  Well, the principle you need to understand when it comes to assessing an assassination like this is
*  dissociation. That is Israel's probably premier superpower. We are not capable of or we're not
*  interested in addressing reality as a whole at the moment, because reality as a whole is just a bit
*  too complex. And it entails our claiming responsibility for the consequences of our actions. So what we do
*  is we break reality up into smaller parts. And that means that Ismael Haniyeh, despite everything
*  that you said, which is obviously correct, he was our partner in negotiations over the fate of the
*  hostages. It seemed like there was a deal coming. The Palestinian factions under the offices of China
*  seem to be making progress towards at least a semblance of unity. So obviously, we needed Ismael
*  Haniyeh in place if we wanted all of these things to come to any kind of fruition. But Ismael Haniyeh
*  is also a target. And he was declared a target long before I think the war in Gaza began, long
*  before Israel's genocidal campaign began. But he was most certainly a target at this stage of the
*  campaign because Israel has no more achievements, quote unquote achievements it can claim, as a ways
*  of actually admitting that genocide is at an end. Israel needs a victory image. And Israel has no
*  victory image other than the dead bodies of Hamas leaders. So getting them, eliminating them, as we
*  say here, performing targeted killings, all euphemisms for assassination, is the order of
*  today as far as the operational considerations are concerned. Okay, so we need Haniyeh as a political
*  partner for political processes, but he's also a target. And our operational concerns are paramount
*  because this is how Israel supposedly promises security to its people. So we don't care. Once
*  Haniyeh is acquired as a target, once he can be assassinated, then the whole bit about how we need
*  him politically becomes immediately irrelevant and we assassinate him, which was how and why this
*  happened. The fact that it happened right on the heels of the assassination of Hezbollah's military
*  chief, Vlad Shukr, in Beirut after Israel had been given warnings not to strike in Beirut.
*  This was of no importance. We promised we would destroy Hamas and we would get all the leaders
*  who had been responsible. It doesn't matter that Haniyeh was apparently not responsible for October
*  7th because that was hatched by Hamas leadership inside Gaza and Haniyeh had been outside Gaza for
*  years. He was a target. We could get him. This was a legitimate check sign in the win column.
*  So we assassinated Haniyeh in Tehran. I think, again, the most important lesson we can learn from
*  this is really how inherently broken, fragmented Israel's perception of reality is at the moment.
*  We don't do strategy. It's all tactics in every arena.
*  It's because a lot of people look at it and think, well, that's an attempt to just stop any
*  ceasefire deal. Because I know you said actually during the Vietnam War, there was that, I can't
*  remember who said it, that the Americans should just declare victory and go home. And that was
*  the way you should just extricate yourself from something you're not going to win. But in this
*  case, I mean, by killing, someone said it was a bit like negotiating the Good Friday Agreement
*  and then killing one of the Sinn Fein leaders, like Martin McGuinness at the time, for example.
*  You don't do that if you want an actual deal. So what do you think? This is an attempt to just
*  say for PR reasons, particularly for the US, for US public opinion, we want a ceasefire deal,
*  but then you do everything you can to stop it. I mean, is that not what's going on? Or is it just
*  you think actually the declare victory kind of? Yeah, well, I'll see you and raise you. I think
*  that there is interest in a ceasefire deal. But I think that Tanja believes that the only way he
*  can achieve a ceasefire deal is by declaring victory. And the only way he can declare victory
*  is by presenting the Israeli public with the dead bodies of Hamas leaders. I actually think,
*  I have every reason to assume that we were as close to a deal as we have been throughout the
*  duration of this campaign. Obviously, Netanyahu is not particularly interested in a deal, but
*  seemed like Netanyahu was aware of the fact that Israel was vastly overextended militarily,
*  and that Gaza offered him no achievements whatsoever, that the next stage would be simply
*  to begin a long term occupation of Gaza, which is not something he wanted to do.
*  I mean, Israel has been trawling for Hamas leaders for quite a while now. The assassination of
*  Muhammad death that killed more than 90 Palestinians and was described by Israeli authorities as a
*  precise operation is a good example. Assassinating Haneeah seems to me like an important part of
*  this claim for victory, which was in turn supposed to ground, I guess, an Israeli agreement to a
*  ceasefire. I don't think this is just obstructionism. I think this is complicated, but very, very blatant
*  politics. That makes sense. Very interesting stuff there. I mean, in terms of what's going on more
*  broadly, Lebanon, obviously we saw that strike, as you mentioned, Lebanon, and the kind of standoff
*  that's been going on basically between Hezbollah and Israel. Of course, Hezbollah is not a Hamas.
*  They've actually, I mean, they've got huge amounts of rockets. There's been this kind of taunting,
*  sending in drones without being detected to kind of go look where we can go past the Iron Dome,
*  that kind of thing. And also we saw that strike which killed 12 Druze kids, which is obviously
*  hideous. What's your thoughts and what's going on there in terms of the Israeli strategy?
*  Because a lot of people think that the argument seems to be, look, Hezbollah, within Lebanese
*  society, there was an appetite for war. And obviously Hezbollah has to be cognizant of that.
*  And within Israeli society, well, Hezbollah is a highly different kind of fish. They can actually
*  do huge damage. So actually, from the Israeli state's perspective, it's not actually an easy
*  fight. So what do you think? Is it just kind of this is going to carry on this
*  brinkmanship for a long time? Or do you think it could actually just detonate?
*  We need to start with the political conundrum, which was the fate of more than 100,000 Israeli
*  citizens that were rapidly evacuated from the north part of Israel after October 7th on the
*  false pretext that Hezbollah was planning a similar invasion and massacre. And the real problem that
*  Israel has been contending with is how to get them to return to the north. And essentially, while
*  an orderly diplomatic solution was on the table as an option, both Israeli authorities and the
*  citizens of the north sort of understood that nothing would be achieved unless there was an
*  actual war, in which Israel could assure that Hezbollah retreats from the international border
*  five kilometers to the north beyond the Litani River. So that's the political conundrum. That's
*  where it starts. And that is what drives Israeli strategy with regard to Hezbollah.
*  Hezbollah has been adamant in its refusal to stop the tit for tat it has been conducting with Israel
*  for 10 months now until the war in Gaza stops. I have to assume that, again, Israel's behavior
*  following the Matsh del Shams attack, which I assume is connected to Hezbollah, but I assume it
*  was carried out in error. I don't think Hezbollah meant to kill 12 Druze children. The Matsh del
*  Shams football pitch was a staging area for the Israeli military as well. I think somebody made a
*  mistake there. But Israel felt it needed to retaliate, and it retaliated the only way it
*  knows how, and that is by assassinating senior personnel. That is Israel's MO. It has been its
*  MO throughout this exchange of, this lethal exchange of fire with Hezbollah over the last nine months.
*  And Israel assassinated the most senior Hezbollah leader it has so far. What is Israel's strategy?
*  Israel doesn't really have a strategy. Israel wants to impress Hezbollah into stopping its fire.
*  It doesn't want to start a war. It said so very overtly. The IDF spokesman,
*  Rear Admiral Hagavi, said this very directly. Israel doesn't want a war. Hezbollah has said
*  it doesn't want a war. But this assassination was, again, Israel being habitual, doing the only thing
*  it knows how to do. And this time it apparently went too far, not just because of the seniority
*  of the assassinated leader, but because of the proximity to the assassination of Haneeyah,
*  and lest we forget to the bombing of the Yemeni port of Fadda in retaliation for
*  the Houthi drone reaching Tel Aviv, exploding and killing a single Israeli.
*  Again, remember the principle, dissociation. That's what we do. We're not capable and we're
*  not interested in seeing reality as a whole. We break it up into small pieces. We attempt to
*  douse each specific tactical fire. And what we did is what we had always warned ourselves against,
*  which was unite all the fronts against us. What concerned us most on October 7 was that this
*  would be a multi-front war. And acting separately, leafily, in each front, we made sure that these
*  fronts would converge and understand there's an axis of resistance summited to Iran. And Nasrallah
*  as speaking, as we're speaking, I suspect that there will be a coordinated response from the
*  Uranians, Houthis and Lebanese. I mean, what do you think at the moment? What do you think the risks are
*  of an all out, I guess, conflagration? And do you think everything's a bit on hold maybe because of
*  the US presidential elections and there's a bit of a holding pattern? What do you think?
*  I still think there won't be an all out conflagration. And the reason I think that is
*  because all of Israel's rivals at the moment have a lot to gain from not going all out, not initiating
*  war and not even initiating a retaliation that would be powerful enough for Israel to consider
*  as a casus belli, as a reason to begin a war. Iran and Hezbollah and the Houthis,
*  they all understand that Israel is one of its weakest moments. And I think that's the only
*  sound way to analyze Israeli behavior. Israel is dangerous and Israel is desperate because it's
*  weak, because it failed abjectly in Gaza, because the hostages have not yet been returned, because
*  Hezbollah seems capable of countermanding every Israeli move vis-a-vis Lebanon. And also because
*  Israeli society domestically is, I don't know if I can say it's disintegrating, but the state of
*  its resilience and solidarity and commitment is as low as it has ever been. And we can talk about that.
*  But all of these reasons together make Israel extremely weak. And the calculus of power
*  in the Middle East when it comes to Israel is that Israel's enemies are strong, the weaker Israel is.
*  So right now, Iran, the Houthis and Hezbollah, I would even go as far as saying, and I'm sure
*  people in Washington or in London would disagree with me, but they're enjoying a kind of a moral
*  advantage at the moment, which is of course ridiculous because Israel's been conducting a
*  genocide for 10 months. But operationally, strategically, now all the people who are
*  scholars of war might even agree that Hezbollah, Iran and the Houthis have the advantage. And they
*  will have the advantage as long as they manage to keep things under control. Israel is seen more and
*  more, I think, as mad, bad and dangerous now. Nobody wants to do business with us.
*  Even the Starmor government is going to stop shipping arms to Israel.
*  So, well, one hopes, but let's talk about, you know, if even Keir Starmor is taken aback
*  by Israeli behavior, it says a lot about Israeli behavior. And I don't think anybody's going to
*  come out and say, we're going to join the Iranians and Hezbollah and the Houthis. These are still
*  considered to be, you know, enemies of the West. But in terms of the potential liability,
*  I think Israel is beginning more and more to be seen as a serious liability.
*  So I think what now is being done in Washington, and I would assume that in London and Paris and
*  Berlin as well, I think there are attempts to tell the Iranians to calm it down, right, to respond,
*  but to respond in a measured way. And again, we've been here already. This is April 14th,
*  was it? All over again. The Iranians were considered by the world within their rights to
*  respond in an attack against Israel. I think they're considered within their rights to respond with
*  an attack now as well. I think we'll see a strike. I think it will be a measured strike. And I think
*  the message the Iranians, the Houthis and Hezbollah will want to send to the world is,
*  you know, we are the grownups in the room at the moment, not Israel.
*  It's interesting, earlier this year, just because what you're talking about there, the
*  author Vincent Bevin's, he tweeted, in the final years of South African apartheid, the
*  white government decided it must warn, overthrow the government on Gola, to install the puppet
*  regime in Namibia, three attacks in Babway, four attack Botswana, five attack in Zambia in order to
*  survive. This did not work. So, I mean, it's interesting looking at just the kind of scale
*  operation Israel's involved in, and that could actually look like strength superficially, but
*  that's not true. And that's kind of partly what you're talking about, I suppose.
*  I think the analogy is very apt. I think it isn't just this government. Israelis would like to think
*  that it's about this government. It isn't just this government. It's the paradigm that has shaped
*  Israeli demeanor and the region is on the verge of complete bankruptcy. It's becoming completely
*  irrelevant. There's a sea change in the making, and I think it is starting now. These are things,
*  again, that very few people can say directly, if any. The EU, I know for a fact, thinks that
*  they've had enough of Israel. I know that in D.C., many, many people are starting to see Israel as,
*  at best, a hindrance and at worst, a serious liability in the region. China, obviously,
*  has taken sides here and is siding with the Palestinians, has a long-standing alliance
*  with the Iranians. So, Israel doesn't really have a major ally anymore, and that is, of course,
*  all Israel is doing. But, yes, Israel is gradually being ostracized. People are backing away from
*  commitments to Israel. Let's not forget, of course, the ICJ advisory opinion, which is huge.
*  I mean, events are so hectic that we seem to forget that opinion or, you know, sort of
*  ignore it. But that opinion was huge. That opinion changed the entire way, the entire
*  positioning of global public space with regard to Israel. Everything Israel had claimed was legal
*  had been deemed officially illegal. You know, there are no more negotiations of the legality
*  of the occupation. The occupation is illegal. Israel's actions are illegal. That changes the
*  entire equilibrium of the system. And, in a way, Israel, I think, is also responding to that,
*  when it does the only thing it knows how to do, and that is use drones and go gradually more and
*  more crazy. But Israel is facing smart regional leaders. The Houthis are smart. The Iranians are
*  smart. And the League, or the new president who expected to be off to a moderate start, has to
*  mollify his hardliners. But perhaps more than anybody, Hassan Nasrallah is smart. Hassan Nasrallah
*  knows Israel very well. And he has borne the brunt of everything Israel can shoot at him,
*  and he has survived to tell the tale. He carries, he's not very popular in Lebanon. Hezbollah is an
*  oppressive religious organization. But as far as his authority goes, as his leadership goes,
*  he has a lot of credit from a lot of people. Let's talk about within Israeli society. We saw these
*  extraordinary scenes of disorder after military police attempted to arrest about 11 Israeli
*  soldiers after a Palestinian detainee had been, I'll just say gang raped, his injury so severe,
*  he had to be hospitalized. Now, there have been reports of, huge numbers of reports of torture
*  and rape, which have even made it into the likes of the New York Times and CNN, in which, again,
*  there had been quite graphic accounts, witness accounts of rape of Palestinian men and also women,
*  as well as just various forms of cruel and inhuman and degrading torture. In fact,
*  the UN Human Rights Office this week published a report that says at least 53 Palestinian detainees
*  are known to have died in Israeli military facilities and prisons since 7th of October.
*  There are huge numbers who have been in detention without charge.
*  Many of them, they're guilty of being Palestinian. I mean, they're eventually, in some cases, released
*  after having been tortured. Doctors have been tortured to death, clearly. The reason I talk
*  about this is earlier this year, we obviously had the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor
*  issue requests for arrest warrants. They detailed war crimes and crimes against humanity's charges
*  against both Hamas and Israeli leaders. Torture was included in the request to charge against
*  Hamas leaders, not Israeli leaders. Now, we saw these riots, basically, Israeli politicians and
*  civilians basically joined an Israeli mutiny amongst the army to try and get them released.
*  And then Israeli soldiers were questioned afterwards in the media. And they said that,
*  actually, the judges and all the rest of it basically said, we'll let you, you know,
*  your heroes and all the rest of it. And the only reason this happened in the first place is an
*  external hospital raised the alarm, the doctors involved. So basically, I'm interested in what
*  the hell happened. What does this say, you know, going on in Israeli society? People on the streets
*  rioting in support of the right to rape. Debates in the Israeli Knesset about whether or not it's
*  justifiable to to to sodomize using instruments, a detainee. I mean, just extraordinary, I have to
*  say to just watch. It's extraordinary to watch. And yeah, that was a long summary, but there's a
*  lot back in. What's your general thoughts on all that? So long. Your summary is, you know,
*  is short, short and succinct when you consider the horror of this whole incident. Look,
*  even though that's how it sounded, I don't know if it's correct to define the debates in the Knesset
*  about whether it's legitimate to rape Palestinians. But that's not because Israel is united in
*  understanding that it's not legitimate. It's the other way around. Despite what seemed like a January
*  6th moment, which was how it was presented by most Israelis who consider themselves
*  on the Zionist left or part of the Israeli center. This thing, this outbreak of riots,
*  this breaking into a fortified military prison and rioting near the military courts and so on.
*  I think this thing actually revealed how broad the consensus within Israeli society actually is.
*  And again, this was portrayed by Israelis as proof of how Israel is torn on the inside,
*  how there's a struggle, we like to call it the struggle between the state of Israel and the
*  state of Judea. That is the state and the territories led by settlers and very Jewish,
*  very religious, very oppressive. But of course, the state of Israel is secular and democratic
*  and startup nation and so on. But that actually wasn't the case because this was all about a
*  single episode. It was so egregious that it could no longer be kept under wraps. And there was a
*  single episode that was so egregious that it could no longer be kept under wraps. And there was also
*  the issue of needing to demonstrate complementarity. That is, Israel wanting to show the
*  ICC that its legal system is capable of investigating suspicions of war crimes independently.
*  So there's a lot of pressure on Israel that included, I think, very graphic threats about
*  arresting Israeli leaders if they were to travel abroad. And apparently this case of this Palestinian
*  detainee came up and that was seen as a way of showing the ICC they were actually doing something
*  about it. We're sending military police to investigate that we will apprehend and punish
*  the ones who did it. But when that happened, the ones who did it, the prison guards, they started
*  to fight. The MPs would come to get them. And as far as they were concerned, they were right.
*  The reason they did this is because it had been conveyed to them very clearly that they could do
*  whatever the hell they wanted to the Palestinian detainees and nobody would care. And they weren't
*  specifically horrible people. The general sense in Israel, and this is in the broadest consensus
*  you can imagine, is that Hamas, and particularly the Nukhba force, the elite force that was military
*  force that raided Israel on October 7th before about 2000 ordinary Gazans joined them. That these
*  people were the worst, most horrible, most evil people in the world. That whatever we did to them
*  could not be punishment enough. That we needed to deny them basic conditions, that we needed to
*  imprison them in special prisons. Torture was too good for them. And there was a broad consensus
*  that this was true. Now again, not everybody celebrated inhumane treatment of Palestinian
*  detainees. There were a lot of people who just ignored the issues or stayed mum.
*  The torturance that they mourn has been documented for months. Everybody knows what happened there.
*  Physicians who worked there wrote anonymous letters reporting having to perform amputations
*  without anesthesia, for example. Everybody knew what was going on there. Everybody looked the other
*  way because ultimately, effectively, everybody agreed that you could do this to Palestinians
*  who had been involved in October 7th. Of course, nobody knows how many of the people in that camp
*  were actually involved in October 7th. But that was the consensus. And what erupted in Israel over
*  the last few days was not really a January 6th moment. It was a way for the Israeli elite who had
*  condoned this, who had looked the other way, who was okay with this being done, to find a scapegoat,
*  to find a strong man to blame and say, you know, it's just these fanatics. If we get rid of these
*  fanatics, if we lock them up, everything will be okay. And in a way, that's the dynamic of the
*  protests against the Netanyahu government that took place for about a year before October 7th
*  and that have resumed recently. The protests are not about the genocide. The protests are not about
*  torture. The protests are about who's in charge, who gets to decide who counts as a real, true
*  patriot and who doesn't. And it's a struggle between an old entrenched elite and the upstarts
*  who want to topple that elite. But it's a completely in-house struggle. And perhaps the most, I think,
*  important thing you need to understand is that neither side gives a fig about the Palestinians.
*  Neither side cares. Nobody cares what's being done to the Palestinians. Nobody cares. I mean, take
*  the assassination of Deff, for example. They killed more than 90 and was really, I mean,
*  Israel used several 2,000-pound bombs in order to assassinate Deff. Again, this was described
*  as a precise operation based on precise intelligence today by Israeli media.
*  Nobody cares. You know, nobody cares. I read, over the last few days, I've been reading, I thought
*  this had been overdone with, but I've been reading again, people I know to be serious, smart, educated,
*  who have been saying things like, difference between Israel and Iran, this is why we're
*  waiting for the Iranian retaliation, is that Iran will shamelessly target civilians, whereas Israel
*  only goes after senior leaders. I swear to God, this is not a solitary statement. People actually
*  said this. So the thing that I come away with is this understanding and these events that they
*  learn and at the military courts only reinforce that this is about looking good. This is about
*  feeling good about yourself, but this is about keeping the debate exclusively within Israel
*  about Israelis. The Palestinians are simply not there. We don't care. We don't necessarily
*  want to kill them. There are people who feel they deserve abuse. Yes, they are at one end of
*  the spectrum, but at the other end of the spectrum are people who say, no, this whole thing is
*  repulsive, but of course we have to keep them in concentration camp conditions. What else are you
*  going to do? And ultimately this all adds up to a broad consensus that simply dehumanizes the
*  Palestinians in the most extreme ways I can think of. And that is still Israel at the moment,
*  despite the failures in Gaza, despite the impending regional war, despite the implosion of every
*  semblance of strategy Israel seemed to have, that is still Israel at this moment.
*  It's interesting. There was a tweet by, you must have seen it, the Israeli analyst, not a wise
*  Israeli analyst, I've called, Jel Ben Afaim, who had previously supported the mistreatment of
*  detainees. He said, I feel stupid and ashamed. In May an exposure came out on CNN detailing the
*  abuses in state time. And then the New York Times released her own argument. Both were backed up
*  with Israeli sources, crossed with Palestinian ones. I dismissed them because my government
*  sources, Israeli media denied them my whole life. I was told the international media was out to get
*  Israel, that they were all anti-Semites. But today I realized I was lied to. How much I was lied to
*  by my country, by my friends, by my media. And then it goes into the worst part. He says it's
*  only coming out not because the government have chased their hearts, it's because of pressure.
*  Not least he says from the ICC and the ICJ. But he said, they said the truth that Israel is routinely
*  torturing inmates. The sexual abuse is very common that people have been tortured to death.
*  Worst of all, many of the people in this facility were innocent, random by accident. Yeah, I mean,
*  it's just quite interesting hearing that. It's probably quite, I don't know. I mean,
*  it's always interesting when people, you know, who he would have been for the last few months
*  angrily decrying anyone who said the truth. And now he's finally realized the truth. I know that's
*  quite rare, but it's still quite a useful piece of evidence. Yeah, you know, I'm certainly for him.
*  I support him in his quest to find the truth. But it takes a very conscious, willful act of denial
*  to not see what's happening. And it's not even, I can't explain this statement that I quoted to
*  you before about how Iran targets civilians while Israel targets leaders. You know, maybe
*  in early November, I would have understood maybe even though I thought the blanket bombings were
*  a horrid crime beginning on October 8th, or I knew where they would go. But I could have understood
*  the rage. I could have understood the humiliation. But after 10 months, tens of thousands of women
*  and children and civilians in Gaza dead, after 10 months, you could really, you know, tweak that
*  in good faith. That I think only shows, I mean, that shows precisely that our dehumanization of
*  the Palestinians was so severe, was so all engrossing that we had in the process dehumanize
*  ourselves. You know, we're not capable of seeing this. I don't think these people were lying. I
*  don't think they were posturing. And these people wrote in Hebrew, it wasn't for Hasbara purposes,
*  but in the Israeli collective mind, everything that is done to Hamas is, is, you know, proper
*  and justified. And, and all responsibility for all civilian deaths in Gaza is exclusively on Hamas
*  shoulders, because it uses civilians as shields, because it hides among civilians. And because,
*  this is another argument you hear here quite quickly, quite often, I'm sorry, not quickly,
*  is Hamas could have stopped this whole thing in 10 minutes. All they had to do was give themselves
*  up and return the hostages and Israel would have stopped. Which of course, in no way fits reality
*  with Israel employing very sophisticated AI systems and algorithms to detect tens of thousands
*  of Hamas targets, because Israel's declared goal for this war was the destruction of Hamas.
*  After a few months where it became very clear that Hamas was not going to be destroyed,
*  this destruction became the destruction of Hamas as a capable military and governing force. Even
*  that didn't happen. So now Israel has resorted, and this has been the case for weeks now, Israel
*  has resorted to hopefully, you know, bombing extensively enough to kill senior Hamas leaders.
*  I don't know if it worked with Dave or not. There's no way of knowing if Israel is telling the truth.
*  It doesn't matter. What matters is that Israel attempted to assassinate Dave in an area that was
*  full of displaced persons it had sent there because it had designated the area as a safe zone.
*  And the notion that if Dave was there, it was okay to kill as many Palestinians as possible.
*  I've had these conversations where people said to me, you know, if Hitler had surrounded himself
*  in the bunker with 90 Jews, would you have not killed Hitler? That's the sort of counter-argument
*  you hear here. But none of this registers in the collective Israeli consciousness. None of it.
*  Palestinians are simply not there. We don't care.
*  Just finally, actually, it's not a complete... So, Greg, can you just mention Hitler, given the
*  content of this tweet, which I was genuinely shocked by. And lots of people were shocked by it,
*  and he deleted it. The former spokesperson of the Israeli... One of the spokespeople of the Israeli
*  prime minister in government, Ilan Levy, tweeted yesterday, not your grandparents Jews anymore.
*  Yeah.
*  Whoa. I would say when I saw that, I was like, wow, wow. I mean, literally suggesting that those who
*  had perished in the shower were weak. We're not like them. They were weak. We stand up for ourselves.
*  We fight. I don't know. What do you say to that?
*  Precisely. A lot of Israelis were very angry with that tweet. But again, remember the beginning of
*  our conversation. Dissociation. We're very angry with Ilan Levy. We can place him. He was Netanyahu's
*  advisor. He was let go by the Netanyahu family for whatever reasons. But he still does hasbara. So
*  we look at him, we read what he says, and we say, oh my God, that's so offensive. It's offensive to
*  us. A lot of Israelis responded in Hebrew, dude, my grandparents survived the Holocaust, came here,
*  built a life for themselves. What the hell are you talking about? So on the one hand, we're very
*  angry. On the other hand, we sort of get it, I guess. Very few of us are happy about the
*  assassinations. You may have seen people handing out sweets. Those are directed photo ops. Very
*  few Israelis woke up in the morning and felt safe when they heard Ania was assassinated.
*  We know what the implications are. We know what the consequences of our actions are. But
*  we seem to be resigned to our fate. We seem to think there's nothing we can do.
*  And again, finally, we've got that unity between the prime minister and the IDF high brass because
*  here we've got a successful operation. Everybody needed to cooperate to mount a successful
*  operation like that. And again, nobody's happy. If anybody has the notion that Israelis are walking
*  around feeling triumphant, they really aren't. There's a sense of impending doom. But again,
*  not because we did anything. We did what we had to do. And anything that happens would have happened
*  anyway because we're not responsible for any of it because for 10 months we've been telling ourselves
*  we're not responsible for what's happening in Gaza. And the way grandmothers used to talk about
*  wiping the frown off your face because otherwise it'll stick. We've convinced ourselves we're not
*  responsible. We're not responsible for anything. We do our best. We try. We're not great at it.
*  Obviously, things are going to hell in a hand basket. But it isn't us, not because it's them,
*  just because we're not responsible. And the other side of that when it comes to the Palestinians,
*  is that we don't care. Those are two sides of the same coin. We're not responsible strategically.
*  We don't care when it comes to the Palestinians. We're zombies. We're not really here. We're hollow.
*  We're not even full of murderous intent. We're not particularly, we're not celebrating all this
*  death. We don't like it, most of us. But we're not really here. That's the vibe in Israel right now.
*  Sounds like kind of mass ketamine disassociation. A slightly surreal segue for me there. But
*  all realistic that was brilliant stuff. Always insightful, always thoughtful, always makes me
*  think. I mean, when I spoke to you last time, it made me think about things in a different way,
*  which is always brilliant when you speak to someone. So those who are watching,
*  please share this video, press like, leave your comments, makes a bit more people watch it,
*  subscribe. And Dari, thank you so much. It was always an honor.
*  Thank you for having me. It's an honor for me as well.
*  Bless you.
