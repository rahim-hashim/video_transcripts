# Israeli Ambassador REVEALS Real Their Plan
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [December 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp9iPxUuUkI)
*  Zippy Hottivelli, the Israeli ambassador to the UK. What do you even say? Where do you even begin?
*  Calling her a crude caricature is I think being pretty generous on my part. Who her grotesque
*  attempts to justify and rationalize the horror befalling the people of Gaza are supposed to
*  convince is frankly beyond me. Admittedly she does have the slight advantage that her government's
*  sadistic mass slaughter of the Palestinian people is largely being treated with kid gloves by the
*  British media with honorable exceptions but her sheer stupidity, I mean just contrast to the slick
*  performances of her predecessor Mark Regev who was a highly effective PR man for mass slaughter
*  compliments where they are due. But it does have a big advantage and that is what I would describe
*  as her accidental honesty saying the quiet part out loud rather than suppressing the nefarious ends
*  of her allies for the sake of diplomacy. Let's just listen to her interview with Sky News.
*  You need to know what you did. Is there still a chance for a two-state solution? I think it's about
*  time for the world to realize the Oslo power that failed on the 7th of October and we need to build
*  a new one and in order to build a new one. Does that new one include the Palestinians living in a
*  state of their own? I think the biggest question is what type of Palestinians are on the other side?
*  Is what Israel realizes? The answer is absolutely no and I'll tell you why. Well then how can there
*  be peace in Israel? The reason there is no peace is because the Palestinians without offering
*  a state to Palestine, how can there be peace in Israel? Israel knows today and the world should know
*  now the reason the Oslo Accords failed is because the Palestinians never wanted to have a state next
*  to Israel. They want to have a state from the river to the sea. So the two-state solution is dead.
*  Why are you obsessed with a formula that never worked that created this radical people in the
*  other side? Why are you obsessed with that? Well on one level you might say this isn't really a big
*  surprise. She herself has previously declared that between the sea and the Jordan River there needs
*  to be one state only the state of Israel. As I say, Sub-Sahle Sea is not exactly her forte.
*  Notice that phrase there. She's saying to the river from the river to the sea essentially,
*  which is deemed genocidal when those who support justice for Palestinians say it,
*  but not when Israeli leaders say it even as they steal Palestinian land in the West Bank
*  and massacre thousands of Palestinians, mostly in Gaza. When Benjamin Netanyahu stood before the UN
*  with a map of greater Israel earlier this year he was not exactly being subtle either and Netanyahu
*  has long declared there will never be a Palestinian state so long as he's Prime Minister. Recently he
*  announced that only he can block a Palestinian state and indeed much of his coalition government
*  is clearly united in support of a greater Israel some more or less subtly than others. Now indeed
*  the Israeli Foreign Minister has also said that Gaza will shrink after the war is over but the
*  Israeli ambassador Zippy Hotevelli saying there absolutely will be no Palestinian state so
*  unapologetically embracing the offers I would say useful clarity about what Israel is actually
*  planning. Let me talk about that but first note she accuses Palestinians of wanting one single state
*  from the river to the sea. You mean the projects that Israel is actually instituting in practice
*  which she herself has endorsed as it prevents another state from existing and colonizes the
*  West Bank which is illegally occupied with 500,000 illegal settlers who are unleashing many of them
*  such terror against Palestinians that even the British conservative government is condemning it
*  and calling for those settlers responsible for violence to be banned from entering Britain. She
*  says the prospect of an independent Palestinian state is what created as she called this radical
*  people so not even subtly not even being subtle here about her belief in collective guilt there.
*  What has driven so many Palestinians to support say Hamas which is clearly what she was hinting at
*  the prospect that they might have their own independent state one day is that really what
*  she thinks the basis for it is or was it the total crushing hopelessness based on decades of
*  oppression of apartheid as diagnosed by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the Israeli
*  Human Rights Organization, Bezlem and many others the occupation, siege, state violence indeed the
*  general total abject lack of hope imposed upon the Palestinian people. But let's just examine what
*  Hodei Rehli's declaration means in practice. It means that the Palestinians of Gaza, West Bank,
*  East Jerusalem never have their own state they remain forever stateless. Does that really mean
*  a forever limbo where these particular slithers of the globe are permanently deprived of nationhood?
*  Let's just engage with what options Hodei Rehli and her allies are presenting here. Do they mean
*  there will be a single state from the river to the sea that Israel's borders will become
*  exactly that? So what of the over three million Palestinians in the West Bank and the 2.2 million
*  Palestinians in Gaza at least the 2.2 million before this current horror began will they become
*  citizens of this state with I don't know the right to vote? You know what I don't think
*  Qatari has got that in mind there are as is 1.6 million Palestinian citizens of Israel proper
*  that was those who weren't driven out of their homes with the Macba which happened at the beginning
*  of the establishment of the state of Israel so that's about 20% of the population who are already
*  third-class citizens who suffer widespread institutionalized discrimination and indeed
*  in 2018 Israel passed the nation state basic law emphasizing only Jews have the right of self-determination
*  in Israel telling its Palestinian citizens very clearly exactly what their status is.
*  So what does it mean in practice? Does Hodei Rehli just want to keep an oppressed dispossessed
*  Palestinian population permanently in Gaza and the West Bank their anger and discontent growing
*  as the utter hopelessness of their situation is emphasized as they suffer horrendous never-ending
*  oppression apartheid state violence the worst what forever? I don't think so not least given that
*  population is only going to grow and grow it has rapidly grown over the years this point keeps
*  coming up by the way as some sort of gotcha how can there be a genocide in Gaza if its population
*  has rapidly grown it's doubled in size since 2000 this is an incredibly stupid point firstly
*  those discussing genocide do so overwhelmingly in the context of what's happened in the last two
*  months or so but let's just apply this stupid logic to history under Joseph Stalin in the
*  Soviet Union there were famines the great terror and the small matter the Nazi invasion of the
*  Soviet Union which was a war of annihilation which slaughtered around 27 million Soviet citizens
*  and guess what despite these obvious mass slaughters of tens of millions of people
*  the Soviet population grew under Stalin even obviously taking out the territories annexed
*  by the Soviets in World War II does that mean these horrors never happened obviously that would be
*  ridiculous people who suffer huge levels of deprivation tend to have high birth rates lower
*  birth rates are generally associated with affluence so is Israel just going to go oh okay
*  we'll just have this growing population whose total hopelessness we have imposed upon them
*  even though we know that will lead to very obvious and inevitable theory they're not going to do that
*  of course they're not going to do that which is why the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people
*  based on what the Israeli government have made clear they oppose which is their right to have
*  a state is self-evidently the most likely outcome you can see that in the clear backing
*  amongst Israel's rulers for ethnically cleansing Gaza a few weeks ago a leaked document
*  as one example from the intelligence ministry backed this plan as it happens that ministry is
*  not as powerful as it sounds but it's headed by someone regarded as a relative moderate in the
*  ruling Likud party and therefore is indicative of wider thinking it's also obvious that if Israel
*  is permanently opposed to any Palestinian state ever existing then it needs to erase Palestinian
*  national identity so long as there exists a Palestinian people with a clear Palestinian
*  national identity there will always be a struggle for an independent Palestinian state that's an
*  that's a statement of the obvious so that's why in its murderous rampage in Gaza the question of
*  genocide is so live and why when you hear Israeli politicians and officials using genocidal language
*  you have to take that seriously like calling Palestinians human animals declaring all gardens
*  have collective guilt that was the Israeli president or indeed that there were no innocents
*  in Gaza quoting genocidal biblical passages declaring the Palestinians of the west bank to
*  be Nazis that kind of thing you have to take it seriously and it should be noted by the way
*  that Zippy Hotevelli a self-evident raging extremist is fated by major political parties as
*  the inspiring Jewish peace movement Nahamod puts it following her presence in Westminster Hall
*  it is appalling to see Zippy Hotevelli being welcomed by both UK political leaders and the
*  leaders of our Jewish community she stands for anti-Palestinian racism,
*  Nakba denialism and permanent apartheid we must reject everything she stands for wholeheartedly
*  the fact is though Hotevelli's comments are deadly serious they reveal the intentions of the Israeli
*  state and indeed they reveal the very likely fate of the Palestinians unless we fight to stop it
*  and we fight for a just lasting peace what is that just lasting peace it recognizes that Israeli
*  Jews and Palestinians aren't going anywhere that the land belongs to them both that they have to
*  live together always security happiness and hope for their future that's what we've got to fight
