# Netanyahu Lets Slip Israel's Real Plan
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [December 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWlIojS38qA)
*  This should be headline news, yet for some inexplicable reason it isn't.
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of course of Israel,
*  and a man responsible for grave, grave war crimes on a colossal scale,
*  has made Israel's intentions very clear,
*  and that is the mass removal of the Palestinian population from Gaza,
*  or to use that gruesome euphemism which emerged from the horrors of the Balkan Wars of the 1990s,
*  ethnic cleansing.
*  Now according to Israel Hayon, that's the biggest newspaper in Israel,
*  and it is also interestingly close to Netanyahu himself.
*  Netanyahu told the Quds party members at a meeting
*  that he was working on finding countries ready to, in quotes,
*  absorb Palestinians from Gaza.
*  He said,
*  Our problem is countries that are ready to absorb them, and we are working on it.
*  The world is already discussing the possibilities of, in his words,
*  voluntary immigration,
*  adding a team must be established to ensure that those who want to leave Gaza to a third country can do so.
*  It needs to be settled.
*  It has strategic importance for the day after the war.
*  Now firstly, let's just dismiss voluntary as the insulting nonsense that it is.
*  The people of Gaza do not want to leave their homes.
*  Of course, most of them have been now forcibly displaced.
*  Eighty one percent of Gaza's population already are refugees,
*  that is, they are the families of those driven from their homes in Israel's official borders
*  during and after the 1948 Nakba, or catastrophe.
*  Now they've already been forced to flee internally,
*  and they have learned throughout their history a bitter lesson
*  that once driven out, they are invariably never ever going to be allowed back.
*  Now a pre-war poll found that the vast majority of Gazans don't want to leave their homes.
*  And actually, interestingly, that's higher than, say, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon,
*  Morocco, Sudan and Tunisia.
*  For many Westerners who served a daily diet of inflammatory racist coverage from newspapers,
*  leaving with the impression that everyone from poorer nations wish to come to the West,
*  these findings may be something of a surprise.
*  But they are true.
*  People invariably don't want to leave their homelands,
*  particularly those who have already been driven historically from where they live.
*  Now, as the Israeli journalist Dimi Rida puts it,
*  voluntary emigration, he puts in quotes.
*  I'm afraid you'll start hearing this a lot from Netanyahu and Co.
*  Remember, it's not in quotes voluntary, and it isn't in quotes emigration.
*  It's a euphemism for ethnic cleansing 101.
*  It was literally Adolf Eichmann's first big project with regards to European Jewry.
*  Now what it means in practice is making the conditions of life impossible,
*  forcing Gazans therefore to flee Gaza.
*  Now this is a pillar of genocide, making the conditions of life impossible.
*  Now there's the bombing, of course, and that's a large part of this.
*  You flatten civilian infrastructure.
*  You make a place therefore uninhabitable.
*  Much of northern Gaza is completely destroyed.
*  Indeed, as Itai Efstein, an Israeli lawyer and special advisor to the Norwegian Refugee Council,
*  puts it, as Israeli military operations in Gaza drive civilians closer to its southern borders,
*  the looming possibility of mass deportation of Palestinians to Egypt grows.
*  This alarming prospect follows recent media reports and explicit statements by Israeli officials
*  endorsing such deportation without reasonable justification,
*  proper accommodation in places of refuge, or guarantees of return to homes once hostilities end.
*  Now the vast majority of the strips, 2.2 million, are not just, as I've said,
*  displaced. They've been driven to an ever-shrinking corner of Gaza in ever more
*  inhospitable conditions. But take this other example in terms of making life impossible.
*  The Israeli plan, mooted to flood Hamas's tunnel network with seawater,
*  which would leave Gaza with no drinkable water, devastate what little agriculture is possible
*  there. And this is something which a UN special rapporteur has specifically flagged in the
*  context of the threat of genocide. Netanyahu continues a two-faced policy of the Israeli
*  government, which loudly and unapologetically broadcasts its war crimes to the Israeli public,
*  while telling the West that it's actually abiding by international law.
*  Now in the Wall Street Post, Netanyahu has written,
*  In destroying Hamas, Israel will continue to act in full compliance with international law.
*  This is frankly just a repulsive lie. A hideous lie. From collective punishment,
*  to indiscriminate bombing, to the forcible removal of civilians, to destroying the conditions of life,
*  to multiple reports of civilians being massacred and tortured, the Israeli government might as
*  well be reading through the GDB convention solely to work out which parts to violate.
*  Netanyahu blames Hamas's strategy of using Palestinian civilians with human shields,
*  placing terrorist infrastructure inside and underneath homes, hospitals, mosques, schools,
*  etc. Now, given there are few precedents for a military campaign as destructive and deadly
*  as this, this is risable nonsense. If you detonate that many explosives in an area the size of East
*  London and wipe out that much of its buildings and infrastructure, the presence of human shields is
*  neither here nor there. Mass civilian death is inevitable. Notwithstanding Israel's own history
*  of using human shields, of which I will do a specific video discussing very soon, now Netanyahu's
*  desire to force out the Palestinian population doesn't come out of nowhere. In the 1970s,
*  the historian Max Hastings overheard a young Benjamin Netanyahu dreaming of a war when,
*  if we get it right, we'll have a chance to get all the Arabs out. We can clear the West Bank and
*  sort out Jerusalem. Clearly a project of his, a greater Israel project, which goes back a very
*  long time. And so now he enacts his lifelong ambition. But let's just be clear, we shouldn't
*  make this simply about Netanyahu the bogeyman. He's easy to make a bogeyman because the threat
*  of ethnic cleansing has widespread support. And there was a coordinated campaign agitating
*  for this grievous war crime to be committed. So take Danny Danon. He's another Likud politician,
*  a high profile Likud politician, and also Israel's former permanent representative to the United
*  Nations. Now he cites a poll in which 68% of Israeli Jews say that they are very supportive
*  of removing the Palestinian population from Gaza, with 15% quite supportive, 8% not so supportive,
*  and just 9% saying they don't support it at all. That is 83% of Israeli Jews supporting the forced
*  removal to some degree of the Palestinian population. Pretty bleak. That just illustrates how
*  courageous Israeli peace activists are and underlines the need for the boycott, divestment,
*  and sanctions campaign against Israel, because most white South Africans bought into apartheid
*  and had to be forced to abandon that position through international pressure driven by campaigning,
*  and the same has to be done all over again. Now Danon Bose, I'm happy that the Israeli public
*  understands that the plan I initiated for the voluntary migration of residents of the Gaza
*  Strip is the most correct and humane solution to the problem. I mean, where do you even begin
*  with that kind of language? Danon Carlawford, an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal as well,
*  with Ram Ben Barak from the so-called liberal opposition, yes, yes, added. Important that,
*  because, you know, if you think this is just the Israeli right, that's the problem here. I'm afraid
*  it isn't. In this op-ed, they wrote, the international community has a moral imperative
*  and an opportunity to demonstrate compassion, as they put it, calling on the countries,
*  countries across the world to accept limited numbers of guards and families who have expressed
*  a desire to, as they put it, relocate. Now this humanitarian veneer, for what they're talking about,
*  is itself interesting. I'll come on to that. As Francesca Albanese, the UN Special Rapporteur
*  on Human Rights in the Occupied Territories puts it, I've interviewed her, do check out that interview,
*  voluntary migration, no matter how the Israeli government calls it, forced displacement is a
*  crime, prosecutable under the Rome Statute. Its architects shall be investigated and prosecuted
*  by the International Court and other courts under universal jurisdiction. Now, those agitating
*  for ethnic cleansing are not stupid. Malign, hateful, dangerous, yes, all those things,
*  they're not stupid. They know it's illegal, they know it's not just illegal, it's actually a very
*  grave crime, so that's why they're dressing all of this up in humanitarian lingo. Well, largely when
*  they're talking to the West, when they're talking to a domestic audience, they're more comfortable
*  using terms like human animals and quoting a biblical passage which, in a sense, in essence,
*  agitates for genocide and so on. Now, this approach was noted by an excellent piece in
*  the Jewish Currents earlier this month written by Jonathan Shimeir. It's entitled Israel's
*  Humanitarian Expulsion, in quotes. Now, Shimeir notes the growing prominence of what was once,
*  as he puts it, an extremist position within Israel, the call to push out the remaining Palestinians
*  out of historic Palestine. He notes many calls for that position within Israeli society in
*  newspapers such as Israel Hayon, as I say, the newspaper close to Netanyahu, as well as
*  various conservative think tanks. The aim, he says, is to present ethnic cleansing as a humanitarian
*  gesture. He notes that ethnic cleansing of Palestinians has, of course, been a central
*  feature of Israeli policy since the state was founded, with a million Palestinians driven from
*  their homes between 1948 and 1967. But this forced removal of 2.3 million Palestinians in one go
*  would dwarf anything that's so far been done. Now, these calls are indeed being echoed all over
*  the place. There's an article in the Jerusalem Post headed, Why Moving to the Sinai Peninsula
*  is the Solution for Gaza's Palestinians. It's striking to note how the author frames this
*  argument because it clearly reveals the strategy of the Israeli state. So he says, major portions
*  of the metropolis are considerably incapacitated and cannot be simply fixed. Rather, the damaged
*  and destroyed structures must be completely torn down. The tunneled and consequently exploded in
*  bulldozed soil must undergo extensive environmental and engineering rehabilitation. He goes on to say,
*  in other words, the metropolis has to be fully evacuated, the metropolis, sorry, redesigned,
*  monitored, and only then rebuilt to provide habitable and economic conducive conditions. Such an
*  effort requires unique expertise and immense funding that will take considerable time that cannot be
*  calculated and on that basis calls for the Palestinian population for their own good to be
*  removed from Gaza and driven into the Sinai in Egypt. So the Israeli state destroys Gaza and then
*  goes, oh look, Gaza is no longer habitable anymore. I guess the humane thing to do would be to deport
*  the civilian population to save them from the conditions that we created. Well, the civilian
*  population who survive anyway. Now, these calls are frankly being echoed elsewhere. One Israeli
*  council leader has proposed sending all Gazans to camps in Lebanon and flattening the entire
*  Gaza Strip so it becomes an empty museum, as he puts it, like Auschwitz. Specifically, he says,
*  let it become a museum showcasing the capabilities of the state of Israel and dissuading anyone from
*  living in the Gaza Strip. Just fascistic, deranged rhetoric, which has become acceptable. Now, I
*  spoke to Omar Bartoff, the brilliant Israeli historian and Samuel P. Saar professor of Holocaust
*  and genocide studies at Brown University earlier this month, and I specifically wanted to talk to
*  him about the question of ethnic cleansing in terms of its relationship to genocide. Let's just
*  hear a little clip of what he told me. About 1.8 million Palestinians out of 2.2 or 2.3 have been
*  displaced. They've been displaced, they've been concentrated in a very small territory. The homes
*  have largely been destroyed. The Israeli army and government have not committed to allowing them
*  back, and they're now in conditions that are creating an ever-widening humanitarian disaster.
*  And there is great deal of talk in Israel about removing them entirely from Gaza, which would
*  indicate that this is an operation of ethnic cleansing, as one Israeli minister, Dichter, said.
*  This is Nakba 2023. That is Nakba for the disaster of 1948, the expansion of 750,000 Palestinians in
*  1948. Ethnic cleansing often deteriorates into genocide because people don't want to move,
*  and so in order to encourage them to move, you kill them. And so we are, I think, right now
*  at a point where ethnic cleansing seems to have been carried out and is ongoing,
*  and it may become genocidal. Now this is a critical point. People don't want to leave their homes,
*  especially the Palestinians who've learned that bitter lesson over and over again that once removed
*  they don't come back. They're not allowed to come back. The homes are taken away from them.
*  So the response then has to be mass slaughter, and here enters the question of genocide.
*  There is no question at all that the Israeli state is determined to ethnically cleanse
*  the Palestinian population. Some might respond, well, the US will never let them do this.
*  Oh yeah, the US has let them get away with everything so far, with occasional bits of
*  hand-wringing that the Israeli state rightly judges to amount to nothing. Don't count on it.
*  The failure of most Western media outlets on top of that to accurately report on what's going on,
*  on the gravity of what it all entails, and indeed the moral obscenity that it represents,
*  well that's also enabling Israel to get away with anything. So it is up to us to shout about
*  this as loud as we can. Please like and subscribe. Do share this video. You can keep the show on the
