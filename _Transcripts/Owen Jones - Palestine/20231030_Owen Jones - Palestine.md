Video Description: This is beyond outrageous. A Labour MP calls for a peaceful settlement for Israelis and Palestinians alike - and the Labour leadership suspends him for it. The attempt to demonise those opposing the current horror will only escalate - so we must speak louder.

# Labour MP SUSPENDED - For Backing PEACE
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQiZty9_jnY)
*  This is absolutely obscene, beyond obscene.
*  Let me just try and contain my righteous rage at what's just happened.
*  Now, Andrew McDonald is a brilliant Labour MP,
*  one of a diminishing number of Labour MPs,
*  who believes in old-fashioned ideas like social justice,
*  redistributing wealth and power, and indeed peace.
*  Now, he served in Keir Starmer's shadow cabinet until 2021,
*  when he resigned in protest at the leadership's refusal to back a genuine living wage,
*  as well as Starmer's general master's guarding of his leadership pledges,
*  you know, things like nationalisation of utilities,
*  increasing taxes on the rich, scrapping tuition fees,
*  and I would say particularly relevant today,
*  putting human rights at the heart of foreign policy.
*  His words.
*  Now, he has been suspended, Andrew McDonald, from the Labour Party,
*  for the most innocuous call for peace imaginable.
*  He spoke at the mass rally this Saturday, which I attended in London,
*  which demanded a ceasefire,
*  a demand-backed, according to the polls,
*  by an overwhelming majority of the British population,
*  not least Labour voters.
*  Let's just hear one excerpt from him.
*  Now, many of those in our government want to tell us
*  that this all started on the 7th of October,
*  and that this is all simply about retaliation against Hamas
*  for the terrible crimes it carried out on that day.
*  But, friends, we know that this is simply not the case.
*  So, very clear there, where Andy McDonald stands,
*  he condemned there the terrible crimes, as he put it,
*  committed by Hamas on the 7th of October.
*  He went on to end his speech like this.
*  We will not rest until we have justice.
*  Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians,
*  between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.
*  Free, free Palestine!
*  Free, free Palestine!
*  Go!
*  This is what he's been suspended by the Labour leadership for saying.
*  Let's say it again.
*  We won't rest until we have justice, until all people,
*  including the people of the UK,
*  We won't rest until we have justice, until all people,
*  Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea,
*  can live in peaceful liberty.
*  Who on earth could object to that?
*  Which sane, rational person, who actually believes in peace,
*  who wants an end to mass killing,
*  could possibly have a problem with that statement?
*  I'll tell you this, it's the people who oppose such a statement,
*  who in a just world would have booted out the Labour Party
*  in moral disgrace.
*  Now, the Times newspaper, supposedly our paper on record,
*  a Murdoch rag,
*  falsely originally claimed that he had chanted,
*  between the river and the sea, Palestine will be free.
*  Now, they wrote a correction,
*  adding, we apologise for the error,
*  which I'm sure was made entirely in good faith.
*  Now, as it so happens, even this phrase is misconstrued.
*  It is claimed that it means the driving of the Jewish population of Israel,
*  clearly a despicable aim.
*  Now, while it's true, like so many phrases, it can be abused,
*  it's simply untrue that millions would use it
*  and do use it in such a horrifying and contemptible way.
*  What they mean is Palestinians currently facing oppression,
*  whether those in Gaza, by the sea, the West Bank, to the river,
*  or the Palestinian citizens of Israel are freed of that oppression,
*  either in the form of a two-state solution,
*  normally based on pre-1967 borders,
*  or in one secular state where all have equal rights and an equal vote.
*  Both are completely legitimate positions.
*  In any case, though, not actually relevant,
*  because it is not what Andy MacDonald said.
*  So we have a spectacle where it's fine, absolutely fine,
*  for Keir Starmer to go on national radio and endorse war crimes,
*  which is what he did when he supported cutting off water and electricity
*  to a civilian population,
*  then do bare-faced lies about what he said,
*  even though we could all hear what he said,
*  even though he said afterwards about being in accordance with international law,
*  either not knowing what international law says
*  or being completely dishonest about it.
*  Labour can issue briefings answering positions on reports
*  that Israel has been using white phosphorus, illegal,
*  when used against civilian populations,
*  with the first response,
*  we support Israel's right to defend itself.
*  Where the Labour leadership backs the onslaught by Israel,
*  making glib statements about international law,
*  while never actually condemning Israel for serially breaking it,
*  whether it be for the collective punishment,
*  including, of course, a siege,
*  which has totally cut off water, food, medicine, basic supplies,
*  the forcible removal of a civilian population
*  condemned by the United Nations and multiple human rights organisations,
*  the mass bombardment of civilian populations,
*  which has led over 8,000 deaths, at least,
*  not counting those trapped, presumably dead below rubble,
*  including over 3,000 children in three weeks.
*  The 8,000...
*  Sorry, the 3,000, more than 3,000 kids,
*  is more than the total number killed in armed conflict globally
*  across more than 20 countries over the course of a whole year
*  for the last three years, as the likes of Save the Children have noted.
*  If you adjust for population, the over 8,000 total deaths
*  is equivalent of over a quarter of a million Brits,
*  bearing in mind,
*  over around 43,000 died in the Blitz over the course of eight months,
*  it would be the equivalent of a quarter of a million Brits
*  in around three weeks being killed.
*  Now, they haven't condemned the fact journalists
*  and the whole families had been killed,
*  let alone UN officials and aid workers,
*  or condemned the language used by Israeli officials and leaders,
*  openly speaking, in terms of overt support for war crimes,
*  and indeed language which has been condemned as genocidal,
*  whether it be about reducing Gaza to a city of tents,
*  where all buildings are destroyed,
*  talking of human animals, saying,
*  will eliminate everything, permanently occupying Gaza's land,
*  biblical readings from Netanyahu,
*  which have been widely interpreted as tantamount to the course of genocide,
*  one former Israeli military commander stating their aim
*  that they will destroy anything that moves, we could go on.
*  What's actually unacceptable in the modern Labour Party
*  isn't to stay silent and tacitly endorse
*  a military onslaught involving all of these things,
*  but it is to call for a lasting peace for Israelis and Palestinians alike.
*  This comes from the faction of the Labour Party,
*  which brought us Iraq, with the hundreds of thousands killed
*  and all the blood and chaos,
*  Afghanistan, a two-decade-long occupation,
*  disastrous, which ended with the Taliban stronger than ever,
*  and which backed the Libyan war,
*  which turned that country into a war-ravaged nightmare.
*  This all against a backdrop of an escalating campaign
*  against those of us protesting,
*  against the horrors being unleashed by the Israeli state
*  with the open support of our government.
*  The more atrocities are committed,
*  the more wider societies are pulsed by it,
*  the more cheerleaders of this horror will come under attack.
*  It is desperate.
*  They're trying to claim the real moral disgraces and extremists
*  are those who oppose war crimes and the mass slaughter of civilians,
*  turning the world upside down on its very head.
*  This all has a political purpose, of course,
*  to deflect pressure away from our political establishment
*  for their complicity in this horror.
*  Let's listen to Sweila Bravaman, our, let's just say it,
*  disgusting Home Secretary.
*  Well, first of all, let me explain what we've seen over the last few weekends.
*  We've seen now tens of thousands of people take to the streets
*  following the massacre of Jewish people,
*  the single largest loss of Jewish life since the Holocaust,
*  chanting for the erasure of Israel from the map.
*  To my mind, there's only one way to describe those marchers.
*  They are hate marchers.
*  Hate marchers, the absolute front of this nauseating individual.
*  This is the politician who used the term cultural Marxism,
*  long regarded as an anti-Semitic dog-whistle,
*  who does disgraceful inflammatory speeches,
*  warning of immigration being an existential threat to Western civilization,
*  who talks darkly about the number of children born to foreign-born mothers,
*  clearly echoing the far-right rape replacement theory,
*  and she thinks she can grandstand on what constitutes hatred.
*  I've been to those marches, I've been to all of the London marches.
*  They are multicultural, they are Britain at its most diverse,
*  bringing together Muslims, Jews, non-believers and so many others.
*  And what brought us all together and brings us all together
*  in growing numbers is a desire for peace and justice,
*  for the mass killings of innocent people to stop,
*  for Palestinians to finally be free of oppression.
*  Sure, you always get a few idiots at a crowd of that size,
*  which are half a million alone this Saturday,
*  but they are few and far between.
*  Indeed, the protest on Saturday was crawling with police officers,
*  clearly looking for any reason to arrest people.
*  Yet out of those hundreds of thousands of protesters,
*  there were just 10 arrests, a tiny number,
*  much less than a football match, which has smaller numbers attending.
*  Now, we should also note in the current climate,
*  today the Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked
*  as a permanent parliamentary secretary for a letter in which he said,
*  Hamas attacks against innocent civilians are unforgivable,
*  while calling for assurances Garzans don't suffer collective punishment
*  and also backing a ceasefire.
*  Now, what happened to Andy MacDonald is McCarthyism, straightforwardly.
*  There is nothing remotely wrong with anything he said.
*  It is obviously not in any sense anti-Semitism.
*  Anti-Semitism does exist.
*  It is an evil, an evil which has been responsible for terrible crimes
*  over 2000 years, not least the attempt to exterminate
*  the entire Jewish population during the Holocaust.
*  And of course, it can hijack Palestinian solidarity.
*  We saw that in Dagestan, that wasn't driven by solidarity
*  with the Palestinian people, a desire for emancipation,
*  a love of humanity, but by hatred.
*  I'm doing a video on that and why it's important to always
*  confront anti-Semitism, which always must be fought.
*  That does not mean abusing the evil of anti-Semitism
*  to shut down legitimate critiques of Israel's state.
*  Here's one example from Luke Acurst, who's on the National Executive Committee
*  of the party, who has sadly significant power in Starmers' Labour.
*  He wrote, perhaps people could wake up and realise there's a connection
*  between anti-Semitism attacks, whether in Dagestan or Stanford Hill,
*  and your exaggerated demonising language about Israel committing genocide,
*  collective punishment or carpet bombing.
*  Now, what he's doing here is saying that even stating inarguable facts
*  about what Israel is doing is racist incitement.
*  We can see the massive bombardment and destruction of civilian communities
*  with our own eyes.
*  Around half of Gaza's homes have been destroyed or damaged
*  in a very short period of time, that is carpet bombing.
*  As for collective punishment, what Israel has been doing
*  has been characterised as such by the United Nations and numerous NGOs,
*  who I would say are far more informed than Luke Acurst,
*  who works for a pro-Israel lobbying firm, including, for example,
*  and the massive bombardment of civilian areas.
*  Someone like Acurst clearly wishes to silence anyone critiquing
*  the terrible crime currently being committed,
*  which involves the mass slaughter of innocent people,
*  which is happening before our eyes.
*  Now, look, to end.
*  What the Labour leadership has done to Annie McDonald is a disgrace,
*  yet another shameful addition to a morally disgraceful chapter
*  in Labour's history.
*  His treatment is part of a racist campaign,
*  we should be clear about that, to stigmatise and delegitimise
*  any and every expression with the Palestinian people
*  as they suffer mass slaughter.
*  It also underlies another point.
*  Given how authoritarian Stalmer is with his own party,
*  how on earth can we trust him with our freedoms when he's Prime Minister?
*  This will only escalate as public horror grows
*  and the public, the political establishment comes into ever-growing pressure
*  to end their complicity in the crimes committed by the Israeli state.
*  That's why we must stand with the likes of Annie McDonald
*  and stand with all those fighting for just peace.
*  One way to quote Annie McDonald,
*  where all people, Israelis and Palestinians,
*  between the river and the sea can live in peaceful liberty.
