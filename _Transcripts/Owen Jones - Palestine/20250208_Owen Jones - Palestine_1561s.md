# BBC Israel Bias TAKEN APART By British-Palestinian Leader - w/. Aimee Shalan
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [February 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw)
*  Now, throughout this genocide, the media coverage, both in Britain and the West, has been an absolute [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=0.0s)]
*  travesty, turning reality upside down, gaslighting, erasing context, deferring, of course, to Israeli [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=6.8s)]
*  narratives, refusing to refute lies and to call them for what they are, erasing the Palestinian [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=13.44s)]
*  experiences, erasing Palestinian voices. We really could go on. I mean, it's a racist mess, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=20.56s)]
*  which has been used to legitimize one of the great crimes of our age. With that in mind, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=24.96s)]
*  I'm really delighted to be joined by Amy Shalan, who is the chair of the British [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=29.12s)]
*  Palestinian Committee, who've been doing crucial work all the way through, not least holding [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=33.76s)]
*  politicians to account, and director of McCann, and they focus on educating people about the, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=38.32s)]
*  well, the horrors of Palestine, but how to talk about it and communicate to that to a broad [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=46.88s)]
*  audience. Amy, how are you doing for us? It's great to speak to you. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=52.24s)]
*  Good to speak to you too. Thank you. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=54.64s)]
*  Solidarity is ever. You've been going on TV, serve your colleagues, and the emotional labour [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=57.12s)]
*  of that, I think, is very difficult for people like myself and others to ever truly understand. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  With that in mind, I just want to start. There was, I'll start actually with this clip, which [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=68.0s)]
*  is a clip of your colleague, director of the British Palestinian Committee, Sarah Hussaini, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=74.08s)]
*  and she was on the BBC. Let's just listen to that and what the BBC presenter said. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=81.76s)]
*  President Trump's statements over the past few days constitute the most explicit [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=88.80000000000001s)]
*  call for ethnic cleansing and forced displacement of Palestinians, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=97.04s)]
*  and the most explicit denial of Palestinian rights of any US administration. And now, of course, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  also suggesting that the US will occupy Gaza is obscene. Now, whether he can carry out these [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=105.84s)]
*  so-called plans or will carry out these so-called plans, which obviously you've heard from recent [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=113.36s)]
*  statements are very incoherent at this point, the man standing next to him at that press [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=117.36s)]
*  conference in Washington, Benjamin Netanyahu, who is wanted by the ICC for war crimes, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=121.84s)]
*  has been carrying out these ethnic cleansing plans and denial of Palestinian rights for decades, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=127.04s)]
*  and his predecessors before him for the best part of a century. This, the whole way through, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=131.44s)]
*  has been enabled by governments like the US and the British government, who have not only failed [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=136.56s)]
*  in their international responsibilities and legal duties to uphold Palestinian rights, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=142.96s)]
*  failed to not render aid or assistance to Israel's lawful military occupation, and failed to hold [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=147.04s)]
*  Israel accountable for its violations of international law, they've actively been [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=153.84s)]
*  supporting diplomatically and militarily Israel's assault on Gaza over decades. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=157.68s)]
*  Okay. Obviously, as you would expect me to say, those governments, Benjamin Netanyahu and others, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=162.8s)]
*  would, I'm sure, reject the idea that what they're promoting here is ethnic cleansing. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=169.52s)]
*  So the BBC presenter there ends by saying, obviously, as you would expect me to say, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=174.56s)]
*  Netanyahu and others would, I'm sure, reject the idea that what they're promoting here is [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=179.28s)]
*  ethnic cleansing. Now, I think this is absolutely extraordinary. I know a lot of people go, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=184.16s)]
*  what do you expect from the BBC? For me, it's just so important never to normalise this. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=190.0s)]
*  Always treat it as insanity. It is ethnic cleansing. It's not disputable. And yet, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=194.64s)]
*  that even here, when the US administration comes out and calls for ethnic cleansing, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=201.28s)]
*  the BBC decides it has to do rebuttal on behalf of both the Trump administration and Israel, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=206.8s)]
*  rather than just defer to international law. I just wondered your thoughts on that. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=212.4s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think we've seen time and time again, the mainstream media and particularly the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=216.32s)]
*  BBC have consistently aligned with Israel and they are consistently parroting Israeli talking points [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=222.32s)]
*  and as a default position, whilst also trying to claim impartiality during a genocide. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=232.56s)]
*  We've seen that Palestinians are really consistently delegitimised and dehumanised, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=240.32s)]
*  and at the same time, the long-standing history of their oppression is being silenced and erased. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=246.48000000000002s)]
*  That is a racist logic really that has sort of comes back from the days of Balfour. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=252.88s)]
*  When we think about it, it lies at the heart of our British institutions, which essentially [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=260.88s)]
*  don't feel that Palestinians have the same rights as other people. And we're seeing it in [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=265.84s)]
*  the power dynamics and language that's being played out day after day. I mean, in the Balfour [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=272.4s)]
*  Declaration, Palestinians were referred to as non-Jews. So that's what I'm talking about in [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=277.91999999999996s)]
*  terms of the fact that their identity and their collective power as an indigenous people is totally [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=284.4s)]
*  erased and it continues to be doing so. And so we still see that in the British media today, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=294.88s)]
*  in the mainstream media, when they're talking about Palestine, we're constantly sort of being [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=300.56s)]
*  called controversial if we use terms like genocide or ethnic cleansing or apartheid, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=305.36s)]
*  all of which is seen as inflammatory. And it's really at the same time, while they're going into [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=310.88s)]
*  overdrive, privileging Israeli narratives and voices and misinformation, consistently insisting [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=315.68s)]
*  on emphasizing Israel's rights while excluding the rights of Palestinians and consistently also [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=324.16s)]
*  using emotive language and sympathy with Israelis, but not for Palestinians. While Israeli spokespeople [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=332.32000000000005s)]
*  have really been allowed to dehumanize Palestinians, not only with no pushback from news presenters, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  but where they keep on parroting those same comments. But all of that is based on really [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=344.24s)]
*  decades of a dominant political discourse in the global north, which has situated Palestine within [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=349.92s)]
*  a conflict paradigm, where Palestinians and Israelis are conceived of as two sides in an [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=357.76s)]
*  age-old ethno-national kind of religious conflict over land, which completely fails to take into [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=364.16s)]
*  account the key historical facts or to even think about the root causes or the settler colonial [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=371.44s)]
*  nature of the Zionist project since its inception, which has led to the mass dispossession [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=378.4s)]
*  of Palestine's indigenous population that prefaced the creation of the state of Israel. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=384.71999999999997s)]
*  And we see that in the failure to address the deep asymmetry between the oppressed and the oppressor, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=391.2s)]
*  and the subordination consistently of Palestinian rights and the rule of law to a political process [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=397.76s)]
*  which essentially sees Israel's long-term strategic goals as the key driving force, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=404.32s)]
*  and has led to a zero-sum game in which basically the central concern is that if Israel is going [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=412.56s)]
*  to lose out, if Palestinian rights are actually upheld. And as a result, we've seen what's been [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=418.96s)]
*  able to happen, which is Israel's been able to continue to colonize Palestinian land to be much [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=425.44s)]
*  more explicit in its expansionist goals, and the oppressed are invited to come to the table to be [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=430.64s)]
*  oppressed still further at best. I mean that stripping of context is kind of at the heart of [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=438.32s)]
*  this refusal by the BBC and others to just tell the truth. If someone sets my house on fire, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=444.8s)]
*  I say the house is on fire, someone says the house isn't on fire, the response of a journalist [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=451.52s)]
*  there isn't to go, well someone says the house is on fire, but someone says the house isn't on [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=456.48s)]
*  fire, is the house on fire or not? I mean the BBC's coverage is just in this, when Trump said he was [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=460.40000000000003s)]
*  going to ethnically cleanse Gaza, which he made abundantly clear, Trump suggests, this was the BBC [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=466.64000000000004s)]
*  headline, Trump suggests the US could take over, in quotes, and redevelop Gaza as he hosts Netanyahu, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=472.08000000000004s)]
*  and then the subheading, the president says the US could take the lead in removing unexploded bombs [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=478.72s)]
*  and rebuilding Gaza after resettling Palestinians in other countries. It's not funny obviously, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=483.12s)]
*  but it's darkly, it's just so farcical, it's almost like it's dystopian in some ways, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=491.92s)]
*  redevelop, removing unexploded bombs like a humanitarian mission. I mean when you see that, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=499.04s)]
*  in response to what Trump says, and this is how the BBC, that's the editorial decision, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=505.12s)]
*  it's gone through a whole range of people, had to sign it off. What do you think about that? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=508.72s)]
*  Well I think again it's part and parcel of a consistent erosion of international law. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=513.2s)]
*  Now ethnic cleansing is related to genocide very clearly, it really surfaced in the context of [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=520.5600000000001s)]
*  the 1990s conflict in former Yugoslavia, and it's been acknowledged in judgments and indictments of [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=527.76s)]
*  the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and it's been used in UN Security [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=534.88s)]
*  Council resolutions and the General Assembly. So I mean it's very clear that the BBC in [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=541.12s)]
*  packaging what he said in that way is really obfuscating the fact that ethnic cleansing has [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=548.16s)]
*  been defined by the UN, by a commission of experts, as really a purposeful policy that's designed [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=553.84s)]
*  to, by one ethnic and religious group, to remove by violent and terror inspiring means the civilian [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=562.0s)]
*  population of another ethnic or religious group from certain geographic areas, and it's really [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=568.24s)]
*  important to acknowledge the coercive practices that are involved in doing that, and the UN sort [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=573.36s)]
*  of lists those as being murder, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, extrajudicial executions, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=580.0s)]
*  rape and sexual assault, severe physical injury to civilians, confinement of civilian population in [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=588.16s)]
*  ghetto areas, forcible removal, displacement and deportation of civilian population, deliberate [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=595.12s)]
*  military attacks or threats of attacks on civilians and civilian areas, the use of civilians as human [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=602.16s)]
*  shields, the destruction of property, the robbery of personal property and attacks on hospitals, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=608.8s)]
*  medical personnel and locations within the Red Cross or Red Crescent emblem among others. So [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=614.88s)]
*  all of which I think we can safely say we have witnessed in just recent months, let alone kind of [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=622.7199999999999s)]
*  previously, and although ethnic cleansing itself hasn't been recognised as an independent crime, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=630.7199999999999s)]
*  forcible transfer, which clearly this is by creating those coercive, that coercive environment where [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=637.12s)]
*  people's homes have been reduced to rubble, the civic infrastructure has been destroyed, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=645.36s)]
*  we cannot assume that this is simply a plan to rebuild Gaza and have an interim measure, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=652.5600000000001s)]
*  as is now being claimed, where Palestinians will be relocated and then can later return. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=662.4s)]
*  We know what happens to Palestinians when they're forcibly displaced. It happened in 1948, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=669.6s)]
*  it happened in 1967 and it's been happening all the way through since the establishment of Israel [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=676.48s)]
*  because essentially they are operating where they want the maximum land with the minimum number of [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=683.36s)]
*  Palestinians. I mean that point there in terms of how this so-called plan has been framed, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=690.48s)]
*  in terms of just the media's failure to discuss intent and very clearly explicitly stated intent. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=698.0s)]
*  Back in December 2023, I did a video for this channel which was entitled, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=704.3199999999999s)]
*  Where are the headlines about this? and it was about the proposals by Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=709.92s)]
*  to remove the population of Gaza. He talked about finding, he said the problem was finding other [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=716.48s)]
*  countries to accept it and they were talking that his advice about thinning out the population of [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=722.0s)]
*  Gaza, but that wasn't reported almost anywhere. That's been the problem hasn't it? Well there's [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=726.56s)]
*  lots of problems, but it's very rare for intent to actually be so explicitly spoken and yet you [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=732.4s)]
*  almost, this is portrayed as part of what came out of nowhere, when actually it has been Israel's [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=738.0s)]
*  repeatedly stated plan, it's just that's not been reflected in the BBC coverage or any other, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=742.56s)]
*  the vast majority of Western coverage at all. Absolutely, I mean on the same day as Israel's [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=747.52s)]
*  military evacuation in order to the entire population of northern Gaza, back in October [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=752.72s)]
*  actually 2023, an Israeli intelligence ministry's document as you rightly refer was leaked to the [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=758.96s)]
*  media and it referred very clearly to the expulsion of all Palestinians from Gaza and then talked about [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=768.0s)]
*  moving the population forcibly, so that those plans were at an official level, it was clear, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=774.4s)]
*  but even if we're not looking at those plans, we had Israel's ministry of energy and infrastructure [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=780.96s)]
*  saying all civilian population in Gaza is ordered to leave immediately, we will win, they will not [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=787.6800000000001s)]
*  receive a drop of water or a single battery until they leave the world. It's not subtle. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=794.1600000000001s)]
*  It's not subtle and also it has been happening hand in hand, the mass displacement in Gaza has [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=802.88s)]
*  been coinciding with increased settler and military attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank as well, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=809.2s)]
*  where Israel has also been accelerating the colonisation of Palestinian land. Its intent [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=817.5200000000001s)]
*  is very clear, it's made it very clear and it is exceptionally disingenuous to say otherwise. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=824.48s)]
*  I just want to put on another clip, this is you on the BBC actually, it's in mid-January, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=836.48s)]
*  let me just show everyone this clip. Clearly this ceasefire deal is both imperative and very long [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=841.6s)]
*  overdue, so really my first thoughts are for the people in Gaza. Preservation of life is the number [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=848.0s)]
*  one priority and after 15 months of genocidal assault, treating the injured, the starving, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=857.36s)]
*  those in need of medical attention, mental health care and the recovery of countless bodies buried [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=863.6s)]
*  under more than 42 million tonnes of rubble is absolutely essential. I don't want to go down the [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=870.32s)]
*  avenue around genocide, we know of that case being brought, we know about what Israel has said [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=877.2s)]
*  disputing that. Let's just stick on where we are today and some of the issues that we need to focus [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=883.12s)]
*  upon in the coming days, weeks and months, the humanitarian work first of all. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=889.44s)]
*  Mason- So it's really striking there that the presenter says, I don't want to go down the [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=894.8000000000001s)]
*  avenue around genocide. I mean, sorry, what a sentence by the way. It's just when you read, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=898.96s)]
*  I'd just be fascinated if, you know, I've met him, this presenter, I've chatted to him. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=904.48s)]
*  But just to read that sentence back and ask if someone's proud of having used that form of [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=909.12s)]
*  language. I mean, you know, you've got genocide scholars, preeminent genocide scholars around the [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=914.8s)]
*  world who've said this is genocide, human rights organisations, Amnesty International, there's a [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=920.88s)]
*  live genocide case at the International Court, we could go on. You know, just to dismiss that when [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=926.3199999999999s)]
*  it's clearly a mainstream respectable view on the BBC, what do you think about that in terms of how [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=933.28s)]
*  that's framed? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=939.76s)]
*  Kate- Well, I think we shouldn't underestimate the extent to which [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=941.76s)]
*  Britain is not simply a passive observer here. Britain is actively collaborating in the assault [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=948.16s)]
*  or has actively participated with military and diplomatic support. And the BBC's coverage is [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=956.16s)]
*  reflecting that. And instead of participating in the dehumanisation and dispossession of [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=965.76s)]
*  Palestinians and inactive genocide, actually, the UK government has a very, very clear [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=971.76s)]
*  duty to address the root causes of injustice, to take its full obligations under international [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=978.64s)]
*  law into account. And that really means, you know, not only supporting those institutions [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=985.52s)]
*  and international institutions that have issued arrest warrants for Israeli leaders, it also means [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=994.16s)]
*  supporting the genocide case against Israel at the ICCJ, and also the advisory opinion for Israel [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1003.36s)]
*  regarding its need to withdraw immediately from all occupied territories. And so I think the BBC's [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1011.28s)]
*  coverage is really reflecting the fact that Britain is essentially an aggressor against the [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1019.52s)]
*  Palestinian people. But it's not being explicit about the fact that Britain has essentially been [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1027.12s)]
*  at war on the Palestinian people and has not only allowed Israel to unleash the full force of its [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1034.6399999999999s)]
*  military by standing by as a passive observer, but has actually provided the military support for it [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1041.2s)]
*  to continue to do so. The BBC, the British Palestinian Committee, has written a letter [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1048.56s)]
*  signed by your director, Dr Sarah Husseini, to Keir Starmer, following, of course, President [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1055.76s)]
*  Trump's statements. And that includes, for example, urging the government to swiftly and [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1063.9199999999998s)]
*  unilaterally condemn those plans, as well as including the prospect of US occupation of Gaza [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1068.24s)]
*  and the Israeli annexation of the West Bank, as well as ethnic cleansing, take immediate steps to [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1073.84s)]
*  end military, economic and diplomatic support for Israel as a matter of legal obligation. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1077.36s)]
*  Joining the international coalition, as you mentioned, they are opposed to those plans that [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1081.84s)]
*  alienate the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, seek accountability for all crimes in [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1085.04s)]
*  violation of international law, as well as third party obligations, the ICJ advising opinion on [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1089.1999999999998s)]
*  the legal consequences, as you said there. In terms of where the government's at, because the [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1095.1999999999998s)]
*  government will come back here, well look, we've suspended 8% of arms sales. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1101.44s)]
*  They're still supplying, for example, crucial components for the F-35 jets, which are raining [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1109.8400000000001s)]
*  death and destruction. But what do you think in terms of why the BBC, just it was important to [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1113.6000000000001s)]
*  write this letter now and where the government's at, given what you just said there? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1119.2s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think it's very clear where the government is at. Keir Starmer didn't directly [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1124.0800000000002s)]
*  criticise Trump's plans. He dodged the question. He has undermined international law frequently in [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1128.32s)]
*  recent months with very equivocal statements. And, you know, kind of responses have to be [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1135.52s)]
*  dragged out of the government with regard to international law. There are no current signs [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1141.4399999999998s)]
*  that his government's got any intention of ending its military support and economic cooperation with [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1147.04s)]
*  Israel, as it is duty bound to do so, under a number of international treaties, including [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1153.28s)]
*  the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide, to which the UK is a signatory. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1160.0s)]
*  And it's really important to note that that obligation is not a passive obligation. It is an [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1166.16s)]
*  active obligation. The UK must do everything it possibly can to ensure that it prevents and [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1174.48s)]
*  punishes the crime of genocide, which makes it all the more egregious that he is seeming to continue [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1181.04s)]
*  without any intention of ending military and economic cooperation. And I think, I mean, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1191.76s)]
*  the other thing that he did say, just to go back to the issue of ethnic cleansing, he did say in [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1199.52s)]
*  parliament that Palestinians must be allowed home. But he certainly didn't, he meant they must be [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1206.56s)]
*  allowed to go back to their homes in Gaza. And I think it's very important to remember that 80% [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1213.84s)]
*  of the population of Gaza are refugees who were ethnically cleansed during the establishment of [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1220.32s)]
*  Israel. And they do indeed have a right of return to their original homes. And that was actually a [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1226.1599999999999s)]
*  point made by Palestine's ambassador to the United Nations. He said that if, you know, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1232.56s)]
*  Trump was talking about a nice, beautiful piece of land, and he said, well, that could be to those [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1237.84s)]
*  parts of Israel. People often don't realize, as you said, the vast majority of people in Gaza, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1242.72s)]
*  that's where they were driven to. I mean, just, I guess, just finally, I mean, this is, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1246.96s)]
*  you know, a hideous moment in what has been, well, it's not just the hideous moments in 7th [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1256.56s)]
*  October, decades, as you know, generations of horror. I mean, do you feel now, I mean, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1263.44s)]
*  it looks so bleak in so many levels, but in some way, it looks like a floundering, declining [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1270.24s)]
*  superpower, the United States. This is kind of a morbid symptom of its decay in some ways. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1276.08s)]
*  But that public opinion has shifted quite dramatically in lots of Western states. You [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1282.48s)]
*  know, too many people have seen things they can't unsee, unheard things they can't unhear, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1287.12s)]
*  read things they can't unread. Do you think that, do you feel that there is, you know, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1291.28s)]
*  that this public pressure is growing to a level where, not in the here and now, you can't see [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1297.44s)]
*  someone like Trump shifting because of it, but that actually, you know, there have been so many [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1303.36s)]
*  attempts to obliterate the Palestinian people and the Palestinian people remain, that actually, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1309.44s)]
*  this is not going to end well for Israel. What do you think about that? [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1315.44s)]
*  Well, I think the, you're absolutely right. I think there has been a massive groundswell [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1321.1200000000001s)]
*  of support for Palestinians, which our political leaders are choosing to ignore. But, you know, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1327.2s)]
*  people have really come out in protest time and time again. They have continued to speak out. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1334.0s)]
*  At the Cannes, we have been inundated with people wanting to learn more about Palestine, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1342.64s)]
*  wanting to really ensure that they have the skills and the confidence to talk about Palestine and [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1348.32s)]
*  the knowledge base. And people are very motivated. And there are a lot of people also who have [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1354.48s)]
*  responded to the mainstream media who aren't engaged necessarily in the cause, but have seen [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1362.32s)]
*  the images and heard what is being said at the same time. And some think there's this absolute [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1369.12s)]
*  disconnect between what they understand. And I think the mainstream media really has been [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1375.84s)]
*  underestimating its audiences in thinking that they can't actually see what is happening. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1382.1599999999999s)]
*  Having said all of that, I also just want to really pay tribute to the extraordinary people [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1388.48s)]
*  of Gaza, who I think are teaching us what it is to be a community. I think it is seeing the images [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1398.64s)]
*  of people walking back to their homes, seeing the way that actually the community have continued, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1410.96s)]
*  not just to survive over these horrific months, but they have continued to try and work together [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1419.2s)]
*  and to continue to prove themselves to be a community. It's not just about land. It's about [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1428.48s)]
*  a people who are absolutely, their generosity to each other in this moment, in the face of [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1437.52s)]
*  a world which I'm sorry, but their experience has shown a mirror to a very ugly world which has not [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1448.72s)]
*  stepped up in ensuring that they have a future that is rooted in freedom and justice and dignity. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1454.6399999999999s)]
*  But we can see how the people of Gaza are determined to create that for themselves. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1465.68s)]
*  Amen. Yeah, the people of Gaza have reminded us what it is to be human in a world of grotesque [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1473.8400000000001s)]
*  inhumanity. Please everyone do check out Makan by the way, Makan.org.uk. I'll include that in the [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1479.28s)]
*  description so people can check it out. As they know, on the website providing transformative [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1485.92s)]
*  education to strengthen the movement for Palestinian liberation, it's to give people that confidence [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1490.3200000000002s)]
*  to speak about it because obviously I think what prevents many people from speaking out is a fear [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1494.0s)]
*  of the smears people get, they're being stigmatized, of you know, being gaslit, of not having the tools [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1499.9199999999998s)]
*  to be able to stand your ground and to speak the truth and to be bullied into submission. And it's [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1508.1599999999999s)]
*  important that people learn, not least of course, from Palestinians themselves who've been erased [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1514.9599999999998s)]
*  and airbrushed out of this horror and then gaslit when they're on television. So please like and [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1520.56s)]
*  subscribe, leave comments, that's all good for the algorithm, then more people will listen and engage [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1528.88s)]
*  and hear from Amy, that's the whole point of the exercise. But Amy, thank you so much for everything [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1533.68s)]
*  you've done and for your voice, your eloquence, your clarity in the face of, you know, unbelievable [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1536.88s)]
*  horror, including from my beloved colleagues in the British media. So thank you so much. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1544.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaHgWTZtiw&t=1552.8s)]
