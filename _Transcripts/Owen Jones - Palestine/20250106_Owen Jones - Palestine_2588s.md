# Patreon version - Is Owen Jones A STOOGE Of Israel?: He Responds To The Claims
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk)
*  Okay, buckling guys, because this is going to be a long video. Now, first of all, here's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=0.0s)]
*  what I want to talk about this channel. Right now, above all else, I want to talk about [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=5.08s)]
*  Israel's genocide against the Palestinian people, which is being enabled, indeed facilitated [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=9.08s)]
*  by Western governments. I want to talk about the rise of fascism in the West and beyond. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=14.92s)]
*  I want to talk about other injustices too. And I want to platform more compelling voices [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=19.92s)]
*  than my own who are otherwise erased by our dire mainstream media. Here's what I don't [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=25.04s)]
*  want to talk about. Me. I'm not that interesting. And it is a distraction from all of that. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=32.12s)]
*  Alas, sometimes it's necessary. And sometimes it can be useful and indeed clarifying to [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=38.56s)]
*  bring out and talk about political themes. In this case, just indulge me. Now there are, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=44.28s)]
*  put it this way, criticisms about my record on the question of Palestine, which are circulating. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=50.16s)]
*  So what I'm going to do is state the facts about that record. And look, first of all, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=56.32s)]
*  it's really important for me to state I should be criticised and scrutinised. I get things [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=61.32s)]
*  wrong. I make mistakes, sometimes big mistakes. I've been around as a writer with a public [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=66.12s)]
*  platform since I was in my mid twenties. I'm now a geriatric millennial who's 40. So when [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=71.12s)]
*  I learn, make mistakes, go on journeys, I do that in public. That said, the critique [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=77.76s)]
*  I'm going to take on head on is that I am some sort of raging Zionist, a champion of [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=83.4s)]
*  Israel, someone who doesn't really support the Palestinian cause and has no history of [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=89.24000000000001s)]
*  doing so. One colourful influencer has been in touch to suggest that I have made a career [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  off shilling for Zionism, that I helped cause the genocide and I am specifically responsible [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  for the slaughter of Palestinian children. Well, as you'll see, I believe this is a [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=104.72s)]
*  straightforward erasure of the truth and of history. As I will show this critique comes [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=110.4s)]
*  from the sort of people who lie by omission, erase the work I've done, twist what I say, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=114.88s)]
*  take things out of context and just make things up. As I'll show, whatever my failings, I [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=118.56s)]
*  have a record of consistency. Many of the things you hear me say now in 2025 are the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=124.44s)]
*  exact same things I was saying when I first started writing in newspapers and going on [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=128.04s)]
*  TV a decade and a half ago. Indeed, since my public career for World of a Better Term [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=131.88s)]
*  began in 2011, I've had these consistent positions on Palestine. Opposition to Israel's [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=137.64s)]
*  brutal occupation, to the barbaric siege of Gaza, to the illegal settlements. I've consistently [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=143.24s)]
*  supported sanctions, including a total arms embargo on Israel. I've supported specific [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=148.84s)]
*  boycotts. I've called out the criminal complicity of Western leaders and consistently challenged [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=153.56s)]
*  the role of the Western media. I've consistently opposed the claim this is a conflict or a [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=157.52s)]
*  war given its asymmetrical nature. An occupier backed and armed to the teeth by the West [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=162.84s)]
*  versus a besieged and occupied people subjected to extreme deprivation. I've consistently [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=170.24s)]
*  not just advocated obviously for an independent homeland for the Palestinian people, but even [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=176.16000000000003s)]
*  proposed a one state solution based on democracy and equal rights for all citizens, whoever [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=180.72s)]
*  they are, who live in Palestine. Have my positions firmed up? Absolutely, as I'll [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=185.52s)]
*  discuss, but as a show, it's a lie to suggest I've ever used my platform for anything other [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=189.12s)]
*  than support for the Palestinian cause. Now let's just start back in 2012 when I was [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  28 years old. As you'll see, twink death is real. Now I became known for my commentary [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  in British politics in particular. My first two books were Chavs, The Demonisation of [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=202.76000000000002s)]
*  the Working Class and The Establishment and How They Get Away With It, both of which were [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  attempts to communicate class politics to a mass audience. My stick has always been [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=211.28s)]
*  socialism for normies, for want of a better term. I don't use normies in a pejorative [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=215.8s)]
*  way. I mean the non normies, the political loser weirdos like myself trying to reach [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=219.44s)]
*  beyond that. Anyway, nonetheless, the first appearance I had on television, which went [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=225.84s)]
*  viral was about Gaza back in 2012. It was on BBC's Question Time, which is the BBC's [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=232.48s)]
*  flagship political debate programme. Back then, at least, that had millions of viewers. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=239.28s)]
*  It was during Israel's murderous 2012 onslaught against Gaza. As you listen to what I say, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=242.88s)]
*  you will hear me say, making the same exact arguments I make today. I began by taking [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=249.04s)]
*  on the now late Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy, who had made his name opposing the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=254.08s)]
*  invasion of Iraq, but had given a dire platitudinous response on Israel's war crimes. Let's have [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=260.0s)]
*  a listen. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=265.36s)]
*  I'm actually disappointed by that response, Charles, in all honesty. Let's be absolutely [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=267.0s)]
*  clear about what happened. Firstly, this whole idea that Gaza, that Hamas broke the ceasefire, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=274.6s)]
*  is just not true. In fact, it was broken after, in October, Israel killed 15 Palestinian fighters, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=280.04s)]
*  they shot dead a mentally disabled Palestinian, they killed another 13-year-old in an intrusion, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=287.16s)]
*  and when there was an attempt to actually get a ceasefire, negotiations were ongoing, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=292.8s)]
*  that is when they assassinated Ahmed Jabari, at completely ending those ceasefire talks. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=296.32s)]
*  Now, it is often said, and Barack Obama made this point, he said, what country on earth [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=301.84000000000003s)]
*  would tolerate rockets being fired at them? I ask you this, what people on earth would [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=305.8s)]
*  tolerate a siege which stops basic supplies getting in, an occupation, a 45-year-old occupation, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=311.88s)]
*  a brutal occupation at that, illegal settlements all over the West Bank which are in total [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=321.68s)]
*  violation of international law, and what we've seen in the course of this onslaught are the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=327.32s)]
*  deaths of 158 Palestinians, at least 30 of Hema children, and I don't want to just throw [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=334.32s)]
*  statistics around, I'll give you one example of one of those children, Omar Mishirin, he [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=340.12s)]
*  was 11 months old, he was the little boy, the son of a BBC journalist, and he was killed [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=344.4s)]
*  in a so-called targeted strike. Now, we all want a secure and lasting peace. When we have [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=349.56s)]
*  Israeli ministers, like the interior minister, calling for Gaza to be sent back to the Middle [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=355.35999999999996s)]
*  Ages, when in the last offensive we had another minister calling for a holocaust to be afflicted [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=359.76s)]
*  on Gaza, when we have the son of Ariel Sharon, who wrote in the Jerusalem Post talking about [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=365.76s)]
*  how Nagasaki and Hiroshima were solutions, possible solutions to be inflicted, when we [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=373.15999999999997s)]
*  have those people we won't get a secure peace, but the way we will get it for Arabs and Jews [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=379.04s)]
*  alike to end the occupation, end the siege of Gaza, and dismantle the illegal settlements, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=382.72s)]
*  and finally have a just settlement for the Palestinian people, ensuring peace for Arabs [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=388.84000000000003s)]
*  and Jews and the region as a whole. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=393.32000000000005s)]
*  I think part of the problem is that people like O-In should actually keep their nose [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=398.32s)]
*  out of something that they have no intimate knowledge of and that they jump on the bandwagon [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=411.0s)]
*  of this anti-American, ultra-left, Israel-bashing that is fashionable at the moment. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=416.28s)]
*  As you can hear, what I'm trying to do is shift the conversation from the perspective [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=423.28s)]
*  of Israel to the perspective of the Palestinian people, to centre their suffering, to emphasise [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=426.24s)]
*  the genocide or rhetoric emanating from Israel, to conclude there would never be peace until [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=431.38s)]
*  Israel's oppression of the Palestinian people was dismantled. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=437.3s)]
*  I then made the case for a one-state solution based on equal rights for all, which has always [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=440.08s)]
*  been my preferred solution, but I'll come on to that. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=445.24s)]
*  You can listen to that here. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=448.34000000000003s)]
*  The crucial point you're making is about the existence of those settlements, and I [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=449.34000000000003s)]
*  country on earth would be allowed to flout international law in the way that Israel has [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=453.16s)]
*  done for decades. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=457.28000000000003s)]
*  I'll answer her question. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=458.28000000000003s)]
*  Her question. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=459.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, the key point there... [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=460.28000000000003s)]
*  You heard what she said, which was that the number of people who have now settled in West [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=461.28000000000003s)]
*  Bank make the two-state solution practically impossible. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=465.98s)]
*  There are two possible solutions. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=468.44000000000005s)]
*  One is to have a federal solution where you have equal rights for both Arabs and Jews. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=470.0s)]
*  That seems to many people obviously far-fetched, but they did say that about South Africa back [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=473.92s)]
*  in the day. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=477.84000000000003s)]
*  Otherwise, you have to dismantle the settlements, enforce international law, but what has to [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=478.84s)]
*  happen because the point is Britain supports, as other Western countries do, they've supported [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=483.88s)]
*  and armed Israel to the teeth. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=489.67999999999995s)]
*  They're not acting as honest brokers. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=491.67999999999995s)]
*  They have to use their pressure to force Israel to give in and give justice to the Palestinian [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=493.64s)]
*  people. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=497.67999999999995s)]
*  What I tried to do there was take on the sense that a single-state solution was somehow utopian [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=498.67999999999995s)]
*  or extreme by pointing to the precedent of South Africa and the end of apartheid. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=502.67999999999995s)]
*  That's what I've always tried to do. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=507.28s)]
*  I've tried to make radical ideas accessible, palatable. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=508.96s)]
*  That's what I was trying to do. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=513.76s)]
*  Now, let me just be frank. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=514.76s)]
*  At the time, during that onslaught against Gaza, very few people made those arguments [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=515.76s)]
*  on television. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=522.3199999999999s)]
*  When I say very few, I mean almost no one. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=523.3199999999999s)]
*  It was even worse than it is today. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=526.12s)]
*  You certainly didn't get others making the case for a single democratic state, which [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=528.04s)]
*  was even more light years outside of the Overtoun window than today. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=532.64s)]
*  I'd also say there weren't extremely compelling voices, far more compelling than my own. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=536.04s)]
*  They were just barred from going on television. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=539.7199999999999s)]
*  It's important I make that point. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=541.4399999999999s)]
*  Inevitably, I came under attack because of this performance, including from Douglas [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=543.3199999999999s)]
*  Murray in the Hard Right Spectator magazine, which became something of a theme, as you [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=547.48s)]
*  will see. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=552.8s)]
*  When Israel unleashed its murderous onslaught against Gaza in 2014, I similarly used my [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=554.42s)]
*  platform in The Guardian just after I joined that newspaper. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=559.24s)]
*  Some of you may know about my recent exposé of the BBC's coverage of Israel's genocide [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=562.44s)]
*  today, which I wrote for DropSight News. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=567.96s)]
*  I was continuing there a theme I've stuck out for a long time. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=571.84s)]
*  The article was written the morning after Israel's onslaught against Gaza began. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=575.72s)]
*  To pull the curtain back a bit, I had to fight to write that. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=581.6s)]
*  The view was my beat was domestic British politics rather than say Palestine. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=584.08s)]
*  I had to fight hard to keep my central arguments intact. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=588.36s)]
*  One of the reasons I launched this YouTube channel in November 2020 is because I wanted [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=592.36s)]
*  to have total editorial control over what I talked about. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=597.6s)]
*  The article opened with, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=599.96s)]
*  Israel under renewed Hamas attack. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=602.0s)]
*  This was last night's BBC headline on the escalating bloodshed in Gaza. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=604.4s)]
*  It is as perverse as Mike Tyson punching a toddler followed by a headline claiming that [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=608.6800000000001s)]
*  the child spattered him. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=613.72s)]
*  As I wrote in the article, the macabre truth is that Israeli life is deemed by the Western [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=616.0s)]
*  media to be worth more than a Palestinian life. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=620.36s)]
*  Here is the hierarchy of death at work. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=623.72s)]
*  According to the Israeli human rights organisation, Bezalem, 565 Palestinians have been killed [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=625.6800000000001s)]
*  by Israeli security forces since January 2009, while 28 Israeli civilians and 10 Israeli [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=630.6s)]
*  security personnel have been killed. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=636.46s)]
*  The asymmetry of this so-called conflict is reflected in the death toll, but it is not [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=638.6800000000001s)]
*  reflected in the coverage. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=643.44s)]
*  That's what I wrote. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=644.44s)]
*  I noted how the Western media erased Israel's killing of six Palestinians, all of them a [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=645.44s)]
*  child in the West Bank. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=649.48s)]
*  I then dissected Israel's lies about the reasons they killed those Palestinians and [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=650.76s)]
*  I concluded the BBC is a public broadcaster duty bound to provide balanced reports that [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=655.6s)]
*  accurately reflect the reality on the ground. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=660.6s)]
*  It is failing to do so and it is up to licensed pairs to whom it is accountable to man that [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=662.52s)]
*  it does. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=667.8000000000001s)]
*  Now, in other words, the long investigative expose I just published about the BBC's coverage [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=668.8000000000001s)]
*  of Israel and Palestine built on a critique that I have pushed for a very long time. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=673.6s)]
*  Now, during Israel's 2014 onslaught against Gaza, I actively took part in the protests. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=679.12s)]
*  I spoke at those protests. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=684.08s)]
*  Again, I used my platform to make the same arguments, the exact same arguments you've [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=685.48s)]
*  heard me make during this genocide over and over again. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=689.6s)]
*  This was July 2014. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=693.76s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=695.8000000000001s)]
*  Israel is armed to the teeth and backed by our Western governments. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=696.8000000000001s)]
*  They are complicit. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=701.8000000000001s)]
*  They are complicit with every death, with every maiming. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=703.8000000000001s)]
*  With every single attack. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=709.1999999999999s)]
*  And that is why we're out with such numbers, not just against the Israeli government, but [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=711.1999999999999s)]
*  against our own governments for their role in this massacre. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=717.64s)]
*  So friends, just to end, this is our message to the Palestinian people. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=722.64s)]
*  However lonely it may feel, however no overwhelming the odds, you have the hearts of billions [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=728.64s)]
*  of people across the world. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=734.88s)]
*  And we will never, ever, ever give up on you. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=738.88s)]
*  Free, free Palestine! [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=744.88s)]
*  And then I spoke again at the protest against Israel's onslaught. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=746.88s)]
*  When I was bit at PSE in August 2014, again, here are the same arguments I make today. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=751.88s)]
*  In one month, in one month, one in every 1,000 Gazans were murdered by the Israeli state. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=756.88s)]
*  That is a statistic as horrifying as it gets. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=768.88s)]
*  Because this is not a conflict. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=773.88s)]
*  This is not a war. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=776.88s)]
*  This is a massacre. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=778.88s)]
*  A massacre by the occupier against the occupied. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=781.88s)]
*  Now critics often tell us this. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=786.88s)]
*  They say in a world of such suffering, in a world of such bloodshed, why aren't we out [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=789.88s)]
*  marching about Syria and Iraq? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=796.96s)]
*  And we do stand in solidarity with Syrians. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=799.96s)]
*  We do stand in solidarity with Iraqis. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=802.96s)]
*  But here is the key point to make. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=805.96s)]
*  Here is the key point. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=808.96s)]
*  Our governments fund, arm and support Israel. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=810.96s)]
*  They are complicit with every single Israeli attack. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=816.96s)]
*  With every single naming. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=822.96s)]
*  With every single death. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=826.0400000000001s)]
*  And we will march until our governments stop arming and supporting the Israeli occupation. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=829.0400000000001s)]
*  That is why I am here. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=837.0400000000001s)]
*  Now friends, remember, remember apartheid in South Africa. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=840.0400000000001s)]
*  Remember how strong it seemed. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=847.0400000000001s)]
*  Remember how well armed. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=850.0400000000001s)]
*  Remember how invincible. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=852.0400000000001s)]
*  Did apartheid not fall? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=855.12s)]
*  As apartheid fell, the occupation of Palestine will fall as well. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=860.12s)]
*  That is a certainty. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=868.12s)]
*  The West must stop arming Israel. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=870.12s)]
*  The siege of Gaza must end. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=874.12s)]
*  Every soldier must leave. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=878.12s)]
*  The arguments again I made in support of Palestine led to further attack from, you guessed it, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=881.2s)]
*  Douglas Murray for example, in The Spectator who wrote in an article in August 2014 which [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=885.2s)]
*  headlined Owen Jones' lying about Israel, plain and simple. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=890.2s)]
*  He denounced me for suggesting that the real threat of antisemitism, the major threat of [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=895.2s)]
*  antisemitism came from the far right, the rising far right. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=899.2s)]
*  I said the far right was rising. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=902.2s)]
*  I think that's been pretty vindicated. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=903.2s)]
*  He said it was spearheaded by young Muslims and he said, outrageously, that I continued [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=905.2s)]
*  to share antisemitism at the same time assiduously feeding it, cynically conflating critique [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=910.2800000000001s)]
*  of Israel's crimes and antisemitism, accusing me of painting the background against which [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=915.2800000000001s)]
*  acts of violence against Jews took place, pointing for example to how I condemned Israel [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=919.2800000000001s)]
*  from the massacre of children, declaring that I revealed the moral sickness of a portion [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=925.2800000000001s)]
*  of the left. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=929.2800000000001s)]
*  Clearly the sort of attack you get from Israel's apologists when you oppose terrible crimes [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=930.2800000000001s)]
*  being committed against the Palestinian people. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=933.2800000000001s)]
*  The shameful, in my view, conflation of antisemitism with critiquing Israel's crimes, which is [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=935.2800000000001s)]
*  completely irresponsible given the real danger of antisemitism. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=939.36s)]
*  But those are attacks I've always been on the receiving end because of the position [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=942.36s)]
*  that I take on Palestine. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=947.36s)]
*  Now, in September 2014, I took part in a debate organised, again, by the Palestine Solidarity [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=949.36s)]
*  campaign about the BBC's dire coverage of Palestine alongside the film director Ken [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=953.36s)]
*  Loach. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=958.36s)]
*  Again, that theme that I would keep returning to. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=959.36s)]
*  Unfortunately, the videos it appears are no longer available, which is a shame in terms [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=961.36s)]
*  of the videos of the discussion. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=966.44s)]
*  I carried on using my platform to support the Palestine Solidarity campaign as best [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=968.44s)]
*  I could and their brilliant work, speaking alongside Omar Barghouti, the co-founder of [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=973.44s)]
*  the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement in March 2015, which I will come on to. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=977.44s)]
*  Now, later that year, Jeremy Corbyn stood to be leader of the Labour Party. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=982.44s)]
*  Now, there are legitimate criticisms of my position in the Corbyn era. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=986.44s)]
*  I'll come on to that. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=990.44s)]
*  When he stood to be leader in 2015, I campaigned for him, writing my column for the Guardian [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=991.44s)]
*  on the day he launched his leadership bid with the peace headline, Jeremy Corbyn is [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=995.5200000000001s)]
*  in the leadership, the Labour leadership race. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1000.5200000000001s)]
*  The real debate starts here. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1002.5200000000001s)]
*  Indeed, I recommended him partly on the ground as he was. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1006.5200000000001s)]
*  And I quote from the article, a proponent of peace and a staunch internationalist. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1009.5200000000001s)]
*  And I spoke at rallies in support of his bid across the country. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1013.5200000000001s)]
*  This isn't simply about one man. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1025.52s)]
*  This isn't just about the party leadership. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1034.52s)]
*  This is about building a bottom up grassroots movement to change this island and fight for [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1037.52s)]
*  social justice. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1044.52s)]
*  And every single person in this room has a role to play in all of that. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1045.52s)]
*  Indeed, I went on television to make the case for him over and over and over again. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1050.52s)]
*  The reason he's doing very well is because he has an optimistic vision, unlike many of his rivals. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1054.6s)]
*  The thing about him, I think, is he's become a bit of a rock star in political terms. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1060.6s)]
*  People don't normally queue to see politicians. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1064.6s)]
*  Owen Mark II, the point I was making was that actually what really resonated... [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1066.6s)]
*  Well, you are older than me, so yes, Mark. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1070.6s)]
*  Blimey, OK. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1071.6s)]
*  All right, all right. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1072.6s)]
*  All right, boys, all right. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1073.6s)]
*  Some age better than others. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1074.6s)]
*  I think the reason Jeremy Corbyn is doing so well and his opponents are on the back foot [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1075.6s)]
*  is he has an optimistic vision. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1079.6s)]
*  In that summer of 2015, a smear campaign was directed against him. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1081.6799999999998s)]
*  I wrote a piece for the New Statesman in August, in fact, headlined if Jeremy Corbyn wins, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1085.6799999999998s)]
*  prepare for a firestorm. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1090.6799999999998s)]
*  But I specifically defended Corbyn over attacks about his campaigning for Palestine in August [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1092.6799999999998s)]
*  2015, writing a piece headlined Stand By for more attacks on Corbyn's principled foreign [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1096.6799999999998s)]
*  policy stance, noting he was vindicated over the Iraq War. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1102.6799999999998s)]
*  He was coming under attack because he'd spoken at pro-Palestine events where he'd met or [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1105.6799999999998s)]
*  shared a platform with the Holocaust Nire. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1110.76s)]
*  Obviously, he did not know that. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1112.76s)]
*  Anyone who knows Jeremy Corbyn knows he would abhor anyone with those hateful views. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1114.76s)]
*  As I wrote in the piece, as somebody spends a lot of time speaking at events ranging from [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1121.76s)]
*  conferences to protests, though nowhere near as much as Corbyn has done over several decades, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1125.76s)]
*  I know how absurdly impractically it would be to research the backgrounds of every other [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1130.76s)]
*  participant. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1134.76s)]
*  Corbyn himself abhors anti-Semitism and anti-racism is central to his political DNA. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1135.76s)]
*  I added the minority who were anti-Semites like this individual weren't representative [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1139.84s)]
*  of the Palestine justice movement and had to be unequivocally challenged and driven [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1143.84s)]
*  out. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1146.84s)]
*  Which is of course true. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1147.84s)]
*  In 2016, I wrote a column in support of boycotts against Israel's occupation and against attempts [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1149.84s)]
*  by the Conservative government to criminalise them, headlined Boycotts are vital to democracy [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1154.84s)]
*  so that's why the Tories will ban them, in which I quoted a Jewish peace activist opposing [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1158.84s)]
*  the cynical conflation of Israel and Jewish people, in which I added, he's surely right [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1162.84s)]
*  in believing that the government is using the deadly serious issue of anti-Semitism [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1168.9199999999998s)]
*  to close down activism centred on the policies of Israel's government. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1172.9199999999998s)]
*  Now come on to the scrutiny that is valid, but what became known as, in inverted quotes, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1178.9199999999998s)]
*  as the anti-Semitism crisis really came into its own in 2018 and this was a devastating [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1183.9199999999998s)]
*  onslaught, a destabilising onslaught against the Labour leadership and anyone seen to be [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1189.9199999999998s)]
*  supportive of the leadership, which of course included myself. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1193.9199999999998s)]
*  The position I took, I summed up at the time, is walking and chewing gum, which is to say [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1197.0s)]
*  that Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour leadership and the vast majority of Labour membership [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1201.0s)]
*  abhorred anti-Semitism, that anti-Semitism is real and an evil, that it existed in society [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1205.0s)]
*  and on a fringe of the left and that it had to be opposed. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1210.0s)]
*  Don't apologise for that position because I believe in it, I think it's the correct [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1214.0s)]
*  position. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1218.0s)]
*  So that meant I went on TV and defended Jeremy Corbyn's leadership against smears, including [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1219.0s)]
*  one such smear in the Murdoch media in the spring of 2018. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1224.08s)]
*  Have a listen. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1228.08s)]
*  Firstly, those in the Labour party, including the Labour leadership, anti-racism was one [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1230.08s)]
*  of their defining causes. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1235.08s)]
*  In the 1980s they were portrayed as the loony left, politically correct, shutting down free [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1236.08s)]
*  speech because of that anti-racism. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1242.08s)]
*  What does that got to do with the anti-Semitism? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1243.08s)]
*  It's to do with the fact that there's an attempt to link the minority, the despicable [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1245.08s)]
*  minority, who will be drummed out of the Labour movement and the left, the anti-Semites, the [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1248.08s)]
*  bigots, who have nothing to do with socialism, to link that to the Labour leadership. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1253.1599999999999s)]
*  You know what's happening, you know what that front page splash is all about. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1257.1599999999999s)]
*  I'll give you an example, that Sunday Times blast, because you were leading on it the [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1259.1599999999999s)]
*  last hour, I did watch by the way. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1262.1599999999999s)]
*  I'm not disputing what may have been done earlier. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1264.1599999999999s)]
*  What I'm saying to you is, presumably if the Sunday Times had found any evidence that [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1266.1599999999999s)]
*  linked an individual to it, they would have gone on that. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1271.1599999999999s)]
*  What they did is went on Facebook groups with tens of thousands of members, with hundreds [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1274.1599999999999s)]
*  of thousands of posts, millions probably of comments, culminatively, found despicable [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1278.1599999999999s)]
*  racist and anti-Semitic comments, then tried to link that to the fact that there were people [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1282.24s)]
*  within the leaders office who were the most committed anti-racist I've probably ever met. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1286.24s)]
*  Look, I've got an example here, just to show how these splashes work, this so-called [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1289.24s)]
*  journalism, OK, where's your camera? [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1292.24s)]
*  This is Conservatives Against the EU, it's a Facebook group. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1294.24s)]
*  It is full of the most despicable racists. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1297.24s)]
*  And presumably the Conservative Party would reject it, wouldn't they? [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1300.24s)]
*  About Gina Miller, for example, F off you foreigner, telling them to go back to your [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1303.24s)]
*  homeland, the most despicable racists. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1308.24s)]
*  You're not making that, why isn't that? [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1310.32s)]
*  Because presumably Labour is the story at the moment. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1313.32s)]
*  As you can see, I abandoned the usual media etiquette there to defend the then Labour leadership [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1316.32s)]
*  against these attacks. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1321.32s)]
*  Not something you do, incidentally, if it's your media career that you're interested in. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1322.32s)]
*  Indeed, I got attacked as a consequence of this position in right-wing media outlets [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1326.32s)]
*  like the Sun newspaper, a gutter rag which drips with racism. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1331.32s)]
*  It wrote, Meanwhile, the Sun can reveal lefty cheerleader Owen Jones accused enemies of [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1334.32s)]
*  Mr Corbyn of weaponising anti-Semitism in an astonishing rant posted online speaking [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1338.3999999999999s)]
*  at a hard left momentum rally in Portsmouth on Thursday night. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1343.3999999999999s)]
*  The mouthy Guardian writer said only a minority of people on the left hated Jews. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1346.3999999999999s)]
*  He ranted, there is a minority of people on the left who are anti-Semitic. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1352.3999999999999s)]
*  There are also people using that and weaponising that issue to portray the whole left as anti-Semitic [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1355.3999999999999s)]
*  and that's false. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1359.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean, I think they're trying to paraphrase there, but the basic point there is obviously [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1362.3999999999999s)]
*  correct. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1367.48s)]
*  The most notorious attack in this period was called Wreathgate in which Jeremy Corbyn came [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1370.48s)]
*  under attack because he had laid a wreath in Tunisia in 2014 to remember the victims [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1375.48s)]
*  of Israel's strike on the PLO's headquarters in 1985 because he's pictured near the graves [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1379.48s)]
*  of two senior PLO figures, one of whom was one of the architects of the Munich massacre [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1384.48s)]
*  of 1972. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1388.48s)]
*  As I wrote, the smear campaign against Jeremy Corbyn over the 2014 visit to Tunisia is complete [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1389.48s)]
*  and utter bullshit. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1395.56s)]
*  And here is why. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1397.06s)]
*  That link to an entire column in the Guardian expanding on that headline, the Corbyn wreath [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1398.06s)]
*  scandal is just an exercise in hypocrisy. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1401.84s)]
*  Now, other columns are right at the time, including one headlined, Saudi Arabia and [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1405.84s)]
*  Israel are killing civilians and Britain is complicit with the subheading, the slaughter [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1410.2s)]
*  in Yemen and the Palestine territories is happening with British arms and support and [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1414.32s)]
*  media silence. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1419.64s)]
*  When Labour was pushed to adopt the so-called International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1422.36s)]
*  definition of anti-Semitism, criticised for including examples which conflated legitimate [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1425.56s)]
*  critique of Israel with anti-Semitism, I promoted the alternative new code of conduct supported [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1430.28s)]
*  by the Labour leadership, which it was fiercely attacked for. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1435.9199999999998s)]
*  Crucially I did a Guardian video interviewing a British Palestinian lawyer who set out the [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1439.6399999999999s)]
*  objections to IRA and the reason it was so important, I felt, to do that interview is [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1444.28s)]
*  because Palestinian voices were being completely erased from the so-called debate. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1449.92s)]
*  A definition of anti-Semitism, then it has 11 examples of what are anti-Semitic depending [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1454.88s)]
*  on the context. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1462.04s)]
*  Which examples are problematic? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1463.04s)]
*  From the Palestinian perspective, it really is just two of these so-called illustrative [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1464.04s)]
*  examples of anti-Semitism that we take issue with and I'm just going to read the text [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1468.8000000000002s)]
*  of them because it's easier that way. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1473.96s)]
*  The first is denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g. by claiming [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1475.6s)]
*  that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1481.0s)]
*  By saying that claiming a State of Israel is a racist endeavour is a kind of anti-Semitism, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1484.24s)]
*  we fear we'll descend into prohibiting people from being able to talk about the State of Israel. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1489.28s)]
*  That same year I kept plugging away at my betenoir, the BBC's outrageous coverage of [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1495.08s)]
*  Palestine, not least how the BBC website framed the massacre of Palestinian protesters by [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1499.28s)]
*  the Israeli state in Gaza during the great march of return. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1503.92s)]
*  In 2019 I went on BBC Radio 5 and said the idea that in any sense he's, J.B. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1509.76s)]
*  Corbyn, is anti-Semitic or racist is an astonishing, outrageous smear. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1516.16s)]
*  I couldn't get a clip of it but Five Live have kept the quote up. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1520.1200000000001s)]
*  And that year when BBC Panorama did an entire documentary suggesting Labour was anti-Semitic [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1524.1200000000001s)]
*  and racist, I called it a travesty, complete with sinister music and camera work. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1528.6s)]
*  Noting how it failed to discuss basic details like by the summer of 2016 most anti-Semitism [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1535.6799999999998s)]
*  cases predated Corbyn and criticising it for what I believe were its distortions and specifically [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1539.3999999999999s)]
*  went on TV again to make that case. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1546.52s)]
*  So it shouldn't have been broadcast? [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1548.8799999999999s)]
*  I think it should have been a balanced broadcast. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1550.6s)]
*  It should have had a range of voices. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1552.4399999999998s)]
*  It shouldn't have edited emails. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1554.1999999999998s)]
*  Why edit an email to make it look like the exact opposite? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1556.2s)]
*  Don't listen to me on this. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1559.24s)]
*  People go, well you would say that you're lefty and all the rest of it. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1560.24s)]
*  But the point is... [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1563.24s)]
*  No, no, no, this isn't what... [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1564.24s)]
*  The point is that it was a theory. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1565.24s)]
*  Now I have to say the reason I find some of the harsh criticisms I get about this period [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1567.0800000000002s)]
*  sometimes difficult to stomach is to be blunt. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1570.6000000000001s)]
*  During these moments, why was I on TV? [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1573.16s)]
*  I'll tell you why. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1575.3600000000001s)]
*  Because actual shadow cabinet members on the left didn't want to do it. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1576.3600000000001s)]
*  And I get that. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1580.28s)]
*  It's not enjoyable. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1581.28s)]
*  You get smeared, your career gets menaced, you get a tonne of death threats. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1582.28s)]
*  I think, and I still think, that basking for the truth is important. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1586.28s)]
*  But I was filling a vacuum because actual left-wing MPs did not want to go and do it. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1589.08s)]
*  Just being honest here. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1593.8s)]
*  And you know, what was important here, what should have been important, is demarcation. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1596.2s)]
*  Which is a theme I keep talking about. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1600.2s)]
*  Now some of the criticisms I've had is that I backed action taken against anti-Semitism [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1602.3600000000001s)]
*  by Jamie Corbyn's leadership and his ally, Jenny Formby. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1607.8s)]
*  He became general secretary of Labour, including suspending and removing certain members. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1610.28s)]
*  I'm not apologising about that. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1614.84s)]
*  Indeed, one of the defences I made is that they accelerated the process [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1615.9599999999998s)]
*  when the right-wing of the Labour Party were no longer in charge of the party machine [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1621.8799999999999s)]
*  from the spring of 2018. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1624.1999999999998s)]
*  Because what happened then is those complaints were not being acted on. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1625.8799999999999s)]
*  And then, even though the left was not in charge of the party machine, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1629.6399999999999s)]
*  Jeremy Corbyn got blamed for it. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1633.8799999999999s)]
*  It was ludicrous. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1635.7199999999998s)]
*  Completely ludicrous. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1636.6s)]
*  That media narrative was false. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1638.76s)]
*  And I tried to challenge it. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1640.36s)]
*  I tried to tell the truth. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1641.8799999999999s)]
*  The truth actually matters. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1644.36s)]
*  This isn't to say there were not valid criticisms to make of me in the Corbyn era. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1646.1999999999998s)]
*  During his second 2016 leadership bid, when there was an attempted coup against him, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1649.6399999999999s)]
*  I voted for him as leader again. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1653.8s)]
*  But I was very critical. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1655.7199999999998s)]
*  Those critiques focused particularly on communication. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1657.9599999999998s)]
*  But before the 2017 general election was called, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1660.6799999999998s)]
*  I said those communication failures risked a terrible election defeat, [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1662.9199999999998s)]
*  for which I feared the left would be blamed and therefore destroyed. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1666.28s)]
*  That came after defeats in by-elections, Labour's polling was catastrophic. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1670.4399999999998s)]
*  I suggested that Corbyn should be replaced with someone else with the same politics. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1674.76s)]
*  And some were very, very angry about that. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1678.28s)]
*  And they still are. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1681.0s)]
*  And I get that. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1682.12s)]
*  It was a big mistake on my part. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1682.84s)]
*  The criticism's justified. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1685.24s)]
*  People thought, look, come on, you've got one job. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1686.4399999999998s)]
*  We don't have other lefty commentators with a platform. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1689.8799999999999s)]
*  You know, you should just be out there fighting our corner. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1694.6s)]
*  And you're not. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1697.32s)]
*  People are angry about it. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1697.8s)]
*  Now, as it happened when the election was called, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1699.6399999999999s)]
*  thanks to transformative policies finally being front and centre, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1701.4s)]
*  Labour support surged. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1704.3600000000001s)]
*  The Tories lost their majority. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1705.5600000000002s)]
*  Labour got 40% of the vote. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1706.76s)]
*  I was proven wrong, thankfully. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1708.0400000000002s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1709.24s)]
*  I sometimes say that I was saved by the Tory Prime Minister, Theresa May, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1709.72s)]
*  who called that election. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1713.4s)]
*  Politically, I was definitely going melty, for want of a better word. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1714.2800000000002s)]
*  And that election, thanks to my beloved Theresa May, [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1717.8000000000002s)]
*  led me to firm up my politics, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1721.3200000000002s)]
*  which is why when Labour's defeated catastrophically in 2019, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1722.44s)]
*  I stood consistently by my politics and didn't shape-shift like a political opportunist, [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1725.48s)]
*  like to be blunt, others have. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1729.3200000000002s)]
*  Sticking to your left-wing principles in the last few years, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1731.32s)]
*  it's not been fun, has it? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1734.1200000000001s)]
*  You don't do it for a laugh. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1735.4s)]
*  You do it because it's the right thing to do. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1736.84s)]
*  Now, none of that, the reason I just did that part in history, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1738.68s)]
*  also do with Palestine, because sometimes people suggest it was. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1741.48s)]
*  Or indeed the conflation of anti-Semitism, very real evil, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1744.2s)]
*  with questions linked to as well in Palestine. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1748.1200000000001s)]
*  But some specific criticisms have come up, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1750.92s)]
*  which again deliberately strip out of context and lie by omission. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1754.04s)]
*  One is that I spoke at a meeting of the Jewish Labour Movement in 2017. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1760.12s)]
*  That's Labour's only affiliated Jewish organisation. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1764.28s)]
*  Now, the basis for that critique comes from the fact [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1766.52s)]
*  that it's not simply a Jewish organisation, but in its constitution, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1769.0s)]
*  it states that one of its values is to promote the centrality of Israel in Jewish life. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1772.9199999999998s)]
*  Why did I speak there? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1777.9599999999998s)]
*  Very straightforward. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1779.2399999999998s)]
*  The father of my best friend, best man at his wedding, [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1780.1999999999998s)]
*  I was best man at his wedding and vice versa. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1783.32s)]
*  His father died and the JLM asked me to do an election in his memory. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1786.36s)]
*  Which after consulting the family, I did. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1790.04s)]
*  And I would note the same year Jamie Corbyn spoke at a JLM meeting as well. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1793.1599999999999s)]
*  Now look, I came under attack for doing so. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1797.6399999999999s)]
*  I wrote one post which stated, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1799.6399999999999s)]
*  I'm a passionate supporter of Palestinian justice. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1801.6399999999999s)]
*  My views on Palestine haven't changed one jot. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1803.8s)]
*  Palestine currently languishes under brutal occupation [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1807.48s)]
*  and is deprived of one of the most fundamental rights, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1810.36s)]
*  the right to national self-determination. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1813.8799999999999s)]
*  Israel's hard right government is expanding illegal settlements. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1815.72s)]
*  The Israeli government has subjected Gaza to brutal sieges and military offensives, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1818.52s)]
*  which have killed hundreds of Palestinian civilians. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1821.8s)]
*  My opposition to these horrors hasn't weakened one bit. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1823.8s)]
*  And added, I support a just peace for both Arabs and Jews, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1827.0s)]
*  which I stand by as well as discussing my opposition to anti-Semitism. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1830.2s)]
*  I was of course at a Jewish labour movement meeting. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1834.68s)]
*  In the lecture itself, I did a pitch at, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1839.08s)]
*  I guess you would say middle of the road, Jewish Brits. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1841.24s)]
*  So you have committed anti-Zionist Jewish Brits. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1843.4s)]
*  You have diehard right wing Zionists. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1847.3999999999999s)]
*  And I was pitching at those who were neither to try, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1849.0s)]
*  as I saw it, to win them over to the Palestinian cause. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1851.1599999999999s)]
*  You might disagree with what I was doing, but that was the point. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1854.4399999999998s)]
*  I wrote up this pitch. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1858.9199999999998s)]
*  This is just odd, I think. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1861.32s)]
*  This is presented as if I was presenting this as what should be the core strategy [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1862.52s)]
*  of the Palestinian solidarity movement, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1866.4399999999998s)]
*  rather than what was a very specific pitch at a Jewish labour movement meeting [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1867.8s)]
*  and therefore at floating Jewish voters, if you like. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1873.0s)]
*  So that included talking about the specific horror of the [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1878.52s)]
*  Shoah, in which six million European Jews, of course, were murdered by the Nazis. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1881.48s)]
*  Listening to the lived experience of Jewish people when they talked about anti-Semitism. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1885.16s)]
*  Building a Palestinian solidarity movement where British Jews, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1888.84s)]
*  who are, as I put it, genuinely committed to the end of the occupation and settlements, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1892.2s)]
*  feel welcome. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1895.8s)]
*  And then demanding the immediate end of the occupation of Palestinian land, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1897.08s)]
*  the end of the blockade of Gaza, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1900.04s)]
*  the dismantling of all settlements, boycotts of products made in illegal settlements on [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1901.72s)]
*  Palestinian land. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1905.64s)]
*  I'll come on to that. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1906.84s)]
*  An arms embargo against Israel and other human rights abusing states. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1907.8s)]
*  Solidarity with those Israeli peace activists fighting for Palestinian justice. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1911.96s)]
*  The latter is something you've seen me do on this channel repeatedly by platforming such voices [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1916.84s)]
*  as best I can. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1920.44s)]
*  Now, I'm currently coming under attack for this specifically, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1921.4s)]
*  which I'll be honest, I think is wild. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1923.96s)]
*  I also think it's bemusing because I was actually heckled at the lecture with a case I made [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1925.4s)]
*  for Palestinian liberation. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1931.4s)]
*  Some took it very well, some didn't. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1932.52s)]
*  But I don't think there's anything wrong with pitching arguments in support of Palestinian [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1936.52s)]
*  liberation to what could be described as, as I said, they're floating Jewish voters, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1941.8000000000002s)]
*  if you like. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1946.2800000000002s)]
*  That was the basis of it. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1949.24s)]
*  The critique I would make of myself reading back is, I mean, I discuss being committed [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1950.2800000000002s)]
*  to the objective of Palestinian liberation freedom with a two-state solution guaranteeing [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1955.64s)]
*  peace and stability for all. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1959.0s)]
*  Now, to be honest, other than question time in 2012, I almost always steered away from [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1961.96s)]
*  the question of an end state on the pragmatic grounds it should be decided on the basis of [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1965.88s)]
*  negotiation as long as, for example, the occupation, the settlements, the siege and so on ended. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1970.76s)]
*  At the time, it had been put to me that there was very little meaningful support for one [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1975.24s)]
*  state solution in polling of either Palestinians or Jewish Israelis. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1979.24s)]
*  To be honest, Jeremy Corbyn then and since has made the case for a two-state solution. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1982.84s)]
*  I'm not sure where he's currently at on that. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1989.3999999999999s)]
*  I haven't asked him, but I would say he's one of the most courageous and principal champions [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1990.84s)]
*  of Palestinian liberation. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1995.08s)]
*  I don't think him having argued that contradicts that. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1995.9599999999998s)]
*  My own personal preference caveat, someone who's a white Brit, is what I argued from [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=1998.84s)]
*  question time, a single democratic state with equal rights for all, like South Africa, however [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2002.6799999999998s)]
*  hard that might be to achieve. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2006.76s)]
*  That's certainly where I am now. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2007.8s)]
*  I did a big search. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2009.32s)]
*  The only time I think I discussed an end state at all in those years were on question time [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2010.2s)]
*  and in that lecture. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2016.84s)]
*  Now, the other criticism I get refers to an interview I did at the time with the Jewish [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2018.52s)]
*  Chronicle. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2021.72s)]
*  I'm not going to lie, that interview was a big mistake from what I remember, just very [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2022.2s)]
*  leading questions in which I was tripped up, not least on the question of boycotts, which [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2026.6s)]
*  I've written about in The Guardian. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2031.0s)]
*  I've always backed, as I've set out here, sanctions, boycotts, written about that in [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2032.84s)]
*  The Guardian, but I didn't use my platform to properly back the boycott, divestment, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2037.32s)]
*  sanctions movement in The Guardian until 2021. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2043.0s)]
*  In a piece, headline, Denied a State, Palestinians are now Denied a State in their own future. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2045.56s)]
*  Earlier that year, I published a video on my channel entitled The Case for Boycott, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2051.72s)]
*  Divestment and Sanctions. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2054.7599999999998s)]
*  Definitely should have come out earlier in support of that campaign. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2056.68s)]
*  Totally accepts that was a mistake. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2059.48s)]
*  Again, I talk about Jamie Corbyn here because he's the figurehead of the left, but [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2061.96s)]
*  I'm not the only one who's gone on a journey, I think, on that. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2068.04s)]
*  He was asked about in 2017, he didn't back BDS back then, I bet he does now. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2070.04s)]
*  It doesn't stop the fact he was a very eloquent champion of the Palestinian people. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2075.0800000000004s)]
*  He is a very eloquent champion, far more than myself. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2078.04s)]
*  He was vilified for it. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2081.7200000000003s)]
*  But it's that Jewish Chronicle interview which keeps coming up, it's just this mess, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2082.76s)]
*  which, for example, asked leading questions and chopped up my answers. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2086.84s)]
*  It was just one of the worst journalistic experiences I've ever had. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2092.36s)]
*  Certainly a learning curve there. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2097.0s)]
*  The other critique which has come up focuses on a book I wrote about the Labour left called [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2098.44s)]
*  This Land, The Struggle for the Left. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2103.4s)]
*  This, for me, really is actually the most frustrating criticism. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2105.32s)]
*  You see, there's a chapter in which I do a potted history of the left's changing [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2107.64s)]
*  relationship with Israel and Palestine. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2112.68s)]
*  It wasn't a chapter about my personal views. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2115.0s)]
*  It was supposed to be a detached history of how the left went from a pretty [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2116.7599999999998s)]
*  slavish pro-Israel perspective, I would say, to championing the Palestinian cause. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2120.84s)]
*  A lot of people are familiar with this. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2126.04s)]
*  It's an unfortunate history, if I'm honest. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2127.24s)]
*  You see, the official communist movement in 1948 backed Israel's foundation. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2129.0s)]
*  The Soviet Union was the first country on earth to do a jury, recognise Israel, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2133.56s)]
*  and left-wing labour luminaries backed it, like Eric Heffer, for example. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2139.48s)]
*  That's partly because they saw it as a socialist project, for example, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2144.2s)]
*  which then overtly became a state which never claimed any such thing. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2147.96s)]
*  And things like the aftermath of the occupation of the West Bank and [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2152.2s)]
*  Gaza from 1967 onwards changed all that. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2155.56s)]
*  I mean, the likes of Tony Ben with Labour Friends of Israel. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2157.96s)]
*  You'd never imagine that, would you, given how he ended up a brilliant [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2160.44s)]
*  champion for the Palestinian people. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2163.4s)]
*  Now, that didn't mean I personally thought this was a socialist project [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2164.7599999999998s)]
*  to associate the socialists in deficit. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2168.2799999999997s)]
*  Of course I don't. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2169.64s)]
*  I was writing about the left's changing relationship and how it was perceived [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2170.6s)]
*  by the left. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2174.7599999999998s)]
*  You can't have socialism and ethnically-cleaned people and deprive [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2176.2s)]
*  and occupied people of their freedom. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2179.72s)]
*  So, for example, people quote from those chapters though I said there was an [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2182.4399999999996s)]
*  incontestable need for a Jewish state in 1948 when what I was actually [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2185.48s)]
*  discussing was how Zionism went from being a minority strain amongst Jewish [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2189.08s)]
*  people to a dominant strain after the Holocaust, which is what happened. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2195.16s)]
*  It wasn't supposed to be a discussion of my views. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2198.4399999999996s)]
*  This is how people are portraying it. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2200.2799999999997s)]
*  I also discussed how it differed from other settler colonial projects which [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2202.4399999999996s)]
*  planted the flag down of their country where they were from. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2206.92s)]
*  But I wasn't disputing that Israel is a settler colonial project, which of [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2210.28s)]
*  course it is. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2213.64s)]
*  Settler colonialism takes different forms. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2214.04s)]
*  Discussing how it presents itself doesn't stop believing that settler [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2216.6800000000003s)]
*  colonialism is a terrible injustice. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2224.04s)]
*  I mean, it's just, I mean, that's why it's frustrating. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2227.64s)]
*  It's stuff like that. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2233.16s)]
*  It's kind of like, well, I'm writing a sort of academic history of the left [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2233.88s)]
*  evolution. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2239.0s)]
*  It was contextual, you know. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2241.08s)]
*  It wasn't a history of Israel and Palestine. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2242.92s)]
*  It wasn't the point of it. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2245.8s)]
*  I mean, in that chapter, I go on later to talk about some of the things I [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2247.88s)]
*  spoke about in this video. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2251.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, it's been a long video. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2253.56s)]
*  Apologies. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2255.6400000000003s)]
*  But it is important to speak the truth about my record and about my position [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2256.6800000000003s)]
*  given this has come up. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2261.56s)]
*  You know, I have consistently used my platform to support the struggle for [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2263.08s)]
*  Palestinian liberation. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2267.16s)]
*  It's not really possible to look back at that record and say I haven't. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2268.2000000000003s)]
*  I mean, if I haven't, then it's, you're leaving the conclusion that the bar is [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2274.76s)]
*  almost impossible to... [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2282.04s)]
*  So this has been a very long video, but it is important to speak the truth [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2286.28s)]
*  about my record, about my position, given this has come up. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2289.8s)]
*  I mean, the fact is I have consistently used my position to support the struggle [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2293.0s)]
*  for Palestinian liberation. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2297.4s)]
*  I don't see how you could argue based on that record that I haven't. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2299.6400000000003s)]
*  If I'm excluded from that, if I'm based on that portrayed as some sort of [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2303.48s)]
*  champion of Israel, then it's not going to leave many people, is it, passing the [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2309.2400000000002s)]
*  purity test. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2314.2000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I've consistently fought against the deliberate conflation of the struggle [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2315.2400000000002s)]
*  with the genuine evil of antisemitism, which I've consistently opposed. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2321.48s)]
*  And the way you can oppose antisemitism, you should oppose antisemitism, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2325.8s)]
*  without antisemitism being falsely used to demonise those who stand with the [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2329.96s)]
*  Palestinian people, which obviously has been directed at myself as I pointed out. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2335.96s)]
*  Now, it doesn't mean I always got it right. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2340.6s)]
*  It doesn't mean the language I've used has always been correct. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2342.7599999999998s)]
*  But claims circulating amongst some that I'm some pro-Israel, anti-Palestinian [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2347.08s)]
*  stooge are deranged. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2351.48s)]
*  And the context I've given you is why, as soon as the genocide began, I made a [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2354.12s)]
*  pattern myself to use my platform as best I could to oppose what I knew from the [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2360.12s)]
*  very start would be a terrible crime. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2363.24s)]
*  Whatever the consequences that would be. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2364.8399999999997s)]
*  And this is me on the 10th of October, 2023 on Sky News. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2366.52s)]
*  I was the first British journalist to go on television and make these arguments. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2370.76s)]
*  I got vilified for it. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2374.44s)]
*  Listen, no one speaks about Palestine because they think it's good for their [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2375.4s)]
*  career. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2380.2000000000003s)]
*  If they do, they're deranged, deluded at best. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2380.6800000000003s)]
*  Which is why you may have noticed I've been blacklisted by almost every single [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2385.5600000000004s)]
*  television channel since it's begun. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2390.28s)]
*  That's what happened. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2392.6000000000004s)]
*  Well, so what? [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2394.0400000000004s)]
*  Palestinian journalists have been slaughtered in the biggest massacre [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2395.7200000000003s)]
*  of journalists in history. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2398.0400000000004s)]
*  I'll survive a blacklist. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2399.96s)]
*  But what I've tried to do with this channel and my platform is consistently [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2401.48s)]
*  oppose this genocide, building on the position I've always had, consistently [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2405.32s)]
*  taking on the role of the Western media and our rulers and try to platform voices [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2411.2400000000002s)]
*  other media outlets are raised. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2415.16s)]
*  That doesn't mean I shouldn't be scrutinised or critiqued. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2417.16s)]
*  But I just want to emphasize this. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2419.96s)]
*  There are two strategies if you're someone who supports the struggle for [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2421.16s)]
*  justice, emancipation, for anyone. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2425.8s)]
*  Now, you can do your best to speak to as many people as you can without [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2427.96s)]
*  watering down your principles, but to win over the unpersuaded, to build [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2433.4s)]
*  support. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2437.8s)]
*  That's been the aim of this platform. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2439.2400000000002s)]
*  And since the genocide began, you know, not to boast, but just to make the [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2441.08s)]
*  point about the purpose, literally millions of people, millions of people [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2445.48s)]
*  have watched these videos, whether that be on YouTube, Instagram, on Twitter, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2449.56s)]
*  and so on. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2452.84s)]
*  And obviously you've all made that possible. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2453.32s)]
*  Now, for those who regard me as beyond the pale, presumably they feel it would [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2455.4s)]
*  be better for the cause if my channel only existed and wasn't pointing out [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2460.6s)]
*  this content opposed to genocide. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2465.48s)]
*  Well, I think that's sad. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2467.16s)]
*  But if you think this content is helpful to the Israeli state, that certainly [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2468.12s)]
*  needs to its apologists. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2471.56s)]
*  Or you can have another strategy. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2473.4s)]
*  Only speak to those who are already persuaded. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2475.08s)]
*  Only speak to the most radical members of the already persuaded. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2477.48s)]
*  Denounce those who are just not pure enough. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2482.44s)]
*  Indeed, decide that you would prefer to shrink the movement as long as you can [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2484.12s)]
*  be allowed a voice in it, not convincing or persuading a single person. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2488.8399999999997s)]
*  Well, I think that's self-indulgent to say the least. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2493.08s)]
*  And actually think when it comes to fighting genocide, it's unforgivable. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2496.04s)]
*  If there are those who want to denounce me as a raging Zionist, a stooge of Israel [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2500.2s)]
*  and all the rest, that's up to you. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2504.44s)]
*  But even if you disagree with me, I think you can see I've used my platform [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2507.7999999999997s)]
*  as long as I've had one to support Palestinian liberation. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2511.48s)]
*  Have my views become firmer on certain issues? [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2514.6s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2517.48s)]
*  But I've always been on this side. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2518.36s)]
*  And to conclude, I hope this sets the record straight. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2519.48s)]
*  I'm sorry this is self-indulgent. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2522.76s)]
*  It's wasting time and energy. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2524.12s)]
*  Not that interesting. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2526.28s)]
*  And I'm actually not that complicated. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2527.0s)]
*  I don't have a load of secret ulterior motives. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2528.52s)]
*  I'm just doing my best to use my platform as effectively as I can in what is, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2531.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm afraid to say, an extremely dark period in human history. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2535.8s)]
*  My commitment is to keep doing everything I can with my platform as long as I have it [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RibyILPi4Kk&t=2538.36s)]
