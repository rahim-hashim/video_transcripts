# Suella Braverman HUMILIATED By Gaza Protesters
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iw0FuvnYI5s)
*  Wow, please inject this into my veins.
*  Now, Shredda Braverman used to be, quite absurdly, the Home Secretary of Britain,
*  charged with national security, law and order, that kind of thing.
*  She's a pantomime villain of a right-winger and a hardcore apologist for the Israeli state
*  and its current genocidal onslaught against the Palestinian people.
*  Now she's teamed up with GB News, the Fox News of Britain,
*  which has made a total mockery of Britain's broadcasting rules to churn out
*  relentless right-wing propaganda. GB News is essentially a right-wing political project,
*  more than say a news channel, despite the claims made before it was launched,
*  which those of us who disbelieve, by the way, were completely vindicated over.
*  Now, GB News took Shredda Braverman to the encampment at Cambridge University,
*  set up by students there to oppose Israel's genocidal campaign.
*  The motive here was very straightforward, to use these students as culture war fodder.
*  The hope was that there would be a confrontation, which would be fireworks and rile up the GB News
*  audience. You know, students angrily announcing Braverman, big shouting match, hopefully some
*  abusive things being said about our former Home Secretary, while Braverman stands about looking
*  all smug, job done. Well, here's what happened. Now quite often you'll see that they don't seem
*  particularly intent on showing their faces, I don't know if you might be able to engage with people.
*  Hello, just wondering if you'd like to have any kind of discussion at all with Suella today?
*  Hi, I'm Suella. I'm keen to find out your views and what you're protesting about.
*  Nothing at all? No? Interested in why you're covering your faces?
*  Is it a Covid or a health measure?
*  No comment. Can I just ask, are you students at the university or just from around the area?
*  Nothing? Okay, interesting. What were you expecting? Did you think that maybe people might
*  engage a little bit with you? Well, these are supposed to be some of the brightest and the
*  best students in the land and taught in the art of articulating their views and expressing
*  arguments in a coherent way and I'm interested in hearing their arguments. Yeah, anyone?
*  Engaging and listening. What would be your main question to some of the individuals?
*  I'm really keen to hear what your message is to Israel.
*  No. Interested to hear your message to Hamas? No comment.
*  Do you think the hostages should be released now?
*  Not very conversant today.
*  Hi there. Go on. Very nice to... I'm Suella. Can I ask you what your message is to Israel?
*  Yep. Right. Can I ask you what your message is to Hamas?
*  Silence. Guys, anyone willing to just explain a couple of bits and bobs? What you guys are
*  doing here? Why it's so important to you? What the demands are or anything? No?
*  Vegan and nut fruit needed. Vegan and nut free food is needed. Morning everybody. Hi,
*  I'm Suella Braverman, MP. Here to inquire about what you're protesting about and give
*  you an opportunity to send your message onto national television.
*  No? Okay, all right. Well, it's fascinating really because I thought that maybe they would
*  give some form of response or reaction. Yeah.
*  Sorry about that. That is funny. You've got to admit that's funny. That's comical. It's
*  embarrassing. Hugely embarrassing for GBNews and Suella Braverman. What makes it perfect is we took
*  that from the GBNews Twitter feed because they just posted it probably thinking, yep, that's a
*  win. Come on guys. We got some juicy content. Being completely and utterly ignored, blanked
*  by the students we were trying to ridicule and humiliate and serve up for the culture war.
*  Absolutely amazing. Incredible stuff. No, genuinely though, well done to those students who had the
*  correct strategy there, of course, with GBNews and Suella Braverman who were trying to use them.
*  That it wasn't the whole point of this exercise wasn't some engaging back and forth in good
*  faith and interesting debate to tease out differences of opinion. It's really tedious
*  that they try and pretend it was because they know that's not what they were trying to do.
*  Actually, their audience know that's not what they were trying to do. Their critics know it's not
*  what they were trying to do. Nobody believes it. Everybody knows they were trying to set up what
*  they thought would be a useful confrontation for them, which would serve their political purposes
*  of demonising protesters. That's what the whole point of the exercise was. They know it. It's just
*  a waste of time insulting everyone's intelligence to pretend otherwise. They were trying to use
*  students as a prop in the culture war. It's kind of grim, isn't it? They're trying to get up to
*  all these students. Suella Braverman asked, oh, why are you covering your face? Wow, why would they
*  want to do that? What? Just because a right-wing cultural channel is sticking cameras in their
*  faces, which will then reveal all their identities. A load of right-wing lunatics can go and dox a
*  load of 19-year-olds, go through their entire history and try and serve up their histories
*  all over the internet to try and demonise and attack them further. Why would they need to cover
*  their faces up? It really is a mystery, isn't it, Suella Braverman? Now, clearly what they were
*  trying to do, this noxious channel and Suella Braverman, was to demonise those who committed
*  the despicable crime of opposing one of the great atrocities of our age, as thousands of civilians
*  are slaughtered, of course, with the support of the British government. I bet they were gutted.
*  They were gutted by that response. And so after being subjected to the silent treatment,
*  one of the protesters did go to GB News Studio. Let's listen to that clip.
*  One of my first questions that I was very keen to ask, I mean, were you at the
*  encampment? The Cambridge one, but other ones. Other ones, okay. And can I ask you what your
*  view is of the events of October the 7th? What do you think happened on October the 7th in Israel?
*  Well, obviously, the camps haven't started because of October the 7th specifically. They're
*  starting, I mean, this week in loads of encampments up and down the country, they've been, like,
*  celebrating and having to, like, memorise the fact that this week commemorates the Nakba,
*  which took place 76 years ago, which means catastrophe, which is a massive symbol of what
*  Israel has been doing for the last 76 years. This isn't about October the 7th. And to start with
*  that is just entirely disingenuous, I think, on your part. I really want to say that I think it's
*  great, actually, that you went to that camp today and tried to talk to those students. And you kind
*  of embarrassed yourself, I would say, whilst doing that, because it was a reminder for me, and I'm
*  sure for other people watching, that actually the Palestine movement brought you down, and the
*  Palestine movement has the potential to bring down lots of other Tory ministers and the whole
*  government, and not just the Tory government, I would say any government and any mainstream
*  political party that is backing what Israel is doing right now, which is a genocide.
*  So what the student does here, very ably, I would say, is reframe the discussion. What
*  Sorella Braverman wants to do is start the clock on the 7th of October and just erase history.
*  To pretend Israel was just minding its own business, being all peaceful, not bothering anyone,
*  just being all cheerful and democratic, and then out of nowhere, a terrible atrocity took place in
*  Israel, just had to go defend itself. And that's the entire history of the Israel-Palestine conflict.
*  Whereas, as this student points out, this goes back generations, not least, of course, back
*  to the Nakba, the catastrophe of 1948, within living memory, that is, when three quarters of a
*  million Palestinians were driven from their homes in more modern parlance, ethnically cleansed,
*  15,000 of them slaughtered in the process. Now, it should be noted that the vast majority
*  of Gaza's population today are the family members of those driven from their homes in 1948, well over
*  80%. Then, of course, we have further ethnic cleansing, including another mass violent
*  expulsion in 1967. We have the longest belligerent occupation in modern times, apartheid, as defined
*  by international and Israeli human rights organisations, the theft of Palestinian land and
*  its colonisation by illegal settlements, mass incarcerations with huge numbers, including
*  children incarcerated without trial and tortured and abused, relentless mass murder. In the West
*  Bank alone last year, 240 Palestinians were killed before the 7th of October, around 40 of them
*  children. Well, that, to be honest, Suhaela Braverman even knows or cares about most of that history.
*  She looks flabbergasted when confronted with some actual context. And that's aside from the
*  atrocities committed by the Israeli state in Gaza right now, as I speak and you listen, far graver
*  than the crimes which were committed on 7th of October, which I've always been very clear about.
*  Braverman is, alas, a one-dimensional caricature of a right-wing demagogue who seems to just go
*  through right-wing talking points like a checklist, with no substance to anything she says or argues
*  for or against, quite unlike the students she was trying to demonise. Now, it's striking that
*  Braverman was sacked by the Prime Minister, Rishi Senaka's Home Secretary, after she accused the
*  Metropolitan Police, London's police force, of bias in the policing of protests. An absolutely
*  absurdity, of course, what really angered her was that protests against Israel's genocide are
*  overwhelmingly peaceful, with fewer arrests than at Glastonbury Music Festival, and therefore there
*  was no legal basis for the Met to wage the sort of war-gates protests against Israel's genocide,
*  which the likes of Sorella Braverman obviously crave. The idea that the Metropolitan Police is
*  some den of leftiness which loves protesters, yeah, well, come off it now. I mean, she went on
*  to write a completely unhinged article for the Telegraph, claiming that Islamists are in charge
*  of Britain. Now, basically, she claims there's some Islamist cabal running the show. That's really
*  why the Met isn't just going around locking up anybody who objects to a genocide. I mean, it's
*  just a disturbing conspiracy theory dripping with Islamophobia. The truth is the protesters who gave
*  Braverman the silent treatment have been vindicated, like protesters from Iraq to Vietnam,
*  who were similarly sneered at and insulted by politicians and media elites. The tragedy,
*  of course, is those responsible were never held to account in those crimes. That's what has to
*  change. Please like and subscribe. Do leave your comments and thoughts. Do share the video. Help
