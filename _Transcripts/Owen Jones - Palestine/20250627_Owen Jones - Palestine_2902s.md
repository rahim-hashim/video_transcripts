# Why Israel Will LOSE - w./ Alonso Gurmendi Dunkelberg
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0)
*  Now much of Israel is high on triumphalism at the moment. Benjamin Netanyahu seems to be behaving [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=0.0s)]
*  as the master of all before him. I mean within Israel itself, the society, the grip of genocidal [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  mania, he could well win an election. Not quite the narrative which was originally portrayed, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=10.48s)]
*  not least in the aftermath, I have to say, the 7th October. Is this a period, is it strategic, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=18.32s)]
*  victory after strategic victory for Israel? Are they going to get rid of genocide, let alone [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=26.4s)]
*  various other hideous war crimes and reshape them at least in their own image? Well there's no better [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=30.56s)]
*  person to talk about about the current general situation than Dr Alonzo Gamendi who is a brilliant [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=36.48s)]
*  academic and actually, sorry I should say he's at LSE, Family and Human Rights, but I don't know [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=43.04s)]
*  to be disparaging about academics but not all academics are that proficient in communicating [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=51.04s)]
*  the research, the ideas they have to a broader audience. Alonzo is very good at doing that which [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=58.32s)]
*  is particularly crucial in this field at this particular moment. It's great to see you, how [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  you doing? Thanks Owen, thanks for having me again, it's always great to be here. It's always a [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=68.56s)]
*  pleasure. Yes, last time we spoke I think you were talking about strategic defeat for Israel, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=73.44s)]
*  I mean you know it might be hubris but I mean it's been now, it's getting on for 21 months [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=82.48s)]
*  of genocidal depravity in Gaza which is literally relentless every day. Imagine going back in time [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=91.44s)]
*  and explaining that to yourself, you know whatever terror people had of what was to come in Gaza, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=96.56s)]
*  not least based on the public statements of genocide made at the very beginning and throughout, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=103.36s)]
*  imagine being told this is every day for 21 months with no end in sight at that time. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=108.64s)]
*  There's been Iran, there's been Lebanon, they keep invading Syria, they've been, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  they're occupying Syria, doesn't even get discussed. I mean you know and then there's the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=120.64s)]
*  relentless pogroms in the West Bank, those who believe in a greater Israel are feeling quite [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=127.2s)]
*  cocky I think to be honest. What do you think? Where do you think things stand? Do you think [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=132.8s)]
*  actually this ends in terrible strategic defeat for Israel and the kind of that project? Or [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=138.08s)]
*  at the moment are they genuinely just on a roll because they've got the US hegemon on their side? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=145.6s)]
*  Um I honestly I think politics is a delicate game. I don't think it works in this way as in like you [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=151.36s)]
*  just start bombing people and hegemony emerges from that. I think it requires a lot more than that. So [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  I feel like the extreme rapidness with which Israel is acting, which is uncharacteristic [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=171.68s)]
*  of the Israeli state, they usually take very long time to make very slow moves. The reason why they [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=179.44s)]
*  are acting so quickly and in so many fronts and over stretching so much to the point that I mean [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=185.12s)]
*  they started running low in interceptors during the war with Iran is the fact that they know [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=190.88s)]
*  that for the foreseeable like three to four years, presuming Trump leaves office, always a big if, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=198.0s)]
*  they know that if Trump leaves office in four years Gen Z is gonna have uh reach finished up being 18. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=209.28s)]
*  And all of these like young people are gonna have shaped their political opinions on this onslaught [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=220.39999999999998s)]
*  that Israel is committing all over the Middle East. Um and that's just like that won't be forgotten. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=228.32s)]
*  The back to normality argument where oh no we're just now gonna mow the lawn every few years and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=235.2s)]
*  kill 200 people here, 150 people here, and then every now and then drone Lebanon or Syria, that's [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=240.96s)]
*  not coming back. I think like we just saw in in New York a candidate that says you really need to [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=248.24s)]
*  contextualize uh you know Palestinian messaging like globalizing the Intifada is not a call for [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  violence. He just won in New York. Yeah, Zerom and Andy for those who don't know and uh and supports [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=262.24s)]
*  BDS, boycott divestment sanctions, and called for um Israel to be a state of all where it's [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=268.0s)]
*  equality for all its citizens which is no longer actually Israel anymore. And he's also the son [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=276.56s)]
*  of a very well-known academic like Mahmoud Mamdani who like is someone that I teach every year so it's [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=280.96000000000004s)]
*  really cool. Um but but it does show that like the way that um the world is moving towards [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=286.56s)]
*  is not in the way of supporting Israel unlimitedly and forever. Uh and Israel knows this so I think [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=294.08s)]
*  what I'm seeing now is whatever is not achieved in this uh race to getting as many strategic [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=300.96s)]
*  interests satisfied as possible as quickly as possible, whatever is not achieved they know that [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=308.96s)]
*  they'll never achieve. And that in itself to me is a sign of desperation because you're [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=314.16s)]
*  overstretching like think think of the amount of things that Israel had to activate in Iran to go [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=319.20000000000005s)]
*  to war with Iran. It had to spend people that were undercover in Iran for years in very high ranking [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=324.24s)]
*  places. Um it had to reveal that it had the capacity to build you know laser targeting within Iran. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=329.68s)]
*  Um it had to spend a lot of its interceptors to defend and uh and all of these things are not [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=337.04s)]
*  easy to build. Uh for what? For apparently from from the latest intel that um the US has produced [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=344.32s)]
*  delaying the Iranian nuclear plan for a month, two months? Is it is it really it's it you might call [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=351.44s)]
*  it a tactical win although I would say not necessarily because um the regime is still intact [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=359.52s)]
*  and um the nuclear program is still ongoing um and right now actually Iran would have every [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=366.47999999999996s)]
*  incentive to say okay if this is how it's going to be I'm going to produce a nuclear bomb which is [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=374.15999999999997s)]
*  what nobody wanted like not even Iran wanted a nuclear bomb in 2018. Now it's 2025 and they [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=377.28s)]
*  would be crazy not to pursue this so they've sort of produced their own worst enemy again. Um I mean [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=382.64s)]
*  Donald Trump says the US has totally obliterated its targets and he's announced what he calls [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=389.76s)]
*  the real scum who shared the pentagon's initial US assessment which suggested that you know [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=393.92s)]
*  because he says the whole thing is collapsed as a disaster that they suggest actually only put it [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=400.96000000000004s)]
*  back by just I mean it's a complete waste of time that really if it's a handful of months [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=405.04s)]
*  not relevant and actually that then is counterbalanced you're saying in theory [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=409.92s)]
*  by their accelerated some would say more quite rational demand I don't know I mean not I don't [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=414.0s)]
*  like nuclear weapons and I support non-proliferation nuclear weapons which are an [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=419.84s)]
*  existential threat to our civilization um it's not any rational act is it to speak to respond to this [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=424.15999999999997s)]
*  by going well if you don't want to get attacked you need a nuke. See but yeah that's the thing um the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=431.35999999999996s)]
*  we're always told how uh in in this dynamic in the Israel Iran dynamic there is an irrational [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=439.84s)]
*  fundamentalist actor that cannot be trusted with nuclear weapons and that is Iran and I'll be the [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=446.56s)]
*  first one to say I don't want Iran to have nuclear weapons I don't think it's a good idea I think [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=453.84s)]
*  no one in the world should have nuclear weapons I come from Latin America every single Latin American [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=458.32s)]
*  state gave up nuclear weapons a long time ago we're a nuclear free zone and it works great um I [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=462.56s)]
*  South America is one of the only places in the world that cannot be reached by you know [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=470.48s)]
*  ballistic missiles um because no one has them and it's great so I don't want Iran to have nuclear [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=474.32s)]
*  weapons but this idea that then the other side of the coin is this like liberal democracy that [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=481.04s)]
*  actually can be trusted with undeclared nuclear weapons um and are you know ontologically good [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=487.2s)]
*  as opposed to the ontologically bad nature of Iran I feel it's it's a constructed narrative [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=493.84s)]
*  that is sort of breaking down in the face of like this is the country that has killed 56,000 [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=499.84s)]
*  Palestinians that it is massacring people looking for aid um to eat um and that has produced all of [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=504.71999999999997s)]
*  these like horrible consequences in in in Gaza and in Iran um and we're supposed to see that as [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=512.56s)]
*  rational so it's important to to notice that that is a constructed reality that that binary is [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=520.3199999999999s)]
*  constructed is invented it's based on orientalist prejudice where in reality what you have is two [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=526.64s)]
*  authoritarian non-liberal um governments um that both violate human rights um but one has nukes [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=532.16s)]
*  and is accepted as a nuclear power and one isn't and one is supported by the west [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=541.04s)]
*  absolutely and so that that that binary is is um is the problem it's a view of the middle east [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=547.92s)]
*  that fundamentally puts Israel as the quote-unquote children of light and so because they are the [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=554.56s)]
*  children of light they get to impose their will over everyone else in the region backed by NATO [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=559.36s)]
*  um isn't there I mean which is basically along the lines of you know as an example Iran is this [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=564.9599999999999s)]
*  set bit of evil compared to say and then there's Israel the children of light or whatever leaked [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=572.7199999999999s)]
*  recording of Israeli generals being threatened sorry Iranian generals being threatened by the [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=580.08s)]
*  Israeli state by that they're they will bomb them and kill their children and their wives and this [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=585.76s)]
*  made well certainly me think of the AI program and the targeting procedures in Gaza where there is an [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=596.16s)]
*  AI system which locates supposed military targets you know however that's defined and and and you [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=605.36s)]
*  know these are not these are not classes high ranking targets not even verified exactly not [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=613.52s)]
*  verified exactly and they they wait until they go home and then there is a collateral damage limit [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=619.84s)]
*  of 20 people which is acceptable to blow up and they know they often know they know how old the [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=626.48s)]
*  children are when they're about to kill them including babies two years you can kill 20 of [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=632.64s)]
*  them for that whoever that person is and they call it a daddy's home the point I'm making though is [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=637.12s)]
*  you know if Iran was if Iran was doing that if they get here's an IDF soldier gone home we're [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=643.84s)]
*  going to blow them up as soon as they get home to ensure they're killed along with their entire [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=650.3199999999999s)]
*  families people go that is an example of heinous evil barbarism this just shows what we're dealing [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=654.72s)]
*  with here it just shows how evil they are but that isn't applied to towards Israel if anything [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=660.56s)]
*  there's just a narrative of they were human shields I mean you know a term which has been used to justify [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=665.04s)]
*  a genocidal source because you just label anyone who happens to be around whatever's been identified [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=670.9599999999999s)]
*  as a target is human shields when Israel is using actual human shields and goes on an industrial [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=676.3199999999999s)]
*  scale but I mean but the point making is that you know how would you do because when Israel does it [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=680.56s)]
*  because they go well we're fighting and you listen to that and go that's as evil as it gets [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=686.4799999999999s)]
*  you're threatening to kill people's children and their wives you know you're threatening to kill [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=690.32s)]
*  children you are in the abyss but it's the narrative you just it's not possible to make [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=693.6800000000001s)]
*  this narrative stick it's impossible almost as a respectable mainstream accepted consensus [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=700.48s)]
*  whereas if Iran did anything like that then they would that would just be unique evil [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=706.5600000000001s)]
*  yeah this is the basis of orientalism that I mean Edward Said Palestinian scholar mentioned this [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=711.44s)]
*  a crease you know wrote an entire book about it about how these behaviors these prejudices [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=716.88s)]
*  are constructed and influence the way that the west understands the the east right and so the [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=723.52s)]
*  orient and I think this is part of that strategic defeat that I'm talking about this this phrase [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=729.8399999999999s)]
*  that I don't know if many people have heard of like people like you and I that have like been [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=737.4399999999999s)]
*  um studying Israel past and for a long time we have but this idea that every accusation [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=742.1600000000001s)]
*  is a confession I don't think it was that popular I don't know 10 years ago um in the general public's [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=747.2s)]
*  imagination and I think now it is and I think now people take what and I mean people not governments [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=755.36s)]
*  not media people take what Israel says with a huge grain of salt and a huge level of skepticism that [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=764.08s)]
*  before wasn't there so so part of this strategic defeat is breaking down that binary of like the [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=770.16s)]
*  only liberal democracy um in the middle east with the most moral army in in the world like that that [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=777.1999999999999s)]
*  image of Israel is never coming back and I I don't think that even if they change governments or or [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=783.28s)]
*  like uh the so-called left initial assumes power I don't think that is enough I think Israel has [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=789.8399999999999s)]
*  stained its image for the foreseeable generations and they know that which is why they're in such [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=798.0s)]
*  a hurry which is why they're burning so many assets throughout the middle east um it's it's [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=803.6s)]
*  difficult to infiltrate Hezbollah it's difficult to infiltrate Iran um and the reason why they're [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=808.96s)]
*  expanding all of that uh right now as fast as they can is to get as many strategic objectives that [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=813.84s)]
*  they have as possible in the middle east right now because they're not going to be able to do it [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=821.52s)]
*  once this wave is done was once this wave of like unconditional support for Israel is done which is [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=827.36s)]
*  coming so I I would call that a defeat isn't it optimistic though maybe a bit optimistic in that [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=832.88s)]
*  you know I mean at the moment what Israel is consciously doing and deliberately doing is [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=839.68s)]
*  forging links particularly with the far right in Europe and far right parties who tend who often [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=844.56s)]
*  are very pro-result and actually you know the far right movement parties of the 30s and 40s [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=850.32s)]
*  anti-semitism is at their very core the jews were the other um and obviously anti-semitism [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=855.6s)]
*  remains a huge problem in the far right but it's interesting they look at Israel as the kind of [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=860.48s)]
*  ethno state they want to emulate in lots of ways and they also see them as a kind of like you know [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=865.44s)]
*  that you see this they're fighting the wars that we will have to fight in the future like you can [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=870.0s)]
*  kind of work out where they're going with that one um but you know they're forging those links [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=873.84s)]
*  I wouldn't rule out a continued far right rise um in Europe with question marks over [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=879.68s)]
*  then the viability of democracy as we know it in Europe because you can look at Hungary [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=887.5999999999999s)]
*  as an example I mean Russia actually kind of started that process off where you kind of [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=891.8399999999999s)]
*  you rot out the substance of democracy but you keep you keep the trappings for show I mean look [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=895.3599999999999s)]
*  at Russia it's ridiculous it's it's got Russia has six political parties represented as Juma it's got [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=899.28s)]
*  20 registered political parties and there are more people being and persecuted for political reasons [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=903.92s)]
*  than any time since Joseph Stalin more than Brezhnev more than Khrushchev and it's it's basically [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=908.88s)]
*  totalitarian is getting that is essentially totalitarian but it's it's not done the one it's [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=914.16s)]
*  not a one-party state you know I mean they found this way I mean Hungary's done that but I mean [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=919.6s)]
*  it's a bit of a tangent but I just worry there's a kind of well you know look if democracy you know [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=924.56s)]
*  has its way the views of increasing numbers of people will just become the majority and then that [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=930.32s)]
*  will mean that's bad news for Israel but what but what if our future actually is kind of [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=936.16s)]
*  the rise of of far-right regimes which then just rots out democracy yes well two things here [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=942.3199999999999s)]
*  number one is I guess my hope that I think the rise of the far right in the western world has [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=949.8399999999999s)]
*  to do more with the crisis of capitalism than with an identitarian ethno-nationalist inclination by [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=959.1999999999999s)]
*  the majority of the population in the west so my hope is that as candidates like like Sora Mandani [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=965.04s)]
*  like um um who was it in the green party here in the UK I forgot one's case is [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=971.4399999999999s)]
*  yeah as as as these like um I think at some point as class war um is presented as more important [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=982.3199999999999s)]
*  than cultural wars the cultural war will sort of diminish that that's my hope I hope I don't know [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=993.76s)]
*  if I'm correct I there's there's a lot of work to be done there but then on the other side as well [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=998.64s)]
*  there's the um point of where the world is right now and this is something like people ask me like [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1004.16s)]
*  oh is international law in crisis now that you know that Israel has been whatever it wants in [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1009.2s)]
*  the middle east and I go like well depends on what we call international law because yes uh [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1013.68s)]
*  international law is a discipline that goes back like several hundred years and has always been a [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1018.8s)]
*  tool of domination has always been a tool of colonialism has always been like a weapon to [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1023.68s)]
*  justify oppression it was used in the 1800s to justify the scramble for Africa it was used [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1028.8s)]
*  it was used in the 1500s to justify the colonization of the Americas it has that long [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1034.24s)]
*  standing tradition and if that's the claim then then yes that that international law is in crisis [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1039.28s)]
*  why because for the first time in a very like no no other time in the history of international law [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1044.56s)]
*  have countries in the global south countries that have been colonies had so much power and so much [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1050.56s)]
*  representation and it's only grown um and so if you look at this from the perspective of like the [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1055.76s)]
*  500 year history of international law the 1960s you know decolonization till today is a blip in a [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1061.52s)]
*  500 year history and it is those states and those movements those national liberation movements that [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1067.9199999999998s)]
*  are starting to shift how international law is understood that's why you have Palestine opening [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1073.76s)]
*  up cases in the ICC you have South Africa open up cases in the I.C.J. against Israel um you have [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1078.0s)]
*  Brazil constantly intervening in in in the war in Ukraine and like yes there is a there's of course [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1082.64s)]
*  a danger that like you know Russia China become the new hegemon and they're the ones that you know [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1089.12s)]
*  break the rules for their own benefit but I am optimistic in that um international law will not [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1092.72s)]
*  simply become just or will not just be this like NATO focused rules based order that is implemented [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1099.84s)]
*  unequally between north and south hemispheres forever um I'm I'm hoping that the change that [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1108.08s)]
*  started in the 1960s uh will lead to a different kind of international relations um moving forward [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1115.1999999999998s)]
*  so I maybe I am optimistic uh and it's not very common for me to be optimistic but at least in on [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1122.08s)]
*  those on those two fronts um if we play our cards right then yes it is it is entirely possible for [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1127.52s)]
*  um that new reality of a gen z that values different things than gen x and the boomers [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1134.96s)]
*  and even millennials um will lead to a strategic defeat of Israel I'm not saying that'll happen [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1142.8s)]
*  next year I'm not saying that'll happen the next election cycle it might be that some [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1147.68s)]
*  European countries go into fascism for like five ten years but in the grand scheme of things and [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1151.6s)]
*  in the scheme of things that Israel thinks in um when you think about it in decades like yeah I [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1156.96s)]
*  don't think they're thinking uh the path to victory lies in in the long-term game I think what we're [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1162.4s)]
*  seeing is that they think the path to victory over the middle east and securing the kinds of [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1168.88s)]
*  territorial ambitions that they have in the middle east uh come from the short term and that's why [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1173.28s)]
*  they're acting in very short term ways I mean I suppose but speaking partly to that is that [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1177.92s)]
*  increasing numbers of right-wingers are dissenting on Israel I mean we've seen Tucker Carlson um I [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1185.52s)]
*  mean eviscerate Ted Cruz the Republican congressman really over Israel um I mean Ted Cruz came across [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1192.3999999999999s)]
*  like a complete idiot idiotic lunatic um you can see why Donald Trump crushed him partly but I mean [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1200.48s)]
*  I mean it was it was it was motivating to watch but Tucker Carlson you know and we've seen obviously [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1206.8799999999999s)]
*  you know Steve Bannon who's very close and will present itself as being very pro-Israel by the way [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1214.0s)]
*  um but clearly dissenting on the question of Iran I mean they're not dissenting he's not [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1220.6399999999999s)]
*  dissenting on the humanity of Palestinians um they're about being dragged into forever [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1226.56s)]
*  wars by Israel basically and also you know why don't they need to stand in their own two feet [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1231.28s)]
*  god bless them that they need to do their own thing rather than keep coming to daddy um yeah I [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1235.84s)]
*  mean and also you know I mean Piers Morgan's kind of his politics or whatever really but I mean [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1241.36s)]
*  you've seen him he's sort of beginning to shift a bit um well he shifts erratically what do you [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1247.04s)]
*  think what do you I mean does that is that what do you make of all that the kind of the significance [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1254.8s)]
*  of what's happening there so so on the one hand I mean it's um it's interesting to see because [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1259.6799999999998s)]
*  these are like the you know Dave Smith and like Tucker Carlson and all of these individuals are [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1271.6799999999998s)]
*  the people who would like lead this far-right movement that you're describing that might win [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1278.1599999999999s)]
*  so even if even if we end up with like far-right fascist governments in in the west um that doesn't [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1282.4799999999998s)]
*  guarantee that they will be unapologetically pro-Israel in the way that like Trump is [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1289.36s)]
*  demonstrating right now with with he really wanted a 12-day war he didn't want a 13-day war [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1293.1999999999998s)]
*  because he wanted to like you know say that it was a 12-day war and so he got mad at Israel over [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1299.04s)]
*  nothing um that is just ego but there is an alternative that so-called quote quote unquote [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1303.84s)]
*  woke right that is ideological about this so even if they like even if the far-right wins there is [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1311.6s)]
*  an argument to say that doesn't necessarily mean that they will be pro-Israel the so so that that [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1316.48s)]
*  also factors into the calculations I think of the Israeli government now I guess in the context of [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1322.96s)]
*  this shift what what what really um what I really don't like is that like we're we're talking about [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1328.32s)]
*  like we can trace this discussion this debate about whether or not Israel has gone too far [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1336.08s)]
*  in the right to that you know Dave Smith versus Douglas Murray at in Joe Rogan episode and what [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1340.6399999999999s)]
*  what really what kills me is um there was an entire discussion about expertise um that had [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1346.56s)]
*  zero involvement from uh academics and from people who have actual expertise in the subject um [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1352.56s)]
*  and I feel like the discourse that we are seeing shaped right now is being led um mostly by um [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1358.32s)]
*  political commentators comics um comedians and like people who um I mean get to shape discourse [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1365.76s)]
*  of course but I would say I'm disappointed at the fact that if you see the representatives of like [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1374.72s)]
*  academia that are talking about Israel past and they get exposure uh in the topic of Israel past [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1381.52s)]
*  you have John Spencer who's at West Point um who is completely out of line with the academic [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1386.8s)]
*  consensus on what is happening right now in the Middle East um Natasha Housework when he does [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1393.2s)]
*  videos with Netanyahu calls him sir I think yeah I mean there's this there's this um mismatch [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1398.48s)]
*  between what I discuss in workshops and conferences with academics where like there's [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1408.08s)]
*  broad agreement there's some disagreement but there's broad agreement that what's happening [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1413.28s)]
*  is a genocide that Israel's use of humanitarian law is like completely um out of step with with [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1416.8799999999999s)]
*  normal you know um analysis of the law that Israel's attack on Iran was unlawful um and then what I see [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1425.2s)]
*  on tv and so I'm I'm I guess I'm worried at the lack of um importance that people who study this [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1432.6399999999999s)]
*  for a living have in shaping discourse and I don't want to get into this like argument of like [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1441.28s)]
*  oh you need to you need to have PhD to talk about this not at all in the country I think we need [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1445.44s)]
*  diverse opinions we need journalists we need human rights advocates we need you know uh [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1449.2s)]
*  demonstrators but what I don't see in this shift in this course is uh participation from academia [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1453.12s)]
*  uh like which is why like you were mentioning that I try to engage with the public more that [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1462.08s)]
*  that's why I created a pitch channel that's why I created a youtube channel because I feel like [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1466.16s)]
*  it's not that it should only be academics who talk about this it's it's that right now we are [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1469.92s)]
*  not part of that conversation uh and that is that is disappointing to me so so if I if I can frame [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1474.72s)]
*  this in in any way it's like it's great to see that the tide is turning it's sad to see why it's [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1479.6s)]
*  turning it's turning for reasons that have to do with like the political interests of the UK France [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1486.3999999999999s)]
*  and Canada that like want to like move towards a two-state solution sometime soon and there's [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1491.84s)]
*  going to be this conference at the end of this month um to discuss um well I don't know if they're [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1497.04s)]
*  going to recognize the Palestinian state or not at this point but like to discuss moving forward [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1502.8799999999999s)]
*  with a two-state solution and this like quote unquote woke right that wants to like criticize [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1506.3999999999999s)]
*  Israel out of anti-interventionism and like isolationism not necessarily out of a concern [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1511.12s)]
*  with not at all as a concern of with colonialism or imperialism or human rights of Palestinians [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1516.48s)]
*  so yeah I'm I'm I'm frustrated with the state of discourse right now I mean on [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1522.4s)]
*  you know Israel and international humanitarian law and so on I mean so much of what Israel has [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1529.68s)]
*  done is I mean it's hideously dystopian really I mean I've said this a lot I think it is important [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1536.8000000000002s)]
*  that you know whatever the details you you know dynamics you understand and history and context [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1544.48s)]
*  almost in it they you should tell yourself a lot I can't actually believe this is happening [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1550.96s)]
*  um and the so-called you know Gaza humanitarian foundation is an example of just really [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1555.44s)]
*  horrifying dystopian elements of what Israel is doing and the way it behaves and operates [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1566.72s)]
*  so you you get rid of the established humanitarian system which you already were obliterating like [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1572.24s)]
*  exterminating aid workers stopping aid getting in and which even the likes of David Cameron the [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1578.4s)]
*  former conservative foreign secretary and the US government absolutely details but didn't act on [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1584.24s)]
*  breaking their own laws which is to not provide military assistance to countries which are not [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1589.44s)]
*  facilitating the distribution of US aid um but you know well they they got rid of that system [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1595.52s)]
*  replaced it with this genuinely just completely dystopian nightmare which is limited food which [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1602.64s)]
*  is often not usable like for example dried pasta you can't cook because they've stopped the means [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1609.6000000000001s)]
*  of cooking pasta from getting in that kind of thing will flour you can't cook you can't cook it [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1614.0800000000002s)]
*  um and you uh you then put you know get these um you know mercenaries to man it and and then [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1619.2800000000002s)]
*  you massacre people as they get the food what do you make of it just in terms of the I mean [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1630.0s)]
*  is there a precedent for this I mean it always seems as well that you can't really you know [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1635.92s)]
*  because what they're doing here is gaslighting the world I mean it's interesting the first time [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1640.08s)]
*  it happens is it's big it's like Alsheba hospital got involved at the beginning a big hoo-ha because [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1643.04s)]
*  it's seen as a very fucking lunatic thing to do to massacre innocent people who are starving to death [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1648.08s)]
*  like that sort of scene thing to do so there's a kind of like well who did it and they do the [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1654.64s)]
*  gaslighting wasn't asked didn't happen that kind of thing and and then you know um CNN did a detailed [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1658.96s)]
*  expose so occasionally these media outlets they do a deconstruction it's too late too little too [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1664.48s)]
*  late no enough prominence and it's orphaned it's siloed it's not as detached from the wider reporting [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1670.24s)]
*  which then just goes back to Israel says this as though it's a credible claim it's like groundhog day [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1676.0s)]
*  but they went through it and you know one of the first one of the first aid massacres what an [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1681.28s)]
*  expression and and made and it was very clear that was Israel that did it you know they they [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1685.84s)]
*  took from the bullets direction I mean it's a militarized zone which Israel is is the Israeli [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1690.1599999999999s)]
*  army is entirely you know it's like the idea oh there's another armed group massive what are you [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1697.04s)]
*  talking about but I mean what do you make of it because it is I don't know I mean you know the [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1700.8s)]
*  way they you know I mean it's just it's it's it's a dystopian violation of international humanitarian [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1707.36s)]
*  law which they they I mean why are they doing it do you think what's the purpose in doing it and [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1714.16s)]
*  what would you make of the way they they're getting away with it I mean you just get these massacres [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1720.0800000000002s)]
*  every day and you you really have to do some digging to to find out about them yeah uh so [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1724.48s)]
*  there is an important concept here that South Africa mentioned in its um opening remarks in the [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1731.28s)]
*  genocide case at the ICJ and also that Francesca Alvarez has coined a humanitarian camouflage in [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1737.2s)]
*  her reporting her first report on anatomy on a genocide covered anatomy of a genocide covered [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1742.96s)]
*  this concept that she has um explained as um using the law to hide systematic killing of civilians [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1748.0s)]
*  so for example she makes the claim of um it is under international humanitarian law if if a [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1758.64s)]
*  civilian object is being used for military purposes it becomes a military target while that use is [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1765.68s)]
*  happening this is occurring and so but that's one thing another thing is to say okay so there is a [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1771.44s)]
*  cache of weapons on the basement of this like 20 story high residential building uh where 200 [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1777.28s)]
*  people live okay so since there's a weapons cache there it's being used for military purposes so I [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1782.48s)]
*  can destroy the entire building and kill 50 people right and destroy I don't know 50 homes [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1787.44s)]
*  right so it doesn't matter how much civilian damage I cause um because I mean there's a there's a [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1796.56s)]
*  legal justification right um and when you do that enough at the end of the day it's terrible when [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1802.8799999999999s)]
*  you do it in isolation but when you do it in a systematic fashion it becomes suspicious that [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1810.48s)]
*  what you're actually trying to hide is you're actually trying to help to kill as many civilians [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1814.96s)]
*  as you can you're just doing it by saying oh look there's a gun here there's a tunnel here there's a [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1818.56s)]
*  whatever here and you end up or I mean you end up killing people almost systematically right and [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1823.2s)]
*  I think this is a common conception of genocide genocides are usually systematic in nature [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1830.48s)]
*  um it's it's very difficult to have like one ton killing in in in genocide because you need this [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1837.92s)]
*  like sort of like mindset of let's destroy the population um and so all genocides have this [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1844.48s)]
*  systematic way of occurring like in in in in Rwanda it was going house to house with a machete [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1851.76s)]
*  right um in in well in the Holocaust of course it was the gas chambers and and like the the systematic [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1857.52s)]
*  extermination with the Einsatzgruppen and all of that um all genocides have this systematic element [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1863.2s)]
*  and the idea of the humanitarian camouflage had been at until now the clearest example that what [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1869.68s)]
*  was going on in Gaza was systematic it was being hidden camouflage behind an interpretation of the [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1876.64s)]
*  laws and then came the Gaza humanitarian foundation and I think this is the clearest example of [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1881.2s)]
*  systematic killing and systematic displacement in this whole process um of like genocide in Gaza [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1887.52s)]
*  because here's what you do you you you create a situation that sets the conditions for massacres [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1895.92s)]
*  right you put three distribution centers in Gaza only in the like two in the south and like one [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1902.8s)]
*  in the center and then you plan for one more but clearly insufficient um centers for such a large [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1910.16s)]
*  population such crammed population such a starving population no uh none of them in the north in Gaza [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1916.88s)]
*  city where you have actually sent people there were these like huge videos of like masses of [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1922.8000000000002s)]
*  Palestinians marching back north and you are then putting these centers in the center and the south [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1927.0400000000002s)]
*  so people from the north have to be forcefully displaced again because they either starve or [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1933.44s)]
*  march south across the net-serving corridor across all the death zones that Israel has set up these [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1940.4s)]
*  invisible lines in the sand that if you cross them all of a sudden you're a valid target because [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1945.68s)]
*  you're there so you move a huge population south to displace it to empty the north in a more [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1949.68s)]
*  permanent way um than before which is now you cannot send people back because there's no food [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1957.52s)]
*  back to go to you you cannot live in the north so you're creating the conditions [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1963.12s)]
*  so that Palestinians cannot exist as a society as a group in the north of Gaza so you're emptying [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1968.0s)]
*  the north of Gaza and then when Palestinians get to your distribution centers you line them up in [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1972.72s)]
*  these like dystopian corridors of like cages and whoever gets food gets sent this like area for [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1977.2s)]
*  them to be concentrated there not necessarily to return to wherever they came from after of course [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1984.88s)]
*  running them through like AI softwares to see you identify them as a Hamas member and then if they [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1991.6s)]
*  do then off you go to be tortured um and that is just on the population moving aspect of this like [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=1996.88s)]
*  this is not a distribution this is Palestinian distribution forceful displacement um and then [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2003.3600000000001s)]
*  you get this idea of these gangs that have been established as ISIS related gangs that have been [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2010.3200000000002s)]
*  put there uh essentially basically to create problems right there's no other possible [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2014.88s)]
*  interpretation as to why you would do that um and so every now and then you get to claim over there [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2021.44s)]
*  were people that were moving suspiciously and aggressively towards the food you know starving [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2025.84s)]
*  people that were hungry and were trying to get the food and because of course there's not enough [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2029.4399999999998s)]
*  food so of course people are going to try to get the food so you create the perfect conditions for [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2033.84s)]
*  saying oh that was dangerous it was endangering my aid distribution service so I killed them [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2037.6s)]
*  so you killed 40 one day 30 another 50 another 30 the other and at the end of the day you start [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2042.56s)]
*  killing hundreds of people per week this is systematic extermination right this is as systematic [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2047.84s)]
*  as it has gotten in the uh Gaza genocide and I think it's important to say so uh because it is [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2055.76s)]
*  it is premised on a type of program that every single humanitarian entity every single humanitarian [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2062.88s)]
*  aid agency in the world rejected even the guy that they got in the beginning to do this said no no I [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2068.4s)]
*  can't do this and quits right so it's because of this it's because of this the amount of [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2074.32s)]
*  Palestinians that are being displaced and killed through the Gaza humanitarian foundation is not [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2080.88s)]
*  a bug in the system it's a feature it's what it's there to do and I think it's important to [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2085.2000000000003s)]
*  shed the light on that because it is inhumane it is systematic it is a system in place to move [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2090.56s)]
*  people around Gaza and kill people in Gaza and that is just when I think of things that that that [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2096.7200000000003s)]
*  evidence that this is an ongoing genocide the starvation campaign was a very clear one but this [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2104.0s)]
*  one is extremely clear as well it's it's planned systematic it's the it's there for everyone to see [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2109.44s)]
*  it it is frankly monstrous what's happening there every day absolutely um I mean what do you think [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2115.68s)]
*  now I mean just a couple of other things I mean one is the relationship with the US and what did [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2124.4s)]
*  you what did you make of Donald Trump apparently you know speaking about Israel in ways which you [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2128.64s)]
*  do not expect any US president to speak if we're going to be brutally honest do you think it's all [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2134.4s)]
*  just theater this is when he was you know he was he was talking about Israel and Iran like they were [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2138.56s)]
*  both naughty school children and he was the he was the very bizarre headmaster he was a headmaster [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2143.2799999999997s)]
*  um very camp um demagogic both camp and demagogic um headmaster but anyway I mean what what did he [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2151.12s)]
*  make of what he's you know because he said you know that they that you know and he was talking [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2158.96s)]
*  about is like well Israel got a bad hit he was almost kind of speaking about Iran in a kind of [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2163.36s)]
*  way well he was quite impressive what they did to Israel they did give Israel a bit of a kicking [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2167.6s)]
*  odd to be honest what do you think what do you think is the dynamic shifting um so I think [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2173.36s)]
*  it is almost inevitable for fragile masculinities to clash right so uh you have these like [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2181.52s)]
*  self-described alpha male types Netanyahu and like Trump um Trump thinks that he can solve the [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2190.0800000000004s)]
*  Middle East uh the entire Middle East in 48 hours because he's the deal guy and Netanyahu thinks [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2198.6400000000003s)]
*  that he can you know expand Israel's control over the Middle East whenever he wants he can he can [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2205.6000000000004s)]
*  occupy Mount Hebron in in Syria he can um march his troops into the Latani River in Lebanon he can [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2212.16s)]
*  apparently he's going to now annex large parts of the West Bank he can you know genocide Gaza and [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2220.7999999999997s)]
*  no one can stop him um and so when you when you combine those two toxic masculinities [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2226.7999999999997s)]
*  my my I mean I say this without any particular knowledge it's just my speculation my personal [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2232.56s)]
*  opinion on how like you know fragile toxic males uh act and behave it is inevitable that they will [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2236.72s)]
*  end up hating each other it's like if you had uh like the most predictable fight in the history [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2243.52s)]
*  of mankind was Elon Musk and Trump like those two were absolutely 100 going to fight because they [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2248.7999999999997s)]
*  were they they cannot share a single space and it's the same with Netanyahu so I feel like um [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2255.68s)]
*  um I mean I'm sure there's a more complex geopolitical analysis happening here and like [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2261.44s)]
*  military arguments and people talking in Trump's ear and I don't know Netanyahu's ear but at the [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2268.48s)]
*  end of the day uh I I think it's it's much more simple than that it's just egos run amok and it's [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2272.7200000000003s)]
*  two people that have very clear images of themselves and contradicting interests one [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2280.96s)]
*  wants a deal to be seen as the deal maker the other one wants to get you know geopolitical [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2286.08s)]
*  successes and the control of land and they just don't match so they will inevitably fight [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2292.64s)]
*  and I mean if you have predictions for the coming months and does it because I mean with Gaza [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2299.6s)]
*  you just kind of think how can this possibly just continue it it does I mean it's been wiped [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2307.52s)]
*  for the face of the earth you know and hanging over it is the US endorsed proposal to remove [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2314.8s)]
*  the entire population which you know they haven't done for many reasons yet not least because where [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2321.6800000000003s)]
*  where would they drive the survivors we don't know how many survivors there are we don't know how [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2328.8s)]
*  many they've killed and we don't know how many have already fled the kind of a lot of middle [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2332.5600000000004s)]
*  class Palestinians left Gaza towards the beginning because they could afford the extortionate fees [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2338.48s)]
*  and required people haven't for those of us who've raised money for passing your families [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2343.44s)]
*  unfortunately the crossing has been closed for very long time so we haven't managed to get them out [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2348.2400000000002s)]
*  but what do you what I mean what do you what what do you think in terms of [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2352.56s)]
*  you know that that the prospects of of of that and and I suppose I mean you know because that's the [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2356.4s)]
*  issue I suppose is that if they did that that would actually be have a searing impact on a lot [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2363.36s)]
*  of people so you think would make it worse for Israel in the long term but then in the [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2368.4s)]
*  short to medium term it means the greater Israel project is much more likely and viable [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2373.84s)]
*  so I guess it's kind of like the two things are kind of like you know aren't they kind of like [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2379.44s)]
*  what what happens what can happen quicker Israel running out of road with its western allies [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2384.56s)]
*  or just murdering and driving out enough Palestinians to forge a greater Israel [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2390.08s)]
*  yeah I think it's a very difficult moment because I think the only way to stop what's going on [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2394.56s)]
*  without it being you know Israel achieving its aims and like emptying Gaza of Palestinians [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2403.84s)]
*  annexing it and settling it is for Israel to be stopped and I don't think there's appetite [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2410.56s)]
*  in the United States for that and that could be done with a phone call I I don't see that [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2417.68s)]
*  I don't see that happening anytime soon I see the possibility that some you know European states [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2422.72s)]
*  might take some meager steps like like recognizing a Palestinian state which like would be the bare [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2431.92s)]
*  minimum that that like states should be doing at this point I see for example that the European [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2439.7599999999998s)]
*  Union might suspend the EU Israel free trade agreement all of these like palliatory consequences [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2444.4s)]
*  that might happen here and there but I don't see a way let's say a top-down way to end the genocide [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2451.76s)]
*  anytime soon so that is exceedingly frustrating and especially in the context of like in the [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2464.5600000000004s)]
*  beginning we got about a provisional measures order from the ICJ every now and then we got an [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2475.84s)]
*  advisory opinion every now and then it was a very active moment with international law and I think [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2482.0s)]
*  it gave people a perception that the objective of South Africa's claim in the ICJ was to stop the [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2486.88s)]
*  genocide and people are starting to lose faith and that okay why is the genocide still going and so [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2494.6400000000003s)]
*  I feel like the best way to shift the calculus right now is to continue to do what like the [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2501.44s)]
*  sort of Palestinian solidarity campaign has been doing which is to increase the political cost of [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2511.44s)]
*  supporting Israel with like demonstrations marches and things of the sort to evidence that this is [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2516.4s)]
*  an electorate that is not going anywhere like happened recently in New York but South Africa's [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2525.6000000000004s)]
*  claim was never going to stop the genocide it that's not how international justice works in [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2534.8s)]
*  fact the South African case against Israel has been one of the most active ones that I can think of [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2543.1200000000003s)]
*  because South Africa originally used the provisional measures phase as an attempt to create roadblocks [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2549.1200000000003s)]
*  for Israel and it worked for a while but then it became obvious that Israel was just not going to [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2554.08s)]
*  comply with any order and at some point you know South Africa needs to start focusing on its memorial [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2558.48s)]
*  and not on the provisional measures so that's what happened and so it's sort of that that sort of like [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2563.36s)]
*  started to wean the you know the novelty of the case the relevance of the case similar with the [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2567.92s)]
*  arrest warrants everyone was very excited but then at the end of the day states are acting in ways that [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2576.08s)]
*  are you know extremely disappointing and saying that they won't arrest Netanyahu or Netanyahu [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2580.16s)]
*  getting a free pass here and there or just not going to a place where they where he would be [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2586.56s)]
*  detained and so I guess it's important to see the law as like part of this political discourse that [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2590.16s)]
*  is emerging right now and and and I think it's important to understand the law not as a panacea [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2603.2s)]
*  like I said international law is a product of colonialism it was not meant to end genocides it [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2610.0s)]
*  was meant to enable genocide and so we are working with tools that are exceedingly deficient [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2615.6s)]
*  so I guess it's the other way around what will affect the law will affect the law is actually [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2623.92s)]
*  people like I've discussed this with like with like friends like what what will officially [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2635.28s)]
*  deem this a genocide will it be the international court of justice saying it is a genocide or or [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2642.64s)]
*  will it be popular discourse and and I feel like if the ICJ were forced say to issue a ruling right [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2649.04s)]
*  now is it a genocide or not the political cost of saying so would be right now would be very high [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2656.08s)]
*  for a very conservative organization like the international court of justice so this is why [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2662.7200000000003s)]
*  we got things like Sabanica we're like it's Sabanica it's a it's a genocide there there was [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2667.52s)]
*  incitement to genocide but the entire campaign was not genocidal this is how like we get these [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2671.84s)]
*  things to happen so this is the most usual practice of like there's a definition of genocide but [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2677.3599999999997s)]
*  but whenever a genocide is committed that specific genocide cannot be genocide so we like chip [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2684.3199999999997s)]
*  at the edges of the definition so that every genocide that happens cannot be a genocide so in [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2689.3599999999997s)]
*  a way I guess the silver lining of this like exceedingly frustrating history with international [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2693.9199999999996s)]
*  the cost for as we've been discussing the cost of actually saying this is a genocide [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2700.24s)]
*  has been decreasing it's now much more acceptable to say it and so I think it's the other way around [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2706.08s)]
*  it's not the ICJ that will formally say this is a genocide I think the like popular opinion the [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2712.56s)]
*  politics and the discourse surrounding this that will enable this binary of Israel the children [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2720.64s)]
*  of light versus the muslim world that is orientalized and racialized as that collapses [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2726.64s)]
*  that will enable the law to apply in a much more free environment where it will be able to be [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2732.8799999999997s)]
*  applied in a much more fair just manner than it could be today right now right so I guess I don't [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2739.2s)]
*  have a lot of hope as to like how this will end but in the interaction with the law and the [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2748.16s)]
*  interaction with discourse I do feel that in the again as I was saying like in the overall history [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2753.6s)]
*  of international law which is like 500 years of colonialism and oppression ever since the 1960s [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2759.68s)]
*  it's starting to slowly change and I feel like as of now basically because of this genocide we have [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2765.52s)]
*  the I guess there's a there's a moment in the history of international law where we might be [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2775.52s)]
*  able to too late of course come to the conclusion that yes this is a genocide because the world is [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2782.7200000000003s)]
*  moving away from the colonial and orientalist binaries in which it exists today the tragedy [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2790.96s)]
*  of all this is that this huge shift in the way the world works this huge shift in world order [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2797.2000000000003s)]
*  is being paid for with the blood of Palestinians and that is something that we cannot let people [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2803.2s)]
*  forget ignore we need to be in the streets we need to be talking about it we need to shed light into [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2812.88s)]
*  it because that is not an acceptable price and um it's it's at the end of the day international law [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2817.2s)]
*  today international law and international politics will not save the world or Palestinians [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2828.7999999999997s)]
*  what we do right now what we say and we talk about right now that's what will affect change [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2835.12s)]
*  if it becomes politically impossible to sustain a colonialist project in the middle east then [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2842.24s)]
*  things will change and the only way that that will be achieved is through um collective action [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2847.4399999999996s)]
*  it the the solution won't come from the clouds it will come from us it will come from from our [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2855.04s)]
*  conversations from our discussions from our protesting from our marching with our feet with [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvOj869lct0&t=2859.2000000000003s)]
