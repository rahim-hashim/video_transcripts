# Israel Risking 'MILLIONS OF LIVES' In Regional War Omar Badder
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woCLjvCO91Q)
*  So there was no better guest, as I'm sure you'll all know, having seen my previous interviews
*  with the wonderful Palestinian-American analyst Omar Badr, than this, the current guest who
*  I just introduced.
*  I've interviewed him two or three times now, and we've got a lot to talk about, to say
*  the least.
*  We last spoke, I think, back in January, I think, and this hideous obscenity has descended
*  into even darker depths since we spoke.
*  But it's a big honour to be able to speak to you again, so hello.
*  Yeah, thank you so much.
*  No, I really appreciate the platform as well, and it is indeed a horrific situation that
*  we can't possibly ignore, and I appreciate you bringing attention to it.
*  No, it's obviously crucial, and whatever horror I feel is obviously magnified for you.
*  So it's always a huge honour to be able to speak to you.
*  You know, let's speak with Iran, and before we came on, we were talking about there could
*  be an impending Iranian strike, and what that means for this part of the conversation.
*  So as I think stand, Iran has not responded in a military sense, though clearly Israel
*  is trying to goad Iran into a military response after particularly the bombing of the Iranian
*  embassy in Damascus, I have to say.
*  I mean, we would just often lose a bit of perspective here.
*  Whatever people think about the Iranian regime, part of that, if the British embassy was bombed
*  in a foreign country by another power, or the American embassy somewhere was bombed,
*  can you literally just imagine everyone?
*  There would be a military response very quickly.
*  So what's going on here?
*  I mean, Netanyahu is trying to regionalize this war, isn't he?
*  So what's that all about?
*  Tell me what you think.
*  Sure.
*  No, I think this is exactly right.
*  We are in a situation in which there is one goal that Israel is succeeding in achieving
*  in Gaza, which is to destroy Gaza and punish the civilian population in the hopes of making
*  Gaza unlivable and finding a way to, again, to quote Benjamin Netanyahu himself, thin
*  out the population in Gaza.
*  That onslaught and that horrific project is ongoing and it is effectively succeeding.
*  But the underlying strategic goals that Israel had announced to the world in terms of defeating
*  Hamas and ending their rule in Gaza and retrieving the hostages, none of these seem to be on
*  the horizon six months into a campaign that is far longer than any kind of conflict that
*  Israel had engaged in before.
*  So there is a clear failure.
*  There are no closer.
*  They're feeling completely impotent in terms of being able to produce an image of victory
*  to the Israeli public.
*  And in the face of that, they are looking for ways out.
*  And one possible way out is to widen this confrontation, to take the pressure that Netanyahu
*  is currently feeling from his own population.
*  I'm sure you've seen the massive protests that we've seen everywhere of people demanding
*  a deal that would retrieve the hostages.
*  And Netanyahu cannot afford to do that.
*  He knows what the ultimate consequence of behaving reasonably here would be, which is
*  to refocus attention on himself and his personal failures.
*  So he is looking for a regional confrontation with Iran, specifically looking to drag the
*  US into a confrontation with Iran, because I don't think Israel would fare very well
*  in a regional confrontation without US and Western backing.
*  And we've seen this extremely provocative attack on the Iranian consulate in Damascus.
*  I mean, you'd have to be insane to imagine that Iran would not respond.
*  So they are inviting an inevitable response.
*  And Israel is already drawing all kinds of lines about what an Iranian response would
*  trigger, saying that if an attack occurs from Iranian territory, then Israel is going to
*  respond in Iranian territory as well.
*  They're raising the stakes substantially.
*  And they are basically trying to squeeze Iran into a situation where either they capitulate
*  completely or they find themselves on this risk of a major regional war, because Iran
*  does not want a regional war.
*  It does not serve its interests.
*  They frankly would prefer for things to remain somewhat calm and put together.
*  But you can't kill Iranians in a consulate in a foreign country and not to expect a response.
*  And the most tragic part of this, Owen, is that the US engagement on this has been absolutely
*  just despicable.
*  First, there is no condemnation of bombing of a foreign country's embassy or consulate.
*  That in itself seems a little bit ridiculous.
*  But on top of that, you have the US Secretary of Defense committing the US to defending
*  Israel from any Iranian response.
*  Keep in mind that Netanyahu did not give the US heads up about the fact that this strike
*  was happening.
*  So you're basically saying that Netanyahu has the ability to drag the US into a war
*  whenever they feel like it, because we're committing the United States to tolerate whatever
*  provocations Israel engages in and still committing to also defending them from any repercussions
*  from these kinds of actions.
*  This is all an extremely dangerous situation.
*  A regional war that involves direct confrontation between Israel and Iran would have absolutely
*  devastating consequences for the entire region.
*  It's not something that can be taken lightly.
*  And we are looking at potentially, not exaggeration, millions of deaths if we have a war that gets
*  completely out of control in the region.
*  It's a very, very dangerous situation.
*  Wow, that really is chilling.
*  I mean, in terms of why we think this in terms of the context.
*  So we have A, Benjamin Netanyahu wants to drag this out so he's not removed from power
*  and possibly ends up in jail.
*  B, the strategic defeat.
*  We've seen, obviously, the apocalyptic horror unleashed against Gaza and its people.
*  Six months, Israel, the military, which tells itself as one of the world's most advanced
*  an area the size of East London.
*  And yet they haven't defeated Hamas after six months.
*  I mean, there was a report in an Israeli newspaper, it was in Ynet, it was after the withdrawal
*  from Khan Yunis, 90% of it destroyed.
*  And then it reported that Hamas had regained control over the ruins.
*  It just goes to show.
*  So you've got that.
*  And then you've got the US not using, we'll talk about this, it's still doing lots of
*  hot air and still facilitating this genocidal war, but nonetheless, under a lot of domestic
*  pressure.
*  So that would is that, I mean, that kind of deals with that, doesn't it?
*  You stage war with Iran, you extend the war, keep Netanyahu in power, distracts from Gaza
*  in terms of the failures, including retrieving hostages.
*  And also the US then will just, we've already heard from Biden, he said, is ironclad support
*  what's happened.
*  Yeah, I mean, it's honestly pathological, what we're witnessing out of the Biden administration
*  right now.
*  And Biden personally himself having this deep emotional ideological commitment to Israel,
*  right or wrong.
*  I mean, it's on a personal level, really distasteful.
*  But then when he translated into official American policy, it just makes absolutely
*  no sense.
*  The American people did not sign up for that.
*  His own base did not sign up for that.
*  There is significant opposition to the idea that the US is going to continue arming and
*  funding genocidal violence that Israel is imposing in Gaza.
*  And this idea now on top of that, that US troops might be committed to defend Israel
*  in case this war spreads.
*  I mean, just handing over policymaking and putting it in the hands of Netanyahu, a reckless
*  person who will do anything for the sake of his own personal political survival.
*  The fact that Netanyahu can then have significant leverage over what American policy is going
*  to be and what American troops might be committed to or not is completely bonkers.
*  It's crazy.
*  And you've seen to your point, there is growing domestic pressure in the United States.
*  Opinions polls show it.
*  You see it in the streets.
*  You see it in protests everywhere.
*  You see it in the fact that Biden can't speak anywhere without somebody interrupting and
*  protesting the fact that he is arming and supporting this genocide.
*  And as a result, I think Biden is taking note.
*  But so far, this has translated into a shift in rhetoric from Biden, but not a shift in
*  policy.
*  The tone of his voice, the way he engages on this issue, talking about the importance
*  of an immediate ceasefire, how Netanyahu is not handling the situation well and all of
*  that.
*  But ultimately, when push comes to shove, US military funding for Israel continues completely
*  unrestricted and unabated.
*  And it's funny because we saw the signs of a first potential real consequence of American
*  policy when they allowed for a UN Security Council resolution to pass demanding a ceasefire.
*  The Biden administration instantly undermined themselves by going out and publicly saying
*  that this was a symbolic act, that they don't really expect Israel to abide by anything,
*  that this is not really a binding action, and that it doesn't mean anything.
*  It's just very strange.
*  The insult to the intelligence of people who are complaining about American policy, that
*  you think you can try to appease people who are angry by allowing a Security Council resolution
*  to pass, but then instantly say, this is completely meaningless and symbolic and Israel is welcome
*  to do whatever the hell they want to do.
*  It's utterly ridiculous that this is the context that we're living in right now.
*  When I said it wasn't legally binding and then very sense of nationalized, I have to
*  point out, yes, it is actually.
*  Before I ask you about the domestic situation, it's really striking what you said there,
*  millions of lives at risk.
*  I'm just wondering, partly in terms of how this plays out, because you've got Hezbollah
*  in southern Lebanon, and it's been a long time.
*  I mean, there's been kind of a low level conflict being going on there all the way through the
*  Kareem Horan Gaza.
*  In terms of a full blown confrontation, that's not happened for a very long time now.
*  Hezbollah now is very different from where it was in 2006.
*  I'm just wondering, what do you think would happen in terms of how this escalates?
*  Because you've got obviously Iran has a power, you've also got Hezbollah.
*  What are the dynamics do you think it plays in terms of how that could escalate?
*  Yeah, I mean, I think that is in terms of where the physical battlefield would be.
*  I think Lebanon is definitely in the crosshairs as the primary battlefield in this wider regional
*  war, because Hezbollah based in Lebanon is the single most powerful ally that Iran has
*  in the region.
*  And because of proximity to Israel, also the biggest threat to Israel in terms of their
*  physical capabilities.
*  And the last time there was an all out conflict between Hezbollah and Israel was in 2006,
*  nearly 20 years ago.
*  And even then, Hezbollah's threats that they would retaliate to any strikes on Beirut by
*  striking Tel Aviv, stopped Israel from actually striking Beirut.
*  So that's the level of deterrence they had back then.
*  And right now, they are infinitely more powerful.
*  They have far bigger rockets, precision guided, they can hit every point in all of Israel
*  from north to south.
*  And they're capable of producing very significant casualties and destroying infrastructure
*  in Israel in ways that are similar of what Israel is capable of doing in Lebanon.
*  So this is not to say that one side can defeat the other in any kind of conclusive way, but
*  it is to say that any all out war between Hezbollah and Israel would almost imminently
*  mean massive widespread destruction both in Lebanon and in Israel.
*  And that's a prospect that again, any sane human being would be doing everything they
*  possibly can to avoid.
*  But you have a level of hubris, a level of arrogance and a level of commitment to this
*  need to put the Arabs back into their place in that racist mindset of people like Netanyahu
*  and Smotrich and the rest of them in that government in Ben-Gvir that they might actually
*  be willing to go that far and they might be willing to put the region in an extremely
*  difficult situation for the sake of restoring what they describe as deterrence.
*  But what they mean by deterrence is just simply everybody bowing their heads down and accepting
*  that Israel is a country that is above the rules and above the law that gets to do whatever
*  they want without anybody ever challenging them and just accepting that dynamic, which
*  is just fundamentally unsustainable.
*  I think hubris is an excellent word to be using in the circumstances and anyone who's
*  familiar with Greek tragedies knows that's followed by nemesis, which can be in this
*  case, as you know, a very violent nemesis at that.
*  In terms of the US domestic situation, which you've already alluded to, so a new poll came
*  out by YouGov which showed that 36% of Americans believe Israel is committing genocide against
*  Palestinian civilians compared to 34% who disagree.
*  So that is obviously, there's a large number still in the not sure category, 30%.
*  But amongst people under 30, 42% think Israel is committing genocide compared to 24% who
*  disagree with 33% unsure.
*  When it comes to Joe Biden's own voters, the results are overwhelming.
*  57% of Biden voters think Israel is committing genocide, just 15% say it isn't.
*  Trump supporters, 15% say genocide, 63% say it isn't.
*  There's also interest in quite a big gender split.
*  37% of American women think Israel is committing genocide, 27% disagree.
*  American men, 41% say it isn't, 35% say it is.
*  Also alongside race, white Americans, I don't think that's surprising.
*  I'll file a site to say it's genocide than black and Latino Americans.
*  I mean, just because some people, I share this with people like, how can they not be
*  higher?
*  How can it not be higher?
*  I think, you know what, on October the 9th, when Gallant made his statement about human
*  animals and blocking all of life's essentials, I called that genocidal rhetoric.
*  And I paused at the time because I thought, is everyone just going to think I sound absurd
*  and ridiculous and extreme?
*  We're now at the situation where in America, where support for Israel is almost treated
*  as an article of faith.
*  If you don't have unequivocal support, you derange lunatic and extremist.
*  You're outside the parameters of normal political conversation.
*  That's been the case for a while, hasn't it?
*  Amongst the Republicans and the Democrats.
*  And that position has shifted.
*  But also, it's not like the American media is talking about genocide.
*  That's not a discussion.
*  So these figures are pretty striking, aren't they?
*  The fact that now more Americans than not think genocide is being committed by a state
*  armed and backed by the administration with a vast majority of Biden's own voters thinking
*  he is facilitating a genocide.
*  It is absolutely remarkable.
*  And that context that you're describing, Owen, is absolutely critical as well.
*  We are talking about an environment in which American media across the entire spectrum
*  is effectively doing PR for Israel at different degrees.
*  You've got the right-wing media that just portrays Israel the good guys,
*  Palestinians the bad guys, and every Palestinian death is either deserved or terrorists or human
*  shields or all these tired talking points.
*  And then you've got the more liberal end of the spectrum in terms of mainstream media
*  that describes Palestinian casualties as unintended collateral damage,
*  that Israel feels bad, that civilians are dying.
*  That's kind of the framing.
*  And across that entire spectrum, nowhere do we see real meaningful accountability for Israeli
*  actions or an accurate portrayal of Israel's intentions, which its leaders are stating
*  quite openly and explicitly.
*  This difference between Israeli bluntness, if you turn on Israeli media and you watch
*  the discussions that are happening on their shows, the genocidal intent is extremely explicit.
*  They are talking about mass murdering people in Gaza and about devastating the population there.
*  Including children.
*  They're openly talking about children on Israeli television as we need to kill them
*  because they'll turn out to be terrorists.
*  100%.
*  That is the rhetoric and that is completely normalized in Israeli society and Israeli media.
*  And it's reflected in actual policies on the ground.
*  We've had multiple American doctors who have been to Gaza to try to help people.
*  And they say that it's simply standard that you have young Palestinian children, five, six,
*  seven, eight years old with single sniper bullets to the head as the reason why they're dead.
*  I mean, this is a policy of actually murdering the civilian population, including children
*  that is unfolding, but you would not know it watching American media.
*  And on top of that, you've got the discourse in the American political establishment also across
*  the entire spectrum, completely supportive, barring a few handful of exceptions.
*  Bernie Sanders has finally come around now to talk about this policy as being unacceptable.
*  Israel's policy is being absolutely horrific and demanding an end to US military funding
*  for the Netanyahu government.
*  That is a significant change that we had not seen before.
*  You've got a handful of other senators doing the same.
*  You've got a handful of members of Congress who are also using that similar rhetoric.
*  But those are exceptions.
*  And when they do say it, we fight tooth and nail to make sure that these statements get out there
*  and that people know they're happening because the coverage has been so completely awful.
*  So between that political establishment being unrelentingly pro-Israel and media coverage being
*  just as bad, it is quite surprising that Americans actually know that Israel is committing genocide
*  in Gaza.
*  And that is in large part due to the fact that the images that Israel's own savagery in Gaza
*  is so blatant and so over the top that even all this propaganda that we're witnessing is not able
*  to cover it up.
*  And we see it in more specific examples.
*  I mean, it's quite, again, horrific with the killing of the World Center kitchen staff.
*  Just seven internationals who are there to provide humanitarian aid to Palestinians get killed.
*  And suddenly people start paying attention because we got used to the dehumanization
*  of Palestinians.
*  You can hear about Palestinians being massacred by the thousands and people don't bat an eye.
*  But suddenly you catch on to the fact that Israel not only killed these international humanitarian
*  activists, but that an Israeli drone targeted them and was chasing them deliberately from one
*  car to the other.
*  There's just no dispute about the fact that this is a deliberate act of murder.
*  And frankly, the underlying reason for it is also unsurprising when you listen to Israeli
*  politicians talking about wanting to bring Gaza down to its knees by blocking food and fuel and
*  water and electricity.
*  Clearly the people who are helping get food into Gaza are violating that policy and therefore
*  eliminating the would be elementary common sense from the perspective of people who back
*  Israeli policy as explicitly stated.
*  So that's beginning to also get people's attention that it's not just Palestinians dying, that this
*  murderous policy is actually reaching people who look like Europeans.
*  And therefore that ends up being a reason for people to open their eyes.
*  As disappointing as it is that Palestinian lives are not valued, there is still a silver lining in
*  the fact that people are at least paying a little bit more attention right now because somebody
*  like Jose Andreas, who leads the World Central Kitchen, has plenty of credibility in elite
*  circles in Washington, D.C.
*  And when he starts talking about this as a deliberate target of killing, it's difficult for
*  politicians to continue to regard it entirely.
*  I mean, on that, you know, I pointed this out and, you know, I'm not doing this to attack him now,
*  given the circumstances, but in the, I think, 10 days after this all horror began, a Spanish minister
*  called out Israeli war crimes, including collective punishment, the intentional blocking of aid from
*  getting in.
*  And he denounced her on social media.
*  I mean, he tweeted calling for her to be sacked, suggested that he was pro-Hamas and pro-Russia,
*  implied that, you know, he was someone who was obviously very well and backed Israel's onslaught.
*  He was someone very well disposed towards Israel and now says this is a war on humanity itself
*  because he's obviously, his dogma has collided reality.
*  And the other point about World Central Kitchen, it's not just the fact they, you know, they were
*  tracking these people for days, by the way.
*  The World Central Kitchen, I suppose, they have a deal with the IDF.
*  We can see why.
*  And this was a pre-approved route.
*  Their location was shared.
*  The coordinates, they had World Central Kitchen in massive letters on the trucks.
*  And as you say, they hit first and chased until they were all killed.
*  And it's now come out that the commander who was dismissed from the IDF as a telegraph,
*  right-wing newspaper has revealed that commander is a right-wing settler who in January wrote an
*  signed an open letter calling for aid to be cut off from Gaza.
*  So the guy who blew up trucks, which caused international aid agencies to say they were
*  going to stop operating, called for aid to be stopped from coming into Gaza.
*  You don't have to be a tin-fork conspiracy theory, Siddy.
*  I'm going to ask about salvation before we do.
*  And the just the famine and the horrendous...
*  Yeah, before you get to that, just a quick word on Jose Andres,
*  because I think it's a really important one.
*  He frankly is a quintessential example of what Western viewership of this is actually like.
*  Because there's nothing surprising about his perspective that you view Israel as the good
*  guys instinctively, regardless of the evidence, surely they're fighting a war on terrorism and
*  surely anybody disputing their humanitarian intentions must be a conspiracy theorist or
*  whatever. And it is only because he's had an interaction in which he could not look away and
*  was forced to know the details because an incident impacted people he knows on a very personal level
*  that he's finally seen the light. You honestly could just look at that as exactly what every
*  person needs is to be forced to actually look at the details and examine them for themselves,
*  as opposed to relying on these preconceived notions of what Israel is to be confronted by
*  the reality of what Israel is today and what its government is and how they behave and the
*  rhetoric they use and the actions they take. You would come to very, very different conclusions.
*  This entire silly idea that the Israeli government are the quote unquote like us and the other side
*  is the terrorists is undermined by the fact that the Israeli government rhetoric is very openly
*  racist and genocidal and murderous and their actions are the very definition of terrorism.
*  Using violence against civilians, murderous violence against civilians in order to change
*  political outcomes and achieve political outcomes that they can't achieve otherwise.
*  That is a government that can only be described as a terrorist organization in my view. And yes,
*  any kind of closer look that you take a look at that you have and any kind of closer engagement
*  that you have with examining those facts can only lead to that inevitable conclusion and it
*  will open everybody's eyes to actually see it. Absolutely. State terrorism on a grand scale and
*  he now is talking about the war on humanity, which he wouldn't have done in your eye unless
*  he'd suddenly been forced to collide a reality. Before I ask you just more about what's happening
*  in Gaza, Donald Trump not been talking about as much as I should have done probably to be honest.
*  The presidential election is six and a half, just less than seven months away, isn't it?
*  He's got every chance of winning, partly because as much as a lot of Biden supporters are going to
*  spend their time screaming at people how morally outrageous they are. They'll say to people who
*  are disillusioned by this, you're a disgrace if you don't vote for these, you're far out.
*  You know, this is really often the well-known effective strategy to get people to vote for you,
*  call them like idiots and stupid and outrageous. We hate you vote for us or you're scum. We still
*  think you're scum, but vote for us anyway. Donald Trump, they could win. Now what is going on with
*  Donald Trump on this position? Because actually, I mean, he's not been that visible in lots of ways,
*  but maybe actually that's because a lot of what he's saying has not been covered properly.
*  Yeah, I think it's funny because there is a deliberate attempt at this point of the American,
*  again, political establishment, media establishment, the idea that they've given
*  Trump too much leeway the first time around may have enabled him in doing so. And so there is,
*  frankly, a lot less coverage of what Trump is saying and doing. Nonetheless, he does have a
*  very chance of actually winning in large part due to Israel's backing of Israeli policies, that this
*  is diminishing Biden's support in key states, swing states that could actually determine the
*  outcome of the election. And it's funny because there is a personal contrast between Trump and
*  Biden in terms of the personal commitments. I don't think Trump cares about Israel one way or
*  the other. Trump is exclusively interested in himself and could not care less about foreign
*  policy issues on merit. Nonetheless, as opposed to Biden, of course, who has a very deep personal
*  commitment to Israel, that much is obvious. But nonetheless, Trump understands how to manipulate
*  the situation in his favor. And he understands where the Republican base is on this issue,
*  which is far more extreme in terms of their pro-Israel sentiment. So he knows that this is
*  a position that he should be taking. And he also knows how to get Biden in a tough situation.
*  Trump has made note of the size of the pro-Palestine protests that have been taking place
*  in the United States. Solidarity with Palestinians and with Gaza is something that Trump has remarked
*  on. And I think as a result, he knows that this is a problem for Biden. And you find Trump now very
*  cynically saying things like, I think it was just yesterday he may have put out the statement,
*  saying that Biden is quote, 100% pro-Palestinian. And essentially saying that anybody who cares
*  about Israel should be supporting Trump's presidency as opposed to Biden's. Again, it's
*  quite laughable, the idea that six months of enabling anti-Palestinian genocide is the 100%
*  pro-Palestinian position. And it just, you know, lets your imagination run wild to think of what's
*  the anti-Palestinian position then that Trump is going to be advocating for. But also I think
*  he's goading Trump into displaying his pro-Israel chops. He sees that Biden is beginning to soften
*  a little bit, at least in terms of his rhetoric. And by calling Biden anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian,
*  he's effectively trying to push Biden to demonstrate that he's not by pursuing even
*  more aggressively pro-Israel positions, which would undermine Biden's support with his own base
*  and actually increases the chances that Trump could capitalize on that and get himself to win
*  the election. So the entire thing is incredibly cynical. But again, it's just to think of it from
*  the perspective of people who care about basic decency and humanity and human rights, that you
*  do have a genocide enabler running against somebody who's promising to be worse. It's an
*  absolutely disgusting political climate in this country right now in terms of the options that
*  are viable. And it shouldn't be that way, that if democracy is supposed to genuinely represent
*  and reflect the views of the population, there should be candidates falling over each other,
*  trying to capitalize on the fact that Americans don't want support for this massacre and do want
*  to see a ceasefire and do want to see this massacre end. And that's not at all where the
*  political conversation is, which really highlights the limits, the imperfections, to put it even
*  mildly, of American democracy, that just the views of the elites and American policy does not in any
*  way reflect American public opinion on a very wide range of issues. And this is a very obvious one of
*  them. Strong same here. I just want to talk to you about a horrific expose, well, brilliant expose
*  about something absolutely horrific. I've covered it on this. It was by Plus970 magazine. It's an
*  Israeli-Palestinian magazine by the brilliant investigative, the Israeli investigative journalist
*  Yuval Abraham, based on six Israeli intelligence sources about an AI system called Lavender,
*  which basically automates the killing of so-called low-level Hamas operatives, which is not actually
*  defined in any meaningful way anyway, where it will kill up to 15 to 20 civilians per
*  minute. Low-level so-called targets are deemed acceptable collateral damage. It's not even
*  always clear if that target is home. And they even note themselves in inaccuracy in it. They drop dumb
*  bombs, which kill vast numbers of people on the basis more high-tech bombs are expensive, and they
*  don't want to waste bombs, they say, on expensive bombs on these people. It includes the system where
*  they wait for them to come home is where the kids are, and they kill them at home.
*  Where's daddy? I raised this. I was on Sky News the other week. Always a pleasure never
*  talking on British news television to talk about this issue and other issues. And they didn't want
*  to talk about it. It hasn't got the coverage it deserves. It's like industrialized extermination.
*  What are your thoughts about it? Because... Yeah, it's again, I mean, just words
*  escape you to try to describe a system that is that horrific. I mean, look, it's a thinly veiled
*  effort by Israel to cover for what it's doing in Gaza, right? They have every intention to destroy
*  Gaza and to devastate the civilian population. But rather than openly state that this is their aim,
*  they hand over the system to artificial intelligence to determine tens of thousands of
*  speculative targets of where militants might be, and then say, we don't care about the civilian
*  death toll, they can raise the threshold to 20 people for lower level militants and more than
*  100 people for high level commanders. If you're having artificial intelligence pick tens of
*  thousands of targets, and your policy is we don't care how many civilians we kill in the process,
*  you can have the pretense that you're targeting civilians when everybody understands that what
*  that policy describes is the mass slaughter of the civilian population of Gaza. That is what the
*  system serves. And this idea of waiting for, again, speculative militants to be home,
*  I mean, that's just a very transparent violation of international law, that combatants are
*  combatants only when they are engaged in combat, when they are armed and engaging in hostilities.
*  And if you're at home with your family, that's not a legitimate target by any stretch of the
*  imagination. And if you do want to indulge Israel's idea that anybody who's even loosely
*  affiliated with Hamas going home is still a legitimate target, and that you can drop a bomb
*  and kill them along with their family, that very same logic, if you extended it to October 7th,
*  for example, when you think of all the military-aged people who were at the festival,
*  you could make the argument by that logic that these were also militants and you would just
*  change the entire conversation about this. And yet when Hamas kills military-aged Israelis
*  who are in a civilian context, everybody understands that that is terrorism, correctly,
*  but when Israel does it, we give them so much leeway on the idea that, oh, well,
*  this is where they can find them and that's what you do. I mean, it's all incredibly cynical. And
*  again, there is no hiding the fundamental racism that is underlying behind that discrepancy in the
*  way that people judge Israel's actions versus Hamas's actions. Waiting for people in order to
*  avoid engaging them on the battlefield where it's more difficult to kill them, to wait for them to
*  be home in order to drop a dumb bomb and eliminate them along with their entire family.
*  It's an absolutely horrific act. I just don't know how any person with any kind of moral sense can
*  defend policies like that. And yet this is the stated Israeli policy being carried out thousands
*  of times over and over and over again with devastating consequences. And people look at
*  it and just kind of throw their hands up in the air and go, well, I guess nothing too different
*  from what you expected and not even worth covering. That is an absolutely glaring and
*  disgusting double standard. And it's leading to the very consequences that we are witnessing,
*  which is that Israel is running rampant on this rampage all over the place, mass murdering people
*  leading to a very significant potential regional confrontation. And nobody's appreciating the
*  magnitude of the situation. Nobody's pointing out the insanity of it, that the entire world now is
*  on the cusp of a possible regional war. That's going to be absolutely devastating. And it all
*  stems from Western government's inability to put, and actually not inability, unwillingness. I think
*  we should be careful about the way we use those words. They were absolutely able to put an end
*  to this disgusting and horrific massacre. They choose not to because they lack the backbone
*  to stand up to the Israeli government and cut off the weapons supply. And that refusal
*  to end Western participation in this massacre is bringing the world to the brink. And it's just
*  utter madness that nobody's standing up and calling this out for what it is.
*  Related to that, I just wanted to talk about state-sanctioned famine, starvation. Famine is
*  now, in fact, US officials come out and said that famine has started in northern Gaza,
*  where people are either, well, people have been eating animal feed, but people have already been
*  starving to death. I just want to just quote this from the London Times newspaper, which is
*  owned by Rupert Murdoch. And by the way, this is not giving credit, you'll see. Well, quite the
*  opposite. In a column, one of the columnists who did not suppose they could have spoken out against
*  the war in Gaza at the time when it started, they didn't. Perhaps the greatest tragedy is that this
*  was all predictable. It was like watching a slow motion car crash. On October 9th, the defense
*  minister, Yeov Gallant, promised to complete siege in Gaza with no lectures, as you know,
*  food, no fuel. The next day, he told Israeli chiefs he'd released all the restraints. Giora
*  Ireland, a former Israeli general, wrote the same month to make the siege effective. You have to
*  prevent others from giving assistance to Gaza. Other such statements formed a backdrop to all
*  that has happened. They plagiarized that from my column. I'm not even joking. They took it from my
*  column four days earlier, which I wrote in The Guardian. I know that because they put the whole
*  thing, they even wrote the same month. And he actually said Giora Ireland released all the
*  restraints. I missed out the the and they replicated my error. The point I'm making there is,
*  okay, this is the point I'm making. This is the biggest scandal in modern Western journalism. And
*  that is a bar to have to cross. There was the Iraq war. I'm not letting the Western media off the
*  hook in terms of other scandals. The reason I'm saying that, and you've already said this earlier
*  in this interview, is a point actually made by the brilliant, what's his name, the associate,
*  is an Israeli-American associate professor of Holocaust and genocide studies who I've interviewed.
*  Why have I just forgotten his name? He's a brilliant scholar. The point he made to me was
*  intent is so rarely explicit in the way that it is in this particular case. And it was from the
*  very beginning. They said what they were going to do. They didn't go, you don't have to go through
*  leaked documents. It's not like, you know, they were like, no, no, you know, like in Iraq, they
*  were like, no, it's humanitarian. We're going to save Iraqis from Saddam Hussein. They were like,
*  no, we're going to starve the population. And we think they're all guilty. We don't believe
*  there are any innocent civilians. And we're going to starve them and deprive them of all the basic
*  rights. And we're going to wipe guys off the map. But they said that over and over again, over and
*  over again, literally every day, defense minister, cabinet ministers, politicians, backbenchers,
*  media outlets, generals, soldiers. And none of these quotes I just read, I did a search in October,
*  not a single almost not a single newspaper or media outlet in the US or here quoted them. It's
*  as though these quotations happen in another universe. They weren't relevant somehow. But
*  you only had to listen. This is the point to what they said from the start. They're just doing what
*  they said they were going to do. And now Israel has starved the place to death. And even now,
*  supposedly, leverage is being used, trucks going in, apparently, Israel are making them so they're
*  only half full. There's not roads there. They bombed them. They're blocking them from going into
*  northern Gaza. You know, the headline today in the Guardian, AIDS still not reaching Gaza,
*  as top US official warns from, it's not that starving them to death on purpose, as they promised.
*  Sorry. It's absolutely infuriating. And the thing, Owen, is we remember that kind of
*  just shamelessness from Donald Trump. I mean, with Donald Trump, he would lie about the most trivial
*  and transparently false things. It rained during his inauguration, and he claimed that there was
*  no rain. You can watch the video. It was raining. He claimed his crowds were bigger than Obama's.
*  You put up the pictures. It's not even close. And his willingness to just say, I don't care
*  that the evidence is overwhelming. I'm just going to lie and insist on lying was kind of a
*  shocking thing to watch. And we watched American media make fun of Donald Trump for it, that his
*  capacity for lying is just incredible. And yet we don't see that same commitment to truth being
*  applied in this case of even mocking Israeli officials for claiming things that they themselves
*  have undermined by claiming other things just five minutes before. And so we do have, we do find
*  ourselves in the situation in which Israel's intent is declared as to starve the people of
*  Gaza. You have humanitarian organizations across the entire world, every single major and credible
*  independent source, confirming that they are preventing aid from going in. But then when
*  Israeli spokespeople get on Western media and they're asked about this, they go, oh, no, we
*  don't know what you're talking about. We're letting all the aid in. Hamas is stealing it.
*  Just there is not even an attempt at trying to come up with a plausible argument to explain
*  their behavior. They're just blatantly lying and counting on the fact that American journalists
*  and hosts are not going to have a follow-up question in which they call out these lies.
*  That's how you create that level of comfort with lying. It is honestly, you can reduce this entire
*  ugly, despicable crisis beyond just this point, by the way, in Gaza, but much longer as a problem
*  of American provided impunity for Israel, that Israel gets to do whatever it wants. You can't
*  bring votes against them at the UN Security Council because the US would veto them. You can't
*  try to provide any level of meaningful accountability that would impact Israel's behavior because the US
*  will continue sending weapons. And that has taught the Israelis that they can do whatever they want,
*  genuinely without consequence. And that, frankly, has encouraged streams of extremism in their
*  thinking, that the level of blatant open anti-Palestinian racism that is expressed day
*  in and day out by this government is so blatant. And the level of lying that they're engaging in
*  also is a reflection of that. That because the American political establishment provides impunity
*  for Israel in terms of policy, you've got this default position among American journalists and
*  media outlets to also provide Israel with the benefit of the doubt and never challenging their
*  claims. And that kind of impunity really allows this horror that we're witnessing to actually
*  unfold before our eyes. And there's no doubt in my mind that future generations are going to be
*  looking back at this moment and wondering how the hell did the world stand there and do nothing,
*  and what it meant for all these governments that claim to champion freedom and democracy and human
*  rights and humanity and so on, that they have facilitated this absolutely horrific massacre
*  in the face of open, transparent lies and were never willing to challenge it with anything
*  meaningful beyond the occasional word of criticism about how maybe Israel's gone too far and maybe
*  it's time to let some more aid in or whatever. Honestly, it's exactly and even this rhetoric
*  about how many trucks Israel is letting into Gaza. As you pointed out, the roads are destroyed. The
*  ability to physically distribute aid in Gaza is nearly impossible right now. You do need
*  an end to this slaughter in order for us to be able to get humanitarian aid around. But even short
*  of that, this endless debate about how many trucks are let in, is it 500? It was 200? And is that too
*  much or is it too little? Are they empty? Are they not? There's a more fundamental question
*  than nobody's asking, which is who the hell gave Israel the right to regulate how many trucks go
*  into Gaza in the first place? It is not Israeli territory. Israel should have no say in what goes
*  in and out of Gaza and how much of it goes in and out. And to be stuck in the confines of a debate
*  about how much they're letting in and not, I think is seeding a much more fundamental point
*  about the fact that Palestinians ought to be a free people. They're not children under the
*  guardianship of Israel that Israel gets to decide how much food they get. Just this entire relationship
*  is so fundamentally broken that we've come to internalize and accept to a great degree
*  the idea of Israeli control over Palestinian lives. Can you imagine a situation in which Hamas
*  is determining how much food Israelis get to eat and that the debate would be hosting a Hamas
*  spokesperson on CNN to talk about, well, we've let in this many trucks, so that's how many,
*  you know, just nobody would put up with that kind of conversation. Everybody would instantly say,
*  get your hands off of what Israelis get to eat and not eat. And that's the conversation we should
*  be having here. It should not be about the number of trucks or how much they've let in or not.
*  It should be that they should have no say whatsoever in what Palestinians have access to
*  and that the only obligation Israel has at this point is to get the hell out of Gaza
*  and to end that blockade that has existed for a couple of decades before the crisis that we're in
*  actually even unfolded. The radical concept you've introduced here into the
*  that Palestinians are actually human beings of equal worth, which is obviously something which
*  is not even on the radar of the media coverage. It's not even, I mean, it's astonishing from the
*  start to finish the lack of subtlety of even engaging in the point you just made, which should
*  be central. Just before I ask a question, find a point in terms of where things are at,
*  you know, it's notable as well that Israel is waged, destroyed much of the domestic
*  food production and agriculture. So when people talk about the aid going in as the
*  structure of the road, they're not taking into account that the need is much greater for so many
*  reasons, partly because of Israel's genocidal warfare. David Cameron, of all people, the British
*  Foreign Secretary, one of the only costs Israel has had to pay is sacking their spokesperson,
*  Elon Levy, when he said unlimited aid was getting in and then the British Foreign Secretary,
*  still arming them, made the point that Israel was putting up loads of blocks to stop aid from
*  getting in, contrary to what Elon Levy said. Just finally, I mean, I know there's an article that
*  you pointed to, which I've seen as well, which is, I think it was in NPR, which was about a
*  way to shift to low intensity warfare, that the number of Palestinians being violently blown apart,
*  as well as those named, including kids being amputated without anesthetic, has
*  decreased in the recent period. Now, I mean, notwithstanding the fact that we've seen
*  Khan Yunus, yeah, 90% destroyed, we see the prospect obviously of a violent assault on Ra'far,
*  but in these sorts of horrors, it isn't even the violent deaths that in the end kill the
*  vast majority of people. They destroyed the healthcare system, the aid's not getting in,
*  but just the healthcare system is a daily death sentence for a lot of people. Cancer patients,
*  people with heart problems, people who are infirm, pregnant women, newborn babies,
*  you could go on. Just what do you think? This whole narrative that actually the number of
*  massacres is not quite as high as it was. Yeah, it's, I mean, the article described it as low
*  intensity warfare at this point. And when you think of the number comparison, right? I mean,
*  just in the past day, more than 80 Palestinians have been killed. The day before that, 65
*  Palestinians have been killed. By any normal standard, under quote unquote normal circumstances,
*  any one of these days would be a horrific massacre that ought to grab the world's attention as a
*  horrific massacre. And yet it doesn't for two reasons. One is that Palestinians are the victims.
*  That's the obvious reason. And the second is that we've gotten accustomed to a rate of killing
*  Palestinians over the past six months. That committing massacres of this scale, where you're
*  quote unquote only killing 80 Palestinians a day, that that's considered to be low intensity,
*  speaks of, again, how much we've normalized the scale of Israeli atrocities against Palestinians
*  as a norm to be accepted that we roll along with as a tolerable status quo.
*  So, giving Israel the leeway to describe the current scale of massacres as low intensity
*  only because they had been killing more than twice as many people every day before that,
*  I think is a little bit crazy. I mean, at the height of this genocide, they were killing 136
*  children per day. And now, presumably, if you just want to do the statistical comparison,
*  maybe they're killing 30 or 40 kids every day. That's still 30 or 40 children being massacred,
*  30 and 40 parents who are losing their children. This is still an absolutely horrific situation
*  that is unfolding day after day. And I think in no universe should that ever be considered
*  low intensity. The death of a single child due to violence that is being excused and supported by
*  Western governments should never be described as low intensity. It is extremely intense and
*  horrific and despicable and ugly and demands an immediate intervention. And I think that
*  not normalizing that kind of rhetoric is really, really important. You can, by all means, if you
*  want, point out that these massacres are killing this many people as opposed to that many people,
*  but I don't think that that should be called as low intensity, especially when we have created
*  a permanent situation now in Gaza in which Palestinian death toll is inevitably going to
*  rise much, much higher. You have a situation in which thousands upon thousands of people
*  are missing under the rubble. We don't know where they are. Someone I personally know just a couple
*  of days ago discovered that their mother who had been missing for a while turned out to be dead.
*  I mean, you can presume that the tens of thousands of people who are buried under the rubble are
*  probably dead. And that means that that number just by itself in terms of who's already dead
*  is much, much higher than the numbers that have been circulating. And you add on top of that,
*  all the people who can't get medical attention, can't get healthy food, can't get clean water,
*  and the inevitable rise in that death, that is an absolutely horrific situation. It is extremely
*  intense and desperately in need of an intervention of some kind to put an end to the slaughter.
*  And even with our best efforts, if you could get a ceasefire in today, if you could stop this
*  massacre today and flood Gaza with aid and medical support, that death toll is still going to rise
*  because it is too late that you can't keep up with the rate of the destruction and desperation that
*  is currently unfolding. And again, it is all only possible because Western governments that claim to
*  represent their people, that is effectively speaking in our name and spending our money,
*  have enabled this massacre to take place and continue enabling it. It's a call for every
*  person of conscience to stand up and demand and scream as loud as they possibly can that this has
*  to come to an end. Amen. Very, very powerful words. And just on that, after October 7th, it became
*  fashionable to extrapolate the figures if you imposed them on the size of the US population.
*  And I would note that, for example, if 80 Palestinians in Gaza are killed, if you just
*  for a population that's equivalent of over 12,000 Americans a day being violently murdered
*  in warfare, and obviously, the points you made buried under the rubble, the latest estimate is
*  around 20,000 buried under the rubble on top of the official death toll of approaching 35,000 now.
*  So that would obviously increase it dramatically. People who've died, the excess deaths, I mean,
*  I interviewed the Palestinian Christian, Khalil Sayegh, who's a Palestinian Christian
*  analyst, whose father died of a heart attack because he didn't get any aid, so he died,
*  it's those sorts of examples, isn't it? It's this destruction of medical health, lack of food,
*  people starving to death. And that's why people talk about excess deaths, which is a grim clinical
*  term, but it refers to the overall who's dying as a result of the conflict, and it's much, much higher.
*  Horrible, horrifying stuff. But Omar is such a sage voice full of so much depth and more clarity,
*  which is the term, as my listeners know, I use all the time when it's appropriate. So it's been
*  a real honor as ever. And so everyone, please do share this video, leave your comments, do like,
*  subscribe, obviously. And Omar, thank you so much as ever. You've been always a brilliant voice.
*  And when I was looked at for analysis, thoughts about what's happening in Darul, obviously,
*  advise everyone to keep doing so. And obviously, we'll speak to you soon.
*  Omar Zidane Yeah, thank you so much. And I'll just say one last thing in closing,
*  and it's something that I also feel like I watch your debates with other people on British television
*  and many other places. And your courage and willingness to take absolutely, are you allowed
*  to curse on this? Yes, right away. You're willing to take absolutely no shit from anyone when you
*  can tell that they're using propaganda talking points and attempting to bully you into silence
*  by using all kinds of tropes. You standing up for them the way that you do, and insisting on telling
*  the truth, no matter how uncomfortable and how controversial, it to me is a sign that your
*  prominence in light of all that is a sign of the fact that the discourse is shifting, that people
*  like you do have a platform and a voice on more and more mainstream outlets to engage in these
*  absolutely critical conversation. And I certainly look at that as a very promising sign. I want to
*  thank you for the voice that you yourself have provided by speaking out and also the platform
*  they provide for other voices speaking truth about this very critical issue right now.
*  Well, that means a huge amount coming from you, honestly. It means a huge amount. I never forgive
*  myself for doing anything else. And what I always say is if Palestinian journalists have been
*  butchered on the ground in Gaza, if they can speak out, whatever cost people think they're going to
*  suffer in, here I am sitting inside of London in my flat with my cats, nothing will ever
*  compare to what they've gone through. So yeah, it's a big honour. Thank you so much.
*  Yeah, thank you. Take care.
