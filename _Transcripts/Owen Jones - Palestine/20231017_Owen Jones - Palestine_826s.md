# Israel's Ambassador LIES Through Her Teeth
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [October 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4)
*  The interview I'm about to show you is an absolute shocker. It exposes how the Israeli state is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=0.0s)]
*  twisting reality, gaslighting us and justifying the mass slaughter of innocent people. It's very [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  important that this propaganda is dissected and exposed for exactly what it is. Now a bit of [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  context, the interview is with Zippy Hotevelli. She's Israel's ambassador to the UK. Who is she [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=16.64s)]
*  first? Now she opposes any independent Palestinian state. She supports a greater Israel based on the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=22.72s)]
*  permanent annexation of all the occupied territories which she calls Judea and Samaria. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=29.04s)]
*  Her view is that means not just annexing the West Bank and East Jerusalem but Gaza as well. She once [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=34.96s)]
*  declared the land is ours, all of it is ours. We did not come here to apologize for that. She's [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=41.6s)]
*  even condemned the board of deputies of British Jews for backing a two-state solution claiming an [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  organization that supports the establishment of a Palestinian state is working against Israeli [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=52.32s)]
*  interests. She claims the Nakba, that's when 700,000 Palestinians were expelled in 1948 from [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=57.04s)]
*  the foundation of Israel, is a very popular Arab lie. She opposes marriages by the way between Jews [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=64.48s)]
*  and non-Jews. That would mean she's opposed the Keir Starmer's marriage for example. Even Melanie [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=70.48s)]
*  Phillips, not exactly a pinko lefty, has condemned her for being too extreme in her rhetoric. She [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=74.88s)]
*  should be regarded as an extremist because that's exactly what she is. Now this interview she did [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=80.08s)]
*  on Sky News is disturbing so let's just listen to what she said. What's the view on the humanitarian [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=84.48s)]
*  crisis in Gaza this morning? There is no humanitarian crisis because there isn't, there is no. Israel is [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=89.36s)]
*  in charge of the safety of the Israelis, Hamas is in charge of the safety of the Palestinians, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=97.44s)]
*  Hamas abused every single support of the international community and instead of taking [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=104.72s)]
*  care of his people. There is no humanitarian crisis in Gaza, an absolute grotesque lie and a [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=109.84s)]
*  disgusting lie and also a dangerous lie because if that is in any way believed that will undermine [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=115.44s)]
*  efforts to prevent that humanitarian crisis from growing and causing even more mass death. Now as [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=121.12s)]
*  it is before the current horror show Israel subjected Gaza to a 16-year long placade from land, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=127.28s)]
*  air and sea controlling the supply also of water, food, energy and fuel which is why the United [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=133.44s)]
*  Nations declares Gaza to be under legally speaking occupation despite the withdrawal of Israeli [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=139.6s)]
*  troops. That has left 80% of its population dependent on international humanitarian assistance, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=145.92s)]
*  70% of its households before this were classified as food insecure, unable to afford the means to [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=151.84s)]
*  feed themselves adequately, two-thirds of refugees. Now bear in mind half the population are [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=159.2s)]
*  children, hungry desperate kids. Since the war began the Israeli defence minister declared a [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=164.72s)]
*  total siege with no electricity, no food, no fuel allowed in on the grounds we are fighting human [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=169.6s)]
*  animals, genocide or rhetoric there, adding Israel intends to in his words eliminate everything as [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=174.64s)]
*  well as other statements from Israeli officials saying that Gaza will be reduced to a city of [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=180.56s)]
*  tents. That is collective punishment, it is illegal under international law. Now UN agencies [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=185.68s)]
*  report that clean water has run out and Gazans are reportedly drinking from the sea, it may well be [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=190.8s)]
*  that thirst ends up being the biggest killer, we don't know, food is running out, hospitals have [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=196.08s)]
*  been bombed and electricity to power them and keep people alive is running out. Even a conservative [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=200.8s)]
*  minister Andrew Mitchell has declared a humanitarian crisis is looming though obviously it is already [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=206.16s)]
*  here. It's a lie to suggest otherwise and a disgusting lie when so many people are suffering. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=211.36s)]
*  Let's hear her again. It created this underneath tunnel of terror a manufacturing of rockets that [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=216.08s)]
*  their own main target is to hurt innocent Jews in their homes and this is the time that Hamas [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=222.4s)]
*  need to pay the price for its abuse, killing innocent Israelis and now preventing from his own [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=228.4s)]
*  people to evacuate and to be safe. Israelis worked with the international organizations to make sure [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=235.04000000000002s)]
*  all Palestinian civilians will be safe and we are giving them the opportunity to go south [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=241.28s)]
*  to sheltered places, places that they will be safe. Unfortunately the children of Qfar Aza, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=246.8s)]
*  the people of Sderot were not given this opportunity to be safe, they weren't alarmed, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=252.32s)]
*  they didn't get alert, they were slaughtered in their beds so Israel is just targeting military [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=257.44s)]
*  targets. Where do you even begin here? Where do you even begin? Now firstly about Hamas preventing [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=264.08s)]
*  people evacuating and the so-called what she describes as the opportunity, the opportunity to [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=268.4s)]
*  go south. What she's talking about here is ethnic cleansing, the forced removal of the Palestinian [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=274.23999999999995s)]
*  civilian population. That has been described correctly by the Norwegian Refugee Council as [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=279.84s)]
*  the war crime of forcible transfer. It has been condemned by the United Nations in these terms. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=285.03999999999996s)]
*  Forcible population transfers constitute a crime against humanity and collective punishment is [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=289.76s)]
*  prohibited under international humanitarian law. She calls this an opportunity, an opportunity. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=294.64s)]
*  I mean it's just so grotesque, it's just so grotesque. Now it's not true that those fleeing [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=301.28s)]
*  the south are being somehow kept safe by Israel. Let's just listen to the BBC Gaza City correspondent. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=308.4s)]
*  There you have it. Israeli strikes killing over 100 people who obeyed the order and moved to the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=324.64s)]
*  south. It's also clear that Israel wants a new Nakba, a new mass expulsion of the Palestinian people [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=338.96s)]
*  so that they can take Gaza for Israel. This is not a conspiracy theory, it is not a baseless smear. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=344.71999999999997s)]
*  Not only has the UN Special Rapporteur declared a second Nakba baby underway, this very ambassador, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=350.96s)]
*  Zippy Hotevalli, as I've said, regards Gaza as Israeli territory to be annexed. They're not [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=356.48s)]
*  pretending, they are speaking plainly about this. They're not hiding it, it's all in plain sight. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=361.76s)]
*  Now she says what all Palestinians will be safe. What's she talking about here? Over 3,000 Palestinian [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=368.88s)]
*  civilians are already dead, including around or over a thousand children. A woefully conservative [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=374.15999999999997s)]
*  estimate because so many are dead and buried under rubble and in a war zone it is logistically hard [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=379.36s)]
*  to retrieve them, so classified as missing. Just targeting military accounts, just offensive gas [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=385.44s)]
*  lighting. Even the official Twitter accounts of the Israeli state are gleefully posting images [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=391.2s)]
*  of destroyed civilian buildings. Entire neighborhoods are being razed to the ground. That [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=396.16s)]
*  has been confirmed by journalists, that has been confirmed by aid workers on the ground and it's [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=401.28000000000003s)]
*  been confirmed by the images that we can see with our own eyes. All the living generations of 45 [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=406.32s)]
*  families were wiped out. That is the consequence of the mass bombardment of civilian targets. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=411.36s)]
*  Let's hear some more. And we want the international community to make sure Hamas will bring back home [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=416.0s)]
*  all those kidnapped people, including British citizens by the way. Yesterday I got a phone call [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=423.28s)]
*  from Israeli citizens that said the mother was shot and the two teenager girls, 13 and 16, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=428.56s)]
*  are kept hosted in Gaza. British citizens. Let's be clear, the taking of civilian hostages by Hamas [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=436.24s)]
*  is absolutely unacceptable and of course they must be released. I mean that's what Hamas obviously [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=441.68s)]
*  should do. Nobody serious supports taking civilian hostages. Does anybody in their right mind think [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=447.52s)]
*  the way these hostages are going to be rescued and come home alive is through this onslaught? Does [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=452.72s)]
*  anyone really believe that? I don't think anyone actually believes that seriously, do they? This was [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=456.72s)]
*  a hostage rescue mission, this would not be happening. If they're going to justify this absolute carnage, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=460.64s)]
*  be honest about it. Don't pretend it's a hostage retrieval operation because it isn't and almost [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=466.32000000000005s)]
*  certainly involves the mass sacrifice of these hostages which the Israeli state is softening up [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=470.08000000000004s)]
*  public opinion for. It should also be said that Israel holds over 1,200 Palestinians without charge. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=475.28000000000003s)]
*  In 2016 they revised the previous law that stated children under 14 couldn't be held criminally [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=481.12s)]
*  responsible. It's estimated that the Israeli military detains and prosecutes between 500 and [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=486.0s)]
*  700 Palestinian children each year in military courts lacking basic safeguards for a fair trial. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=491.28000000000003s)]
*  Save the Children alleged that children in Israeli custody suffer immense emotional and physical [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=496.72s)]
*  abuse including violence of a sexual nature often beaten, handcuffed, blindfolded in small cages in [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=501.52000000000004s)]
*  detention centres. Are these not hostages too and do they not deserve to be released? Let's continue. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=507.44s)]
*  You've been showing pictures this morning that would illustrate that there is a humanitarian [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=512.72s)]
*  crisis in Gaza. Can I ask you something? Yeah. Are you a mother? Yes. What would you think if your [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=516.16s)]
*  children would have been executed in front of your eyes? Would you expect your government [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=524.64s)]
*  to think about those Nazis committing those crimes and to say wait a second first of all we [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=529.52s)]
*  need to protect the enemy and then to protect my children. Your children come as priority to your [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=534.8s)]
*  prime minister. Do you know that? This bit does make me sick to my stomach. The murder of children [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=541.76s)]
*  the murder of children by Hamas is absolutely unacceptable and vile and needs to be called out [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=548.08s)]
*  as such. It is a war crime never downplay that never downplay that. Of course we should be outraged. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=552.88s)]
*  What Zippy is doing there is using that horror to justify the murder of far far more Palestinian [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=557.92s)]
*  children. Before this latest nightmare in the last 15 years 96 percent of fatalities were Palestinian [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=565.2s)]
*  according to the United Nations many of them children. We know that over 1 000 children in [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=571.6s)]
*  Gaza have now been killed. The value of a Palestinian child's life is equal to that of an Israeli [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=577.12s)]
*  child's life or a British child's life. If you do not believe that then you do not believe in the [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=584.0s)]
*  sanctity of human life. You only care about human life innocent human life if it's not about what [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=588.8000000000001s)]
*  the ethnicity or religion happens to be. Now when she says essentially that the Israeli state [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=597.76s)]
*  should only care about the lives of an Israeli child that is not the legal position let alone [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=604.08s)]
*  the moral position. In the words of the international committee the Red Cross the occupying power has a [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=608.56s)]
*  duty to ensure the protection security and welfare of the people living under occupation and to [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=612.72s)]
*  guarantee that they can live as normal a life as possible in accordance with their own laws [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=616.8s)]
*  cultures and traditions. You are morally obliged not to kill children whether they are Israeli or [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=620.3199999999999s)]
*  not. Why am I even having to say this? Let's continue. We have been showing images this morning [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=625.28s)]
*  that illustrate that there is a humanitarian crisis in Gaza. So blame Hamas and ask Hamas why they [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=630.24s)]
*  started those atrocities walking around. So you like knowledge that there is a humanitarian crisis? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=637.04s)]
*  I'm saying there is no. Israel is working. So what do you think is happening? What is happening? There [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=641.1999999999999s)]
*  is a war in Gaza a war that Hamas started by committing a horrible massacre on innocent Israelis. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=646.0799999999999s)]
*  I mean listen to it she's all over the place. There is a humanitarian crisis she first concedes [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=652.8s)]
*  blame Gaza blame Hamas for it she says but then there is no humanitarian crisis. Again no one [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=657.92s)]
*  seriously disputes that Hamas committed a horrendous crime. What is false is the idea this all began on [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD8o_o39kT4&t=662.8s)]
