Video Description: Human Rights Watch have just done an in-depth report about how Meta is censoring pro-Palestinian voices on Facebook and Instagram. Here I show that I've been 'shadowbanned' on Facebook - and why this is part of a general attempt to silence the few pro-Palestinian voices with a mainstream platform.

# We're Being Censored By Facebook Over Palestine
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [December 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6WFmbEv4-A)
*  So, I had a bit of a debate with myself about the wisdom of discussing this, but I believe
*  that this is important, not least because I think there are wider issues at stake.
*  Now, I believe I'm being censored by Metta on Facebook over Palestine.
*  Now, normally I'll level with you.
*  I've been the last kind of person to indulge this kind of chat.
*  Kind of roll my eyes when I hear shadow batting.
*  You often hear this sort of chat from, let's say, the more right-wing elements of our political
*  conversation.
*  But Human Rights Watch, the prestigious global NGO, who I'm sure you've all heard of, have
*  just done a detailed report about censorship of pro-Palestinian voices on Metta, that is
*  the owners, of course, of Facebook and Instagram.
*  Now, before I talk about my own experience, let's just hear from Human Rights Watch about
*  what we're talking about here.
*  Some strong pro-Palestinian speech makes it through Metta's system, but a lot of peaceful
*  expression about Palestine has been wrongly restricted.
*  Social media users sent Human Rights Watch hundreds of examples of censorship they faced.
*  We reviewed over 1,000 cases involving the online censorship and suppression of content
*  in support of Palestine.
*  In around 300 cases, users were unable to appeal the restrictions, which means they
*  didn't have access to remedy and they couldn't get their content reinstated.
*  Most of the censorship consisted of removal of content, suspension of accounts, restrictions
*  on features like Instagram and Facebook Live, and shadow banning, that is reducing the visibility
*  of an account or individual posts.
*  So I've had a look through Human Rights Watch's report and they've documented 1,050 takedowns
*  and other suppressions of content on Instagram and Facebook.
*  Of those 1,050 cases, 1,049 involve peaceful content in support of Palestine being censored
*  or in their words, unduly suppressed, and in another case, one case, removal of content
*  in support of Israel.
*  It said that this censorship of content related to Palestine is systemic and global.
*  It notes Metta's got a well-documented record of what it calls overbroad crackdowns on content
*  related to Palestine and that it has previously apologised for this overreach and promised
*  to address it.
*  So if I just look through this report, it says in cases of suspected shadow banning,
*  users said they were never informed by the platform that their content visibility was
*  diminished.
*  While some claims of shadow banning were supported with compelling evidence that their account
*  was shadow banned, many users concluded that they had been shadow banned based on a hunch
*  or after noticing sudden changes in the number of views on their stories.
*  So what happens with shadow banning is it's not like you suddenly get a notification or
*  some sort of formal warning or you're told anything's happened at all.
*  You suddenly just have a massive drop off of your content's engagement, of its reach,
*  of the number of people looking at your content.
*  So it goes on this report saying, while shadow banning, a type of restriction reported by
*  is challenging to verify, partly due to the lack of platform notice of its occurrence,
*  as I say, some users demonstrated compelling evidence to support their claim.
*  This includes before and after screenshots noting the dramatic decrease in the number
*  of views after the user started posting content about Palestine.
*  So that includes screenshots of engagement metrics, likes, comments, shares, noting a
*  sudden and significant decrease in engagement on content related to Palestine, screenshots
*  that the account or content does not appear in search results and a significant slowdown
*  in new followers and demonstrating that the content is not visible to others.
*  Now in my case, I post these videos.
*  You might be watching it on one of many different platforms.
*  I post them on YouTube.
*  Hello, Twitter.
*  Hello, Instagram.
*  Hello.
*  Also an audio podcast.
*  Hi.
*  Also on Facebook.
*  I'd say hi, but you can't hear me anymore.
*  So that's the issue.
*  On YouTube, my videos get millions of views each month.
*  And since the war in Gaza began, my audience there has grown very, very significantly.
*  Even on X, the artist formerly known as Twitter, my videos do very well.
*  It sounds like I'm just bragging here, but I'm just making the point that do you have
*  a big audience for this stuff, which is important given the issue.
*  A single video on X that I do sometimes gets millions of views.
*  On Instagram, owned by Meta, my videos also often get hundreds of thousands of views each.
*  In fact, it's always in the hundreds of thousands, but users often complain they can't share
*  my videos to their stories, which I think needs investigating.
*  Nonetheless, my overall audience views engagement interactions on Instagram remains significantly
*  higher than before the war, for example.
*  Not so on Facebook, though, where frankly my reach has just dropped off a cliff very,
*  very, very abruptly indeed.
*  So you can use Facebook's creative studio tools to look at your statistics.
*  Between 12th of October, when I started posting about the war on Facebook, to the 29th of
*  November, after which it really is like someone just flicks a switch.
*  You'll see that around 55 and a half thousand people likes my Facebook page.
*  So the total number of likes on Facebook is four hundred sixty five thousand and over
*  four hundred ninety thousand followers.
*  Let's just look what happened to my videos to begin with.
*  So and bear in mind, you've got I've got a big increase there in my audience between
*  seventh and 29th of November, approaching five and a half million minutes of my videos
*  were watched in that 22 day period.
*  Five million four hundred seven thousand minutes.
*  My videos in the in the same period, the last 22 days, that has collapsed to four hundred
*  and thirteen thousand just under.
*  So that's a sudden ninety two point four percent collapse in the number of minutes of my
*  videos that are viewed.
*  Now, my audience is always fluctuated.
*  Everyone's audience fluctuates on these platforms.
*  But since the war began, around 16 million minutes of my videos have been watched, except
*  that was overwhelmingly before the 29th of November, when if you look at the graph,
*  suddenly views flatline again, it really just looks like a switch has been flicked.
*  My post reactions, comments and shares have gone down by seventy three point seven
*  percent compared to the previous 22 days.
*  My net increase in followers has collapsed by eighty nine point eight percent compared
*  to the previous 22 days.
*  So I was suddenly getting a massive sustained increase in followers and then straight
*  away that stopped.
*  So I'm regularly posting videos and other posts.
*  Yeah, there has been a sudden and very dramatic decrease in audience and reach.
*  That's never happened to me before.
*  It doesn't actually make any sense because more people are watching my videos elsewhere.
*  Why would my audience for videos grow elsewhere and then suddenly drop off a cliff on
*  Facebook? The one platform.
*  I've never had any content taken down.
*  That is a content violation.
*  That's what happens if your content goes against the Facebook community standards or
*  Instagram community guidelines and meta.
*  That's because my content, obviously consistently opposes violence.
*  Whoever commits it opposes bigotry, racism is always factually grounded.
*  I don't spread misinformation.
*  If I get something wrong, I do everything I can to correct it.
*  I am sometimes actually slow to react to things, sometimes to people's frustration
*  because I wait for the information and sources to be verified.
*  That kind of basic journalistic practice.
*  So it's not at all clear you can do anything about shadow banning.
*  I posted about this on Facebook and from those who can still see my posts.
*  Hello. The response from them was overwhelming.
*  They either rarely see my content anymore or they have to choose to come manually to
*  my page to find it.
*  So it doesn't appear on their feed.
*  They have to suddenly go on my Facebook page.
*  That's my cat walking across the camera.
*  So what happens? What happens here is your content suddenly reaches a much smaller
*  audience for some completely opaque arbitrary reason and you can't appeal.
*  That's it. And I think there was a very basic democratic question here.
*  Which arises because big tech has such a stranglehold now over the means of
*  distributing information.
*  In the case of Gaza, there are all too few voices on a platform unequivocally
*  opposed to Israel's current onslaught, as well as the broader oppression of the
*  Palestinian people, the occupation apartheid as diagnosed by Human Rights Watch,
*  Amnesty International, Bet-Solem, the hideous human rights abuses that have been
*  occurring for so long, the mass incarceration of Palestinians.
*  We could go on. Now, most media outlets back Israel's onslaught.
*  They don't offer a fair platform in the West for the Palestinian people and the
*  Palestinian cause.
*  So suppressing voices sympathetic to the Palestinian people during what I would
*  describe as one of the great atrocities of our age.
*  It's a problem, guys, isn't it?
*  So, you know, I think added on to that, I have been with my platform doing my very
*  best to elevate otherwise marginalised and ignored voices.
*  Palestinians, of course, and also Israeli peace activists, academics,
*  investigative journalists, voices that need to be heard.
*  Factually grounded as well as voices which, in my view, if there's ever going to
*  be any hope here, have to be listened to.
*  Those who desire a shared land which offers peace and security alike to
*  Palestinians and Israeli Jews.
*  Now, those voices need to be heard and they're being suppressed now because of
*  the suppression of my platform and Facebook.
*  Now, fine, I do have these other platforms.
*  They do reach a huge number of people.
*  But clearly, this is a problem in its own right.
*  And these are human rights watch shows.
*  This is happening to other pro-Palestinian voices.
*  Given I do have a platform, even if the Facebook aspect of it has essentially just
*  been locked off arbitrarily, I think I should highlight this because it's clearly
*  part of a general pattern as highlighted by Human Rights Watch of suppressing
*  democratic discussion and debate.
*  So I want this issue to be raised.
*  I'm glad Human Rights Watch have raised it because this is about meaning that we
*  can't highlight terrible human rights abuses that are happening, terrible
*  atrocities, war crimes, crimes against humanity that are being highlighted.
*  And that enables Israel to continue to commit those crimes against humanity,
*  those war crimes, those atrocities, those massacres, those killings of innocent
*  civilians because there's less scrutiny, there's less discussion, there's less
*  light being cast on it.
*  So this is actually not just about democracy.
*  It's about life and death.
*  So Metas should be challenged about it.
*  And this is my contribution to that.
*  Obviously, it sucks that Facebook now is suddenly not something I can properly
*  use, but I will continue to do my very, very best to do on a daily basis,
*  videos shining a light on what's happening, elevating those voices that
*  we need to be heard.
*  We've got lots and lots of interviews to come and videos exposing what's
*  happening.
