# ICC Prosecutor Leave Israel's Cheerleaders Nowhere To Hide
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [May 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmfRo4yV1tM)
*  No excuses. Nowhere to hide. As the International Criminal Court's prosecutor applies for arrest
*  warrants over Israel-Palestine, it won't just be those named in his statement who will be feeling
*  distinctly rattled right now. You see, it was clear from the very beginning that a crime of
*  historic proportions was being committed. Israel's leaders made it abundantly clear from the very
*  beginning that they were going to commit terrible atrocities involving mass slaughter and mass
*  destruction. Not once, not twice, not three times, but over and over and over and over again. Those
*  who facilitated and legitimised this atrocity will, if they've got any sense, now be in a state of
*  panic because they're going to be held to account by us and we're not going to give up seeking
*  holding them to account for the rest of their lives. Now let's just familiarise ourselves with
*  what's happened here. Kavim Khan Casey, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court,
*  has applied for arrest warrants that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his
*  Defence Minister Yov Galan, as well as three Hamas leaders. Yaya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas,
*  Mohamed Yab, Ibrahim al-Mazri, the commander-in-chief of the Al Qassam Brigades, or Hamas' military
*  wing, and Ismael Haniyeh, the head of the Hamas political bureau. Now let's just deal with the
*  arrest warrants for Hamas' leaders first. Now some of us had moral consistency from the start.
*  On the 10th of October, I went on Sky News along with the Labour MP, pro-Israel Labour MP Margaret
*  Hodge and said, there's no cause on earth which justifies the slaughter of innocent civilians.
*  This should be a basic building block, you see, of moral clarity, of moral consistency. I believe
*  the generations old war against the Palestinian people to be a grave crime, or rather a litany
*  of grave crimes. The murderous ethnic cleansing of the Nakba, the catastrophe of 1948, the repeated
*  ethnic cleansing since, the longest belligerent occupation of modern times, the theft of
*  Palestinian land and its colonisation with illegal settlements, the apartheid, the repeated bouts
*  of mass murder, the mass incarcerations without trial for those who should be regarded as
*  Palestinian hostages, the torture, including the physical and sexual abuse of children
*  detained by the Israeli state we could go on. This, nor anything else, does not justify war
*  crimes and the intentional targeting of civilians. I've spent more time than I would like watching
*  harrowing evidence of atrocities committed against Israeli civilians on the 7th of October,
*  that includes the taking of hostages. These were war crimes and justice should prevail. The prosecutor
*  declares he has reasonable grounds to believe that Hamas leaders have criminal responsibility
*  for a range of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including extermination, murder and
*  hostage taking, and the evidence for war crimes and crimes against humanity is overwhelming.
*  The point is that the crimes committed by the Israeli state are firstly those of a long-standing
*  occupier waging a generations-long war against an occupied and subjugated people. Secondly,
*  because of this, and because indeed it is a military superpower, its crimes are much graver
*  and deadlier and far more destructive. And thirdly, its crimes are directly facilitated
*  by Western governments through weapons and diplomatic and political support and aid,
*  as well as legitimised by our media outlets. This should answer the desperate cries you will hear
*  of water-boultry. So when the Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid publicly declares the ICC arrest
*  warrants are a complete moral failure, we cannot accept the outrageous comparison between Netanyahu
*  and Sinwar between the leaders of Israel and the leaders of Hamas. Well, maybe he's got a point
*  in the sense that Israel's crimes are much worse. Then he's right. That isn't to deny Israel's
*  committed serious crimes as I've detailed, which of course it has and for which it must face justice
*  for. Let's just detail the proposed charges against Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of Israel,
*  and Yoav Galan for criminal responsibility for these war crimes and crimes against humanity.
*  Starvation of civilians as a method of warfare as a war crime. Willfully causing great suffering or
*  serious injury to body or health and cruel treatment as a war crime. Willful killing and
*  murder as a war crime. Intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population as a war
*  crime. Extermination and murder, including in the context of death caused by starvation as a crime
*  against humanity. Persecution as a crime against humanity. Other inhumane acts as a crime against
*  humanity. He adds to the prosecutor that his office, submit that the crimes against humanity
*  charge were committed as a part of a widespread and systematic attack against the Palestinian
*  civilian population pursuant to state policy. These crimes, in our assessment, he says,
*  continue to this day as indeed they do. They refer his office to evidence collected,
*  including interviews with survivors and eyewitnesses, authenticated video,
*  photo and audio material, satellite imagery and statement from the alleged perpetrator group,
*  shows that Israel has intentionally and systematically deprived the civilian population
*  in all parts of Gaza of objects indispensable to human survival.
*  The prosecutor refers to the imposition of a total siege on Gaza, including closing three border
*  crossing points from 8th October for an extended period and then by arbitrarily restricting the
*  transfer of essential supplies, not least food and medicine, when crossings were reopened. That
*  siege, he notes, included cutting off water pipelines and electricity supplies. It included
*  attacks on civilians, such as those queuing for food, obstructing aid delivery by humanitarian
*  agencies, attacks on and killing of aid workers, forcing many agencies to cease or limit operations
*  in Gaza. A crucial point he makes here, my office admits that these acts were committed as part of
*  a common plan to use starvation as a method of war and other acts of violence against the
*  Gaza and civilian population as a means to 1. Eliminate Hamas, 2. Secure the return of the
*  hostages which Hamas has abducted and 3. Collectively punish the civilian population of Gaza,
*  whom they perceived as a threat to Israel. It's worth absorbing that point. He holds that the
*  State of Israel decided that the civilian population as a whole were a threat to Israel,
*  that being of course collective punishment, thereby making them a target for starvation
*  and extermination. After detailing the consequences, famine with the highest number of people facing
*  catastrophic hunger ever recorded anywhere, anytime as a result of an entirely man-made disaster,
*  he declares, notwithstanding any military goals they have, the means Israel chose to achieve them
*  in Gaza, namely intentionally causing death, starvation, great suffering and serious injury
*  to body or health of the civilian population are criminal. What he seeks to do here is nullify
*  the claims of self-defence, there is no legal defence for the crimes committed, whatever the
*  circumstances in other words. Now there are important omissions here. While Hamas leaders
*  stand accused of criminal responsibility for torture, Israel does not, despite overwhelming
*  evidence, including Palestinian detainees being tortured to death, neither have charges of genocide
*  been offered. But notably in his statement he notes his office's examining reports in relationship
*  to the large-scale bombing that has caused and continues to cause so many civilian deaths
*  injuries in Gaza. And he said these should be, so therefore we should look at this as potentially
*  initially proposed charges with other charges to come. Now let's just listen to what he says here.
*  Today we underline in the clearest possible fashion that international law and the laws
*  of armed conflict apply to everyone. No foot soldier, no commander, no civilian leader,
*  no one can act with impunity. Nothing on earth can justify willfully depriving human beings,
*  including women and children, babies, the old and the young, of the basic necessities required for
*  life. Nothing, nothing on earth can justify hostage taking or the targeting and killing
*  of civilians. Well Israel has enjoyed impunity for a very long time and that impunity is now
*  disintegrating in real time. The biggest hammer blow to Israel's impunity has been delivered
*  since its foundation over three quarters of a century ago. Let's listen to the final statement
*  of his. Today I wish to underline one message very clearly.
*  It's my strong conviction that if we do not demonstrate our willingness to apply the law
*  equally, if it is seen as being applied selectively, we will be creating the conditions
*  for its complete collapse. And in doing so we would be loosening the remaining bonds
*  that hold us together, the stabilizing connections between all communities, all individuals,
*  the safety net to which all victims look to in times of suffering. This is the true risk
*  we face at this perilous moment. Now more than ever we must collectively demonstrate that
*  international humanitarian law, the foundational baseline for human conduct during conflict,
*  applies to all individuals and applies equally across situations addressed by my office and by
*  the court. This is how we will prove tangibly, in real terms, for all victims that the lives of
*  all human beings, wherever they may be, have equal value. Well here's a crucial point. There's been
*  no pretence since this horror began that Palestinian life has anything like equal value. Palestinian
*  life has been treated as having almost no value. There hasn't even been a pretence, it's been open,
*  blatant and brazen by politicians and media outlets. Now I want to discuss the responsibility of those
*  who facilitated and legitimized this crime in historical proportions, but first what happens
*  next. This is for now an application for arrest warrants, but note it has the backing of a
*  prestigious panel of experts in international law, including it should be noted Amal Clooney,
*  who has been aggressively denounced for her silence over the last few months, well now we know why,
*  she wasn't able to comment because of her participation in this process.
*  Now the arrest warrants have to be approved by the pre-trial chamber. In the case of Omar Al-Bashir,
*  Sudan's former military dictator, the ICC request for an arrest warrant was issued in July 2008,
*  but only approved in March 2009. In the case of Vladimir Putin, the request was made in February
*  2023 and approved the following month. So far one public application for an arrest warrant has been
*  denied, but it was issued on subsequent application, while one charge in the Al-Bashir case was issued
*  only after an appeal. Now the British government has come out and said the ICC don't have
*  jurisdiction over Israel, that's a lie and it knows it. Joe Biden, president who will go down
*  in history's genocide, Joe Meemaw has declared the ICC prosecutor's application for arrest
*  warrants against Israeli leaders is outrageous. Now like Russia, Israel is not a signatory to the
*  ICC, Ukraine isn't a signatory to the ICC either, but it offered the ICC jurisdiction over its
*  territory. Accordingly, when the ICC applied for an arrest warrant against Vladimir Putin,
*  Joe Biden welcomed it. What's even more embarrassing is the UK foreign minister,
*  Andrew Mitchell, declared the ICC today doesn't have jurisdiction because back in November he
*  declared it's not for ministers to seek to state where the ICC has jurisdiction, that's for the
*  chief prosecutor. He also said then it's not for me to fetter or speak in the place of its chief
*  prosecutor. Hoisted. Petard. Now what this means in practice is that if the warrants are served,
*  ICC states are legally obliged to arrest those named if they land on their soil. Some of you may
*  conclude that may never happen. Well maybe, maybe not. This is a catastrophe, let's be clear for
*  the Israeli state. A catastrophe. The world law order, the world legal order is rigged in favour of
*  the West, the global North. And the global North, the West, principally the US and its allies,
*  have used that fact to offer Israel impunity. Now the Times of Israel reported that when
*  Karen Kahn was elected chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, he was actually
*  Israel's preferred candidate. He is the brother of a British Conservative MP. But let's be clear
*  about the significance of all of this, and let's focus on those who facilitated and legitimised
*  this great crime. There were no excuses, there was nowhere to hide. From the very beginning,
*  it was clear that a crime of historic proportions was going to be committed by the state of Israel.
*  Back in October, I wrote a Guardian column and it was headlined, Israel is clear about its intentions
*  in Gaza, world leaders cannot plead ignorance of what is coming. I wrote that column for a reason.
*  It was obvious that a crime on an unimaginable scale was being committed, and that as the brutal
*  reality became widely accepted and undeniable, those who legitimised and cheered on this
*  abomination would plead ignorance and indeed offer regret. I wrote this article as a marker
*  to clarify that it was abundantly clear at the time what the Israeli state was unleashing,
*  and that there was no excuse for not knowing what they were doing. No excuses, nowhere to hide.
*  From the very start, statements of murderous intent making it clear that Israel was committed
*  to mass indiscriminate slaughter and destruction were made by government ministers in Israel,
*  by politicians, by generals, by army officers, by soldiers, by journalists, by entire media outlets,
*  by public figures we could go on in an orgy of genocidal mania. There are enough of these
*  statements to fill an entire book or indeed several volumes, but suffice it to say that
*  rarely in history has a state so openly declared over and over and over again in the most grotesque,
*  depraved and inhuman language that it intended to commit terrible war crimes and crimes against
*  humanity as it did them, often in overtly genocidal terms. Such statements led the
*  Israeli-American associate professor of Holocaust and Genocide Studies, Razig Al,
*  who I interviewed myself, to declare just nine days after 7th October. We're seeing the combination
*  of genocidal acts with special intent. This is indeed a textbook case of genocide. No excuses,
*  nowhere to hide. When Yoav Galant declared a complete siege with no electricity, no food,
*  no water, no fuel on the grounds, we are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly,
*  why was his word not taken literally? Do people think that was just hyperbole? Maybe they thought
*  he was having a joke. Did our politicians and commentators believe that when Galant ordered
*  his officers or told them that he had lifted all restrictions and separately all restraints on them
*  that he wasn't to be taken literally? Really? No excuses, nowhere to hide. Listen for example
*  to Major General Ghassan Aliyeh, charged with Israel's military occupations and its operations
*  in the occupied territories, declaring on the 9th October Hamas became ISIS and the citizens of
*  Gaza are celebrating instead of being horrified. Human animals are dealt with accordingly. Israel
*  has imposed a total blockade on Gaza. No electricity, no water, just damage. You wanted hell,
*  you will get hell. I ask you, what rumours there are there for subtlety? And I'll tell you,
*  there is none. No excuses, nowhere to hide. Those who legitimised and facilitated and cheered this
*  horror on knew, they knew from the start that a military superpower was carpet bombing a tiny
*  strip of land no bigger than East London, one of the most densely populated areas on earth,
*  with explosives equivalent to several Hiroshima bombs. No excuses, nowhere to hide. They knew
*  that most civilian infrastructure was being severely damaged and destroyed. Homes, schools,
*  hospitals, mosques, churches, ancient landmarks. So much so that Gaza now looks a different colour
*  and texture when looked at from space. No excuses, nowhere to hide. They knew that tens of thousands
*  of Palestinians were being buried alive under the rubble of their own homes. Some killed immediately,
*  others including thousands of children slowly cooked alive, slowly suffocated alive, or slowly
*  cooked and suffocated alive, sometimes spending hours suffering the most agonising deaths
*  imaginable while listening to the screams of their dying loved ones. No excuses, nowhere to hide.
*  The complicit knew that Israel was overseeing the biggest slaughter of aid workers and journalists
*  ever recorded in such a short space of time in any conflict in human history. No excuses, nowhere
*  to hide. They knew that the medical system was being systematically destroyed by the Israeli
*  state, its hospitals razed to the ground, its doctors and nurses and patients slaughtered so
*  that maimed babies had their limbs amputated without anaesthetic, so that pregnant women had
*  their newborns delivered by caesarean without anaesthetic. No excuses, nowhere to hide.
*  And as the ICC statement makes clear, the complicit knew they knew Israel had deliberately and
*  systematically blocked the very basic means of survival, food, water, energy, medicine,
*  imposing mass death on the civilian population resulting in the biggest drop in the nutritional
*  status of a population ever recorded. No excuses, nowhere to hide. We all, we all had front row
*  seats to some of the worst crimes committed in the 21st century as they were live streamed
*  on a daily basis. The first live stream genocide in history as it was called, for a reason.
*  Few horrors in history have so much overwhelming documented evidence, and all that time,
*  all that time throughout the Israeli state repeatedly promised an atrocity of biblical
*  proportions which I say literally because in the case of Netanyahu he invokes the story of Amalek
*  in which God orders the Israelites to kill men and women, infants and nursing babies, oxen and sheep,
*  camels and donkeys and my word do they deliver to the letter. No excuses, nowhere to hide.
*  President Joe Biden promised iron clad support for Israel and offered a limitless supply of weapons
*  including 2000 pound dumb bombs which were repeatedly used to rip apart the bodies of
*  innocent civilians including so many children not least in areas designated safe zones. No excuses,
*  nowhere to hide. Our Prime Minister Rishi Senak in Britain was aware that Israel's leaders had
*  promised this horrific bloodbath when he declared the state had an absolute right to defend itself
*  and we see that absolute right as he defined it played out on a daily basis ever since while his
*  foreign secretary Lord Cameron promised to keep selling Israel weapons no matter what even though
*  it was clear his own lawyers had told him that Israel was breaking international law. No excuses,
*  nowhere to hide. And don't forget Keir Starmer, don't forget him, the leader of the opposition
*  who at the very beginning declared Israel had the right to cut off water and energy despite his
*  later disgusting attempts to gaslight isnt oblivic he had never supported this abominable war crime,
*  one specifically condemned by the prosecutor as he noted how water pipelines and electricity
*  supplies were cut off in his statement. No excuses, nowhere to hide. And that's for our media,
*  our brave courageous media. Now there were examples of brilliant reporting and we should
*  be grateful for that. Although should we? Because this was the bare minimum, but it was there.
*  Overall, this is one of the greatest journalistic scandals in history and my word, the bar for that.
*  Why was coverage of Israel's murderous onslaught not framed around the public statements of Israel's
*  leaders? Not only did this not happen, even when they explicitly made clear their motives over and
*  over again, many of these blood-gloating promises were barely even mentioned in Western coverage,
*  despite proving the best and most accurate roadmap to the entirely predictable horrors which
*  unfolded. Entire crimes were ignored and whitewashed, the lies of Israeli leaders were
*  deferred to, they were allowed to muddy the waters, Palestinian voices were marginalised
*  and ignored and defamed over and over and over again. The famine which we're now discussing,
*  how much coverage was there of the intentional attempt by the Israeli state to manufacture that
*  famine? No excuses and nowhere to hide. It's clear what happened here. Those who are responsible
*  for legitimising and facilitating this grotesque crime which will be remembered throughout the
*  ages, they thought they'd get away with it because Palestinian life has been devalued to the point
*  of having no value at all. Here, my friends, is a depraved story of where dehumanisation at its most
*  flagrant leaves us. Here too is a legacy of our failure to hold to account those responsible
*  for previous catastrophes, not least those who drowned Iraq in blood and chaos, who walked from
*  crime scene to crime scene, splattered with more blood and get away with it. They believed,
*  understandably, those therefore who cheered this atrocity on, that they can get away with anything,
*  and they clearly saw Israel's own impunity as a form of collective insurance which would protect
*  them as well. Well, we cannot let them get away with it. Our politicians and media outlets made
*  this possible. They gave Israel the weapons and the cover to commit some of the worst crimes of
*  our age. We can't let them get away with it. This isn't vengeance. There's not some satisfaction
*  of winning an argument, but because unless we hold them to account for what they've done,
*  then the horrors we have seen are the foreshadow of much worse to come. By denouncing the
*  International Criminal Court's request for these arrest warrants, western states have made it clear
*  that they are determined to bury any semblance of an international order in which basic human
*  rights and justice is upheld, even though we know how that order works in practice. But the
*  consequences of burying it so overtly will prove catastrophic. We can't let them get away with it.
*  So many lives depend on it. No excuses. No where to hide.
