# British Journalist: Palestinian Kids "Can Just Go To Hell" - Yet Dan Hodges Faces No Consequences
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [February 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE)
*  People have been smeared, threatened, deplatformed, arrested, sacked, the opposing and Israeli [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=0.0s)]
*  onslaught defined by the mass murder of Palestinian men, women and children, by the maiming of [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=7.2s)]
*  countless people, by starvation, by torture, by rape, by the apocalyptic levels of destruction, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=13.52s)]
*  the mass murder of aid workers, medics, journalists. Those who have cheered on one of the worst [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=21.52s)]
*  crimes of our age suffer no consequences, quite the opposite. They remain treated as mainstream, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=27.28s)]
*  as respectable. As I've often said from the beginning of Israel's genocide against the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=32.32s)]
*  Palestinian people, the world is turned on its head. This brings me to the case of Dan Hodges, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=36.8s)]
*  a newspaper columnist for the Mail on Sunday. Now, it is tempting to simply dismiss this man as a [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=42.32s)]
*  glorified internet troll who, like many of the nepo babies who populate the incestuous cesspit, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=47.92s)]
*  that is, I'm afraid the British media, may not have intelligence or insight, but did have a famous [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=52.88s)]
*  mother. Many of those who cheered on Israel's genocidal onslaught have simply gone quiet as the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=57.84s)]
*  scale of depravity became simply too obscene for them to unapologetically defend. They walked away [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  from the crime scene, hands in their pockets whistling, hoping nobody would notice. Dan [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=68.56s)]
*  Hodges' own interventions on this subject are now few and far between. His latest contribution, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=73.36s)]
*  if we can call it that, came in response to Israel's Twitter account. It has an official [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=78.16s)]
*  Twitter account, which is often just full of disgusting bile, frankly. But in this case, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=82.64s)]
*  they posted about Israeli hostages who were released this weekend. Now, to be clear, as I [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=87.36s)]
*  have been from the start, taking civilians' hostages is a war crime for which there is no [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  justification. They should always have been released. Israel's official account shared before [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=96.96s)]
*  and after pictures, showing how much weight these hostages have lost. Now, as the Israeli [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=101.84s)]
*  journalist Demi Rida put it, first and foremost, taking civilian hostages is a war crime and Hamas [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=106.8s)]
*  is entirely responsible for every hostages' physical and mental state. But dear fellow [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=111.36s)]
*  Israelis and their cheerleaders, what did you think would happen to the hostages when you decided to [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=115.6s)]
*  starve Gaza? At the very beginning, Israel's defence minister Yoav Galan announced there would be a [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=120.64s)]
*  total siege on Gaza, blocking the essentials of life. Last April, two US government agencies [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=126.0s)]
*  concluded that Israel was deliberately blocking aid from getting to the people of Gaza. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=131.2s)]
*  Last October, the United Nations reported that more than 1.8 million Palestinians were suffering [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=136.88s)]
*  extremely critical levels of hunger, with 70% of crop fields destroyed. There have been multiple [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=142.72s)]
*  cases of Palestinian children who have died because of starvation-related complications. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=149.67999999999998s)]
*  As Omar Shakir, Israel and Palestine director at Human Rights Watch, put it last April, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=155.12s)]
*  the Israeli government's use of starvation as a weapon of war has proven deadly for children in [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=159.68s)]
*  Gaza. There wasn't even the tiniest fraction of outrage over Israel's deliberate starvation [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=164.24s)]
*  of an entire people in which little kids starve to death, as there has been about these Israeli [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=169.6s)]
*  hostages. Now, it should also be noted that the conditions of Palestinians in captivity are [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  overall much, much worse. Thousands of Palestinians are detained without charge and without trial, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=179.68s)]
*  while others are subjected to the Kangaroo Military Courts, where the judge is an Israeli [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=185.12s)]
*  soldier. The trial lasts minutes, it's conducted in Hebrew with a 99% conviction rate. Israel is [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  the only country on earth to routinely try children in military courts. As Save the Children reported [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=194.56s)]
*  before the 7th of October, child detainees are subjected to physical and sexual abuse. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=200.24s)]
*  There are at the moment over 200 Palestinian children in detention. Other detainees have [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=207.44s)]
*  included an 82-year-old woman with dementia. There are multiple examples of sexual abuse [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=214.4s)]
*  and rape, including of both Palestinian men and women. One Palestinian detainee was even gang [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=220.56s)]
*  raped on camera. Now, one of Gaza's most prominent doctors was reportedly raped to death with three [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=227.6s)]
*  Israeli guards taking it in turns to rape him with their M16 rifles. 54 Palestinian detainees [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=234.48000000000002s)]
*  have died in Israeli prisons, many of them clearly tortured to death. Israeli human rights [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=241.04s)]
*  organisation Betzalem have revealed the systemic policy of abusing and torturing thousands of [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=247.2s)]
*  Palestinians in its custody, detailing harsh arbitrary violence on a frequent basis, sexual [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=251.92s)]
*  assault, humiliation and degradation, deliberate starvation, false lack of hygiene, sleep deprivation, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=256.71999999999997s)]
*  restriction and punishment of religious worship, conversation of all group and personal belongings, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=261.84s)]
*  and the denial of adequate medical care. Meanwhile, Palestinian detainees have repeatedly [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=266.64s)]
*  been released, appearing emaciated and clearly ill treated. There's no outrage about any of this. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=271.59999999999997s)]
*  Why? Because Palestinians are not treated as though they're human beings. It's very [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=277.68s)]
*  straightforward. Very simply, Israelis are seen as us Westerners. Palestinians are treated as them, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=280.8s)]
*  with any amount of depravity inflicted on them, not only tolerated but enthusiastically embraced. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=285.59999999999997s)]
*  Now, Van Hodges tweeted in response to Israel's tweets about the hostages, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=290.8s)]
*  I don't want to see a single penny of British taxpayers' money spent on the reconstruction of [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=294.4s)]
*  Gaza until every Hamas terrorist is either dead or in jail. I don't care about the broader politics. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=297.91999999999996s)]
*  Ren journalist Matthew Stadlin responded, In the meantime, the civilian population, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=303.59999999999997s)]
*  including hundreds of thousands of children, can just go to hell, right? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=307.35999999999996s)]
*  And Van Hodges responded bluntly, Yes, basically. Another told him being pro-genocide is not a good [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=310.4s)]
*  luck, Dan, and he responded, I'll wear it lightly. While another user tweeted, I feel sorry for the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=315.84s)]
*  ordinary Palestinians. They've been cynically used by Hamas slash Iran. He said, I've got to [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=321.12s)]
*  be honest, my sympathy for ordinary Palestinians is pretty low this morning. When he was asked about [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=325.76s)]
*  other Arab states paying for the reconstruction, he responded, they shouldn't pay for it either [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=330.96s)]
*  until Hamas have been completely destroyed. Let's just digest for a moment what this [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=334.48s)]
*  national newspaper journalist who appears on mainstream TV and radio is saying. He was [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=339.2s)]
*  specifically told that a statement meant that the entire civilian population can just go to hell, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=343.84000000000003s)]
*  and he said, yes, basically. And he specifically asked about ordinary Palestinians. He didn't just [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=348.72s)]
*  say he had pretty low sympathy for ordinary Palestinians. He put ordinary Palestinians in [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=352.96000000000004s)]
*  inverted quotes and scare quotes, which I would interpret as him disputing there was such a thing [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=356.88000000000005s)]
*  as an innocent Palestinian civilian. He is inferring both collective guilt and collective [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=361.20000000000005s)]
*  punishment. What he says, what he says that Gaza should be deprived of any financial support from [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=366.40000000000003s)]
*  anyone, including Arab states until Hamas is destroyed. He says that means every Hamas [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=371.12s)]
*  terrorist is either dead or in jail. What he describes there is literally an impossible goal. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=376.48s)]
*  As the former Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, put it just before the end of Joe Biden's tenure [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=380.32s)]
*  as president, we assess that Hamas has recruited almost as many new militants as it has lost. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=384.88s)]
*  That was after 15 months of one of the most sophisticated advanced militaries on earth, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=391.04s)]
*  armed to the teeth by the world's only superpower, reducing Gaza, a tiny strip of [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=395.44s)]
*  land to apocalyptic rubble with Israel's military intelligence service Shin Bet concluding a year [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=399.20000000000005s)]
*  ago that Hamas would survive in some form after Israel's onslaught. It turns out you cannot defeat [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=403.76s)]
*  an idea and if you slaughter huge numbers of innocent people, then some of their loved ones, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=409.03999999999996s)]
*  their parents, their children, their lovers, their friends are going to fight you to the bitter end. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=412.96s)]
*  Indeed, someone pointed this out to him. Another, they tweeted, Hamas will always be there. The [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=417.12s)]
*  young ones will take up arms to replace the ones who have perished. Israel's deadly actions [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=421.36s)]
*  will always have resistance. Sadly, there will never be peace in the region. He responded, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=425.28s)]
*  fine, then leave it in rubble. Now, in any case, by the way, Israel repeatedly lies about who Hamas [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=428.96s)]
*  is. As Israeli soldiers told the Israeli Nisab Bar-Haretz, the Israeli military [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=433.76s)]
*  murders civilians and then claims their victims are quote unquote Hamas terrorists, which they [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=437.84000000000003s)]
*  know isn't true, meaning the official tally of Hamas terrorists killed is itself a lie. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=441.6s)]
*  They provided one example and an idea spokesperson announced their forces had killed over 200 [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=446.56s)]
*  militants. In practice of those 200 fatalities, only 10 were confirmed as known Hamas operatives. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=451.04s)]
*  What Dan Hodges is supporting in practice would mean almost everyone in Gaza dying. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=460.0s)]
*  As just one example, 83% of Gaza's plant life has been destroyed. The healthcare system, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=464.32s)]
*  the hospitals are in ruins. As Donald Trump himself has publicly conceded, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=469.6s)]
*  albeit to justify ethnic cleansing, Gaza is just not a place that can sustain life as is. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=473.6s)]
*  Hodges supports Israel waging a never-ending war because if you [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=478.40000000000003s)]
*  wage a more so sworn and entire people, there will always be an endless supply of new recruits [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=482.16s)]
*  wanting to fight back and Israel will always falsely claim that the people they are killing [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=487.04s)]
*  are Hamas. Indeed Hodges makes clear his anti-Palestinian racism. He is self-evidently [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=491.04s)]
*  an anti-Palestinian racist. He isn't trying to hide it. Let's just be clear. This is what [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=497.04s)]
*  he says means. When asked yesterday if he still stood by responding to a tweet which said, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=501.84000000000003s)]
*  in the meantime, the civilian population, including hundreds of thousands of children, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=507.28000000000003s)]
*  could just go to hell, he said, in response, yes, basically. Going to hell means dying. It [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=511.2s)]
*  means babies dying. It means children dying. Half of Gaza's population is children. It means [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=517.28s)]
*  pregnant women dying. It means elderly men and elderly women dying. He openly embraces [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=521.6s)]
*  collective punishment. Indeed, when someone tweets, that's collective punishment, he responds, fine. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=526.0s)]
*  Collective punishment is a grave war crime. Now, he's not an intelligent guy, let's be clear, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=531.92s)]
*  but he will know that he's there supporting a war crime. Just imagine on the 7th of October, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=536.56s)]
*  a commentator tweeted they had pretty low sympathy for Israel's population. Just imagine they [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=541.3599999999999s)]
*  agreed that Israel's civilian population, including hundreds of thousands of children, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=546.0s)]
*  should go to hell. Imagine they agreed with collective punishment against Israeli civilians. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=551.5999999999999s)]
*  That person would immediately lose their job. Their feet wouldn't touch the ground. And if they [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=557.1999999999999s)]
*  continue to tweet all of what Dan Hodges has tweeted about Israelis, they would likely be [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=561.5999999999999s)]
*  arrested. I spoke to a British lawyer about this. He said that Dan Hodges' statement is [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=564.72s)]
*  dangerous close to if it has not already violated UK law, including the Public Order Act, which [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=569.0400000000001s)]
*  criminalises stirring up racial hatred. They add, even more concerningly, inciting or endorsing [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=573.6800000000001s)]
*  actions that could contribute to genocide or crimes against humanity may itself violate UK law, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=578.5600000000001s)]
*  including provisions under the International Criminal Court Act 2001. But here and now, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=583.12s)]
*  there are no consequences for Dan Hodges' career. Almost no British mainstream journalist has even [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=587.0400000000001s)]
*  criticised Hodges. I just want to add some further context. Dan Hodges was one of those who spread [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=592.48s)]
*  the lie that Israeli babies had been beheaded on the 7th of October. This is important, so let me [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=597.04s)]
*  just go through what he tweeted at the time, because accountability is very important here. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=601.28s)]
*  He quite clearly tweeted Rob Burley, formerly the producer of BBC Live programming, who said, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=606.0s)]
*  Reports of 40 babies, some beheaded, found at kabbots. This isn't freedom-fying, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=610.48s)]
*  it's depraved violence perpetrated by sick men. Someone challenged him, is this a fact? I'm sure [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=615.04s)]
*  you would not post this without verification, for shame if you did. Burley then posted a clip [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=620.4s)]
*  from Israeli television as proof. Astonishingly, he has never deleted this misinformation. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=624.72s)]
*  Hodges then added his own comment to this disgusting lie. He said, People have said Israel's [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=632.56s)]
*  response must be proportionate. Fine. What's a proportionate response to this? What would [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=638.48s)]
*  our proportionate response be if terrorists did that here? When told the response shouldn't be [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=642.56s)]
*  massacring Palestinian babies and children who are not responsible for Hamas' murderous crime, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=647.04s)]
*  he said, I didn't ask that. I asked what a proportionate response should be to the [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=651.5999999999999s)]
*  massacre of babies. Can you tell me? When asked if people would have been happy for the RAF, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=658.3199999999999s)]
*  the Royal Air Force, to bomb nationalist communities in Northern Ireland when the RAF [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=662.24s)]
*  were happily slaughtering bitches, troops and civilians on Mainline UK, he said if they'd [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=665.5999999999999s)]
*  walked into a maternity ward and beheaded 40 babies, yes. Notably, people responded to him. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=669.4399999999999s)]
*  Challenge him on whether these reports had been confirmed yet. That is private citizens [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=676.88s)]
*  challenging a journalist at a national newspaper on the most basic principles of journalism. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=680.48s)]
*  No Israeli babies were beheaded on the 7th of October. Not one. The number of Israeli [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=686.16s)]
*  infants killed on the 7th of October is one. Eight-month-old Mila Cohen was shot dead through [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=690.48s)]
*  the door of a safe room by Hamas militants, indisputably a crime. No question, along with [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=695.68s)]
*  the other war crimes committed that day. The purpose of the false claim about the beheading [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=699.76s)]
*  of Israeli babies, which was spread by multiple British newspapers and the President of the [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=703.36s)]
*  United States, was very straightforward. There was almost nothing you can think of which is [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=707.12s)]
*  more depraved than beheading babies. The intention was to present violence committed by Palestinian [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=711.04s)]
*  militants as uniquely depraved and thus distinct from the violence of the Israeli state. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=715.2s)]
*  You can see from Hodges' tweets why it was to build acquiescence and consent for Israel's mass [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=720.5600000000001s)]
*  slaughter of the Palestinian people. That was the point of this claim. As soon as people felt [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=728.72s)]
*  horrified or traumatized by the butchery of Palestinian civilians, Israel's cheerleaders [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=733.76s)]
*  could go, remember the beheaded Israeli babies. Dole your senses of empathy and revulsion because [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=737.6800000000001s)]
*  Gaza is inhabited by monsters. While one Israeli infant was killed on the 7th of October, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=742.1600000000001s)]
*  by the 1st of January this year, 1,091 Palestinian infants had been reported [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=748.64s)]
*  violently killed out of at least 17,400 children compared to the 36 Israeli children killed on the [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=753.84s)]
*  7th of October. By infants, we're talking about those aged under the age of one. Of those infants, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=760.0s)]
*  238 were babies born after the 7th of October. These are likely to be considerable underestimates, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=766.08s)]
*  excluding those, for example, who died because of a lack of medical care because Israel destroyed [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=771.76s)]
*  Gaza's hospitals. These were babies who were burned alive by Israeli weapons. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=776.5600000000001s)]
*  These were babies whose tiny fragile little bodies with their little fingers and their [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=782.32s)]
*  little toes and their delicate skulls were ripped apart. Others were crushed to death [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=785.52s)]
*  and suffocated under rubble. Others were beheaded by Israeli weapons. Others were starved to death. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=788.96s)]
*  Some died instantly, some did not. They died in pain. Born into a world of horror, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=794.88s)]
*  dying unimaginably cruel deaths. The likes of Dan Hodges expressed infinitely more horror [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=799.28s)]
*  over fictional killings of Israeli babies than they have over the mass slaughter of Palestinian babies. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=805.92s)]
*  I know how Hodges has never deleted his false claim. I see no apology for his false claims [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=810.88s)]
*  anywhere. What possible justification could there be for that? If I said that Israeli soldiers were [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=817.92s)]
*  going around beheading Palestinian babies, leaving aside the Palestinian babies who've been beheaded [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=822.56s)]
*  because of Israeli weapons, for example, exploding. If I said Israeli soldiers were using knives to [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=825.6s)]
*  behead Palestinian babies and that was shown to be false, what do you think would happen? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=830.0s)]
*  What do you think the consequences of that will be? What would happen even in the context of [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=834.88s)]
*  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of Palestinian babies actually being slaughtered in vast numbers [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=839.28s)]
*  by Israeli weapons? Again, likely to be career ending. I'd be torn apart. I would be regarded [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=842.88s)]
*  as a disgrace to journalism. But Hodges can get away with spreading false claims about 7th October [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=848.4s)]
*  with no consequences. And as we can see, he uses those false claims to try and build support for [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=853.8399999999999s)]
*  an onslaught which then actually caused the mass slaughter of babies as well as so many other [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=858.56s)]
*  innocent civilians. Dan Hodges offers up an instructive case study about the British media. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=864.4s)]
*  Hodges can openly support war crimes. He can openly support the mass slaughter of civilians. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=868.64s)]
*  He can openly make clear his racist contempt for an entire ethnic group and he suffers no [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=872.64s)]
*  consequences. Well, that simply cannot be allowed to happen. We cannot normalise this depravity. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=876.72s)]
*  Normalising this sort of depravity will have devastating consequences, not just for Palestinians, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=880.88s)]
*  but for all humanity. If we simply normalise murderous racism, which is what this is, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=885.1999999999999s)]
*  we will go to ever darker places. All of the worst crimes of our history were made possible [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=890.48s)]
*  by the sort of attitudes shamelessly expressed by Dan Hodges. That is, obscene levels of [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=895.44s)]
*  dehumanisation which are used to justify barbarism. In the here and now, he will not suffer [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=900.1600000000001s)]
*  consequences. But we must not give up until people like Hodges do face consequences, by which I mean [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=905.44s)]
*  his tawdry little career ended in disgrace and him being turned into a public pariah like other [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=910.48s)]
*  apologists for other terrible atrocities. Either Israel's genocide is remembered for what it is, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=914.72s)]
*  a terrible crime. A terrible crime. What is normalised is humanity plunges into a hellish [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=919.44s)]
*  abyss of violent barbarism. It might take years and years until we get accountability, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=924.4s)]
*  but we can never ever ever ever give up fighting for accountability. We must keep the receipts. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=928.0799999999999s)]
*  We must remember what people did and said when there were no excuses, when it was perfectly clear [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=933.04s)]
*  what Israel had done to the people of Gaza. The stakes are too high. Right now, the likes of [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=937.52s)]
*  Hodges feels impunity, which is why he uses his platform to so shamelessly and unapologetically [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=941.84s)]
*  issue such depraved statements. That impunity must end, because the stakes are simply too high. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPqlaKwvsDE&t=946.64s)]
