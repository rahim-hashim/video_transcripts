# EXPOSED: How The US Covered Up Israel's STARVING Of Gaza
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [September 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ)
*  The US has covered up Israel's deliberate attempt to starve Gaza, its population of both food [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=0.0s)]
*  and medicine, as well as the other essentials of life, directly causing what the US knows [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=7.2s)]
*  is one of the worst humanitarian catastrophes on the face of the earth. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=11.68s)]
*  You may have correctly believed, understood this to be the case for a very long time, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=16.64s)]
*  because the evidence is absolutely overwhelming, but Israel's starvation policy, and crucially, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=20.96s)]
*  the US complicity, the extent of all that, was confirmed this week. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  Now this is criminal behaviour, literally, on the part of both Israel and its US patrons. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=33.36s)]
*  Without the complicity and indeed facilitation of the US administration, none of this would be [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=39.28s)]
*  possible. And that should help form the basis for criminal charges and trials, not just of Israeli [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=44.32s)]
*  leaders, but US leaders as well. This may take years, but I am confident by the way that one [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=51.2s)]
*  day this will happen. This crime is too big. Too grotesque. Too shameless. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=55.6s)]
*  There are new reports in the US investigative journalism outlet ProPublica, which bears the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=60.88s)]
*  headline, Israel deliberately blocked humanitarian aid to Gaza. Two government bodies concluded, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=64.8s)]
*  Antony Blinken rejected them. Antony Blinken, of course, is the US Secretary of State, who has [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=69.76s)]
*  played the key role, along with Joe Biden from the US administration side, of justifying Israel's [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=75.04s)]
*  war crimes and crimes against humanity, its genocidal onslaught, muddying the waters to [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=81.6s)]
*  deflect responsibility from Israel, not least in pretending that Israel intends to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=86.47999999999999s)]
*  agree to ceasefire deals it had no intention of agreeing to, as well as hand-wringing for US [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  domestic consumption, not actually putting any meaningful pressure on the Israeli state to prevent [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=97.36s)]
*  these hideous atrocities. Here are some crucial details. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=103.11999999999999s)]
*  The United States Agency for International Development, USAID, is led by Samantha Power, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=107.36s)]
*  a democrat who was US ambassador to the United Nations under Barack Obama. In the spring, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=111.44s)]
*  they delivered their assessment to Antony Blinken that Israel was deliberately blocking deliveries [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=116.88s)]
*  of food and medicine. They specifically sent Blinken a 17-page memo which described, for [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=121.84s)]
*  example, Israel's interference with aid efforts. Well, that's one way of putting it. The mass [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  slaughter of aid workers, destroying agricultural structures, routinely turning away aid trucks full [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=131.6s)]
*  of food and medicine, leaving them stockpiled less than 30 miles across the border in an Israeli port, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=136.56s)]
*  including enough flour to keep 1.5 million Palestinians fed for a considerable period of [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=142.88s)]
*  time. This was also backed up by the head of the State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=148.8s)]
*  and Migration, who in April determined Israel was blocking humanitarian aid. Therefore, the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=154.8s)]
*  Foreign Assistance Act should be triggered, which imposes a legal obligation on the US government [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=160.56s)]
*  to block military aid to states preventing the distribution of US-backed humanitarian aid. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=167.28s)]
*  So that would have been an astonishing $830 million at the time worth of taxpayer money on weapons and [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=173.28s)]
*  bonds. Now, we know, of course, famine has broken out in Gaza. Children have literally been dying. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=179.44s)]
*  It's not just famine, it's all the other basics like medicine and the destruction of the hospital [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=185.44000000000003s)]
*  system alone. That itself imposes a catastrophic human cost on a daily basis. Death sentences, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=191.44000000000003s)]
*  huge numbers of death sentences every day. Now, USAID concluded correctly that Gaza is one of the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=200.08s)]
*  worst humanitarian catastrophes in the world. Now, in response to the story, the US administration [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  claimed that they had put pressure on the Israeli government. But as ProPublica notes, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=213.84s)]
*  whatever concessions have been won, the aid going in is still just as inadequate as when both USAID [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=217.6s)]
*  and the State Department Refugee Bureau made these assessments. This matters, this matters a lot, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=222.08s)]
*  because the law, as I say, of the United States requires the federal government to cease giving [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=228.48000000000002s)]
*  weapons to nations which prevent US-backed humanitarian aid from being delivered, and it [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=233.12s)]
*  underlines US complicity in a genocide. Now, Blinken was asked about these reports on US cable [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=236.88s)]
*  news. Let's have a listen. Mr. Secretary, ProPublica has determined that two agencies found [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=244.56s)]
*  that Israel is deliberately stopping humanitarian aid from getting to civilians. And as you well [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=249.2s)]
*  know, the US government says that it has to restrict supplying weapons to a country that does [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=254.88s)]
*  this type of thing. Why have we not done so? So this is actually pretty, pretty typical. We had [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=259.44s)]
*  a report to put out on the humanitarian situation in Gaza and what Israel was doing to try to make [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=266.24s)]
*  sure that people got the assistance they needed. And I had different assessments from different [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  parts of the State Department, from other agencies that were involved, like USAID. My job is to sort [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=278.64s)]
*  through them, which I did, draw some conclusions from that. And we put out our report and we found [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=284.8s)]
*  that Israel needed to do a better job on the humanitarian assistance. We've seen improvements [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=289.36s)]
*  since then. It's still not sufficient. There's no follow up there, I would note, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=295.04s)]
*  which is a terrible failure of journalism. But what is the claim here? USAID in particular is [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=298.72s)]
*  the key US international aid agency, its official aid agency. The fact is Blinken overrode what they [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=303.20000000000005s)]
*  said. Is he saying they're lying? Mistaken? How would he know better than them on what grounds? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=309.44s)]
*  Who else gave him information which contradicted what they said, given it is corroborated by [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=313.6s)]
*  multiple independent aid agencies and experts across the board? It gets worse, much worse. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=318.0s)]
*  The Atlantic is a so-called centrist American publication. Its editor is actually a former [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=325.68s)]
*  IDF prison guard. That's the Israeli defence forces. You can hardly accuse this publication [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=329.76s)]
*  of having some anti-Israel agenda, though of course Israeli propagandists claim anyone who doesn't [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=334.24s)]
*  propagate Israeli lies and deceits are Hamas. Let me read from this story by Franklin Foer, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=341.36s)]
*  The War That Would Not End. It concerns a visit by Blinken to Israel last October. It reads as [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=348.15999999999997s)]
*  follows. Before he landed, he felt sure that the Israelis would accede to allowing trucks full of [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=354.64s)]
*  basic goods to enter the Strip. In the parlours of diplomacy, the agreement was pre-baked. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=359.35999999999996s)]
*  When Blinken visited Netanyahu, the Prime Minister balked. Netanyahu told Blinken that he would [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=365.59999999999997s)]
*  negotiate the matter with Biden when he arrived in two days. Blinken replied that the President [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=371.03999999999996s)]
*  wouldn't board a plane without a humanitarian agreement in place. It was lunchtime and Blinken [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=374.56s)]
*  retreated to the Acting Ambassador's home in Jerusalem, hoping that Netanyahu would reconsider [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=379.28000000000003s)]
*  in his absence. At 6pm, Blinken met Netanyahu at the key area. But the hours apart had done [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=383.44s)]
*  nothing to resolve the differences. Netanyahu kept arguing. His hands were tied. I've got people [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=388.4s)]
*  in the cabinet who don't want an aspirin to get into Gaza because of what's happened. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=392.64s)]
*  Ministers wanted to inflict collective punishment. That's not me, he added, but that's people in my [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=396.4s)]
*  coalition. Well, firstly, bollocks from this obsessively deceitful man Netanyahu. He is the [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=400.4s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister. He is responsible, of course, for the decisions taken by his government. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=406.47999999999996s)]
*  He's just tailoring his message here for an audience, in this case, an American politician [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=410.47999999999996s)]
*  who fears US public opinion and feels he has no choice but to try at least claim he's trying to [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=414.23999999999995s)]
*  extract concessions. The fact is the US knew from the start what Israel was doing and they continued [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=419.03999999999996s)]
*  to provide limitless support, not least in the form of weapons. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=425.68s)]
*  This hand-wringing was all that it was. Hand-wringing. Now, the fact is it was [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=430.40000000000003s)]
*  very clear from the very beginning that the Israeli state intended to deliberately starve [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=433.84000000000003s)]
*  the Palestinian people, not just of food, but of the very basic essentials of life in general. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=437.36s)]
*  Now, what's so infuriating about this, just being gaslit into oblivion, is you do not need to do some [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=442.4s)]
*  digging into secret Israeli files to uncover this truth. The Israeli state just ran out and said it [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=448.08s)]
*  from the start, over and over again. Their intent was open, public, shameless, gratuitous. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=452.96s)]
*  Let me just quote Yoav Galan, defence minister, on the 9th of October. He declared Israel was [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=459.35999999999996s)]
*  imposing a complete siege on Gaza. No electricity, no food, no water, no fuel. Everything is closed. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=464.88s)]
*  We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly. Let me quote, on the same day, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=470.79999999999995s)]
*  Major General Ghassan Alyan, Israeli army coordinator of government activities in the [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=475.84s)]
*  territories, Kogath, that is in charge of military operations in the occupied territories. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=479.76s)]
*  He said, Harris became ISIS and the citizens of Gaza are celebrating instead of being horrified. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=484.32s)]
*  Human animals are dealt with. Accordingly, Israel has imposed a total blockade in Gaza. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=489.03999999999996s)]
*  No electricity, no water, just damage. You wanted hell. You will get hell. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=493.36s)]
*  There's no subtlety here, is there? But the Western media failed over and over and over again [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=498.88s)]
*  to not only report, I would say, and note, many of these genocidal statements, but to give them [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=504.48s)]
*  the due prominence they deserved and crucially to frame their coverage around these statements [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=509.76s)]
*  of intent, which turned out to be a completely precise guide to what the Israeli state went and [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=514.4s)]
*  did. Now I, from the very beginning, I noted what Yoav Galan said and when he said it, I warned that [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=520.16s)]
*  these were genocidal statements. Sentiments. How could I work that out? I'm not running the [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=528.24s)]
*  government of the United States or Britain. Well, I just listened to what he said, actually. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=537.28s)]
*  Didn't take any specific insight. I just took him literally. I took them literally when they said [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=541.68s)]
*  what they said. I presume they meant what they said. They did. What were my colleagues doing in [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=545.8399999999999s)]
*  the Western media? A lot of them not even reporting these comments, not framing the coverage around [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=551.28s)]
*  them. If that had been Russia saying, we're going to starve to death, we're going to impose a total [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=556.3199999999999s)]
*  siege on the essentials of life of Ukraine, they would frame their coverage around those statements [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=560.48s)]
*  and look at what the Russian state then went and did. That did not happen here. Instead, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=564.64s)]
*  media outlets kept platforming Israeli denials, which were lies, total lies, and leaving the [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=571.4399999999999s)]
*  audience to go, well, who's to know what's really happening? The fog of war, claims, counterclaims, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=576.3199999999999s)]
*  rather than looking at what they said they were going to do and what actually happened. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=582.0s)]
*  Now, earlier this year, back in May, the International Criminal Court Chief Prosecutor [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=585.68s)]
*  issued requests for arrest warrants against both Benjamin Netanyahu and his defense minister, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=589.28s)]
*  Yov Galan, focusing above all else on this policy of starvation. Those requests are awaiting the [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=593.52s)]
*  approval of three pre-trial judges. Well, I must ask, what are you waiting for? The evidence is [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=600.0s)]
*  clear and decisive, overwhelming, incontrovertible, as well as the other pillars of Israel's genocidal [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=604.4s)]
*  campaign. The Israeli state sought to deprive the Palestinian people in Gaza of the very basics of [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=612.3199999999999s)]
*  life. And crucially, we know the US state knows all of that. And that's why it's not just Netanyahu [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=618.32s)]
*  and Galan who belong in the dock, but also Secretary of State Antony Blinken and President Joe Biden. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=623.9200000000001s)]
*  We must never give up fighting for justice for one of the greatest crimes of our age. If I sound angry, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=629.2800000000001s)]
*  it's not contrived. I am. And not just with these politicians, but with much of the Western media, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=634.88s)]
*  active complicits, actively complicit, accomplices in genocide. Doesn't get worse than that, does it? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURTdutGlXQ&t=639.84s)]
