# Israelâ€™s Aid Massacre Lies DESTROYED - By CNN!
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM)
*  Look, on one level, what I'm going to discuss with you here is absurd. When it comes to Israel's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=0.0s)]
*  genocide against the Palestinian people, we are constantly having to debate reality and truths, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=4.32s)]
*  which should be as obvious as the earth not being flat or the earth orbiting around the sun. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=8.96s)]
*  But this is deadly serious, because this is a case study of how the Western media has [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=13.76s)]
*  collaborated with the Israeli propaganda machine. Israel's lies about the Israeli army massacring [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=18.64s)]
*  starving Palestinians desperate to try to get food for them and their families have fallen apart, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=25.68s)]
*  with a major expose in CNN exposing Israel's lies, and CNN have played a terrible role in [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=29.84s)]
*  terms of their own courage of this genocide. But once again the rebuttal is too late, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=36.16s)]
*  it comes after Israel has been allowed by the Western media to sow doubt and confusion, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  so people end up concluding, I didn't know what to think, this is all they he said she said. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  So responsibility for the atrocity doesn't rightly stick to the perpetrator, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=47.92s)]
*  Israel, but ends up being categorised under fog of war. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=52.16s)]
*  A brief recap, after imposing a total siege on anything entering Gaza on the 2nd of March, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=55.76s)]
*  the Israeli state set up a bogus organisation to supposedly provide humanitarian aid, but in [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=60.48s)]
*  practice aiming to force Palestinians to move to a tiny area of Gaza so they can be trapped in a [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=65.44s)]
*  concentration camp before all the survivors are expelled. It's also set up as the finance minister [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=70.08s)]
*  Ben Smocic said, to stop Israel being accused of war crimes so it could finish what it was doing, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=74.64s)]
*  which is its genocidal plan. Now the aid is far too little and often unusable, but in any case [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=82.64s)]
*  it's a ruse, and the journey by starving civilians to pick up aid has become a shooting gallery, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=87.44s)]
*  with the Israeli military repeatedly firing on Palestinians and massacring them. The Israeli [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=92.64s)]
*  military then played to their usual game of lie, deflect, distort, gaslight, and despite the endless [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=97.2s)]
*  examples of the Israeli state having lied and lied and lied about its atrocities, Western media [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  outlets go along with it, treating Israeli claims as credible and therefore refusing to adjudicate [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=107.6s)]
*  on what's actually happened. The CNN article is headlined Death and Hunger, Videos, Expert Analysis [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=111.44s)]
*  and Witnesses Point to Israeli Gunfire in Gaza Aid Sight Shooting. What CNN establishes is that [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=117.44s)]
*  the evidence points to, in their words, the Israeli military opening fire on crowds of Palestinians as [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=122.64s)]
*  they tried to make their way to the fenced enclosure to get food. They cite evidence from [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=128.24s)]
*  more than a dozen eyewitnesses, including victims who were shot, and emphasise that the gunfire [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=132.88s)]
*  was sporadic, that it's not a one-off incident. They note that the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=136.88s)]
*  which in practice is a US-backed Israeli front, accepted that Israeli soldiers were in the area [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=141.68s)]
*  in that time frame. They rely on multiple videos which they have G-located to where hundreds of [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  Palestinians were making their way to what is a militarised aid site in Ra'far, noting the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  designated route is under the control of the Israeli military. This is such a crucial point [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=156.48s)]
*  because it speaks to why there should never have been any doubt about what happened here, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=161.68s)]
*  because it would have been impossible for anyone else to have shot these Palestinian civilians. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=165.36s)]
*  The claim was what? Harris was operating literally under Israel's nose so they could [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=170.32000000000002s)]
*  shoot Palestinians. The whole thing was just insane. It defies any reason or logic. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=175.28s)]
*  Now, CNN consulted weapons experts who concluded that the rate of gunfire heard in the footage, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=181.52s)]
*  as well as the pictures of the bullets which were shot into the bodies of Palestinian civilians, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=186.88000000000002s)]
*  were to quote, consistent with machine guns mounted by the Israeli military that could be mounted [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=192.24s)]
*  on tanks. CNN also say multiple eyewitnesses said they saw gunfire emanating from Israeli tanks [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=196.8s)]
*  nearby. This is enraging because in other circumstances, if the victims of a state which [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=203.60000000000002s)]
*  had been waging a genocidal onslaught against them for 20 months had testified about the identity of [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=208.32000000000002s)]
*  the perpetrators, that would be good enough for media outlets. But Palestinians are dehumanised [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=213.60000000000002s)]
*  and thus they are not believed. CNN notes that the IDF initially said they didn't fight civilians, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=217.6s)]
*  before later claiming they'd fired warning shots, but they now refuse to answer CNN's questions. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=222.64s)]
*  The report includes absolutely hideous examples of the Israeli army shooting at Palestinians, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=228.16s)]
*  people shot on the head, the eyes, anyone lying on the floor unable to even raise their heads [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=232.88s)]
*  because they'd be shot. They spray to Robert Meher, a professor of electrical and computer [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=237.28s)]
*  engineering at Montana State University, who specialises in forensic audio analysis and said [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=242.32s)]
*  the burst of gunfire at a rate of 15-16 shots per second from a distance of about a quarter of a [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=247.36s)]
*  mile were shots spread out and fired repeatedly in one direction. He said since the cracks were [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=252.0s)]
*  irregular, it seems more like the gunfire was being sprayed over the area. CNN also note that [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=256.64s)]
*  the Red Cross said there was a heavy proportion of head targeted injuries for bullet wounds. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=263.44s)]
*  It's clear what's happening here, the Israeli army is intentionally shooting civilians in the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=269.92s)]
*  head. It's really straightforward, it's really simple. You don't have to pass through this. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=273.12s)]
*  This is all infuriating because it was obvious from the start, and yet Western media outlets went [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=279.12s)]
*  along with the millionth attempt by Israel to lie in so contingent about its own atrocities. Here's [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  a bet, even despite this report, all blame for the massacre will still not be definitively attached [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=288.88s)]
*  to Israel by media outlets who will still treat this as yet another murky incident in the fog of [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=292.96s)]
*  war with competing claims. And those media outlets won't then focus on the questions we should be [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=297.04s)]
*  asking about the nature of a state which is deliberately shooting starving civilians in the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=301.36s)]
*  head and the complicity of Western governments in all of this. I mean, the conversation is just in [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=305.04s)]
*  the completely wrong place, isn't it? What about this in Israeli newspaper Haaretz, which contrasts [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=310.32s)]
*  IDF public denials about being linked to the shooting with closed door talks by the army [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=316.8s)]
*  that there had indeed been shooting by them in the area. What's even more repulsive is we've [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=321.12s)]
*  been here before. Israel perpetrated massacres of hungry Palestinians seeking aid over a year ago, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=326.16s)]
*  did the same campaign of deceit and disinformation, the Western media played the same nefarious role, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=331.28000000000003s)]
*  and then weeks later, in that case, CNN actually did a rebuttal but didn't receive even a fraction [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=335.84s)]
*  of the coverage or shift the overall narrative about the nature of claims made by the Israeli [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=340.88s)]
*  authorities. Here's what's even more infuriating, it's all infuriating I know. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=345.84000000000003s)]
*  As part of Israel's disinformation campaign, they released footage of gunmen [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=350.16s)]
*  firing on Palestinians which they claimed was proof Hamas was responsible. Not only was this [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=353.44s)]
*  not Hamas, but it was in fact gunmen allied to Israel. We'll unpack that in a separate video, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=357.68s)]
*  and it was in a totally separate place and a totally separate incident. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=362.16s)]
*  Now there is an article, I'm just going to come onto this, honestly brace yourselves, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=366.40000000000003s)]
*  it's in Spiked, it's a really odious publication, and this article is so unbelievable, it's cynicism [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=372.24s)]
*  and deceit in my view. That's my honest view of what we're going to go through, I'll go through [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=378.16s)]
*  it. The author is Brendan O'Neill, best that I don't say anything further about that guy, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=386.48s)]
*  he writes, 1st of June 2025, make a note of that day. If there is a good chance it will be recorded [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=390.56s)]
*  as a day of infamy, as a day when the Jews were once again libeled as the slayers of innocence, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=396.0s)]
*  as a day when the intellectual classes mimicked their benighted forebears of the medieval era, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=401.6s)]
*  and falsely acclaimed the Jewish nation of spilling blood for sport. For many, it was just an ordinary [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=406.16s)]
*  Sunday, but for those who will come to write the history of our times, it will stand out as a day [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=411.36s)]
*  of frenzy to hear say in which Jews were once again branded demons and bloodlusters. Goodness me! [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=416.24s)]
*  Rather excitable this guy isn't he? Wow, he really is someone who [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=423.84000000000003s)]
*  comes across like he enjoys pleasuring himself in front of a mirror. I would just know how [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=427.84000000000003s)]
*  disturbing it is that he talks about this as a day of infamy, not because huge numbers of civilians [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=434.08000000000004s)]
*  who were starving to death were massacred by a military force, but because of his false suggestion [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=441.36s)]
*  that this didn't happen. Apart from anything else, you can note him here as he is his mode of [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=450.16s)]
*  self-pride and others who defend Israel, conflating the Israeli state with Jewish people. In my view [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=457.28000000000003s)]
*  that's textbook antisemitism. The Israeli state and Jewish people, they are not one and the same, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=462.40000000000003s)]
*  and that demarcation is really important because actually the logical conclusion where we end up [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=468.64s)]
*  with his article is you would end up thinking if you had his frame of mind that you should then [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=474.16s)]
*  end up blaming Jewish people for what actually happened. But we're not saying that. He's suggesting [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=479.6s)]
*  that. He's suggesting that we should conflate Jewish people in Israel and he's saying, well, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=485.52s)]
*  that's, you know, this is an attack on a false attack on Jewish people because it didn't happen, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=491.68s)]
*  but now given the evidence is it absolutely did happen, I mean, it was obviously from the start, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=497.2s)]
*  if he then accepted reality by his logic, he would then have to say it's the fault of Jewish people. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=503.44s)]
*  So he's just driving people down an antisemitic passage by doing that. That's his logic. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=509.44s)]
*  I mean, it's just the irresponsibility of this, of willfully seeking to conflate the Israeli state [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=517.4399999999999s)]
*  and its actions with Jewish people is dangerous. It's dangerous. It's putting Jewish people at risk, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=525.04s)]
*  obviously. Now he goes on about reports of a massacre, mocking those who told the truth, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=530.56s)]
*  saying, with deathless cruelty, the IDF troops opened fire on the half-starved Palestinians [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=536.4s)]
*  queuing for meals. 31 souls were slaughtered in the aid center attack, as the BBC swiftly called it. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=542.16s)]
*  A venomous fury spread through the internet. No one can deny it now, people cry. Israel is [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=547.52s)]
*  replicating Nazi tactics. You brought the Nazis into this, Brendan. Again, you paint yourself into [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=552.72s)]
*  a corner here. Paint yourself into a corner here because you're suggesting that if this is true, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=560.72s)]
*  then we should invoke the sort of horrors committed by the Nazis, aren't you? That's where this ends. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=567.2s)]
*  I mean, we are talking about a genocide and the Nazis did commit a genocide. Not every genocide [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=575.76s)]
*  is the same. The Holocaust and this genocide is different in the same way the Rwandan genocide is [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=582.4s)]
*  not the same as the Holocaust. Srebrenica isn't the same as any of these. They're all different, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=588.0s)]
*  but again, they will all go down in history as examples of genocide. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=592.72s)]
*  He goes on, there was one problem with these breathless accounts of a wicked massacre. It [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=597.52s)]
*  seems no such thing took place. Not that confident there, actually, is he? He doesn't say it didn't [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=600.88s)]
*  happen. He says it seemed... I mean, I wouldn't, if I were him, be so frothing at the mouth with [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=604.64s)]
*  a denial of something which you don't actually seem very confident about, largely because [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=612.0s)]
*  the evidence is only pointing in one direction. Last night, the BBC backtracked. No, it didn't. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=617.2s)]
*  We'll come on to that. It said it has now studied the graphic video of the aid center massacre and [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=621.36s)]
*  ruled that is incorrect. We were told that the BBC was not going to be able to do that. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=625.68s)]
*  That is incorrect. We were told the massacre took place early in the morning, yet the direction, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=629.52s)]
*  the shadows in the clip, point to an event that took place at a 7pm local time. More devastatingly, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=632.8s)]
*  the BBC geolocated the clip and found it was filmed at a part of Karunis, that is, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=637.52s)]
*  four and a half kilometers from the nearest aid distribution center. A journalist in Gaza confirmed [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=641.36s)]
*  it. The events in the viral clip are unrelated to any aid distribution site. This is the exact same [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=645.36s)]
*  untruth which the White House propagated. He's right, the video in question has nothing to do [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=650.96s)]
*  with the aid massacre. The BBC never claimed it was to do with the aid massacre. They reported [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=656.48s)]
*  that this video circulating online wasn't about the massacre in question, but they never claimed [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=661.9200000000001s)]
*  it was. There are in fact multiple other videos which do show the massacre taking place. This [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=667.12s)]
*  particular video isn't that massacre. Lots of people are being shot in Gaza all the time. Yes, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=672.16s)]
*  that's true. This is not the only incident of people being massacred, of being shot at. That's [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=679.76s)]
*  true. But you're just spreading an untruth about what the BBC did here, which the White House did. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=684.88s)]
*  And the BBC, who themselves protected Israel from actual responsibility for what they did, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=691.68s)]
*  have noted they didn't say what you are suggesting they said. He goes on to say, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=700.96s)]
*  we've watched as an untruth spread with uncommon speed to every corner of the earth. We've seen a [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=706.24s)]
*  serious calumny. I've never quite worked out how to say calumny because I'm not an 18th century [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=710.88s)]
*  Protestant puritan preacher or whatever. But anyway, he says be taken as good coin [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=719.12s)]
*  by newsmakers and influencers. You could just write like a normal person, by the way. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=724.72s)]
*  I'm sorry to just interject with literary critique, but you sound crazy. You sound like a really crazy [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=728.16s)]
*  person. It's just not, it's just this sort of prose. I would imagine you've had about five [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=734.48s)]
*  aneurysms, scannily through this. But I mean, it's not normal writing. I'm all for a bit of floral, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=742.88s)]
*  you know, hammer up a bit. But this is like, you sound crazy. I don't want to use stigmatized things, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=752.32s)]
*  but you do sound unhinged. Worst, we've witnessed an eruption of bigotry, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=760.08s)]
*  reports of an aid center massacre unleashed untold due hatred. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=764.4s)]
*  Goes on to make your claims you would only accept again if you were incapable of separating Israel [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=768.96s)]
*  from the Jewish people. Stop equating Israel and its actions with Jewish people. Stop it. Just stop [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=773.12s)]
*  doing it. You don't need to do that. Stop putting people at risk by making those equations. He goes [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=778.24s)]
*  on to attack variously Amnesty International, an Australian doctor in Gaza, among other things. He [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=786.8s)]
*  also attacked me in it, by the way. He said journalists spread the story across social media. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=790.88s)]
*  The Israeli army massacred journalists queuing for food, Owen Jones told his million followers on X. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=794.88s)]
*  Briefly said that Israel's aid initiative is just another stage. It's genocide against the Palestinian [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=799.4399999999999s)]
*  people. Yeah, I said what I said because it's true. That's the facts. Yeah, you see, because [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=803.68s)]
*  genocide involves seeking to destroy people and hold them all in power. Israel has deliberately [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=812.96s)]
*  prevented aid and the basic means of life from getting into Gaza. They've set up this [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=818.5600000000001s)]
*  ruse, which is not distributing anywhere near the aid required. It violates all the basics of [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=824.1600000000001s)]
*  humanitarian provision, which is why even the former US Marine who is in charge of it resigned, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=830.72s)]
*  denouncing it as it was set up. Then what they've done is repeatedly massacred people who are coming [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=838.24s)]
*  to get the aid, which will have the impact of making starving Palestinians be too scared to [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=845.6s)]
*  try and get the aid. Israel will go, well, we provided aid. No, I thought they're not coming [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=850.72s)]
*  to get the aid. We didn't make that. It's their choice. We're sorry that they're starving themselves [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=854.4s)]
*  to death because we're here providing aid for them and then they're not going to get the aid [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=859.28s)]
*  for some reason. What now, Brendan? What now? You've rather hoisted yourself by your own [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=863.6s)]
*  petard, haven't you? You have suggested that this is so serious because people have lied [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=871.84s)]
*  about something so obscene and so repulsive that if it were true, it'd be so evil, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=879.6800000000001s)]
*  it would lead to really damning conclusions. You really have put yourself in quite the [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=886.4s)]
*  corner here. I mean, the only thing you can now do is just become a truth there. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=891.44s)]
*  That's what you can do. You can literally just say, well, reality isn't true. Facts are lies. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=895.6s)]
*  Don't believe your lying eyes and ears. Because what's important, and this is why we have to [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=903.5200000000001s)]
*  stage an intervention with the likes of Brendan and Neil, these conclusions should not be about [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=908.1600000000001s)]
*  demonizing Jewish people as a whole. As you are suggesting, they should as the logical conclusions [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=911.7600000000001s)]
*  of these facts. You're saying basically, this is an outrageous attack on Jewish people, which is [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=917.6s)]
*  untrue. But if you're now having to accept it's true, then you would have to be, as I've said [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=926.96s)]
*  before, you would have to be going, well, actually it's true. This is what these Jewish people have [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=934.72s)]
*  done. But you shouldn't be doing that because it's the Israeli state responsible, not Jewish [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=938.5600000000001s)]
*  people as a whole. The Israeli state is indeed committing a grotesque crime of historic proportions. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=942.08s)]
*  That is the point. What's your possible response to this, Brendan, given the corner you're painting [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=946.48s)]
*  yourself into? Go and respond. Are you going to claim that CNN is now Hamas, the experts they [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=950.32s)]
*  consulted are Hamas, facts are Hamas? This is a teachable moment, isn't it for you? This is just [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=955.12s)]
*  one atrocity committed by the Israeli state, which has perpetrated every war crime under the sun. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=960.32s)]
*  You are now, unless you are completely off your head, going to have to accept the Israeli army [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=964.96s)]
*  lied about this, that they did shoot repeatedly and deliberately at Palestinian civilians trying [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=970.0s)]
*  to get food. So what conclusions are you going to draw? You accept that if it's true, it's actually [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=977.6s)]
*  really evil. Israel's cheerleaders know where this is heading. They know that this is going to go down [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=989.52s)]
*  overall as one of the great crimes of our age. They know that we're getting to a tipping point [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=997.84s)]
*  that is going to end up in a situation where anyone who doesn't accept this genocide for what it is [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=1002.8000000000001s)]
*  faces being banned for all eternity for their complicity. And I'm really, really sorry, Brendan, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=1007.12s)]
*  to have to break this to you, but we are going to keep these receipts. You have written what you [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=1011.36s)]
*  have written. The internet never forgets. We're not going to forget. You are engaging in atrocity [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=1015.12s)]
*  denial during a genocide. That is complicity. That's complicity. The attempt to get Western [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=1023.28s)]
*  public opinion to not believe in atrocities being committed by a state armed and backed by the West, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=1036.0s)]
*  which therefore Western governments are responsible for, has terrible consequences [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=1044.56s)]
*  because it deflects pressure from Western governments who Israel relies on to commit [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=1049.76s)]
*  these atrocities from doing something about it. This is complicity. You're not going to get away [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXo8OYUtCMM&t=1054.0s)]
