# This Outrageous Gaza Article In 'The Economist' Should Be A Scandal
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [April 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI)
*  Without the Western media, Israel's genocide would have been impossible. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=0.0s)]
*  Now today I'm going to offer up a case study. It's from The Economist, a mainstream establishment [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=3.92s)]
*  so-called centre-right publication. And they've published a leader, that is an article which [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  expresses the official position of the magazine, which on social media was trailed as follows. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=13.76s)]
*  Israel seems to have drawn the conclusion that cruel tactics work. In Gaza, it is preparing what [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=18.16s)]
*  may become a huge ground operation, shameful plans for ethnic cleansing or gaining currency. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=23.2s)]
*  My initial response here is to be truthful and content. It's taken The Economist 18 months of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  utter horror and depravity and the best they can come up with is, Israel seems to have drawn the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=33.92s)]
*  conclusion that cruel tactics work itself a gruesome euphemistic description of flagrant, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=38.32s)]
*  objective war crimes, with seams acting to turn what is straightforward, undeniable fact, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=44.959999999999994s)]
*  into a contestable matter of opinion. The article itself is morally wretched and is racist. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=52.16s)]
*  The headline is, Israel's expansionism is a danger to others and itself. Followed by the subheading, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=57.68s)]
*  it risks turning Hebris into disaster. This is a genre of article which goes along the lines of, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=63.76s)]
*  as you'll see, look, we speak here as a friend of Israel and we're worried that you're hurting [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  yourself. We're only trying to protect you from yourself with some good friendly advice. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=73.44s)]
*  This is a state, let's just be clear, whose leaders have arrest warrants against them for [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=77.44s)]
*  war crimes and crimes against humanity issued by the International Criminal Court. With a [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=82.96s)]
*  genocide case lodged against them at the International Court of Justice, and with a [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=86.8s)]
*  consensus stretching from pre-eminent human rights organisations such as Amnesty International to [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=91.12s)]
*  genocide scholars like Israeli-American Professor Omar Batov that Israel is committing genocide. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  None of that mentioned here of course because those facts would hardly reflect well on a [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=101.6s)]
*  publication posing as a critical friend. The article begins, it is hard to believe today [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=105.44s)]
*  that 18 months ago Israel was in grave peril. So open to it with just abject nonsense. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=111.2s)]
*  There's no question that grave war crimes were committed on 7th October, I've always been clear [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=115.52s)]
*  about that. The idea there was any existential threat to the state of Israel is risable and it [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=119.36s)]
*  is a fiction conjured up to justify the genocidal onslaught which Israel has gone on to commit. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  Indeed, to back up this fiction, The Economist writes, surrounded by enemies, bickering with [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=130.96s)]
*  its main ally in Washington, I beg your pardon, ah yes, who can forget the massive ruckus between [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=136.16s)]
*  the US government and Israel as Joe Biden handed Â£26 billion worth of military aid to Israel [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=141.28s)]
*  to facilitate his genocide whilst the US offered endless diplomatic support, used the bully pulper [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=147.04s)]
*  at the presidency to spread false claims to justify the genocidal onslaught, like false claims about [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=152.4s)]
*  beheaded babies on 7th October, deflecting from actual atrocities over and over again committed [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=157.68s)]
*  by Israel. We could go on. Does The Economist think that occasional hand-wringing by the Biden [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=162.4s)]
*  administration, indulged purely for domestic consumption, posed some sort of existential [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=166.88s)]
*  threat to Israel? Obviously they don't think that. They're spreading knowingly what is deceit. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=170.64s)]
*  They know that's not true. But today The Economist says that Israel is rampant, that this time Israel [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=176.23999999999998s)]
*  is fighting on its own terms and with full American backing, and that rather than making Israel safe, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=182.0s)]
*  Israel risks turning hubris into disaster. Here is an obvious example of Western media racism which [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=186.79999999999998s)]
*  is so normalised those guilty of it probably couldn't even begin to understand the charge. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=193.44s)]
*  The argument here is that there hasn't been a disaster, that there's only a risk of a disaster. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=197.52s)]
*  Gaza has been wiped from the face of the earth. Its civilian infrastructure, homes, hospitals, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  schools, libraries, universities, mosques, churches, agriculture, free production, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=207.84s)]
*  literally everything, destroyed. Countless tens of thousands of mostly children, women and elderly [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=212.0s)]
*  people have been murdered, killed, violently so. Gaza has been deliberately starved. Its people [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=217.12s)]
*  have been repeatedly violently displaced. I could go on forever. And that's without [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=222.16s)]
*  talking about the murderous pogroms of the West Bank, the murderous ruin in Lebanon and beyond. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=227.2s)]
*  Does this not qualify as a disaster for The Economist which is already, has already [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=231.44s)]
*  unfolded and is unfolding? Why not? Because by disaster The Economist isn't talking about [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=236.88s)]
*  Palestinian or Arab life. Because their lives don't matter. A disaster only qualifies as such [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=242.72s)]
*  if the victims are perceived to be us, the West, which Israel is counted as belonging to. Indeed, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=248.8s)]
*  the article says the improvement in Israel's security has been remarkable and welcome. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=254.24s)]
*  No mention here what this so-called improvement in Israel's security has meant in terms of the mass [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=258.88s)]
*  slaughter of so many people. If the same number of Israelis had been slaughtered, The Economist [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=263.84000000000003s)]
*  would quite rightly be judging that as one of the worst obscenities of our age. We wouldn't dream [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=267.44s)]
*  of saying whatever was supposed to be portrayed as a net benefit. That anyone talking about a net [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=272.16s)]
*  benefit in those circumstances, The Economist would rightly be describing as a monster. But [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=278.64s)]
*  here that human cost isn't even deemed relevant to that sentence. That lauding goes on. Military [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  action in Lebanon has decapitated Hezbollah. Nothing about the mass butchery of Lebanese civilians. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=287.36s)]
*  Well, that's not entirely true in terms of the total erasure I should say about civilian costs. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=292.96s)]
*  Let's be fair because The Economist goes on to say, however, the Israeli government has drawn [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=297.52s)]
*  two worrying conclusions from the success. One is that cruel tactics work. Having killed tens of [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=301.44s)]
*  thousands of civilians in Gaza, it has again withheld aid and shut off basic services in what [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=306.24s)]
*  looks like a violation of international law. Firstly, the mass slaughter of tens of thousands [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=310.88s)]
*  of civilians isn't alluded to there in passing as a crime in of itself, but simply because of the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=315.68s)]
*  fear that it might set a bad precedent. And that next line, it has again withheld aid and shut off [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=320.56s)]
*  basic services in what looks like a violation of international law. Just straightforward gaslighting [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=325.2s)]
*  here. Israel has imposed a total blockade on anything entering Gaza since the beginning of [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=331.2s)]
*  March, which The Economist knows full well because Israel announced it. And the consequence of that [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  by the way is all the bakeries have now closed. Why not mention the fact that Israel has imposed [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=342.32s)]
*  openly a total blockade in Gaza? They've said it. And that's the reality on the ground. That doesn't [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=346.64s)]
*  look like a violation of international law. It is a violation of international law, a grave violation [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=352.64s)]
*  of international law, which you could then mention the fact the International Criminal [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=357.52s)]
*  Court has already issued arrest warrants about deliberate starvation. That's a straightforward [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=361.12s)]
*  fact. Why not mention that? Why the emission and deceit by emission is still deceit? There's no [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=365.35999999999996s)]
*  legal interpretation of international law that says otherwise, by the way. Now, The Economist says [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=371.52s)]
*  shameful plans for ethnic cleansing are gaining currency, which it links to Trump's open plan to [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=375.35999999999996s)]
*  remove all Palestinians from Gaza. What is The Economist talking about gaining currency? It's [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=381.03999999999996s)]
*  literally Israel's official plan. Netanyahu has publicly declared this is the plan, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=385.04s)]
*  where you're not hiding this. Is he supposed to be more explicit? What would it mean to be more [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=389.92s)]
*  explicit? What's he supposed to say? The Economist then discusses what it says is Israel's rapid [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=394.72s)]
*  de facto annexation of the West Bank, expanding Israeli settlements, forcing tens of thousands [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=400.16s)]
*  of Palestinians from their homes and allowing violent settlers to rampage unchecked. None of [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=404.0s)]
*  these described as the literal crimes, of course, that they are, which is again just as a fact, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=407.84000000000003s)]
*  not a violation of objective journalism to say that. The Economist then discusses Israel's attack [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=412.48s)]
*  on Lebanon, which it doesn't critique because of the war crimes that Israel has committed, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=416.56s)]
*  not mentioned, but because of a fear that they're counterproductive from Israel's point of view, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=419.84000000000003s)]
*  that it might discredit Lebanese groups who are working to shut Hezbollah out of power, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=424.32s)]
*  and similarly, The Economist fears attacks on Syria are also counterproductive. And here's the key [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=428.08000000000004s)]
*  point from The Economist. It says this is a dangerous path for Israel. Its fear is what all [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=433.20000000000005s)]
*  this means for Israel, not the barbarism being unleashed against Palestinians and Arabs as crimes [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=439.2s)]
*  of their own right. The Economist goes on to suggest, well, Trump isn't a dependable ally. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=443.44s)]
*  Arab leaders may reflect their people's hostility and time, and therefore Israel's regional [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=447.44s)]
*  alliances may be threatened. Again, this is just racism here. It's just plainly making it clear [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=451.92s)]
*  from the Economist's perspective whose lives matter and whose lives do not. Because the objection [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=459.52s)]
*  isn't to crimes committed against people who aren't Israelis, us. It's about the potential [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=466.16s)]
*  danger to us by this, us being the Israelis who are counted as us. Now, The Economist warns that [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=473.28000000000003s)]
*  after the horrors of October 7th, most Israelis opposed the creation of a Palestinian state. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=478.8s)]
*  Note how the atrocities of 7th October are horrors, but the far deadly atrocities committed [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=482.88s)]
*  by Israel every day since then do not qualify as such. Nunu, they're merely strategic missteps as [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=488.08000000000004s)]
*  far as The Economist is concerned. Obviously, wait for this bit. Just you wait for this bit. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=493.36s)]
*  Formal annexation of Palestinian land would lead either to ethnic cleansing or the creation of [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=498.48s)]
*  non-citizens without full rights, or to further cooping up Palestinians in tiny, non-viable [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=502.48s)]
*  statelets. If those policies are enacted, it will be an affront to the values on which Israel was [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=508.08000000000004s)]
*  founded. If you feel like you are losing your mind as I read this out, then you are in good company. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=513.12s)]
*  Here is a prime example of how the Western media will turn reality on its head if it protects [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=523.12s)]
*  Israel. It suggests here that the formal annexation of Palestinian land, ethnic cleansing [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=527.68s)]
*  of Palestinians, the creation of non-citizens without full rights, would be an affront to the [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=532.0799999999999s)]
*  values on which Israel was founded. What values are those then? Here's a question I'd like to [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=536.0799999999999s)]
*  ask The Economist. Have they read a book? Or just skin-read Wikipedia? The foundation of Israel [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=542.0799999999999s)]
*  involved the so-called Nakba, in which 750,000 Palestinians were driven from the land and around [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=547.28s)]
*  15,000 Palestinians butchered in the process. The vast majority of people living in Gaza are [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=551.76s)]
*  the family members of those driven from their homes in what is now Israel, as Palestinian [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=556.88s)]
*  land was not only annexed, but 400 Palestinian towns and villages were emptied of their populations [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=560.24s)]
*  and most of them destroyed. Goodness me! How is it possible to write that and not feel ashamed, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=564.64s)]
*  ashamed as a journalist? Ashamed that you can just write something which is so flagrantly at odds [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=576.64s)]
*  with reality? I mean, it's Orwellian. I mean, is it ignorance or is it deceit? Either which, this [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=586.24s)]
*  person should not be in journalism. And given we're talking about the official position of The [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=594.88s)]
*  Economist, not good, is it? The article goes on, over extension, maybe the most corrosive within [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=599.28s)]
*  Israel. The trauma of October 7th ought to have united Israeli society. Well, I'm sorry to say [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=604.4000000000001s)]
*  this, but Israeli society is pretty united according to the polling, with courageous [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=609.6s)]
*  exceptions. And those courageous Israelis will one day be vindicated. But if you look at the polling, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=612.6400000000001s)]
*  in terms of wiping Gaza from the map, starving its people, I mean, around 80% of Jewish Israelis [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=618.08s)]
*  support the removal of Gaza's entire population, as well as the gripping of genocidal mania. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=623.6s)]
*  The main division in Israeli society alluded to by The Economist is those who believe the genocide [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=628.24s)]
*  should be paused until the hostages, Israeli hostages, are overturned, Palestinian hostages [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=633.36s)]
*  not mentioned, and those who don't think that. Now, if you believe that Palestinian life isn't [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=637.92s)]
*  of equal worth, or indeed not even worth a fraction of the worth in Israeli life, then sure, that is [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=642.72s)]
*  a substantial division. But for the rest of us, I'm afraid it isn't. Because Israeli society, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=648.24s)]
*  because of impunity, has become united in genocidal frenzy. And all the polling bears that out. Now, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=654.8000000000001s)]
*  The Economist goes on, yada yada yada, Israel looks strong, its army is tired, and its politics [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=662.08s)]
*  is split. But it finally gets to the real horror here. Just you wait for it. This is, this is blood [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=666.88s)]
*  curdling stuff. Wait for it. Meanwhile, the most dynamic part of the Israeli economy is tech sector, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=671.5200000000001s)]
*  it's highly mobile. Before October 7th, tech workers dismayed at political divisions, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=676.96s)]
*  and erosion of the rule of law threatened to move abroad. They may one day make good on those [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=680.88s)]
*  threats. Now look, I know many of you are concerned about trivialities like the mass slaughter of [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=685.0400000000001s)]
*  children and babies, about the massacre of paramedics, their bodies thrown in mass graves, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=689.84s)]
*  deliberate starvation, industrialised torture and rape. But have you spared a moment to worry [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=694.1600000000001s)]
*  about Israel's tech pros looking for work elsewhere? Good to know The Economist has its [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=698.24s)]
*  priorities straight. These are the real menaces that have emerged from the last year and a half. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=703.2800000000001s)]
*  The Economist ends as follows. For many years, Israel depended on its American allies to tell [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=712.24s)]
*  it when to stop fighting. Minister Trump in the White House, those days are over. Israel now needs [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=716.72s)]
*  the wisdom to practice self-restraint. Ah yes, who can forget Joe Biden getting Israel to stop [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=721.0400000000001s)]
*  fighting rather than say facilitating Israel wiping Gaza from the face of the earth in some of the [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=725.9200000000001s)]
*  worst destruction ever unleashed against the civilian population. If we're really going there, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=730.4s)]
*  it was Trump who got Israel to stop fighting, really became president, technically, even if [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=737.76s)]
*  that was only a cynical ruse. So what now, Economist? What the Economist here is suggesting [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=743.28s)]
*  is that a state which has committed some of the most heinous crimes of the 21st century, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=748.72s)]
*  all facilitated by the West, and specifically the US government under both Biden and Trump, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=752.3199999999999s)]
*  could plausibly show self-restraint when its leaders and officials have made clear their [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=756.3199999999999s)]
*  genocidal intent from day one, statements of genocidal intent that the Economist has [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=759.6s)]
*  overwhelmingly failed to even cover, let alone frame their coverage around, even though it was [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=764.0s)]
*  the most accurate predictor of what Israel would in fact go on to do. Here is a case study of a [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=768.0s)]
*  Western media industry which throughout this genocide has resorted to deceit, to gaslighting, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=772.1600000000001s)]
*  to turning reality on its head, to erasing and whitewashing reality we could go on. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=776.0s)]
*  This empty hand-wringing is not the Economist absolving itself of its own complicity, it is [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=780.1600000000001s)]
*  deepening its complicity in one of the gravest crimes of our age. Well, we have gathered our [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=784.64s)]
*  receipts and the Economist, like other Western media outlets, will have to account for what he's done. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZaosBDFHI&t=789.12s)]
