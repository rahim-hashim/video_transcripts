# Israel's DESPERATE Attempt To Stop Netanyahu Arrest
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [September 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMMGuhzGIWs)
*  Here is the latest show of desperation from the Israeli stay as accountability finally comes
*  knocking for some of the worst atrocities committed in the 21st century, in a genocidal
*  onslaught which has offered yet more evidence of the human capacity for depravity, as if the dark
*  history of our species did not already have enough. Now for days, there have been rumours
*  swirling that the International Criminal Court is about to finally issue arrest warrants against
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defence minister Yoav Galan for war crimes
*  and crimes against humanity committed in the course of Israel's onslaught against Gaza.
*  You may recall that requests for those arrest warrants were issued on the 20th of May this year,
*  that is 123 days ago, approaching 18 weeks ago, by the ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan.
*  A recap there, the process is that those requests have to be approved by three judges in the
*  pre-trial chamber who hail from France, Romania and Benin. There have been repeated attempts to
*  sabotage this process, not least by the conservative former government of the United Kingdom here,
*  before it was defeated in the general election, which submitted an utterly vexatious attempt at
*  de-eruvalment despite the terrible inadequacies of Geir Starmer's Labour government, including
*  on Palestine. They at least thankfully dropped that particular wrecking attempt, though the bar
*  really is on the floor, abiding my international law, not trying to wreck it. Now, indeed,
*  just so you don't think I'm being ungrateful here, today's Guardian reports that number 10,
*  that is the seat of power here in the UK, has been on alert for a week now about imminent arrest
*  warrants and that they fear that the ICC will expect the British government to support those
*  warrants. Oh, the indignity of it all. Having to support international law as a signatory nation
*  to the ICC and a government which presents itself as being full of integrity and respecting the rule
*  of law. Having to be consistent, having loudly, rightly backed the ICC arrest warrant against
*  Vladimir Putin and trumpeted the importance of international law in that context. Poor,
*  old British government. Honestly, though, what Starmer's government is briefing is truly desperate.
*  They say that this support would need to be offered at a time when Britain hasn't prescribed Iran's
*  Islamic Revolutionary Guard Court in the UK. What? Why is that relevant? I'm certainly no fan of Iran's
*  regime, but Britain hasn't prescribed the Israeli defence forces or Mossad either,
*  if we're going to go down that route, despite the murder of the rampages they've been on either.
*  There is a term for what you're hearing there from the British government and that is called
*  what about to me. You are asked to consider an issue on its own merits, which is in this case,
*  the International Criminal Court, which you, the British government, are signatory to,
*  deciding that the level of evidence which exists that the Israeli state has committed war crimes
*  and crimes against humanity is so high that legal proceedings have been issued.
*  Because you find that fact terribly inconvenient and embarrassing, you go, well, what about Iran?
*  Look over there. What about those guys? It's also stupid because the UK already has extensive
*  sanctions in place against Iran anyway. See, there you go, British government. Just say that. I've
*  sorted out your line for you. You don't have to pay me. Don't worry. I'll just take, you know,
*  I'll accept thanks in the form of just a band of international law, to be honest.
*  The article says the concern here is that what is described as the large anti-Iranian lobby inside
*  parliament will say this is the wrong priorities by the UK because they're seeing the arrest of
*  the leader of a democratic state or the attempt to arrest the leader of a democratic state
*  when the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps isn't prescribed. I mean, first of all,
*  Israel is subjecting over five million Palestinians across the occupied territories to a military
*  occupation. They object to, against their wishes, against their consent, the longest belligerent
*  occupation in modern human history. In fact, there's nothing democratic about that tyranny.
*  It's an experience as democracy. It is experienced as tyranny. So calling Israel a democratic state
*  is a stupid nonsense. Also, what matters here isn't the domestic nature of the state. It is whether
*  it's committing war crimes and crimes against humanity, which incidentally it is on a mass scale.
*  You can't go, well, we've got elections amongst our local population, who the polls incidentally
*  show are gripped by genocidal mania. So that means we can't be committing war crimes against
*  Palestinians and guards on the West Bank. How does that even make sense? How does one follow
*  from the other? What they're spinning in their briefings, as per this very useful article,
*  is that they're, and I quote, most concerned by the explosive political fallout, the ICC issues
*  in the restaurant for Netanyahu, especially at such a moment of extreme tension in the Middle East.
*  Yeah, that's definitely it, isn't it? That's definitely what's worrying them.
*  It's nothing to do with the fact that the British state is a key ally of Israel,
*  but leading figures in this British government, and what was then the official opposition,
*  publicly legitimised Israeli war crimes from the very outset of this horror, and the issuing
*  of arrests warrants will thereby damn them as well, because they too, our leaders here in Britain,
*  will face public shame for their own complicity. Not least given that complicity continues in
*  government. There was some fanfare over the suspension of some British weapons in the week,
*  but it was over about 8% of total arms sales. The British government continues to give Israel
*  key material to prosecute this genocide, not least the sale of parts for F-35 jets, which
*  rain death and destruction on the people of Gaza. There are legal proceedings in place
*  against the British government. I've interviewed those behind that, those brilliant lawyers,
*  and indeed, David Lamme, the Foreign Secretary, has been written to notifying him of his potential
*  criminal liability given the continued sale of F-35 jets, which are complicit in war crimes,
*  or facilitating, actually enacting war crimes. They can't say they didn't know, you see. That's
*  the point about these letters. You tell them there's a public record at the time, which states
*  what's happening. So then they can't go in the future, we didn't know, we didn't know. Yeah,
*  you did. Yeah, you did. You know exactly what's going on. That's why they're worried, because
*  they're worried about liability in the future. These people are going to be around for decades
*  alive. They don't know, I mean, they're thinking how could this end up piling out,
*  given the scale of the crime, even if they're arrested in 10 or 20 or 30 years,
*  which is plausible, I think, by the way. Anyway, Israel clearly got wind of the fact the ICC is
*  imminently poised to issue arrest warrants. That's because they are almost spying on everything the
*  ICC does. And indeed, they have a history of attempting to blackmail and intimidate the ICC,
*  which I've covered in a previous video. It is my strong belief that they will be absolutely up to
*  all sorts of shenanigans with the ICC now, which I think will come out in the years to come. Now,
*  Israel today issued an official challenge to the jurisdiction of the ICC, as well as the legality
*  of the prosecutor's arrest warrant request. They've clearly waited until the last minute,
*  hoping this will delay things. They're relying on two well-rehearsed ruses here. One is that the
*  ICC doesn't have jurisdiction because Israel did not sign up to it. Well, tough luck, buddies,
*  because Palestine did. Unfortunately, you didn't manage to scrub Palestine out of existence, did
*  you? Not for want of trying. The ICC has jurisdictions for war crimes committed in
*  Palestine by anyone, and that includes you, Israel. Two, they claim Israel is a democracy
*  within an independent and respected legal system. What they're going on here is the
*  question of complementarity, which is the fact that the ICC only has a mandate to act if it's judged
*  that the state in question does not have the capacity through its own legal system to properly
*  hold to account those who are accused. The idea that Israel is ever going to hold to account,
*  Netanyahu or Defense Minister Yoch Galant for war crimes or crimes against humanity,
*  is a very bad joke. They've consistently let soldiers off the hook for obscene war crimes.
*  The idea they're going to properly legally hold to account their own leaders is an insult to
*  everyone's intelligence. I know it, you know it, everyone knows it. Now, Adil Haq, a professor of
*  law at Rutgers University, a distinguished leading legal expert, has taken this nonsense apart in
*  this spewish nonsense in an important thread. He points out the deadline to request leave to submit
*  amicus observations expired on July 12th and approved observations on 6th of August. Another
*  challenge would need to be only issued when an investigational prosecution has begun. That is,
*  after arrest warrants have been issued. Under other relevant legal articles, they would need to be
*  at the earliest opportunity. Now, he says, Adil Haq, the arguments described appear wrong on the
*  merits, but the court should reject these briefs as procedurally improper. Let's hope the court
*  does this promptly and finally issues these arrest warrants. But in the meantime,
*  those hideous, abominable war crimes only continue every single day. Footage emerged on Thursday
*  of Israeli soldiers throwing three Palestinians from a rooftop during a raid in the West Bank.
*  You see one blindfolded being thrown from a roof. I've seen it. I'm not going to share it here.
*  I don't know whether they'd already been executed or whether they were still alive. One seemed to
*  outstretch his arms as he fell. Whether they are alive or dead, this is a war crime. If dead,
*  you are forbidden from desecrating the bodies of the dead. Remember when we were told routinely
*  that Hamas threw people from roofs and this was evidence of their depravity? There's actually no
*  evidence of this happening. It's not to justify Hamas, just a fact on this particular question.
*  We do know that ISIS threw people from roofs. They're very famous for that. And was that not
*  offered rightly as central evidence of the utter barbarism of ISIS? And yet this is the Israeli
*  army armed and backed by our governments, the allied army of the West, once again in full view
*  of the world, committing some of the worst war crimes of our age. Today they've been bombing
*  Lebanon again, reportedly killing several children. Not content with slaughtering
*  Palestinian kids, they're back to butchering Lebanese kids too. Well, the ICC must act.
*  And when they do, it's not just those who supported this abomination who must be held to account.
*  I've said this all the way through this. Those who stayed silent in positions of influence,
*  apart from platitudes and handwringing, they too must be held to account. You see, those who did
*  nothing when they had a platform, when they had the power to do something about one of the worst
*  crimes of our age, well, they too are culpable. And all the way through history, the lesson we
*  always need to learn is it is the silent, the silent who play a pivotal role in allowing
*  monstrous atrocities to be committed. They stopped being silent and they spoke out and they did
*  something. These atrocities would never be possible. Please like and subscribe, give me your

*  Firstly, we do our annual Going to Labour Party Conference and Conservative Party Conference videos
*  next week. So next Wednesday, I think we release the one from Labour Party Conference. I will be
*  talking partly about Gaza and Palestine. I'll be challenging, as best I can, the politicians there
*  in the British government, as well as Labour Party members about the role of their government.
*  And I've been talking about a project for a long time and it has taken so much effort and resources.
*  You'll see what I mean. I can't say more, unfortunately still. I know I keep saying this,
*  you're like, what is this? Just, yeah, I wish I could, you know, it has to be,
*  has to be just right. Everything has to be in place. You'll see what I mean.
*  I think you'll appreciate it. I hope so. I'll speak to you soon.
