# Trump: We Will EXPEL Gaza's ENTIRE POPULATION
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM)
*  So it's clear that the Trump administration is dead set on facilitating a grave, grave war crime. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=0.0s)]
*  The forced displacement of the Palestinian population of Gaza. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=6.48s)]
*  Let's listen to this clip of President Trump being [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=10.72s)]
*  asked questions by journalists in the White House. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=13.92s)]
*  The Egyptian president and the King of Jordan have both said that they won't take in displaced [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=16.4s)]
*  people from Gaza like you suggested. Is there anything you can do to make them do that? I mean, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=21.36s)]
*  tariffs against those countries, for example? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=25.92s)]
*  Uh, they will do it. They will do it. They're going to do it. Okay. We do a lot for them and [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=28.479999999999997s)]
*  they're going to do it. Now, first of all, that question from the British journalist, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=37.92s)]
*  Danny Kemp, the White House correspondent for the AFP news agency, is a textbook example of media [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=41.36s)]
*  normalization of US Israeli crimes and therefore complicity. What Kemp is referring to is forced [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=48.0s)]
*  displacement, which is a grave war crime. It is ethnic cleansing. But listen to how the journalist [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=54.4s)]
*  frames the question. He asked Trump about Egypt and Jordan saying they won't take displaced people [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=60.56s)]
*  from Gaza like you suggested and asked, is there anything you can do to make them do that? I mean, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  tariffs against those countries, for example? Now, I know Kemp's fellow journalists are defensive [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=72.32s)]
*  about this. Journalistic solidarity kicks in. Their view is, look at the answer he elicited. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  That's the story. Focus on that. Indeed, we will. But not before we discuss the normalization [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=82.72s)]
*  of war crimes. The Western media has normalized Israel's genocide of mayhem ever since it began [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=88.16s)]
*  482 days ago. And here's a striking example of it. The premise of the question is about whether [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=94.08s)]
*  Trump could wage economic warfare against two countries so they can facilitate a war crime. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=100.32s)]
*  Where are the journalists asking Trump whether he's aware that forced displacement is a war crime? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=107.36s)]
*  Where are the journalists asking about ethnic cleansing? It seems utopian to even suggest [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=112.64s)]
*  journalists might consider asking basic questions like this, which speaks to the problem at hand. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=117.36s)]
*  Maybe they fear they'd never be able to be able to ask questions again. They'd be evicted from [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=122.08s)]
*  being able to do so. Well, if you can't ask meaningful questions and indeed feel you're unable [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=127.92s)]
*  to do so, other than, I don't know, the only thing you can do in this case is help normalize [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=132.24s)]
*  hideous war crimes, perhaps ask yourself if there's any point you being there in the first place [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=137.52s)]
*  Imagine Donald Trump had publicly committed to the forcible removal of the Ukrainian people from [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=142.72s)]
*  Ukraine and was trying to force Poland and Belarus and other countries to take them all. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=147.76s)]
*  Would journalists really be asking Trump about whether he was going to impose tariffs on them [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=152.24s)]
*  and wage economic warfare in order to compel them to facilitate a criminal act of ethnic cleansing? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=156.96s)]
*  In terms of the substance of what Trump has said here, he's clearly committed to the ethnic [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=163.6s)]
*  cleansing of Gaza. What he said a few days ago to reporters in Air Force One when he said Gaza was [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=168.48s)]
*  a demolition site in Egypt and Jordan would need to take people in order to clean out that whole [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=174.56s)]
*  thing, these are clearly not whimsical asides. Indeed, Israeli officials briefed Israeli television [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  that these comments were coordinated with the Israeli government. With that in mind, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=185.76s)]
*  let's turn to Steve Witkoff, the White House special envoy to the Middle East. He's just [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=190.72s)]
*  visited Gaza, or rather more to the point what remains of Gaza. He's the first US official to [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=194.88s)]
*  visit Gaza in 15 years, itself a damning indictment which speaks for itself. He told the US media [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=199.92s)]
*  outlet Axios, what was inescapable is that there is almost nothing left of Gaza. He added, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=206.88s)]
*  people are moving north to get back to their homes and see what happened and turn around and leave. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=213.28s)]
*  There is no water and no electricity. It is stunning just how much damage occurred there. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=217.76s)]
*  He then told them, based on what he saw, Gaza is uninhabitable. He added, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=223.27999999999997s)]
*  there is nothing left standing, many unexploded ordinances. It is not safe to walk there. It is [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  very dangerous. I wouldn't have known this without going there and inspecting. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=233.83999999999997s)]
*  Not to be rude here, but really? Really? Could Witkoff really not have known [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=239.27999999999997s)]
*  any of this without going there? I haven't visited the apocalyptic wasteland Gaza was [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=245.51999999999998s)]
*  deliberately and systematically reduced to, but I really could have told him this in advance for [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=249.52s)]
*  free. Has he not watched the freely available footage of what Israel has been doing to Gaza, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=253.84s)]
*  virtually every day now for the approaching 16 months? Has he not seen the videos of entire [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=258.16s)]
*  residential blocks being destroyed, or indeed of Israeli soldiers wiring up explosives to say mosques, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=263.2s)]
*  schools, universities, then blowing them up? Has he not watched the footage of Israeli soldiers, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=269.6s)]
*  often laughing raucously as they blow stuff up for the hell of it, then [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=275.76s)]
*  post it on social media for public amusement? Was Witkoff not aware of what experts concluded [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=279.28s)]
*  in December 2023, after just two months of this carnage, that Israel had wreaked by then more [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=285.68s)]
*  destruction in that time period than the raising of Aleppo in Syria over the course of four years, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=292.0s)]
*  or Ukraine's Mari Pol by Russian forces, or indeed proportionately the Allied bombing of Germany [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=298.15999999999997s)]
*  in World War II? That as one of these experts stated, at the time, Gaza is now a different [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=304.32s)]
*  colour from space, it's a different texture. Did Witkoff not see the UN estimates that about [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=310.32s)]
*  70% of Gaza's buildings have been damaged or destroyed? Was he not familiar with the United [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=317.04s)]
*  Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs publishing a report this month estimating [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=322.08s)]
*  that 92% of housing units in Gaza were destroyed or severely or partially damaged? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=327.28s)]
*  When the UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, declared he'd never seen such a level of death [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=334.32s)]
*  and destruction as we are seeing in Gaza in the last few months, did Witkoff think he was [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=339.12s)]
*  exaggerating? Yeah, undoubtedly, the total ruin of Gaza when seen up close must be [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=343.84s)]
*  unimaginably shocking, even for those who've cheered on the crime. Many months ago, a Palestinian [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=349.28s)]
*  former journalist in Gaza I've regularly spoken to texted me, it was the early hours, I was in a [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  bar in Dublin, punters were drunk and merry. This Palestinian former journalist said it was like [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=358.96s)]
*  being trapped in an end of the world film. The contrast between where I was and what he was [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=366.4s)]
*  enduring was itself a shocking jolt. Actually seeing the devastated ruins of what is Gaza now, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=371.91999999999996s)]
*  a strip of land no bigger than East London where Israel has detonated explosives with several [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=377.35999999999996s)]
*  times the equivalent firepower of the Hiroshima bomb must be a salutary experience. But Witkoff [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=382.32s)]
*  must have known, he must have known the truth because the devastating truth was there for anyone [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=388.08s)]
*  and everyone from the very beginning. How can the US Special Envoy to the Middle East not look at [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=393.76s)]
*  this utter apocalyptic devastation and not conclude a terrible crime has been committed? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=401.12s)]
*  Does he really believe in his heart of hearts that there was a legitimate military target in [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=405.59999999999997s)]
*  virtually every square meter of Gaza and that an attack on that, all those individual legitimate [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=409.68s)]
*  military targets was proportionate to the military advantage gained despite the civilian [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=415.36s)]
*  slaughter and suffering each of those attacks would cause? Of course he doesn't believe that. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=421.28000000000003s)]
*  No one believes that fiction. Anyone who says that is a liar, a disturbed liar. Everyone knows Israel, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=424.48s)]
*  everyone knows Israel set out to destroy Gaza and inflict a terrible collective punishment [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=431.36s)]
*  on its people because the Israeli state made that clear from day one. It is worth looking, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=436.16s)]
*  it is worth looking at some of the drone footage of what has been done to Gaza. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=441.92s)]
*  The incredible courageous Palestinian journalist Hossam Shabat posted this footage of Bay Hanun [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=445.76000000000005s)]
*  which had a population of over 50,000 people before this genocide began. Take a look. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=451.28000000000003s)]
*  Now, Steve Witkoff says it will take between 10 and 15 years to rebuild Gaza. What is very [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=471.04s)]
*  clear is that Israel's plan all along was to make Gaza inhospitable so its population would be killed [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=482.40000000000003s)]
*  and those who survived would end up forced to flee. Indeed, according to a report in an Israeli [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=487.28000000000003s)]
*  newspaper back in December 2023 Benjamin Netanyahu ordered his top advisor, Ron Dürmer, the Minister [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=493.20000000000005s)]
*  of Strategic Affairs to come up with plans to in quotes thin out the Palestinian population in Gaza [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=498.96s)]
*  to a minimum. It was always clear what Israel was going to do because they said what they would do [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=504.88s)]
*  from the very start. The western media normalised this abomination and now they're going to normalise [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=510.08s)]
*  Trump's support for literal mass ethnic cleansing of Gaza. As ever, we have to document all of this [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=515.12s)]
*  because we have to hold the guilty to account and eventually to justice. Please like and subscribe, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXzOgHZHJVM&t=521.6s)]
