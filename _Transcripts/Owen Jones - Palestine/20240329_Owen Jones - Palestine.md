# Israel Losing Gaza War Israeli Major
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [March 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSvrc8SE2lY)
*  Is Israel losing as it inflicts a genocidal war on Gaza? On the surface of it, this may seem
*  rather counterintuitive. After all, Israel has the continued patronage of the United States,
*  the world's only remaining superpower, who despite occasional public hand-wringing about
*  this mass slaughter, continue to provide Israel with the support it needs to continue wiping
*  Gaza off the face of the earth. In recent days, they authorised billions of dollars in bombs and
*  fighter jets, including 2,000 pound bombs which have been repeatedly used to kill large numbers
*  of innocent Palestinians in one go. That's despite knowing Israel plans an assault on Rafa,
*  where a majority of Gaza's population has been driven to, where even when they supposedly oppose
*  such an onslaught, they hand over the weapons to make it possible. Israel has destroyed or severely
*  damaged most of Gaza's civilian infrastructure, is increasingly reduced to Palestinian people
*  to starvation, with the most acute famine since World War II unfolding before our eyes.
*  It has inflicted what one UN official describes as the biggest rate of killing
*  since the Rwandan genocide. So, an article in the Jerusalem Post about comments made on Israeli
*  radio by former IDF Major General Israel Ziv is rather instructive to say the least. He says,
*  Hamas's military capabilities have indeed been damaged, undoubtedly eliminated by the IDF,
*  but they still have thousands of terrorists. The terrorist in terms of civilian control remains
*  in the hands of Hamas, the organisation is alive and still kicking. He goes on to say,
*  In the absence of a policy, what is the IDF supposed to do? We are over five months into
*  this war without any predictable political goal. Let's say we stayed until now. What is next?
*  Even if we stayed and declared that we were occupying, we would become the new government
*  in Gaza. Israel would need to establish civil, police and security systems and take care of
*  the various services. What happened to us is not just the Hamas situation. The lack of decision
*  making on that part is the most serious thing. He's basically saying Israel doesn't have a
*  strategy at all. Essentially, that's what he's saying. Indeed, the question there he's posing is
*  rather interesting. I would note much of the Israeli establishment has a rather obvious
*  answer to it. You render Gaza so uninhibitable that you drive most of the population out. You
*  make life so miserable and you kill as many people in the process that those who survive wish to flee.
*  What remains is placed under brutal, unrelenting military occupation with Gaza parceled up into
*  zones. He goes on, this Israeli former senior army officer, commenting on Canada's decision to stop
*  armed shipments to Israel, saying, Israel is in the middle of a very serious international crisis.
*  I don't remember one like this before. His result not only of the lack of advocacy, but also that
*  Israel is in a deep crisis as a result of the lack of policy. There we go again, he's back to lack
*  of strategy. Everything points to the fact that the government does not make policy decisions.
*  Not only do we not know what the best decision is, but the world does not know either. He
*  complains that the world is not being shown what he calls the heroic actions of the IDF. He says,
*  they only show photos of the humanitarian crisis, the demolition and the destruction. Well, no shit
*  because that's what's happening. I mean, firstly, he's taking the mitkid, given how much favorable
*  coverage Israel has got from so many media outlets and how many have failed to show the utter horror
*  of what Israel has actually done to Gaza. Many have had to rely on social media instead.
*  Weird we're not seeing what he calls the heroic actions of the IDF, given the famine, mass
*  destruction of infrastructure, mass death, the genocide or rhetoric of leaders and officials,
*  and indeed media organizations in Israel. And the fact the IDF themselves keep posting their own
*  war crimes on TikTok and online, as well as their general gleeful triumphalism and then pillaging
*  and posing with the stolen belongings of displaced, maimed and slaughtered Palestinians. Now,
*  interestingly though, he goes on to say, because of this, the public opinion in the world is
*  against us. The point here is that in the end, he says, the US will not be there for us either
*  because there is a limit to what they are willing to contain. He warns that if Israel goes back to
*  being a nation on its own, maybe we can last a few months, but says Israel wouldn't be able to
*  continue to defeat Hezbollah in the north without backing for its allies and said we're already in
*  a very serious situation. Israel must make a decision. He was America doesn't work for Israel,
*  saying they have worked with Israel until now, but America doesn't agree with Israel's policy.
*  When asked about the need to convince the US or the necessity of the action in RAFA, he says,
*  we're not ourselves convinced. Asking if RAFA is so important, why didn't we enter anyway?
*  I'm not quite sure about the phrasing quoted after this because he says, after what happened
*  on October 7th, we proceeded cautiously and with an excess of force, we did not act with
*  exceptional sophistication and we did not create control. I mean, that seems a little contradictory
*  to me and obviously there was no restraint there. Crucially, he says by saying that the IDF knows
*  what to do, but the war is being lost. It has no goals, no direction. If you agree with the path
*  of the government, the problems will continue. If not, please make room for someone else.
*  Really fascinating stuff there. Now lots there, but this is damning. Bear in mind that Gaza is
*  only the size of East London and this has been going on for six months. Six months of Israel
*  smashing this tiny strip into little pieces. I mean, there was, I think this portrayal that Israel
*  would be able to, you know, I mean, there was talk, I remember of, you know, the US wanting this all
*  done and dusted by mid January and we're now approaching April. A map shared by Charlie Herbert,
*  a former UK general who served in Afghanistan in mid-March, showed only a tiny proportion of
*  Gaza's undercurrent IDF control. Large swathes were in a security vacuum with the rest controlled
*  by Hamas. In fact, a very significant chunk still controlled by Hamas according to the map
*  which he shares. Now he added, reminds me of our old Afghan mapping. Very similar. We thought we
*  had security control. In reality, we only ever controlled a tiny percentage of the country. The
*  remainder was governed by the Taliban. That ended well, didn't it? Well, indeed. And actually,
*  you know, the circumstances are far more fortuitous in the sense for Hamas in the sense,
*  this is obviously the case of a people which have been brutally occupied and suffering this
*  genocidal war with the resultant desire amongst the overwhelming population of Palestine to be rid
*  of their occupiers. Now it's worth noting that last month, US intelligence officials told
*  Congress that Israel was not close to defeating Hamas. They added, American officials have also
*  raised doubts about whether the destruction or elimination of Hamas is a realistic objective,
*  given it operates like a guerrilla force hidden in a network of tunnels that are difficult to
*  penetrate. Now, while Netanyahu had publicly claimed to have killed two thirds of Hamas fighters,
*  US officials thought he was only a third. But there was another crucial point here.
*  They say, American officials also emphasised that the United States has learned in war after war
*  that counting the number of enemies killed in an insurgency or counter-terrorism operation is a
*  fool's game. Operations that kill militants often radicalise others, swelling the ranks of enemy
*  organisations. And US officials say death counts of fighters do not give an indication of whether
*  a government has addressed the core issues driving the war. Very, very important points. I mean,
*  what that says is they will continue this war of annihilation, which will just keep exterminating
*  Palestinians, but will do. You can't wipe out an idea. It's stupid to think that a guerrilla
*  force is a static number. If you wiped them all out, there's still other people who've watched
*  their families and loved ones be slaughtered who can take up arms. It doesn't take much training,
*  does it, to be a guerrilla fighter in the grand scheme of things? You need determination. And if
*  you have seen unbelievable suffering and suffered the most horrific injustices, then that will drive
*  you to fight. It's an obvious point, which we have learned throughout history, have we not?
*  Which is why the genocide implications come through, because you keep hearing Israeli
*  officials making this point and on media organisations in Israel saying they need
*  to kill children because they're going to be so-called terrorists. But this is a case of
*  they'll just keep carrying on murdering people because they've already killed around 40,000
*  people and they haven't come close to killing Hamas. So how many more tens of thousands does
*  that mean? Indeed, Israel Shin Bet, its domestic intelligence agency, last month declared Hamas
*  would continue as a guerrilla force after supposed military defeats. But that point about public
*  opinion is so important. Israel has counted for so long on the overwhelming support largely of US
*  public opinion for a very long time. That is dramatically changing. A new poll in the US finds
*  a huge shift away from Israel. In November, 50% of Americans said they approved of Israel's
*  military onslaught and 45% disapproved. So now 36 approve with 55% disapproving. A startling shift,
*  a huge shift and a shift that's only going to carry on in one direction. Even President
*  Donald Trump, former president, opportunistically sensing an opening given how Joe Biden's trashed
*  his reputation amongst natural democratic voters because of his complicity in genocide said,
*  Israel has to be very careful because you're losing a lot of the world, you're losing a lot
*  of support, you have to finish up, you have to get the job done and you have to get onto peace,
*  to get onto a normal life Israel and for everybody else. Well, he's clearly looking at which way the
*  winds are shifting there. Israel is looking at a future in which public opinion in the main state
*  which arms and backs Israel is turning against it, which will mean growing numbers of voters
*  will demand an end to military support for Israel and aid and for the US to use its enormous leverage
*  to force Israel to end its oppression of the Palestinians. Right now Israel has impunity and
*  impunity breeds hubris. But I think that Israeli officer has a point. This is a genocidal war. Well,
*  he hasn't said that, which has caused huge amounts of suffering. But it also may prove a catastrophic
*  strategic mistake for the Israeli state and it clearly hasn't thought that through.
