# Israel Genocide Apologists Torn Apart - Why Amnesty's Expos√© Was RIGHT - w. Kristine Beckerle
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [December 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QV1Q0pWnXo)
*  Now Amnesty International, of course the international human rights organization, its reputation
*  precedes it, has issued a devastating report which concludes that Israel is committing
*  genocide against the Palestinian people in Gaza. It's an exceptionally detailed, legally
*  founded, legally precise document. It's very important to make that clear. I suppose often
*  those who have been apologists for the hideous onslaught against the Palestinian people have
*  attempted to almost suggest that genocide has been used as a kind of moralistic term,
*  an imprecise term, but this is about the law. It's about what the international law says,
*  it's about legal definitions and how that of course is reflected, how that reflects
*  the hideous suffering that the Palestinian people are currently suffering. I'm really
*  delighted to be joined by Christine Bacall, who is a lawyer, a researcher, who worked
*  on this formidable piece of work which has just been released. It's great timing because
*  understandably, predictably, this report has come under a huge amount of attack, including
*  bad faith criticisms, which we can very easily address. Christine, it's great to be here.
*  You're in a man in Jordan at the moment, are you? Yes, and thank you very much for having me.
*  Great to see you. I just want to start, actually, just with, I just want to start, just get it over
*  and done with basically, because the assault on this document has focused on the idea that
*  Amnesty International had to redefine what genocide is in order to fit the evidence,
*  basically, to come up with that conclusion. Just explain what this bad faith criticism
*  is really all about and why it's nonsense. Yeah, you know, I will say before we released
*  the report, I was so nervous because I knew that there was going to be a lot of attacks
*  once it came out. I knew that was going to happen. I was so nervous there was going to be these really
*  very difficult to respond to arguments. And then it turns out that so many of the arguments were
*  just sort of silly, that in a way, it felt like it was relieving. But in another way, it was extremely
*  upsetting given that if these are the only arguments that you have to launch against a
*  report that is making a finding of genocide, then why are you either arguing, why are you not sort
*  of focusing on what's in the report? But the debate goes as follows. Basically, you've seen
*  this kind of immediate quick argument that Amnesty made up a new definition of genocide to be able to
*  use the word genocide. My favorite response to this so far was that someone interviewed an Irish law
*  professor and they asked him, you know, has Amnesty made up a new definition for genocide? And he
*  basically just said no. But to kind of give a more honest or kind of more in-depth answer, this report,
*  so one thing I should say, it's not just me. This report was put together by this massive team of
*  people, including a massive team of brilliant lawyers, in addition to the Amnesty lawyers that
*  worked on this report. We also sent it out to external experts, including on genocide, to sort
*  of think through to make sure that we were really getting everything right. And you don't really
*  need to listen to me in terms of how Amnesty approaches genocide. You can just go look at
*  the report. And what it does is it explains that it's building and it's using the definition of
*  genocide in the Genocide Convention, which is super clear. And then it's using the findings of
*  international courts, in particular the International Court of Justice, to understand and interpret how
*  one applies that legal term to particular situations and contexts. The thing that everyone's kind of
*  riled up about is what Amnesty discusses in the report is this debate over whether or not when you
*  say there is a finding of genocidal intent, whether or not that has to be the only intent,
*  meaning that I only want to specifically destroy a group but I don't want really anything else,
*  or it can be a dual intent, meaning I want to destroy a group and maybe I also want to destroy
*  an armed group. And basically what Amnesty does, again following international courts, following
*  a lot of other kind of very, very smart international lawyers, it says that when we look at genocide,
*  we can say that so long as you can prove that there is specific intent to destroy a group,
*  that that intent can exist alongside other goals, for example the desire to destroy an armed group.
*  This is particularly important in the context of Gaza and frankly in the context of any war
*  ever, because in any war an attacking military, a military is going to have multiple different
*  goals, multiple different motives, will probably really want to destroy the armed group and to say
*  that if they want those other things, then there can not possibly be genocidal intent found,
*  because it's not the only intent, would basically make the protections that are supposed to exist
*  under the genocide convention moot when we're talking about situations of conflict in war.
*  So what the Amnesty report does is not redefine genocide, it tries to unpack all of these things
*  as already discussed by international courts in the context of Israel-Palestine to explain how
*  we're applying this legal term and how we're applying the interpretations of this legal term
*  by international courts today. And just to be clear, when we talk about genocide, what, because
*  people have lots of ideas in their heads when they and they think maybe they know the answer,
*  but just to be very precise, when we're talking about genocide, what are we saying?
*  Sure, so basically you need to do two things if you want to sort of show that an actor has
*  committed genocide and kind of the place to go if people are interested is the genocide convention
*  and article two just says what genocide is, but you basically need to show two things. One, you
*  need to show that an actor committed prohibited acts under the genocide convention, there's a list
*  of five. We at Amnesty looked at three prohibited acts under the genocide convention, specifically
*  killing members of a group, causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group, and
*  inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the physical destruction of the group.
*  And then the second thing you need to do is you need to show that those acts were committed with
*  the specific intent to destroy in whole or in part a group protected under the genocide convention.
*  And when I say a group protected under the genocide convention, that needs to be kind of
*  a cohesive group that has particular factors. There's not really a debate whether or not
*  Palestinians constitute a protected group, but the big kind of difference that people will point to
*  about genocide versus, for example, other international crimes is genocide is really done
*  against a group. So these prohibited acts are done against a group with the specific intent to destroy
*  them in whole or in part. A criticism of a different direction might go what's taking so long,
*  14 months of this genocidal mayhem with just blood curdling, genocidal rhetoric
*  backed up with some of the most heinous, imaginable atrocities on a daily basis.
*  Why is it taking 14 months for Amnesty? Yeah, I mean, to be honest, when I am asked this question
*  or when I hear my colleagues ask this question, I think it's fair. Like what we've seen in Gaza
*  over the last 14 months, but frankly what we've seen in Israel, Palestine over the last many,
*  many years is a stain on kind of the entire international community. But why it took us,
*  and also, I mean, it's worth saying that Amnesty is by far not the first to make a determination
*  of genocide post October 7th. So why did it take us so much time? It took us so much time because
*  Amnesty takes its time when it does its research. This report, like I said, was a massive team effort.
*  We did deep, deep dive research on, for example, airstrikes. We did deep, deep dive research on
*  conditions of life. We looked at, we wrote to the Israeli authorities multiple times.
*  And we wanted to be absolutely sure that we knew exactly what we were saying in every single piece
*  of this report. And we also wanted to be absolutely sure that if we were going to make a
*  determine of genocide, if we were going to make it in this way with the strong of a conclusion,
*  that we were ready to do it. And we were completely certain of what we were putting out into the world.
*  And do I wish that we sort of, I don't know, could have responded or could have moved faster,
*  maybe, but also maybe not, because I wouldn't have wanted us to come out until we were ready
*  with the amount of research that we had and the amount of detail that we had,
*  because I feel like it makes the argument stronger.
*  Let's just talk about intent and the question of intent. And, you know, I interviewed towards
*  the beginning of the genocide, Raz Segal, who's an Israeli-American associate professor of genocide
*  and Holocaust studies. And he said it's very rare for intent to be so loudly spoken. I mean,
*  he came out to talk about genocide very early on. We're talking the days after the 7th of October.
*  And the reason he did that was because of the expressions of intent, because although
*  terrible atrocities were committed from the very beginning against the people of Gaza,
*  the vast majority of them obviously happened since he made that determination.
*  And I just want to give one example. And this was Major General Ghassan Alleyan. He's the Israeli
*  army coordinator of government activities in the territories, Koga. He's in charge of civilian
*  affairs of the IDF, for those who don't know. And on the 9th of October, a video statement was
*  released by Koga's Twitter account. It was specifically addressed to Hamas and the residents
*  of Gaza. Very important point, because he then said Hamas became ISIS and the citizens of Gaza
*  are celebrating instead of being horrified. Human beasts are dealt with accordingly. Israel has
*  imposed a total blockade on Gaza. No electricity, no water, just damage. You wanted hell. You will
*  get hell. Now, there's no pretense there about the demarcation of military targets on the civilian
*  population. Collective guilt of the civilian population is pronounced. Collective punishment
*  is pronounced, including the siege of all the basic needs of life. No water. I mean, come on.
*  I mean, do you think actually, even the fact we have to discuss this, when actually,
*  I've just mentioned one statement, but there are so many statements from Israeli politicians,
*  generals, army officers, political, you know, soldiers, media, I mean, it's relentless. I mean,
*  do you think there's actually quite rare for this to be so overtly spoken? Because Ra'si Gal said
*  to me, normally states go to great lengths to suppress this kind of intent. Yeah, I think
*  one thing that I never thought I would be saying about a report that I worked on, but I will say
*  it because it's true. One thing that has been kind of startling to me, but also not that startling
*  to me is that after the report came out, just presenting it to people, like for example,
*  journalists or advocates or civil society people, or even bureaucrats,
*  were not really telling anybody stuff they don't already know. Like that's the kind of thing,
*  back to your point about 14 months. So when Amnesty looked at, like the thing with this genocide is
*  Amnesty is providing a 300 page report where we really worked really hard to kind of know every
*  single thing that we were putting forward and sort of put it into a framework that helped people
*  think through how genocide applies to what's been happening in Gaza. But this has all also been
*  live streamed. And also you have all these Israeli officials putting statements online in English and
*  Hebrew, making these extremely dehumanizing statements. You have Israeli officials who are
*  not just kind of random officials, but officials who directly have a say in what is happening in
*  Gaza, making these sorts of statements over and over and over again. And so yes, does it sort of
*  feel like then when I say, well, let me walk you through my 300 page report as to how we determine
*  genocide. And then the person that's in front of me is sort of saying, well, yeah, okay, sure. Where
*  have you been? It makes me, I will say, feel both more stronger about the fact that we did this,
*  because obviously it needed to be done, but also I would say more despairing because the fact that
*  we did this and it's been 14 months and it's ongoing, and the major arm suppliers are still
*  selling weapons. It kind of leaves us all in this world where there's a whole set of people who have
*  been paying attention and kind of know the things that we are putting forward, how they've been
*  happening, that they've been happening with the specific intent to destroy Palestinians in whole
*  or in part. And then a whole set of actors who are continuing to contribute to either arming the
*  Israeli military or defending or blocking accountability efforts. And they're not budging.
*  And so I think the hope for amnesty with this report was not necessarily, I think, to provide
*  some secret information that people who were paying attention didn't know about, but to say,
*  okay, we're going to put all this together. We're going to look at what's been happening over the
*  last 14 months. We're going to very carefully analyze it under international law, what it says
*  on genocide, and we're going to put forward our determination. And the hope was that by doing so,
*  we would contribute to the efforts that we're trying to just keep pushing on the actors that
*  we're continuing to try to deny again, but it's sort of in front of everybody's faces.
*  Do you think, I mean, in terms of when we're discussing this genocide, if we go back to
*  the request for arrest warrants for war crimes and crimes against humanity, as of yet not genocide,
*  this is the International Criminal Court, of course. And these have all, of course,
*  been issued against Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Galan. Very important to say that further charges
*  are extremely likely to be forthcoming that could end up including, of course, genocide.
*  And they don't have to be publicly made. They didn't have to make the arrest warrants public
*  in the first place. And they could end up, or most certainly will, of course, against other people
*  as well. Now, what they said in, and what I thought was quite an interesting
*  statement in the original request for arrest was by Karen Kahn, the chief prosecutor,
*  is he talked about the acts, the war crimes and crimes against humanity, and that he's focusing
*  there on starvation for three reasons in terms of the purpose. And he said one of them was
*  collectively punish the civilian population of Gaza, whom they perceive as a threat to Israel.
*  Is that basically the critical point? Israel's position is the existence of the Palestinian
*  people is an existential threat, and they work backwards from that. And there are constraints
*  that come because, you know, one of the bad faith criticisms you get is if Israel wanted to commit
*  genocide against the Palestinians, they could have done that on the 8th of October, as if any
*  genocide in history has ever been committed within 24 hours, because genocides are a process,
*  aren't they? They're not a dynamic process, not in a positive sense, but they have a logic of their
*  own. So what do you think of that? Is it basically, Israel has constraints upon it. It can't just go
*  out and just murder everyone in that sense. It has, you know, international pressure is not anywhere
*  near what it should be, but that is pressure. What do you think about that? Do they basically
*  work backwards from that point with the other constraints, with various constraints they have
*  to navigate is what I'm trying to ask. Yeah, no, totally fair. And let me use that actually to
*  kind of walk you through a little bit how we thought about genocidal intent in kind of more
*  detail, because I think it goes to that question. And I also think it goes to this question of
*  timeframe, basically. Because when we were looking at genocidal intent, we were looking at statements,
*  like the statement that you read out, and that's kind of part of the analysis, just what were
*  high level Israeli officials that could determine what was happening in Gaza saying.
*  And Amnesty looked at more than 100 statements, identified more than 20 statements by people who
*  again had a significant amount of power over Gaza making genocidal statements, also looked at
*  statements, for example, made by guys who were fighting in Gaza, celebrating destruction, this
*  kind of thing, maybe echoing statements by their leaders. So that's like one piece of the analysis,
*  but another piece of the genocidal intent analysis is looking at patterns of conduct.
*  And in that analysis on the patterns of conduct, that in that analysis, the genocidal intent
*  actually does become clearer as time passes. And the reason I'm saying it becomes clearer as time
*  passes is because if you just took a teeny tiny snapshot of, for example, humanitarian access to
*  Gaza for say one week, and COGAT does this all the time, right, they'll sort of say like, oh, look,
*  but in this week, more trucks entered Gaza than entered Gaza before October 7th. So thus,
*  we are not causing starvation and thus we are not committing genocide and thus everything's fine.
*  But that's not actually how you do an analysis like this, because then you say, okay, well,
*  COGAT, how many trucks have entered Gaza since October 7th? And if you look, there are times
*  when it goes up and then there's times when it crashes right back down. Or you say, okay, COGAT,
*  or not COGAT, the Israeli military, you're saying, we didn't actually mean to kill all
*  those civilians when we bombed this residential house or that residential house or that residential
*  house. But if you look over time and they keep doing the same thing over and over and over again,
*  knowing what the outcome is going to be, and not just knowing because they're people and they can
*  figure it out, but because everyone is telling them exactly what the outcome is going to be,
*  and they keep doing it, that those types of patterns of conduct help us think through
*  genocidal intent. And I think it would have been harder, frankly, in October or November to make a
*  patterns of conduct argument. But then when we're looking at 14 months and we can say, okay, yes,
*  you allowed more aid in in April, but then right after you attacked Rafa and devastated the aid
*  response and attacked the place where you told everybody to flee, I think when you look at things
*  in that totality and over time, that's when things start becoming much clearer about, A, the
*  constraints that Israel is in fact operating under, but the ways in which it is continuing
*  to kill seriously harm and inflict destructive conditions of life on Palestinians despite those
*  constraints. Let's talk about prohibited acts. So killing and serious, killing and causing serious
*  harm, for example. I mean, do you want to talk about that? That, you know, I mean, again, when
*  we say prohibited acts, it's probably quite obvious to people, it might not be. Let's talk about, you
*  know, what we talk about, a bit prohibited, what we're talking about, and then let's talk about
*  killing and causing serious harm, how that fits in. Sure. Yeah. So basically, for anybody who's
*  listening and interested, this is chapter six of the report. But basically, like I said, for
*  the way we did it is we broke down the analysis into looking at the prohibited acts. So I eat the
*  acts that are prohibited under the genocide convention that Israel carried out in Gaza,
*  and then looking at the specific intent, and that's chapter seven of the report, and trying to see
*  what are the indicators, what are the ways in which we can infer and determine whether or not
*  Israel had the specific intent to destroy Palestinians. Again, both of which you need to
*  say Israel is responsible for genocide. But on the prohibited acts, basically, I'm going to break that
*  into two parts, and I'll go short. If there's follow-up questions, I'm happy to answer them.
*  But the first one is killings and serious bodily injuries. And that, perhaps unsurprisingly for
*  anybody who's kind of, again, been paying attention, what we did was we looked at airstrikes
*  and Israel's aerial campaign. In particular, Amnesty did a deep dive on 15 airstrikes that
*  Israel had conducted just between October 2023 and April 2024. All 15 were either direct attacks
*  on civilians and civilian objects or indiscriminate attacks on civilians. These 15 alone killed
*  334 people, including 141 kids, wounded hundreds of others. All of them hit civilian objects. In
*  all but one case, Israel gave no warning, and the one that did give a warning, it wasn't effective.
*  Our colleagues really, really looked trying to find a military objective or a military target in
*  or near the location struck in all 15, and none of the cases did they identify a military target.
*  These strikes, obviously, are only a tiny fraction of Israel's overall attacks in Gaza.
*  One thing that has haunted me is a Palestinian doctor told Amnesty that they had to dedicate
*  an entire day a week just to amputations, and that most of the amputations were the
*  results of injuries caused by explosive weapons, where amputations was the only option.
*  Like I was saying before, viewed alone, one of these attacks, two of these attacks, three of
*  these attacks, maybe, maybe you could argue Israel is being reckless or negligent or whatever.
*  But when you look at them together and you see these patterns of merging that Israel is just
*  doing over and over again in terms of the types of weapons it's using, in terms of what it's striking,
*  in terms of hitting residential homes at night when large extended families are going to be
*  gathered, including in places where they've all been displaced to, remembering that Gaza is one
*  of the most densely populated places in the world before October 7th and post October 7th,
*  everything's become much, much, much more tightly packed together because of forced displacement.
*  It begins to indicate deliverance, and I think you also have to remember that Israel claims to be
*  one of the most technologically advanced military in the world, and this isn't Israel's first
*  foray into Gaza. If the Israeli military has been engaged in combat operations in Gaza,
*  many times over the last 10, 15 years. And when you talk to Palestinians in Gaza,
*  when you talk to humanitarians working in Gaza, when they talk about what's happened since October
*  7th versus these other wars that they've lived through, they say it is something entirely different.
*  And anyways, that's how, based on that work, Amnesty determined that Israel was committing
*  these two prohibited acts, killings and serious bodily injuries. I'll stop there because that was
*  a long answer, but I'm happy to speak about that. Really important answer. And I guess, I mean,
*  evidence is always coming out. And a new report by Air Wars, an NGO which focused on aerial
*  bombardment, they looked at the first 25 days of the bombing campaign in Gaza. They found in
*  October alone, 2023, at least 5,139 civilians were killed, of which at least 1,900 were kids.
*  And they said they looked at 606 incidents involving civilian harm. And they said,
*  whilst over 5,000 civilians were killed, between 30 and 58 militants were killed.
*  So therefore, 99.4% of incidents involving civilian harm kill civilians, with 0.6%
*  killing militants. I mean, it's important. I have to say, I'm glad. I was going to say,
*  we shouldn't be shocked, but we should never, never stop being shocked at this.
*  Something I tell myself every day, you never, ever, ever let yourself stop being shocked by this.
*  But you look at that, and that just looks like extermination.
*  Yeah, I think it's funny because our analysis, like in the report, we actually focus much more on
*  this third prohibited act, inflicting conditions of life, which is kind of like the short
*  shorthand version of that is the slow death prohibited act. But I was very glad that we
*  included the airstrike analysis. And I'm frankly, extremely glad that there are organizations like
*  Air Wars that take this sort of longer term, more data point view, because right, Amnesty looked at
*  15, and Air Wars looks at this much, much wider data set. And I just think that when you talk to
*  people about what has happened in Gaza over the last years, like the air war and the way in which
*  the air war has been fought has just been so devastating. And I think, again, it's one of
*  those things where we can issue our report, Air Wars can issue our report, but anybody who's sort
*  of doubting the extent of this, I just recommend they go look at the videos of, for example,
*  in North Gaza these days, and just how much has been destroyed and flattened.
*  I mean, a really important point, which obviously you talk about in the report,
*  obviously goes into detail, is, you know, I mean, even in, frankly, military onslaughts,
*  which are intense, but nowhere near as intense and concentrated as this, the biggest killer is not
*  violence, it's indirect causes. And as an example, you know, in Britain, if every single hospital
*  was suddenly blown up, that would impose a terrible death sentence on a very large number of people,
*  even without the intense poverty and much of the country being reduced to rubble.
*  I mean, that's the point, isn't it? It's about the conditions of life that you talk about. It's
*  about, you know, we can talk obviously horrible violence, bombing, bullets, you know, the various
*  weapons that Israel has used, but the biggest means of killing will be the other indirect
*  consequences from the multi-pronged offensive. Yeah, and I think so that was that kind of
*  ended up being a real, probably the most one of the most significant parts of our analysis,
*  for all of the reasons that you just laid out, but also because the speed with which so Gaza was
*  already experiencing a humanitarian crisis pre October 7, but the speed with which the situation
*  of the entire population deteriorated was, for lack of a better word, horrifying. And I think,
*  as part of this work, amnesty did interviews with a bunch of different people, and that included
*  humanitarian aid workers, it included people who had been displaced, it included farmers who weren't
*  able to reach their agricultural land and included included medical workers trying to provide care to
*  literally infants and other young kids suffering from malnutrition and malnutrition related
*  complications in Gaza. And I just emphasize that because I will say, working on this along like
*  was awful, but the two things that kind of kept me and I think my colleagues going was one,
*  how many people in amnesty were working on this and two, part of the stories that you were hearing
*  from people in Gaza were yes, the horrific things that were being imposed upon them by the actions
*  by the Israeli government and the Israeli military, but also the ways in which people in Gaza were
*  still trying despite it all to take care of each other. And I think I will truly never forget the
*  doctors who were trying to provide malnutrition and malnutrition related care to literally again,
*  infants and other kids. Anyways, to be more precise in terms of the research, basically,
*  I think the big thing to say here, just again, to sort of take on the misinformation head on,
*  is what critics slash the Israeli government will say in response to the humanitarian crisis in
*  Gaza is basically, no, no, it's not our fault. Like, it's not our fault. We're doing everything
*  we can. And what we tried to do in the report was to interrogate that and to say, okay, what is
*  actually happening and what are the things that are contributing to this kind of horrific set of
*  circumstances that we're seeing. And the three things we looked at were related to our previous
*  conversation, the massive damage and destruction of critical infrastructure and other objects and
*  dispensable survival of the civilian population. So you made the point about hospitals, but also
*  thinking about water and sanitation infrastructure, agricultural land, homes, and like across
*  the board, the damage and destruction is really unimaginable. The second thing, which is a big
*  part of the kind of conversation is the repeated mass force displacement of the vast majority,
*  90% of Palestinian population under inhumane conditions over and over and over again. If you
*  want another resource on this, Human Rights Watch just did a big dive on displacement. And then the
*  third, and I say the third only because you could only think about the denial and obstruction of
*  humanitarian aid and other essentials in the context of the mass damage and the mass force
*  displacement. So to give you an example of that, Kogat loves to talk about how many food trucks are
*  entering Gaza. Cool, great. Like food trucks definitely need to enter Gaza, but you can't
*  talk about just the number of food trucks without also talking about the fact that Gaza's ability
*  to produce food has basically been wiped out. And despite everything, like despite everything that
*  was happening before October 7th, farmers in Gaza actually produced like a significant amount of food
*  in the strip, including important food with important nutrients for people. And so if we're
*  going to talk about how much food is getting into Gaza, we also need to talk about what was being
*  produced in Gaza beforehand, how that's wiped out and is that being replaced? And the obvious answer
*  is no. But basically you can sort of look at all of these different things and see the ways in which
*  Israel's actions, policies, and omissions kind of came together to create the conditions of life that
*  we're seeing, which like to put it bluntly is most people in Gaza are grappling with hunger and
*  disease in a context in which not only has the medical system been totally decimated, but there
*  is no real way for people to medically evacuate if they need to medically evacuate again because
*  Israel is blocking the medical evacuation process. So yeah. That point about food, so obviously
*  discussed at length in the report and such a crucial one because, you know, it's multi-pronged,
*  doesn't it? On the one hand, you've got the serial blocking of aid trucks getting in. I mean,
*  look, even, well, I was going to say the British Foreign Minister, former Conservative Foreign
*  Secretary David Cameron listed raise Israel was blocking that back in the spring. Both US aid and
*  the State Department's Refugee Agency confirmed in April that Israel was deliberately blocking
*  food from getting in. But then there's the destruction of the roads. There's the
*  destruction of law and order and lots of evidence to suggest criminal gangs being allowed with
*  impunity, obviously to steal aid, that, you know, that you've got internal blockades and all the
*  rest of it. And 83%, as an example of all plant life, 83% of all plant life has been destroyed.
*  I mean, that's the point, isn't it? It's just making Gaza inhospitable for human life. That's
*  what's happening. Yeah. And I think we quote someone that I spoke to who has worked on sort
*  of the agricultural sector, let's say in Gaza for many, many years. And the way this person put it
*  was they stole the ability to produce food. And I think that kind of sums it up. And I think
*  there was this period, like, this isn't funny, but there was this period where I became really
*  obsessed with the fact that the Israeli authorities were blocking the import of animal food or fodder
*  into Gaza. And I became obsessed with this because if you start looking, all the agricultural inputs
*  that you would need to sort of revive the agricultural sector are being blocked or being
*  stopped or being prioritized. And it's just, it's this one teeny tiny thing within this huge,
*  wider picture. But that just shows you kind of at every step, everywhere you look, there's some
*  impediments, some blocks, some obstruction that is getting you to the situation again, where the vast
*  majority of people don't have enough food. One thing I was really, well, I was just in all of
*  it, but talking about the assault on cultural, religious structures, life, I mean, this is an
*  important part of genocide, isn't it? Where you don't just erase people, but you erase
*  their imprint on the world. And this includes religious sites which have existed for so, so long,
*  long, you know, religious sites which go back many, many, many centuries. I mean, can you talk about
*  that, how Palestinian culture is being erased from the face of the earth?
*  Yeah, I will say one of my low points after the report was released is I opened social media
*  and someone was, someone had posted a video of another controlled demolition of a mosque.
*  And I couldn't help myself, I watched it. But it hit me because in the report,
*  again, to sort of shift back into lawyerly mode for a second, when looking at genocidal intents,
*  you look at whether or not these prohibited acts were committed, but you also look at whether or
*  not other things were happening that are indicative of genocidal intent. And one of the
*  things that we specifically look at in the report is the destruction of cultural and religious
*  heritage. And particularly look at the destruction of cultural and religious heritage in these
*  controlled demolitions where people are laughing, celebrating, kind of happy about the destruction,
*  there doesn't seem to be any military threat. And again, this kind of happened again and again and
*  again. And you put that into the context of the statements, the wider context of dehumanization.
*  And yeah, it just sort of starts coming together to make this picture, which is why we did this
*  report, that the only reasonable inference of what is happening is that there is genocidal intent and
*  Israel is in fact committing genocide in Gaza. You mentioned these Israeli soldiers and well,
*  we've all seen this, you know, I'm sorry, Al Jazeera did an in-depth piece of work,
*  Richard Sanders have interviewed, on this channel about, in this case, this documentary
*  focused on the glee with which many Israeli soldiers, as you mentioned, blew things up,
*  you know, including libraries, universities, places of worship, cat-claiming, laughing,
*  you know, we've seen all sorts of degrading, you know, wearing women's clothes, playing around with
*  children's toys in just obscene ways. What do you think, just I'm not asking you from a moral
*  perspective, just from a legal perspective, because again, normally speaking, states and those,
*  a state engaged in genocidal war crimes, and the soldiers of that state normally go to great lengths
*  to disguise what they're trying to do. That has not happened here. What does that do you think tell
*  us that a lot of people look at and go, we're not just watching something horrible, we're watching
*  people who think and actually kind of know they've got impunity?
*  Yeah, so I think I'd say two things on that. Part of the reason Amnesty is kind of pushing for the
*  ICC to, not just for the ICC to go ahead and include genocide, all of these things, but also
*  for states to follow the arrest warrants that have been issued by the ICC, is that there is a complete
*  dearth of accountability within Israel. And like, you have had, so we've talked about the ICC in
*  this conversation, but the International Court of Justice, the ICJ, has an open case in front of it
*  brought by South Africa about whether or not Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians.
*  And as part of that case, the International Court of Justice specifically called on Israel to do
*  everything within its power to prevent genocide, and that should include, for example, opening
*  investigations, preventing incitement, all of these things. One of the things that Amnesty looks at
*  in their report is to show it's not happened. And when you have people saying the things that
*  they're saying, posting the videos that they're posting, it doesn't take an expert to realize
*  that those people are not afraid that they're then going to be drawn up on court martial and
*  kind of held to account for the things that they're doing. And so one of the reasons there's this kind
*  of push for international justice, for the role of third states, for example, in universal
*  jurisdiction, is because it is very, very clear that that sort of accountability is not happening
*  within Israel. And it's one of the reasons why we, again, not just focus on the ICC, but have also
*  called on third states to pursue charges where they have sufficient evidence against people who
*  seem to be involved not just in genocide, but any international crimes when they're under their
*  jurisdiction. And just so people are clear, there's this principle of complementarity
*  where the International Criminal Court intervenes when it is confident or has concluded that a
*  the state in question, its judiciary is incapable of doing free and fair trials which investigate
*  the crimes in case. And they're just in, sorry, which are which being discussed. One of the most
*  for me, and this is quoted in the report, and I've always thought again, I mean, I've said this
*  throughout, this is, in my view, the biggest scandal of modern Western journalism, in that
*  what media coverage has consistently failed to do with courageous exceptions is to frame
*  coverage around what Israeli leaders and officials said they were going to do and
*  ordered soldiers to do. And one example, which is quoted in the report, which links to what we're
*  talking about, was Yoav Galan, of course, the former defense minister who is a wanted man
*  by the International Criminal Court. On the 10th of October, he was in a, he addressed Israeli
*  soldiers who deployed near Gaza, and he told them, I released all the strains. He said,
*  attack everything, take off the gloves. And he goes on, you know, he says, to eliminate everything,
*  it will take time, it will take, it won't take a day, it won't take a week, it will take weeks,
*  and maybe months, we will reach all places. He also said the next day that he's released
*  all the restrictions on Israeli soldiers. I mean, that's the point, isn't it? I mean, again,
*  you know, sometimes you've seen coverage that suggests, has there been a breakdown in discipline
*  amongst Israeli soldiers when the defense minister, the man in charge of the Israeli army,
*  specifically told them, you have no restrictions on you, and you have no restraints. And that's
*  a really crucial part of the whole story, isn't it? Yeah, so I think I'll say two things. So one,
*  like part of what that part of the report is trying to show is, one, it really does matter what
*  high ranking officials are saying, particularly when those high ranking officials again have
*  the power to make decisions about what is happening in Gaza. And second, the ways in which
*  statements, claims by these high ranking officials then get echoed on the ground. And so I think
*  those are the two things that that part of the report is trying to show. You don't just sort of
*  say things, and then they go away. If you're the defense minister, if you're the prime minister,
*  if you're the president, what you say matters, it resonates. And I think the other thing that
*  that part of the report is trying to show, and part of the reason the report is trying to show
*  this is that when back in the day, back in the day, it's really not that back in the day, but
*  at the ICJ, one of the things that was said by the Israeli side in response to the use of these
*  statements from October was, oh, well, you know, it was the heat of the moment, people were very
*  upset, understandably, after the Hamas led attacks on October 7. So things were said. But what that
*  section of the report really shows is that, well, actually, in practice, a lot of the things that
*  were said in October were not just then implemented in Gaza, like take this total siege, just the most
*  obvious example, but then also the things that were said in October were then echoed and implemented
*  later on by soldiers in Gaza. And I think it's one of these things where people will say, oh, well,
*  but like, is that really their fault? And the thing is, yes, because there's a million things
*  that could be done to say, actually, no, there are restraints, actually, no, we will hold you
*  accountable if you do x, y, or z. Actually, no, this is completely beyond the pale of not just
*  what international law says, but what Israeli law says. And you don't see those things, you just see
*  the same behaviors continuing and continuing and continuing with the complete absence of accountability.
*  And the last thing I just have to say is that this kind of world of impunity has existed for a really
*  long time. And I think when we look at like what we're talking about this past 14 months, but when
*  we look at the last many, many years, the impunity that has existed for what the Israeli military in
*  particular, but Israeli authorities more broadly have done to the Palestinian people, both in Gaza
*  and the West Bank influences where we're at now, as does the lack of accountability that we've seen
*  more broadly internationally against what the state of Israel has been doing to the Palestinian
*  people. And I think I emphasize that just because you have all these kind of nerves and oh, but can
*  we really push for, can we really arrest a sitting member of the Israeli government? And it's like,
*  are you really going to continue the path that you've been on this many years, given that this
*  is where we are now? And I would hope the answer would be no, but let's see.
*  I mean, it's just one of the things I wanted to touch on. I mean, it's quoted, it's because,
*  you know, the Palestinian testimony is very important in the report and the quote of which
*  is used as the heading of the report is you feel like you are subhuman. And it's true, isn't it,
*  that the prerequisite for every genocide is dehumanization because the vast majority of
*  human beings in any society, not sociopaths or psychopaths, that's a very small, not 2% or so,
*  humans do have a powerful feelings of empathy and sympathy which exist, but dehumanization
*  obliterates them. And it was really interesting, again, was that the right word, disturbing
*  harrass, the Israeli newspaper carried a report by a serving Israeli soldier who said that the
*  rules of engagement prohibited the shooting of stray dogs unless the stray dogs jaws were clamped
*  on the bodies of an Israeli soldier, that no such prohibition existed for civilians who could be
*  shot at will. I mean, that sums up the dehumanization, doesn't it? It's literally,
*  their lives are worth less than the starving stray dogs of Gaza.
*  One of the things that we haven't talked about so much is that the report tries to put
*  what it's looking at, which again focuses on this period post-October 2023, into this much wider and
*  longer context of the dehumanization of Palestinians. You probably don't really need me to
*  talk you through that, but I think that when we talk about genocides, no genocide looks the exact
*  same, but the aspect of dehumanization and treating people as subhuman is kind of
*  a critical part, as is again, this intent or this animus against the particular group.
*  It's kind of just a funny thing to sort of be in a world where
*  not just what we've seen over the last 14 months, but what we've seen over the last many years in
*  terms of an unlawful blockade, we're at year 17, unlawful occupation, we're nearly 60 years apartheid
*  and that we're sort of still in the world where we're trying to convince people that it's bad
*  enough to stop selling weapons or it's bad enough to kind of comply with ICC arrest warrants.
*  And now we're in a world where genocide and it's just,
*  I don't know, I really hope the world surprises us and by the world I mean a particular set of actors,
*  namely the US and Germany as major weapon suppliers, also UK obviously. But yeah,
*  it's one of these things where we have the information, we don't need more information,
*  we have the legal analysis, we don't need more legal analysis, we have the voices of Palestinians
*  who have been speaking up for a very long time. We also have the voices of some creators,
*  Israelis who have been speaking up for a very long time, we have the voices of some
*  creators, Israelis who have been speaking up. Those aren't the problems right now, the problems
*  are political will. In fact, I just interviewed Offa Kasif who's an Israeli politician who told
*  me he fears for his life at the moment in Israel because of his speaking out against the genocide.
*  I'd just say the report goes, talks about international law, right to life, right to food,
*  right to health, these systematic violations obviously. I mean, just in terms of, I mean,
*  you can weave in as well just any kind of any parts of the report you think are really important
*  just to conclude, two final things really. But I mean, in terms of accountability,
*  this crime, a lot of people look at this and go, this crime has been so confessed to and boasted
*  about from the top to the bottom that it has been more documented thanks to the testimonies, the
*  work of Palestinian journalists who've been exterminated and social media and all the rest
*  of it and the work of the likes of Amnesty and all the rest of it. It's rare for a crime to be
*  so documented in so much detail despite the fact that other journalists, foreign journalists,
*  were banned from getting in, analysts are banned from getting into Gaza. There's still overwhelming
*  evidence. And yet the dynamic of power, we know what the dynamic of power is. The US remains the
*  only superpower. Israel is a state which is obviously very close to the United States.
*  A lot of people look and think there's never going to be accountability. They're going to
*  get away with this. They're going to get away with this obscene crime, which frankly has changed
*  people. Many of the people who've watched what's happened have been changed forever. And they see
*  these horrors. They see children being butchered by a state which puts on television shows, by the
*  way, which literally debate killing children as valid and military targets. And they think,
*  how is it, people feel like they're going mad watching that. What do you think? Is accountability
*  a utopian pipe dream? Here's what I'll say. So the first thing I'll say is that I think we can,
*  and I have, looked at the past 14 months and just felt a deep pit of despair. And like I'm someone
*  who's done human rights for a really long time. And this hasn't been the best year plus for people
*  who are invested in the international human rights system. But we can also look at this past year and
*  see mass protests around Palestine across multiple cities. You can see students risking arrest
*  to protest against genocide. You can see, frankly, Palestinian journalists keeping doing what they're
*  doing. Palestinian doctors keeping doing what they're doing. Palestinian artists, by the way,
*  the cover of the report was done by a Palestinian artist in Gaza carrying on. And I think when I
*  look at all of that, I think, well, actually, if all these people can keep fighting despite the odds,
*  then certainly I can. And I would hope that other people kind of take that inspiration away as well,
*  because frankly, like this only carries on. Accountability, it never happens if we all just
*  accept that this is the state of affairs and this is kind of necessarily the way in which the world
*  has to be. Like our despair helps. Our despair helps the people who like impunity. Our despair
*  helps the people who want to just say, well, this genocide happened, but let's forget it. Let's move on.
*  And I think kind of what we owe, and I'm speaking to sort of those who care about, for example,
*  even if Palestine is not your issue, but if you care about kind of human rights writ large,
*  what we owe right now is to keep working, basically, because the fact of the matter is,
*  is the world doesn't get better if we give up. Like it's as simple as that. It only gets better
*  if a whole bunch of people reject a set of unfair structures, unfair actions, unfair policies,
*  and in this case genocide. And like one little thing might make the difference from one other
*  person. And I'll give you a very specific example. Like I've heard people say, well, but do the
*  protests really matter? Because, you know, but the U.S. policy hasn't changed, but the students got
*  arrested. So does it really matter? But I'll tell you, like personally sitting, I live in Beirut,
*  a lot of us were feeling a lot of despair around the time that the student protests kicked off
*  in the U.S. and Europe. And those happening gave us energy. It didn't just give me energy. Like it
*  gave a bunch of my colleagues energy. And as a very, very basic thing, if something that you are
*  doing in solidarity with others helps give them the energy to keep going in a context where the
*  odds are immense, like that is something meaningful. So I can't say that that means things are going to
*  get better immediately. I can't say that that means even that this genocide is going to stop
*  immediately because it is carrying on as we speak. But I can say that unless we continue,
*  then certainly we know what the outcome is going to be. And I don't really want that outcome.
*  Well, just finally, that's what I was going to end on. It's not I often try and end on a more
*  hopeful note, but let's just be brutal. What is the direction of travel as things stand,
*  if there isn't drastic change? Talking about Gaza, which is a different colon text, so when looked
*  at from space because of the mass destruction of civilian infrastructure, the mass destruction
*  of local food production, the destruction of its health care system, a traumatized population,
*  which has been repeatedly forcibly, violently moved around a tiny strip of land, no bigger
*  than East London. I mean, you know, an excess, the death rate itself, the violent death rate,
*  the worst, as one UN official said, since the Rwandan genocide. And then there's the excess
*  deaths, which is those dying, not of the direct violence. I mean, what is Gaza? I mean, this,
*  you know, we saw Cambodia that went year after year after year. What are we looking at?
*  Well, I think just one very basic thing is I get really, really angry and annoyed when people say,
*  well, you know, like, A, obviously, we need a ceasefire, but a ceasefire is not enough.
*  Because frankly, like if the blockade remains in place, and if the situation like as it is now in
*  terms of the humanitarian crisis, something radically doesn't change to sort of help the
*  people who are currently in Gaza, you are looking at, and I don't say this lightly, years of misery,
*  like already what you lose in the first couple of years of life, if you're, for example, extremely
*  malnourished, you don't get back. So first of all, like losses, the losses that have already been
*  imposed are already unfathomable. So yes, we need a ceasefire, and we need to ceasefire right now.
*  But after a ceasefire, you also need like to allow people in Gaza to get health care. And how are
*  they going to get health care? Currently, you need to allow people in Gaza to get enough food. And
*  again, how are they going to get enough food and the entire food production system has been
*  decimated. So when you ask the direction of travel, the direction of travel right now is honestly
*  atrocious. And I think if you like people will count on us all kind of losing, losing energy,
*  being fatigued, moving on. But like the people who are still currently in Gaza living under
*  occupation, living under a blockade, like those people, this doesn't stop when we stop paying
*  attention. So I think what I would say is that one thing that gives me a you want to end on a
*  helpful note in terms of direction of travel, you like what we currently have from the International
*  Court of Justice is we have a decision saying that Israel needs to end the occupation, you have
*  states like Ireland considering taking action related to that. So in terms of the direction
*  of travel, I think if nothing changes, very, very bad. But there are things that are currently
*  happening that actually could be meaningful and could actually put important political pressure
*  on Israel to change the behavior, which I hope everyone kind of engages in what they can.
