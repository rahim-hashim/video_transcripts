# This Proves Israel Violating Genocide Convention - And Defying ICJ Orders
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [February 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0)
*  Well, this smoking good evidence is impossible to report. A little recap, Israel is on trial in the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=0.0s)]
*  world's highest court, the International Court of Justice, for alleged violations of the 1948 [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=5.76s)]
*  Genocide Convention. Last week the court issued a series of provisional orders to prevent genocide [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=10.56s)]
*  and gave Israel one month to report back on its progress. Now in a previous video I've examined [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  how the slaughter has only escalated since the ICG ruling. ICG ruling, while the demand to secure [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=20.96s)]
*  humanitarian aid, has been derailed by the main humanitarian agency, UNRWA, being financially [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=25.119999999999997s)]
*  strangled because of accusations of terrorism against 0.04% of its employees. Obviously the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=30.64s)]
*  Genocide Convention prohibits the act of genocide, that is, as it defines it, acts committed with [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  intent to destroy and hold in part a national, ethnical, racial or religious group. But it then [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=41.92s)]
*  lists five acts which shall be punishable, as it says, clearly genocide, but among them conspiracy [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=47.68s)]
*  to commit genocide, intent to commit genocide, complicity in genocide and also importantly direct [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=53.36s)]
*  and public incitement to commit genocide. So to be clear, you're not simply in violation of the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=58.8s)]
*  Genocide Convention if you commit genocide, but if you incite genocide. Interestingly Israel itself [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  translated in 1950 that 1948 Genocide Convention into its own domestic law. Obviously I don't believe [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=69.6s)]
*  for one moment Israel's leaders ever envisaged such legislation to ever relate to Israel's own [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=76.64s)]
*  treatment of the Palestinians, given it was only introduced two years after the so-called [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=81.28s)]
*  Nakba, that is the catastrophe in which three quarters of a million Palestinians were driven [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=84.72s)]
*  from their homes, 15,000 massacred in the process. Nonetheless the law is the law and according to [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=89.36s)]
*  Israel's 1950 crime of genocide, prevention and punishment law, any person guilty of incitement [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=95.04s)]
*  to commit genocide shall be treated like a person guilty of genocide. Guess what the penalty introduced [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=101.36s)]
*  for that was? I'll tell you, death. Not an exaggeration. I double checked that with an [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=106.72s)]
*  expert on Israeli law, it remains Israeli law, it's never been repealed. So in actual fact, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=112.24s)]
*  technically Israeli government ministers up to and including the Prime Minister and President, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=116.72s)]
*  Minister of Defense, various other politicians, army officers, soldiers, media outlets, journalists [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=121.2s)]
*  have committed a capital offense under Israel's own laws. I think we can safely conclude they have [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=125.44s)]
*  no intention of enforcing that particular law. Now in its damning statement, on behalf of the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=133.52s)]
*  other judges, the President of the Court, the US lawyer Joan Donohue, read out examples of genocidal [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=139.04000000000002s)]
*  incitement from senior Israeli politicians. Following on from that, one of their provisional [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=143.28s)]
*  orders was as follows. The court is also of the view that Israel must take measures within its [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=147.52s)]
*  power to prevent and punish the direct and public incitement to commit genocide in relation to the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=153.12s)]
*  members of the Palestinian group in the Gaza Strip. This particular legally binding order, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  remember, was voted for near unanimously. 16 judges to one. The dissenting judge from Uganda [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=165.68s)]
*  engaged in absolute wild behavior, even voting against humanitarian aid to Gaza on the grounds [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=170.88s)]
*  of so-called Israel-Palestine conflict was a political dispute to be resolved politically, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=175.12s)]
*  not on the courts. Uganda's own government had to release a statement distinct from her. Even [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=179.28s)]
*  Israel's own ad hoc judge voted for that particular one. So how's this order going? Well, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=184.96s)]
*  this particular case study is a slam dunk as they say, which underlines Israel's own views on abiding [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=191.12s)]
*  by this order. Let me introduce Captain Lupi, the apparent non-degear of a French Israeli soldier [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=196.56s)]
*  named Benjamin Chmoul-Sis. Let's just hear from him shall we? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  This is one of the many TikToks posted by Israeli soldiers who are boasting about war crimes. I'll [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=214.96s)]
*  do a video specifically on that soon. They're doing so because they're so confident, so cocky, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=236.24s)]
*  they can get away with anything. International law doesn't apply to them. They enjoy impunity. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=240.72s)]
*  That's their view. Not exactly a delusion, is it, as things stand. So he goes on about going to [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=244.56s)]
*  Gaza. It will be great. We are going to massacre them, massacre them. So here we go. I think we're [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=250.16s)]
*  going to safely pop back in the genocidal incitement box. Well, it's intent really if we're going there. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=254.8s)]
*  What's happened to Captain Lupi? Well, journalist Eunice Terari has been trawling through the war [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=259.6s)]
*  crimes and genocidal incitement posted by Israeli soldiers since this all began. The material is [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=264.56s)]
*  endless, frankly, and I hope he's been looked after by people because it can't be pleasant for [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=270.64s)]
*  one's own mental health to keep sifting through this. Anyway, he's uncovered this. The Israeli [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=275.2s)]
*  military has awarded him a honor certificate worth just bearing in mind again, the genocide convention, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=279.91999999999996s)]
*  Israel's own laws, and the ICJ's own provisional ruling. An Israeli soldier publicly posted about [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=287.03999999999996s)]
*  his intent to go into Gaza and massacre them. The Israeli state is duty-bound to, to quote, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=292.4s)]
*  take all measures within its power to prevent and punish the direct and public incitement to [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=297.36s)]
*  commit genocide in relation to members of a power-seeing group in the Gaza Strip. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=300.88s)]
*  What's the Israeli state doing here then? Punish and prevent the direct and public incitement to [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=305.68s)]
*  commit genocide? Nope. They handed this captain a certificate honoring him instead. Indeed, if the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=309.68s)]
*  Israel defense forces were the most moral army on earth, as Benjamin Netanyahu keeps perversely [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=316.08000000000004s)]
*  claiming, his conduct would be as a bare minimum investigated given he publicly told the world what [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=320.88s)]
*  he was going to do. That's one example. Here's another, even more striking example. You may [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=326.64s)]
*  remember that the examples submitted by South Africa to the International Court of Justice of [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=332.8s)]
*  Incitement included Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, twice invoking the biblical story of [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=337.91999999999996s)]
*  Amalek, who was to Israeli citizens, the other to Israeli soldiers directly. Let's just hear [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=342.8s)]
*  Netanyahu again as a refresh. To remember what Amalek has done to you, says our holy Bible, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=348.08s)]
*  and we do remember and we are fighting our brave troops and combatants who are now in Gaza. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=354.24s)]
*  You must remember what Amalek has done to you, says our holy Bible, and we do remember. So in [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=361.76s)]
*  the story of Amalek, the Israelites are attacked by the nation of Amalek, and God orders the Israelites [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=365.68s)]
*  exterminate all of them. Direct quote. Now go attack Amalek and prescribe all that belongs to him. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=370.8s)]
*  Spare no one but kill alike men and women, infants and sucklings, oxen and sheep, camels and asses. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=376.56s)]
*  The defense here is that Netanyahu actually meant Hamas, not Gaza in general. How does that [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=381.84s)]
*  possibly work in terms of quoting that biblical story? Well I refer to a biblical story where [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=386.96s)]
*  vengeance takes the form of exterminating everyone, men, women, children, babies, livestock for that [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=391.11999999999995s)]
*  matter. We were gaslit into believing by Israel's defenders that this was not how Israeli soldiers [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=397.28s)]
*  understood what they were told. They understood it just meant Hamas, despite what the actual words [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=403.67999999999995s)]
*  written in the scripture say. So let's just hear from this charming example shall we? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=407.84s)]
*  So he talks about leaving these [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=437.84s)]
*  southern Gaza city of Karn Unis with mixed emotions, bless, and he says, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=467.68s)]
*  blessed be the Lord we have destroyed of our territory. He goes on to say that they killed [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=472.32s)]
*  tens of thousands of the Amalek. Well he clearly doesn't mean Hamas here does he? How could he? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=477.28000000000003s)]
*  No one thinks or claims tens of thousands of Hamas militants have been killed in Gaza, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=482.16s)]
*  absolutely nobody. If we include those Palestinians buried under the rubble, who are clearly dead, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=486.32s)]
*  the official figure is well over 30,000. It's likely to be an underestimate, not least given [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=491.6s)]
*  all those dying because healthcare has been destroyed and civilians lack access to food, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=495.52s)]
*  water, shelter, and so on. So he clearly means Palestinians and Gaza in general. He thinks [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=499.52s)]
*  Amaleks are Palestinians. He makes clear anyway that all of that because he says that to be a [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=503.59999999999997s)]
*  moral army Israel has to understand that morally every Arab is a suspicious entity. He goes on to [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=509.76s)]
*  say to be moral is to conquer and flatten all parts of the land of Israel. I was initially confused, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=515.1999999999999s)]
*  but he clearly means Gaza should be part of Israel, that it is Israel really, and needs to be flattened [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=520.48s)]
*  and conquered by Israel. Clearly just genocidal stuff, clearly interpreting Netanyahu's words in [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=525.36s)]
*  a genocidal fashion. So he underlines here a direct link between the genocidal rhetoric of those at [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=529.92s)]
*  the top and the genocidal mindset of soldiers were clearly responsible for, well as the soldier says [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=534.4s)]
*  himself, just use his own words, flattening and destroying Gaza. Damning itself of Netanyahu, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=539.28s)]
*  it shows why the genocide convention made genocide an incitement, a crime in its own right, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=544.16s)]
*  that is not just committing genocide because it has direct genocidal consequences. You can't have [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=549.2s)]
*  a genocide without genocidal incitement. By definition it is an essential pillar of genocide. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=553.92s)]
*  Now this soldier has previously explained by the way why even if the enemy puts down his weapon [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=559.04s)]
*  and runs away you have to kill him. So you know in any case shooting armed opponents as they've [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=564.24s)]
*  run away is a war crime, I don't really need to explain that. So these soldiers are just openly [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=570.7199999999999s)]
*  boasting about the war crimes because they know as things stand they can get away with it. Impunity [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=574.8s)]
*  because Israel will not abide by its own supposed law but it won't abide by international law, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=579.2s)]
*  it won't abide by what the international court of justice tells us to do. That includes gratuitously [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=584.6400000000001s)]
*  violating the genocide convention and the ICJ's orders. Israel in violation is in violation of [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=588.96s)]
*  the genocide convention clearly on incitement as I've just shown. It was ordered by the ICJ to take [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=596.1600000000001s)]
*  all measures within its power to prevent and punish the direct and public incitement to commit [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=601.12s)]
*  genocide. You can see it isn't doing that. Israeli soldiers are allowed to churn out genocidal [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=605.2s)]
*  material but even getting awards they're not being punished. No excuses when Israel reports to the [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=610.1600000000001s)]
*  ICJ on how it's meeting those orders in around three weeks time the ICJ needs to note these [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=616.08s)]
*  examples otherwise this whole process is nothing but a farce. Please like and subscribe, do share [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KB1tFzzt0&t=620.72s)]
