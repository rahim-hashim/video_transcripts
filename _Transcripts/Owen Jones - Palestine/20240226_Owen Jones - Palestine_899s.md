# Israel's Apologists Unleash Racist Firestorm
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [February 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBGOBMTQ-RI)
*  A tsunami of anti-Muslim bigotry is sweeping through Britain and it's been unleashed by
*  apologists for Israel's mass slaughter of the Palestinian people. How's that happened?
*  Well here's a succinct summary. Last week Labour blackmailed the Speaker of the House of Commons
*  into overturning parliamentary protocol. Well that's according to their own sources who both
*  really briefed journalists that that's what they had done. Why? Because the SNB's motion called
*  to an unambiguous immediate ceasefire and crucially charged Israel with the collective
*  punishment of the Palestinian people. Why does that matter? Because it means accepting the
*  undeniable fact that Israel has committed war crimes and from that logical conclusions follow
*  such as ending arms sales as well as sanctions and so on and so forth. That is using the only
*  means that will have any impact on the Israeli state actual pressure rather than words that is
*  hand-wringing which the Israeli state knows it can easily just ignore which is exactly what it does.
*  So the Speaker of the House of Commons then attempted to protect himself from the resulting
*  firestorm by claiming that his decision was actually driven by threats for security and lives
*  of politicians. How does this make any sense? Well the Sky News political correspondent Matthew
*  Thompson tweeted,
*  The question I keep asking myself this morning and I suspect Lindsay Hoyle was asking himself
*  yesterday is what if? What if there had been an attack on an MP related to last night's debates?
*  What if in light of such horror questions were suddenly asked about why the Speaker didn't allow
*  MPs to vote on several options? As I responded, are you suggesting a terrorist would have called
*  off their attack if the Speaker hasn't surrendered to the Labour blackmail to crush the SNP motion?
*  I don't even know how this makes sense. I can't even understand the thought processes to arrive
*  genuinely. What? Under the slightest bit of scrutiny. If you think about it for more than
*  I don't know 10 seconds it falls apart. It doesn't make any sense but this line of attack meant that
*  rather than politicians being scrutinized for their complicity in one of the great crimes of our age,
*  two things happened. One, the story became about the need to even further shut down the right to
*  protest which has already been systematically criminalized and demonized. I'll do a video on
*  that in its own right because it's extremely important. And two, it inevitably opened up an
*  anti-Muslim firestorm. Why? Because Islamophobia is rampant and respectable in this country and
*  given there's a large Muslim contingent on these protests, understandably, given it is overwhelmingly
*  Muslims being slaughtered in Gaza on a daily basis, it was obvious where this would lead. That is,
*  it would become all about angry Muslim protesters who are dangerous and extreme Muslim protesters.
*  So when the Labour and Tory party establishments and their media outriders, that is those who call
*  themselves centrist as well as right-wingers alike, when they endorse this narrative of
*  MPs are threatened by dangerous and extreme Gaza protests, which is why we have to overturn
*  parliamentary protocol for reasons, to trash motions condemning Israel for collective punishment,
*  a tidal wave of Islamophobia inevitably followed. Now the hard-right former Home Secretary
*  Suela Bravamen penned an article claiming the Islamists, the extremists and the anti-Semites
*  are in charge now. Literally a deranged, I think it's fair to say, conspiracy theory claiming those
*  that she describes as the Islamists overneed the country. Now if you're wondering how this deranged
*  conspiracy theory could be penned, it is really very straightforward. The political establishment,
*  Labour and the Conservatives are demonizing the protests against Israel's genocide of war in Gaza
*  as being full of dangerous, hateful extremists. But how can you reconcile this claim with the fact
*  that there are so few arrests, even as hundreds of thousands take to the streets, that indeed there
*  were more arrests at large football matches? Well obviously you have to therefore invent a conspiracy
*  theory to explain all this. It's not because these are overwhelmingly peaceful protests, families and
*  so on, full of people who just object to mass slaughter and terrible injustice and in some one
*  of the great crimes of our age. It's because the Metropolitan Police are under the thumb of an all
*  powerful Islamist movement and their leftist allies or maybe they've even been captured
*  by this said Islamist movement. Now the fact that the Metropolitan Police is institutionally racist
*  and is repeatedly being found as such clearly has to be carefully put to one side here as is the fact
*  that anyone with any dealings within there know they'll have any excuse to crack down on such
*  protests. It's just that even they need to find at least some rationale for arresting people.
*  But for those who have led this campaign to demonize these protesters, given the image they've
*  constructive of what are in actual fact peaceful protesters, what must logically follow is there
*  should be mass arrests and a huge police crackdown. That hasn't happened so I have to explain it.
*  Hence the Islamophobic conspiracy theory. Well both Labour and the Tories and their respective
*  client journalists have laid the foundations here. Next came the former conservative deputy chairman
*  Lee Anderson. I heard the comments here, I heard the comments earlier he was making about Soella,
*  some of the comments she made earlier this week and I don't actually believe that these Islamists
*  have got control of our country but what I do believe is they've got control of Caen and they've
*  got control of London and again this stems in Caen. He's actually given our capital city away
*  to his mates. We've got to stop and beware because if you let Labour into the back door
*  expect more of this and expect our cities to be taken over by these lunatics. Just straightforward
*  racism there. Smearing Sadiq Khan as the friend of so-called Islamists. That is the same Sadiq Khan
*  by the way who's made advisors until recently were a gay man and a Jewish woman. He was one of the
*  best records on LGBTQ rights of any politician in the country and indeed who got threats from
*  actual Islamist extremists for supporting the civil rights of LGBTQ rights and who has a track
*  record of opposing anti-semitism and standing up for the rights of other religious minorities.
*  Now belatedly Lee Anderson was suspended but he didn't seem bothered about it publicly stating
*  I fully accept that they have no option but to suspend the whip in these circumstances somewhat
*  bafflingly adding however I will continue to support the government's efforts to call
*  extremism in all its forms be that anti-semitism or Islamophobia. Hmm okay Lee and has doubled
*  down since refusing to apologize saying that would mean conceding he was wrong and it's not only been
*  briefed that he'll get the whip back he's been repeatedly defended by his conservative colleagues.
*  Here's the former cabinet minister to his coffee. I don't believe that Lee is in any way racist
*  however I think he is very worried about a lot of the activity that's underway right now
*  and how previous attempts to challenge it has not been successful and we need to make sure in any
*  form that we counter extremism. Here's deputy prime minister Oliver Dowden. I don't believe that
*  Lee Anderson said those remarks intending to to be Islamophobic I listened to the the comments of
*  your previous contributor in the way in which they were she was concerned they would be interpreted
*  for that exactly that reason the prime minister asked for indeed the chief whip asked for that
*  apology one wasn't forthcoming action has been taken I think that's the the appropriate step to
*  take I think what what Lee Anderson was more broadly expressing his interviews and others have
*  done is a deep concern which by the way I also share about the way in which politics has been
*  conducted and what has happened over the past week. Crucially they've refused to take any action
*  against Suela Bravaman given her Islamophobic comments with Dowden saying they've been a
*  different category. I don't believe that the language used by Suela Bravaman has crossed the
*  line whereby she should apologize for it no I don't. Saying the underlying point about threats
*  from Islamic extremists Islamic extremists as he says is right again underlining where the
*  demonization of Gaza protests leads us to. So again the Tory politicians have said that's what
*  Lee Anderson is talking about the threats to MPs from i.e. Gaza protesters. Now Tory MPs
*  have also been sending WhatsApp messages condemning the suspension that included a
*  conservative whip they're entitled to discipline Joy Morrissey. Well again you can see there just
*  how much support he has basically the Islamophobic comments not basically the Islamophobic comments
*  he said. Then Vishy Senak released a statement declaring legitimate phrases have been hijacked
*  by extremists to promote and glorify terrorism that elected representatives are verbally threatened
*  and physically that there has been an explosion of anti-Semitism but he said nothing about
*  Islamophobia despite having just been forced to suspend a politician over Islamophobia.
*  And how about the BBC whose headline was MP suspended over criticism of London Mayor what the
*  hell criticism it was a racist smear. This in the week where it's been reported that anti-Muslim
*  hatred has more than tripled since 7th of October. Now the Islamophobia of the Tories should not be
*  a surprise. Tory Baroness Saeeda Varsi the party's most senior Muslim politician has long described
*  Islamophobia as very widespread in the Tories saying it exists from top to bottom. The Tories
*  have repeatedly quietly reinstated Tory members and councillors who said extreme Islamophobic things
*  that they only suspend after they're publicly exposed. According to the 2020 a 2020 poll of
*  Tory members 57 percent of those members have a negative attitude towards Muslims 21 percent
*  registering a very negative attitude and nearly half saying that Islam is a threat to the British
*  way of life just rampant Islamophobia throughout the Conservative Party unapologetic unashamed.
*  When Boris Johnson compared Muslim women wearing the veil to bank robbers and letter boxes he
*  triggered a 375 percent surge in Islamophobic incidents. Now as for Saeed Khan it was under
*  David Cameron's leadership that the Tories with their mayoral candidate Zach Goldsmith led a
*  aggressively Islamophobic campaign that was in the 2016 London mayoral election portraying him as
*  being in league with Islamist extremists. Let's listen to Saeed Khan. I'm unclear why Rishi Sunak
*  why members of his cabinet aren't calling this out and aren't condemned this it's like they're
*  complicit in this sort of racism and I think the message it sends is Muslims are fair game
*  when it comes to racism and anti-Muslim hatred it's not good enough in 2024 in the United Kingdom.
*  Well that's absolutely correct. Now the Tories are infested with Islamophobia no question.
*  So why hasn't the Equalities and Human Rights Commission launched an investigation
*  into Tories about Islamophobia as they did over Labour and anti-Semitism? There's far more
*  evidence of clear-cut Islamophobia from senior Tory figures and indeed grassroots members
*  than anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. That's such all you need to know and these same people
*  the same who accused the left the Labour Party of being racist are the same who either refuse to
*  clamp down on Islamophobia or who actively fan it. Now none of this lets Labour off the hook.
*  They have their own dark history of Islamophobia before I even talk about the present.
*  When there were escalating anti-Muslim hate crimes in 2006 including arson attacks on mosques and
*  assaults on British Muslims the then Labour race minister Phil Wallace declared that women who
*  wear the veil could be frightening and intimidating. Four years later when trying to get re-elected in
*  Oldham his campaign printed a leaflet attacking the Lib Dems on the basis Wallace was strong on
*  immigration denouncing the Lib Dems for wanting to give hundreds of thousands as it put it of
*  illegal immigrants the right to stay accompanied by pictures of extremists holding placards such
*  as behead those who insult Islam and kill those who insult Islam. He had his election disqualified
*  by the courts on the grounds he stood up racist tensions after he won by just a hundred and three
*  votes. When the party suspended him multiple Labour MPs caged his defence and denounced the action
*  taken against him. More recently in the 2021 Batley and Spen by-election which Labour only
*  won narrowly the Maryland Sunday quoted a senior Labour official saying Labour was hemorrhaging
*  votes because Muslim voters among bugger voters because of what Keir Starmer had been doing on
*  anti-Semitism adding nobody really wants to talk about it but that's the main factor. Deputy leader
*  Angela Rayner declared these comments were completely unacceptable and promised an investigation
*  which we never heard about ever again. A Labour source later claimed afterwards that Labour had
*  lost the conservative Muslim vote over gay rights in Palestine. Total nonsense no one canvassing on
*  any wing of the party there reported any evidence of gay rights being mentioned even once and indeed
*  those same Labour voters were voting Labour when it was in government introducing legislation
*  giving equal rights to gay people as if Labour now is somehow flying the flag on LGBTQ rights.
*  Quite the opposite according to a poll by the Labour Muslim Network over one in four Muslim
*  members of Labour had directly experienced Islamophobia and a further large number had
*  directly witnessed Islamophobia with nearly half of Muslim members and supporters not believing the
*  party took Islamophobia seriously. Now listen to this from Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves
*  on the 10th of October last year.
*  But I also know that many of you had concerns closer to home about the anti-Semitism,
*  the anti-Zionism and the anti-Israeli feeling that is allowed to flourish in some communities in
*  Britain and so we stand alongside you here at home as well and we'll ensure that the police do
*  everything within their powers to hold responsible anybody who behaves in that way here at home.
*  Look how she conflates the serious evil of anti-Semitism with what she calls anti-Zionism
*  and anti-Israeli feeling and calls for police crackdowns on this conflation.
*  Looking forward I have to say for the authoritarian crackdowns when they're in power
*  but she says this is allowed to flourish in certain communities in Britain.
*  Who's she talking about there? Which certain communities? Because a lot of people would hear
*  that as a dog whistle, a reference to British Muslims. So here's the context. Both the concerns
*  and the labour are complicit in Israeli crimes by virtue of Britain's role in sustaining those crimes
*  refusing to use its pressure, that is by ending its arms sales and its crucial diplomatic support.
*  Labour's refusal to hold Israel responsible for collective punishment and its attempt to deflect
*  scrutiny from the party's total moral bankruptcy of the mass slaughter of Palestinians by claiming
*  the real extremists are those who oppose this crime that has directly fueled a moral panic
*  about protesters which in turn whips up Islamophobia. That's where we're at. That's
*  why there's a racist firestorm and I'm afraid to say it's only going to get worse as the scale of
*  Israel's crime becomes more obvious and the outrage at those who refuse to stand against it grows.
