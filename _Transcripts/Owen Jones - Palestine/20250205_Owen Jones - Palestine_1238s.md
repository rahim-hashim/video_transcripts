# Trump Promises US Genocide Against Gaza - Western Media Normalises It
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo)
*  Right now, there is a basic test for journalists and for politicians, and it is a litmus test, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=0.0s)]
*  the litmus test of our time. Donald Trump, the president of the United States, has committed his [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=5.76s)]
*  country to commit an abominable crime. He's committed the US to annexing Gaza and ethnically [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  cleansing its entire population. This is a grave and indisputable crime. The bare minimum right now [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=17.92s)]
*  is just to state the facts. That what Donald Trump has proposed is ethnic cleansing, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=25.599999999999998s)]
*  a fact, that's number one, and that this is an objective violation of international law, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=30.48s)]
*  that's number two. Well, we have seen how our journalists and our politicians have failed, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=36.64s)]
*  disastrously failed, from the very beginning, over and over again, and how they have helped [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=41.2s)]
*  to facilitate genocide. Let's start with Donald Trump's comments. Let's listen to what he said [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=46.72s)]
*  before the press conference with Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=52.16s)]
*  and wanted man by virtue of the arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court for [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=56.64s)]
*  war crimes and crimes against humanity, which again, incidentally, journalists should be telling [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=61.68s)]
*  their audiences as a bare minimum. Can you continue to press for this idea that Jordan and Egypt take [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  Palestinians from Gaza? Yeah, I would like to see Jordan. I'd like to see Egypt take some. Look, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=72.48s)]
*  the Gaza thing has not worked. It's never worked. And I feel very differently about Gaza than a lot [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=78.64s)]
*  of people. I think they should get a good, fresh, beautiful piece of land. And we get some people to [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=85.84s)]
*  put up the money to build it and make it nice and make it habitable and enjoyable and make it a whole. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=91.44s)]
*  They don't want to leave. How can you say they don't want to leave? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=100.0s)]
*  I don't know how they could want to stay. It's a demolition site. It's a pure demolition site. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=102.56s)]
*  If we could find the right piece of land or numerous pieces of land and build them some [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=109.76s)]
*  really nice places with plenty of money in the area, that's for sure. I think that would be a [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  lot better than going back to Gaza, which has had just decades and decades of death. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=120.88s)]
*  The casual way he talks about a homeland, the Gaza thing has not worked. It's never worked. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=126.96s)]
*  What hasn't worked, let's just be very clear, is the Israeli state repeatedly murderously driving [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=132.79999999999998s)]
*  Palestinian people from their homes, including three quarters of a million people in 1948, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=137.92s)]
*  which was achieved by slaughtering around 15,000 people. The deprivation of a people's right [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=144.0s)]
*  to national self-determination, occupying their land, stealing their land, colonising their land, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=150.56s)]
*  besieging their land, subjugating them through apartheid. This has not worked on its own terms. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=157.44s)]
*  It's only led to violence, instability and chaos that has not produced peace or security [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=163.84s)]
*  or whichever of those words you wish to choose. This is not a Gaza specific problem. This is a [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=171.04s)]
*  problem of oppression. There can never be peace when there is oppression. Now Trump talks about [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=177.12s)]
*  giving the people of Gaza a good, fresh, beautiful piece of land. Well firstly, the people of Gaza [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=183.12s)]
*  do not want to leave their homeland. It is their homeland. It is where they live. And they know [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  from their history that leaving their homeland means they are never going to be allowed back, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=194.24s)]
*  which we'll come on to. If Trump wants to talk about the people of Gaza getting a good, fresh, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=199.12s)]
*  beautiful piece of land, well Riyad Mansour, Palestine's ambassador to the United Nations, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=203.84s)]
*  got an idea. Our country and our home is the Gaza Strip. It's part of Palestine. We have no home. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=208.4s)]
*  For those who want to send them to a happy, nice place, let them go back to their original homes [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=217.04s)]
*  inside Israel. There are nice places there and they will be happy to return to these places. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=223.2s)]
*  He says that because the vast majority of people in Gaza are indeed the families of refugees who [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=230.88s)]
*  were forced to flee their homes in what is now Israel. Now Trump just casually describes Gaza [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=235.28s)]
*  as a demolition site. In doing so, he casually accepts that Israel must have committed an [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=242.96s)]
*  abominable crime. Because that's what flattening an entire land constitutes. Clearly there's no [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=248.4s)]
*  military justification for doing so. This actually puts Joe Biden perversely to shame. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=253.12s)]
*  Because he never admitted what Israel had actually done with the weapons that he had supplied. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=258.8s)]
*  Now let's go on to the press conference with Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=263.68s)]
*  Would Palestinians have the right to return to Gaza if they left while the rebuilding was happening? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=267.28s)]
*  It would be my hope that we could do something really nice, really good, where they wouldn't [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=272.4s)]
*  want to return. Why would they want to return? The place has been hell. It's been one of the meanest, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=277.03999999999996s)]
*  toughest places on earth. Right now I've seen every picture from every angle, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=284.32s)]
*  better than if I were there. Nobody can live there. You can't live there. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=292.56s)]
*  We can build them through massive amounts of money supplied by other people, very rich nations, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=298.24s)]
*  and they're willing to supply it. If we can build something for them in one of the countries, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=305.6s)]
*  and it could be Jordan, it could be Egypt, it could be other countries, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=311.28s)]
*  and you could build four or five or six areas. It doesn't have to be one area. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=314.4s)]
*  But you take certain areas and you build really good quality housing, like a beautiful town, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=318.71999999999997s)]
*  like someplace where they can live and not die. Because Gaza is a guarantee that they're going [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=326.08s)]
*  to end up dying. The same thing is going to happen again. It's happened over and over again, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=331.44s)]
*  and it's going to happen again as sure as you're standing there, Peter. So I hope that we could do [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=336.72s)]
*  something where they wouldn't want to go back. Who wouldn't want to go back? They've experienced [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=343.6s)]
*  nothing but death and destruction. So Trump makes absolutely clear, with no ambiguity of any [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=348.08000000000004s)]
*  description, that he wants the permanent ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people of Gaza. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=353.20000000000005s)]
*  If you speak to almost anyone in Gaza, they will tell you of their love for, their devotion towards [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=357.28000000000003s)]
*  Gaza, their home. When Trump says it's been one of the meanest, tougher places on earth, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=363.28s)]
*  and says they've experienced nothing but death and destruction, why does he think that's the case? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=370.23999999999995s)]
*  I don't know, perhaps sitting next to Netanyahu might give him some clues. That's because Gaza [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=374.64s)]
*  was subjected to direct military occupation, and then a brutal siege, and repeated Israeli onslaughts [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=379.59999999999997s)]
*  prior to 7th October, in which a whole litany of war crimes were committed. Just months before 7th [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=385.28s)]
*  October, in May 2023, Israel bombed Gaza and killed several children. This happened under [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=391.04s)]
*  successive Israeli leaders. These crimes, by the way. Let's not just make Benjamin Netanyahu the [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=399.04s)]
*  convenient bogeyman. All of this was facilitated by Israel's patron, the United States of America. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=404.08000000000004s)]
*  Now it should be noted that Trump's call for a beautiful area for Palestinians to settle permanently [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=410.72s)]
*  is itself a nonsense. He's called for Jordan and Egypt to take in the people of Gaza. Well, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=416.48s)]
*  both countries have declared they will refuse to do that. It should be noted, by the way, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=421.68s)]
*  that the majority of Jordan's population is Palestinian or of Palestinian heritage. That [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=426.32s)]
*  is those who expelled, or indeed forced to flee, Palestine. If either of those regimes complied, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=431.20000000000005s)]
*  there would be a mass uprising undoubtedly on the streets of those countries, which could quite [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=438.72s)]
*  conceivably overthrow both of those regimes. Which is why, by the way, I think, Middle East Eye [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=443.28s)]
*  has been briefed that Jordan would go to war with Israel if it sought to expel Palestinians to its [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=450.0s)]
*  territory. The article actually notes it would be an existential issue for Jordan and its Hashemite [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=455.59999999999997s)]
*  royal family because Jordan has the third poorest water supply on earth and its 12 million citizens [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=460.23999999999995s)]
*  largely live in a strip of land which runs across Israel's border, so it would not be possible to [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=465.91999999999996s)]
*  host any significant number of refugees, the morality of facilitating ethnic cleansing aside. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=470.24s)]
*  Now, it's notable too in Trump's comments that he talks about other rich countries providing a [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=477.6s)]
*  lot of money to build these new settlements for the ethnically cleansed Palestinians. Who's going to [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=481.44s)]
*  do that and why? Spend a vast sum of money facilitating the crime of ethnic cleansing [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=486.16s)]
*  committed by the US and Israel. Why are they going to fit the bill for that criminal act? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=490.16s)]
*  And note, by the way, the grin painted on Netanyahu's face, the sickening grotesque [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=494.0s)]
*  grin on his face. As Trump describes Gaza being absolute hell and discusses the death and destruction [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=499.28s)]
*  there, look at his pride at the horror he's inflicted on an entire people. He's listening and [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=505.2s)]
*  no doubt visualising what he's done, the decisions he's taken, the orders he's made. Now, it should [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=510.08s)]
*  be noted, this Israeli anti-genocide writer and activist, Asaf Ranol, has told me, Netanyahu knows [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=516.16s)]
*  he can't do anything other than smile. If he says a single word of support, it will be added to the [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=522.0799999999999s)]
*  International Criminal Court case against him. Also, note this from Trump. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=527.12s)]
*  Note the number he's using there. He says 1.7 million people, maybe 1.8. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=548.48s)]
*  There were up to 2.3 million people in Gaza before the genocide began. Now, a certain number [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=553.36s)]
*  did actually manage to leave, but this would still suggest Trump believes hundreds of thousands of [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=557.92s)]
*  Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, which suggests he has access to high level data [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=562.24s)]
*  from the US and Israeli intelligence services that we don't. Though there are, of course, estimates [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=566.8000000000001s)]
*  from public health experts, for example, which suggests such a huge number. And then, of course, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=571.84s)]
*  there was this from Donald Trump. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=577.04s)]
*  Casually declaring that the United States will annex Gaza. Well, this is completely and utterly [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=583.36s)]
*  insane, even by the standards of this man. The US president is declaring he will annex and violently [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=590.32s)]
*  expel the people of Gaza. Now, before we look at the way the media has framed all this, we should [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=595.2s)]
*  listen to Heidi Matthews, associate professor of law, expert on international law, and particularly [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=600.72s)]
*  questions of genocide. She says, many are calling this idea ethnic cleansing. That's not it. In this [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=605.76s)]
*  context of mass atrocity and destruction, forced transfer would be genocide. Indeed, it's worth [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=610.88s)]
*  noting what Omar Bartov, the Israeli American professor of Holocaust and Genocide Studies at [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=617.76s)]
*  Brown University told me towards the beginning of all this, about the fine line between ethnic [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=622.88s)]
*  cleansing and genocide. He declared ethnic cleansing frequently became genocide because, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=627.12s)]
*  brutally speaking, people do not want to be ethnically cleansed and therefore they are murdered. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=631.92s)]
*  Indeed, genocide means the intent to destroy a national ethnic, racial or religious group in whole [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=636.48s)]
*  or in part. This is genocide. But the bar was on the floor here and the least we can expect [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=641.6800000000001s)]
*  is for unambiguous ethnic cleansing to be called ethnic cleansing by media outlets. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=648.16s)]
*  Yet look at how dire these journalists are. Look how cowardly. Look how spineless. Look [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=652.8000000000001s)]
*  how complicit they are. Let's just listen to this one moment from the press conference. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=657.36s)]
*  The Israelis have stood strong and united in the face of an enemy that has kidnapped, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=661.1999999999999s)]
*  tortured, raped and slaughtered innocent men, women, children and even little babies. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=666.9599999999999s)]
*  On that infamous day, Hamas monsters savagely murdered 1,200 innocent people, including more [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=674.16s)]
*  than 40 Americans. They beheaded men. They raped women. They burnt babies alive. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=683.92s)]
*  Let me just say this directly. It is a lie. A total lie to say that babies were burned alive [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=691.68s)]
*  on 7th October, were burned to death or anything like that. It's a total unambiguous lie. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=701.04s)]
*  One Israeli baby was killed on the 7th October. Her name was Mila Cohen. She was eight months old [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=705.76s)]
*  and she was shot dead through the door of a safe room. This by the way is a crime. No question. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=711.6s)]
*  The point is if this is a crime, which it is, where does it leave the at least 1,100 Palestinian [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=718.72s)]
*  babies killed through Israeli bombs, explosives, shelling and bullets? There was another horrible [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=725.28s)]
*  case of a pregnant woman who was shot which killed her unborn baby on the 7th October. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=731.0400000000001s)]
*  Again, that's a terrible crime. Countless Palestinian pregnant women and their unborn babies [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=737.2s)]
*  have been violently slaughtered by the Israeli army. Why this lie about burning babies? Because [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=741.36s)]
*  it is an attempt to make a distinction between the form of violence deployed by Israel compared to [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=746.5600000000001s)]
*  its enemies in order to justify genocide. We may kill more, but they're savages. And it's particularly [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=751.04s)]
*  perverse because many of the Palestinian babies slaughtered were burned alive, because of missiles, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=756.4s)]
*  explosives and indeed weapons fired by the Israeli army. No journalist, not one, challenged these lies. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=761.28s)]
*  With Trump they're talking about slaughtering innocent men, women and children when tens of [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=771.52s)]
*  thousands of innocent Palestinian men, women and children have been slaughtered, but they don't [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=775.6s)]
*  qualify as human beings to him. The failure of journalists to just correct lies shows their [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=779.44s)]
*  complicity, shows their cowardice, shows their failures as journalists. They are bad, bad [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=786.08s)]
*  journalists. They shouldn't be there. People who can do their job should be there instead of them. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=794.32s)]
*  Now let's listen to Sky News. The idea that Gazans should leave and move somewhere else and that a [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=800.4s)]
*  new home should be built for them elsewhere, that has been an idea that has been raised increasingly [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=806.24s)]
*  over quite a few weeks now, months maybe even, by Trump officials. There was a talk about them [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=813.12s)]
*  being moved to Indonesia at one point. The focus from Trump is that they should be going to Egypt [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=819.84s)]
*  and to Jordan. Those two countries will not take them at the moment. Trump seems to think he can [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=825.9200000000001s)]
*  change their minds. We'll see how that develops. That's Mark Stone, the US correspondent of Sky [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=830.96s)]
*  News. What is this man thinking? What's going through his head right there? He says the idea [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=836.24s)]
*  that Gazans should leave and move somewhere else and that a new home should be built for them [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=840.0s)]
*  elsewhere. Why this convoluted nonsense when he should say this is ethnic cleansing and it is a [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=843.36s)]
*  crime. It goes against international law. Who is this man scared of? His editors? The White House? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=848.88s)]
*  Does he not know the law? Does he not know what ethnic cleansing is? If you can't do your job, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=856.4s)]
*  get out of the way. Resign. Stop embarrassing yourself. Let someone who knows what they're [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=862.16s)]
*  talking about and or isn't a coward take your place. You're a bad journalist. Very straightforward. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=867.28s)]
*  Now let's look at how the BBC splashed on this announcement on their website front page, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=873.92s)]
*  which is the most read news website on earth. The headline. Trump suggests US could take over [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=877.76s)]
*  and redevelop Gaza as he hosts in Anyahu with a subheading. The president says the US could [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=883.84s)]
*  take the lead in removing unexploded bombs and rebuilding Gaza after resettling Palestinians [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=888.56s)]
*  in other countries. Goodness me. Suggests redevelop, removing unexploded bombs, rebuilding Gaza, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=893.68s)]
*  resettling. A farcically disturbing positive spin on the grave crime of ethnic cleansing. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=899.92s)]
*  What about the Telegraph? Trump offers to turn Gaza into the Riviera of the Middle East. Oh, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=908.24s)]
*  how generous of him. Shameless churning out of Trumpian propaganda. The Times newspaper. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=912.64s)]
*  Trump says US will take over Gaza and make it Riviera of the Middle East. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=917.92s)]
*  So are these newspapers just being dictated by Trump's press offices [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=921.28s)]
*  with virtually the same headlines? The Independent newspaper. Trump says US wants [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=925.92s)]
*  to take over Gaza and create a Riviera of the Middle East. I'm losing my mind here. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=932.4s)]
*  Then the subheading will own it and be responsible for dismantling unexploded bombs. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=937.8399999999999s)]
*  US president says it White House press conference with Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=942.64s)]
*  Again, it makes it sound like he's being generous. Makes it sound like he's making [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=946.88s)]
*  this amazing offer. What a sick joke from an embarrassment of a so-called newspaper [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=951.36s)]
*  which long lost any meaningful reason to exist. Why are you even there still? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=957.6s)]
*  The headline erodes. Trump suggests permanently displacing Palestinians from Gaza. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=961.76s)]
*  Nothing. Zero zilch about ethnic cleansing. The New York Times front page. Splash. Trump declares [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=965.84s)]
*  that US should seize control of Gaza. That's the main takeaway. Nothing about ethnic cleansing. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=971.6800000000001s)]
*  Next headline. All 2 million Palestinians there should be relocated, he says. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=976.4s)]
*  This is called ethnic cleansing. You're using euphemisms. You are normalising a crime in which [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=980.72s)]
*  you are complicit. And then another story headlined analysis with Gaza Plan and Unbound Trump pushes an [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=986.0s)]
*  improbable idea. Is that your takeaway? An obscene crime is simply referred to as an improbable idea. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=991.52s)]
*  It's about being unrealistic rather than criminal. The Washington Post. Trump proposes US takeover [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=998.64s)]
*  Gaza with a subheading about Trump having suggested Gaza should leave the wall torn area [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=1004.96s)]
*  and that the US would step in to develop it. Do you know what? You suggest going for an Indian [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=1010.24s)]
*  or Chinese takeaway. Suggested Gaza should leave the wall torn. Nothing again about an ethnic [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=1014.48s)]
*  cleansing. I could go on but the mental health of all of you is at stake with me just reeling off [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=1022.4s)]
*  this nonsense, this disturbing nonsense. So I'm going to stop. I'm going to say this though. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=1027.92s)]
*  Many journalists in mainstream outlets like to think they're courageous truth tellers, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=1035.44s)]
*  speaking out without fear or favour, holding the powerful to account whoever they are. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=1040.96s)]
*  Well my friends, Israel's genocide in Gaza really was the litmus test of our age. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=1045.8400000000001s)]
*  A crime. A terrible crime from start to finish. An abominable crime. Countless atrocities broadcast [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=1049.92s)]
*  the world shamelessly every day and unapologetically boasted about by Israeli leaders and officials and [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=1057.2800000000002s)]
*  their cheerleaders and their allies. Those journalists who did not describe this crime [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=1063.6s)]
*  for what it is helped normalise and facilitate genocide. They are villains. They contributed to [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=1068.3999999999999s)]
*  this. The blood of Palestinians is on their hands. That is what they did and they will never, ever, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=1075.04s)]
*  ever scrub the shame away and nor should we let them. And as I've said from the start, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=1082.3999999999999s)]
*  those who directly facilitated the crime through providing weapons, for example, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=1086.9599999999998s)]
*  they've got to go to jail. But as I've also said, careers have to end. We have to make these [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=1091.12s)]
*  media outlets and those journalists pay for what they've done. Not saying this for vengeance. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=1096.8s)]
*  Not saying this because I get a kick out of it. The reason we have to do this is because if there [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=1101.84s)]
*  is no accountability, then we allow the normalisation of the most extreme depravity imaginable and then [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=1106.56s)]
*  the whole world will burn. You see, the sort of crime now being committed, now being proposed, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=1112.4799999999998s)]
*  on top of the crime that has already been perpetrated will break whatever we call the [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=1117.28s)]
*  international order, whatever remains of it. And it will also lead to the end of whatever [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=1121.92s)]
*  Western democracy happens to be. At the end of the 19th century in the US, something called the [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=1127.44s)]
*  Anti-Imperialist League was founded. It was not founded by people on the left, far from it. It [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=1132.48s)]
*  was in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War when there were fears that the US would become an [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=1136.48s)]
*  empire rather than a republic, like the European colonial powers because of the proposed annexation [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=1141.84s)]
*  and colonisation of the Philippines. They feared the US would go from being that republic into [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=1146.64s)]
*  that empire and a tyranny. Well, look, Trump suggesting annexing Gaza and annexing Canada. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=1154.5600000000002s)]
*  That isn't joking around. He wants to build some sort of empire with him as emperor. That will end [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=1160.96s)]
*  democracy as we understand it. Normalise aggressive expansionism and plunge the world into total [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=1165.2800000000002s)]
*  violent disorder. And those who thought he was, you know, oh, he's an isolationist, how can we call [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=1170.24s)]
*  him a fascist? Come on. I think militaristic expansionism, I think we can throw that into [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=1175.84s)]
*  the fascism box. If we don't have accountability, then we will have normalisation of crimes of this [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=1181.28s)]
*  scale, which will lead to the world as we know it burning. And we cannot allow that. And that's why [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KXyIpAPgo&t=1190.24s)]
