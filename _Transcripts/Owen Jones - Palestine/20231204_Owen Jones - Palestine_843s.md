# SHOCKING Expose Destroys Israel's Claims
**Owen Jones - Palestine:** [December 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k)
*  This is one of the most important expos√©s since the beginning of Israel's onslaught against Gaza, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=0.0s)]
*  which has already wiped out about 1% of the population in the space of two months. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=4.24s)]
*  Now, there's some apologists for Israel's onslaught, who are frankly insulting everyone's intelligence. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=8.24s)]
*  They're pretending that this onslaught attempts to spare civilians from being killed. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=12.16s)]
*  As Israel's onslaught's renewed, it's now estimated by the independent NGO, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=16.48s)]
*  Yoram Ed Human Rights Monitor, that around 20,000 civilians have been killed, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=20.64s)]
*  and the large majority of those are women and children. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=24.8s)]
*  The figure given from Gaza's administration is a few thousand lower than that. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=27.76s)]
*  Over 15,000 killed, but that's an underestimate because, as they say themselves, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=31.76s)]
*  thousands of dead bodies are under rubble and have not been retrieved and are not part of the final number. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=36.72s)]
*  Now, their own figure is routinely disputed because these come from the Hamas-run administration, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=40.88s)]
*  which on the surface of it is a totally reasonable objection, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  except their figures from previous conflicts have always been validated afterwards by both Israel [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  and the United Nations. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=53.68s)]
*  Biden has, according to the Washington Post, privately apologized for publicly doubting the figures, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=54.96s)]
*  and indeed they tally with Israel's own private estimates. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=59.36s)]
*  Out of this figure, the Israeli army privately estimates that they have killed between 1,000 and 3,000 armed militants, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=62.64s)]
*  a small fraction of Hamas's overall armed strength, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=68.8s)]
*  itself underlining that the vast majority of those killed are innocent civilians. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=71.6s)]
*  Now, US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, says, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=76.0s)]
*  A detailed investigation by Israeli publications, plus 9-7-2 magazine and Local Call, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=83.44s)]
*  has blown apart the already absurd idea that Israel's onslaught seeks to spare civilian lives. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=93.52s)]
*  They write that the Israeli army's expanded authorization for bombing non-military targets, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=99.2s)]
*  the loosening of constraints regarding expected civilian casualties, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=103.6s)]
*  and the use of an artificial intelligence system to generate more potential targets than ever before [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=107.36s)]
*  appear to have contributed, as they say, to the destructive nature of the initial stages of Israel's war on the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=112.16s)]
*  It's important to note that this investigation by these Israeli publications isn't based on speculation. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=119.36s)]
*  It's so credible because it's based on those working at the very heart of Israel's military intelligence. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=124.56s)]
*  They say it's based on conversations with seven current and former members of Israel's intelligence community, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=130.16s)]
*  including military intelligence and air force personnel involved in operations, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=136.24s)]
*  Palestinian testimonies, data and documentation from Gaza, and official statements by the IDF, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=140.88s)]
*  spokespeople, and other Israeli state institutions. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=147.04s)]
*  In this current war, the Israeli army is expanding its bombing of targets which are clearly not distinctly military in nature. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=150.96s)]
*  What does that mean? It means private residences, as well as public buildings, infrastructure, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  and high-rise blocks, which sources tell those Israeli publications that the army defines as power targets. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=161.84s)]
*  The bombing of power targets, according to the intelligence sources they spoke to, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=167.84s)]
*  say, who have first had experience with this application in Gaza, I should say, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=172.72s)]
*  is, and I quote, mainly intended to harm Palestinian civil society, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=177.2s)]
*  to create a shock that, among other things, will reverberate powerfully and lead civilians to put pressure on Hamas, as the source put it to them. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=181.12s)]
*  The sources tell the Israeli media outlets that the army has files on the vast majority of potential targets in Gaza. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=188.72s)]
*  They calculate the number of civilians likely to be killed in an attack on a particular target, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  so the number is calculated and known in advance to the army's intelligence unit, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=199.28s)]
*  and it's also known shortly before carrying out an attack, roughly how many civilians are certain to be killed. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=203.44s)]
*  Now, listen to this key point. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=209.28s)]
*  In one case discussed by these sources, the Israeli military command knowingly approved the killing of hundreds of Palestinian civilians [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=211.36s)]
*  in an attempt to assassinate one single top Hamas military commander. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=217.68s)]
*  The numbers increased from dozens of civilian deaths, which are permitted as collateral damage, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=222.24s)]
*  as part of an attack on a senior official in previous operations, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=228.07999999999998s)]
*  to hundreds of civilian deaths as collateral damage, as the source puts it. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=231.84s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=236.16s)]
*  Nothing happens by accident, another source told them. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=238.24s)]
*  When a three-year-old girl is killed in a home in Gaza, it's because someone in the army decided it wasn't a big deal for her to be killed, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=240.72s)]
*  that it was a price worth paying in order to hit another target. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=247.44s)]
*  We're not Hamas, these are not random rockets, everything is intentional. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=251.04s)]
*  We know exactly how much collateral damage there is in every home. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=254.56s)]
*  Now listen to this as well. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=259.2s)]
*  According to the investigation, another reason for the large number of targets [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=260.64s)]
*  and the extensive harm to civilian life in Gaza is the widespread use of a system called Habzirah, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=263.84s)]
*  or in English, the Gospel, which is largely built on artificial intelligence [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=269.76s)]
*  and can generate targets almost automatically at a rate which far exceeds what was previously possible. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=273.92s)]
*  This AI system is described by a former intelligence officer in the piece, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=279.44s)]
*  saying it essentially facilitates a mass assassination factory. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=284.0s)]
*  AI-based systems like this allow the army to carry out strikes on homes where there might just be one single Hamas member, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=288.48s)]
*  and including those who are junior Hamas operatives, but also wiping out their entire families potentially. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=297.12s)]
*  According to testimonies of those Palestinians who have faced attacks, since 7th October, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=303.92s)]
*  the army has also attacked many private residences where there's no known or apparent member of Hamas [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  or any other military group in place. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=316.8s)]
*  Such strikes, the source say, can knowingly kill entire families as they do so. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=319.36s)]
*  In the majority of cases, there's no military activity taking place in those harms that are targeted, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=324.24s)]
*  and the source makes an obvious point. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=329.28000000000003s)]
*  This would be like Palestinian militants bombing the private homes of Israeli soldiers, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=331.28s)]
*  killing the whole families with them. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=335.12s)]
*  The human consequences so far, over 300 Palestinian families, have lost 10 or more family members. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=336.96s)]
*  That is a horrifying insight into the consequences of a policy which in practical terms means mass slaughter. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=342.24s)]
*  Another key point, there's different categories of targets which are identified. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=348.15999999999997s)]
*  One is known as family homes or operative homes, the others are known as power targets. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=351.76s)]
*  We're talking high-rise blocks, residential towers in the hearts of cities, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=356.71999999999997s)]
*  and public buildings like universities, for example, banks, government offices. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=360.32s)]
*  These targets are hit according to three different intelligence sources, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=365.52s)]
*  those involved in planning or conducting strikes on these targets, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=368.96s)]
*  and as one source puts it, that a deliberate attack on Palestinian society will exert civil pressure on Hamas. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=372.24s)]
*  So if there's a high-rise building with half a floor that can be attributed to Hamas, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=379.36s)]
*  and that is a point where operatives meet, as the sources put it, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=383.92s)]
*  that is enough grounds to bomb that entire building. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=390.32s)]
*  Now the source then goes on to tell the Israeli publications [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=394.96000000000004s)]
*  that if they would tell the whole world that the Islamic Jihad officers on the 10th floor [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=398.40000000000003s)]
*  are not important as a target, but that existence is a justification to bring down the entire high-rise [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=402.32s)]
*  with the aim of pressuring civilians and families who live in it [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=407.52000000000004s)]
*  in order to put pressure on terrorist organizations, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=409.76s)]
*  this would itself be seen as terrorism. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=412.32s)]
*  So they do not say it, but of course we can say it, that is terrorism. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=414.15999999999997s)]
*  Now while army protocols used to dictate that those power targets would only be hit [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=417.36s)]
*  when residents weren't there, that it was empty, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=421.92s)]
*  the evidence suggests that at least some of these targets have been hit [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=424.32s)]
*  with no prior notice whatsoever. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=427.36s)]
*  The result, entire families wiped from the face of the earth. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=429.44s)]
*  As the sources put it, Hamas is everywhere, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=432.71999999999997s)]
*  any building could be construed as having something linked to Hamas in it, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=434.64s)]
*  and therefore you can't claim any, you can claim, sorry, any high-rise building [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=437.84s)]
*  is a legitimate target. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=442.16s)]
*  So as another source puts it, the perception is that it really hurts Hamas [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=443.20000000000005s)]
*  when high-rise buildings are taken down [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=447.04s)]
*  because it creates a public reaction in the Gaza Strip and scares the population. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=448.96000000000004s)]
*  They wanted to give the citizens of Gaza the feeling that Hamas is not in control of the situation, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=453.28000000000003s)]
*  sometimes they topple buildings and sometimes postal service and government buildings. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=457.36s)]
*  It noticed that the so-called Dahir doctrine for the second Lebanon war [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=461.04s)]
*  dictates that in a war against guerrilla targets such as Hamas and Hezbollah, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=464.64000000000004s)]
*  Israel must use disproportionate and overwhelming force [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=468.8s)]
*  while targeting civilian and government infrastructure for deterrence purposes [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=471.28s)]
*  and force civilian populations to pressure groups to end their attacks. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=475.28s)]
*  I don't normally quote at such length and extensively from a publication like this, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=478.79999999999995s)]
*  but it is so important that we go into detail about these corroborated allegations. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=482.96s)]
*  And well, I think they're clearly more than allegations. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=488.64s)]
*  The Guardian has now itself corroborated these claims and they've added in their own details. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=491.2s)]
*  They point out that the IDF previously hadn't targeted the homes [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=497.11999999999995s)]
*  of junior Hamas members for bombings with houses targeted now regardless of rank, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=500.88s)]
*  meaning Hamas members who don't really mean anything, inconsequential rank and file members [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=505.6s)]
*  have their homes bombed potentially with everybody there, including kids killed. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=510.08s)]
*  Now claims there was accurate targeting are disputed by [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=514.96s)]
*  photographic evidence showing the wide-thread flattening of an urban area [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=518.08s)]
*  with heavy explosive weapons. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=521.4399999999999s)]
*  What's underlined here is that Israel is committing grave war crimes, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=523.28s)]
*  there should never have been any doubt about that. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=526.56s)]
*  If you're recklessly dropping bombs, knowing the inevitable consequence is a necessary, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=528.96s)]
*  avoidable mass civilian death, you are committing grave war crimes. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=533.52s)]
*  These findings, in fact, are consistent with what one Israeli army spokesperson said at the [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=538.0s)]
*  very beginning of this horror show that Israel was targeting based on damage and not on accuracy. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=543.0400000000001s)]
*  Now, the US themselves are deeply complicit with these crimes committed by Israel. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=550.1600000000001s)]
*  They're not only providing Israel the arms necessary to engage in this mass slaughter, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=554.8s)]
*  according to the Wall Street Journal, they provided Israel with large buster bunker bombs. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=559.1999999999999s)]
*  These bunker bombs are killing huge numbers of civilians. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=563.8399999999999s)]
*  It goes further than that. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=566.8s)]
*  The Israeli authorities have declared that with the ceasefire over, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=568.0s)]
*  they've stopped humanitarian aid going into Gaza in the amounts agreed [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=571.12s)]
*  under the previous ceasefire agreement, which has now, of course, ended catastrophically. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=574.8s)]
*  As professor of international law, Tom Dannenbaum puts it, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=579.68s)]
*  this appears to be an admission that aid delivery has stopped not as a collateral [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=583.12s)]
*  effect of a new fighting, but because Israeli officials have decided to prevent it. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=587.04s)]
*  This again implicates the war crime of starvation of civilians as a method of warfare. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=591.52s)]
*  Indeed, as UNICEF notes, the humanitarian situation in Gaza is so perilous that anything [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=598.48s)]
*  other than sustained peace and at scale emergency aid will mean catastrophe for the children of Gaza. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=603.12s)]
*  According to the United Nations, Gaza is once again the most dangerous place on earth to be a child. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=609.28s)]
*  Here's another chilling and absolutely fundamental point. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=614.56s)]
*  According to the Israeli press, Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered his minister of strategic planning [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=616.8s)]
*  and a very close aide of his to explore ways to, and this is a direct quote, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=621.4399999999999s)]
*  thin out the Gazan population. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=626.4s)]
*  That doesn't just mean pushing them through the Rafah crossing into Egypt. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=628.56s)]
*  The English translation of the report adds the sea is also open to Gazans. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=632.9599999999999s)]
*  At its will, Israel opens the sea crossing and enables a mass escape to European and African countries. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=637.84s)]
*  Indeed, it is also reported in the Israeli press that a plan is circulating in Congress [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=644.72s)]
*  to support the so-called resettlement of Gazans using aid as leverage. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=649.6s)]
*  That means a total of two million Gazans, the vast majority of the population, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=654.24s)]
*  being kicked out to Egypt, Turkey, Iraq and Yemen. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=658.8s)]
*  Let's be clear about what that is. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=662.96s)]
*  Ethnic cleansing on a colossal scale. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=664.72s)]
*  Enforced by murderous policies intended to make the conditions of life impossible. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=667.04s)]
*  Now, the current atmosphere in Israeli society makes all of this possible. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=672.0799999999999s)]
*  Avigdor Lieberman, the former minister of finance, defence and foreign affairs, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=675.1999999999999s)]
*  publicly declares there are no innocents in Gaza. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=680.0s)]
*  Genocidal language. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=684.0799999999999s)]
*  The finance minister has declared there are two million Nazis in the West Bank. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=685.36s)]
*  Again, genocidal language because branding a civilian population Nazis [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=690.48s)]
*  justifies the most extreme actions against them. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=695.04s)]
*  The current number one in the music charts in Israel is called Chabadabu [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=698.4s)]
*  and it describes Palestinians as the rats and sons of Amalek. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=702.0799999999999s)]
*  The exact lyrics. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=706.24s)]
*  We've brought the entire army against you and we swear there won't be any forgiveness, sons of Amalek. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=707.1999999999999s)]
*  Bit of context. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=712.0s)]
*  The other week Benjamin Netanyahu, in a message to the Israeli civilian and military population, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=712.88s)]
*  quoted from the Bible the story of how the nation of Amalek attacked the Israelites [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=719.76s)]
*  and God commanded them in response to kill all men, women, children and livestock. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=725.1999999999999s)]
*  Genocidal language. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=731.92s)]
*  The song also calls for the military to kill the terrorists as it puts it. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=733.1999999999999s)]
*  Bella Hadid, Dua Lipa and Mia Khalifa. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=736.3199999999999s)]
*  If you're wondering why, for example, the pop star Dua Lipa is being targeted, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=739.52s)]
*  it's because she made the criminal offence of calling for a ceasefire. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=743.68s)]
*  Now this is why, as well as genocide and Holocaust scholars who've described the onslaught [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=748.8s)]
*  against Gaza as genocide, and that includes the Israeli-American scholar, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=754.0799999999999s)]
*  Raz Tigal, who I've personally interviewed. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=757.4399999999999s)]
*  Check out the video that I did with him. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=759.4399999999999s)]
*  We should listen to what President Lula of Brazil has said as well. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=761.28s)]
*  What is going on at the Gaza Strip is not a traditional war of those that we see on films [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=764.88s)]
*  that we learned and read about. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=773.68s)]
*  What we see is genocide going on. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=775.8399999999999s)]
*  Killing thousands and thousands of children that has nothing to do with that. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=778.4799999999999s)]
*  Women that have nothing to do with that. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=782.3199999999999s)]
*  And destroying the things that took years to be built. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=784.56s)]
*  Now just a final point. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=788.56s)]
*  I don't want to harp on about this too much. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=790.16s)]
*  I'm aware that I'm under severe attack at the moment. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=792.56s)]
*  And I know my critics want to make this all about me rather than Gaza. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=795.52s)]
*  And they're trying to deflect from their support for Israel's mass slaughter of Gaza. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=799.12s)]
*  They have a clear strategy. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=803.4399999999999s)]
*  Those who oppose the mass slaughter are the real, hateful, dangerous extremists [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=804.48s)]
*  rather than those who support this horrendous mass slaughter. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=807.84s)]
*  So I'll respond in due course within that framework. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=810.72s)]
*  And I'll keep using my platform as best as I can to encourage awareness [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=813.44s)]
*  of what's happening to Gaza with the active support of our governments [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=816.88s)]
*  and most of the media. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=820.88s)]
*  To be clear though, I'm not going to be intimidated, harassed or bullied into silence. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=822.0s)]
*  And I'm going to keep using my platform to challenge this crime [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=825.84s)]
*  of historic proportions to the very end. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvJxI9nCr1k&t=828.72s)]
